ordinance or ordinances in respect to such provisions only. (2005 Code)
1-2-3: COURT PROCEEDINGS:
   A.   No new ordinance shall be construed or held to repeal a former
ordinance whether such former ordinance is expressly repealed or not, as to any
offense committed against such former ordinance or as to any act done, any
penalty, forfeiture or punishment so incurred, or any right accrued or claim
arising under the former ordinance, or in any way whatever to affect any such
offense or act so committed or so done, or any penalty, forfeiture or
punishment so incurred or any right accrued or claim arising before the new
ordinance takes effect, save only that the proceedings thereafter shall conform
to the ordinance in force at the time of such proceeding, so far as
practicable. If any penalty, forfeiture or punishment may be mitigated by any
provision of a new ordinance, such provision may be, by consent of the party
affected, applied to any judgment announced after the new ordinance takes

implication, whether the repeal is in the ordinance making any new provisions
upon the same subject or in any other ordinance.
   C.   Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed as abating any
action now pending under or by virtue of any general ordinance of the city
herein repealed, and the provisions of all general ordinances contained in this
code shall be deemed to be continuing provisions and not a new enactment of the
same provisions; nor shall this chapter be deemed as discontinuing, abating,
modifying or altering any penalty accrued or to accrue, or as affecting the
liability of any person, firm or corporation, or as waiving any right of the
city under any ordinance or provision thereof in force at the time of the
adoption of this code. (2005 Code)
1-2-4: CONFLICT WITH CHARTER:
In case any provision of this code conflicts with any provision of the city
charter, the charter provision shall control. (1982 Code § 1.416)
1-2-5: SEVERABILITY CLAUSE:
Unless otherwise provided with respect to particular provisions, all provisions
of this code shall be severable. If any provision of this code is held invalid
or suspended, the remaining provisions shall remain valid and in operation
unless the court finds that the valid provisions are so essentially connected
with and so dependent upon the void provision that the court cannot presume the
council would have enacted the remaining valid provisions without the void one,
or unless the court finds the remaining valid provisions, standing alone, are
incomplete and are incapable of being executed in accordance with the intent of
the city council. (1982 Code § 1.418)
1-2-6: NOTICE OF ASSERTED INVALIDITY:
When the validity of any part of this code is drawn into question in any action
to which the city is not a party, the party asserting the invalidity shall
notify the city attorney of such contention as soon as practicable. (1982 Code
§ 1.419)
1-2-7: NO RIGHT OF ACTION AGAINST CITY CREATED:
This code includes various provisions for licensure, approval, investigation,
inspection and regulation of businesses and activities. These provisions have
been enacted to assist the city in promoting public health, safety and welfare.
It is not the intention of the city council that any person shall rely upon the
city or its agents in any licensure, approval, investigation, inspection or
other regulation. Unless expressly provided otherwise, no provision of this
code relieves any person of the responsibility for that person's own protection
or the protection of others. Nor shall any provision create any right of action
against the city or its agents that would not exist without the provision.
Neither the city nor its agents shall have any liability by reason of the
enforcement of, or failure to enforce, any provision of this code. (1982 Code §
1.420)
1-2-8: NOTICE REQUIREMENTS:
Whenever any provision of this code requires notice to be given to any person,
the notice shall be in writing. Unless personal, published, posted or some
other method of notice in required, notice may be given by regular or certified
mail at the person's last known address, by delivery to the person personally,
by leaving the notice for the person at the person's usual place of abode with
a person of suitable age and discretion then residing there, or by any method
of service sufficient for service of process in a civil suit. Published or
posted notice may be given where permitted by law, charter, or this code, and
shall be given when required. Failure to give notice or defects in the notice
shall not invalidate the proceeding for which notice was required if a good
faith effort was made to give the notice required, if due to special
circumstances the notice could not be given, if the person not receiving notice
or receiving defective notice was not prejudiced thereby or if the person
received actual notice in some other manner. (1982 Code § 1.421)

hearing, or with such hearing as conditions warrant, if immediate suspension or
revocation is necessary for protection of the public health, safety or welfare.

The city council has determined that the health of the elm trees within the
municipal limits is threatened by a fatal disease known as Dutch elm disease.
It has further determined that the loss of elm trees growing upon public and
private property would substantially depreciate the value of property within
the city and impair the safety, good order, general welfare and convenience of
the public. It is declared to be the intention of the city council to control
and prevent the spread of this disease and this chapter is enacted for that
purpose. (1982 Code § 8.6102)
4-5-2: PROGRAM:
It is the intention of the city council to conduct a program of plant pest
control pursuant to the authority granted by Minnesota Statutes Annotated
sections 18.023 and 18.024. This program is directed specifically at the
control and elimination of Dutch elm disease fungus and elm bark beetles and is
undertaken at the recommendation of the commissioner of agriculture. The tree

   B.   Entry On Private Premises: The tree inspector or his duly authorized
agent may enter upon private premises at any reasonable time for the purpose of
carrying out any of the duties assigned him under this chapter.
   C.   Diagnosis: The tree inspector shall, upon finding conditions indicating

available to the city.
   B.   Company Initiated Relocation: The company must give the city written
notice prior to a company initiated relocation of facilities. A company
initiated relocation must be at the company's expense and must be approved by
the city, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld.
   C.   City Initiated Relocation: The company must promptly and at its own
expense, with due regard for seasonal working conditions, permanently relocate
its facilities whenever the city requires such relocation.
   D.   Vacation Of Public Ground: The vacation of public ground does not
deprive the company of the right to operate and maintain its facilities in the
city. If the vacation proceedings are initiated by the company, the company
must pay the relocation costs. If the vacation proceedings are initiated by the
city or other persons, the company must pay the relocation costs unless
otherwise agreed to by the city, company and other persons. (Ord. 223, 9-5-

claims and actions on account of injury or death of persons or damage to
property occasioned by the construction, installation, maintenance, repair,
removal, relocation or operation of the facilities affecting public ground,
unless such injury or damage is the result of the negligence of the city, its
elected officials, employees, officers, or agents. The city will notify the
company of claims or actions and provide a reasonable opportunity for the
company to accept and undertake the defense.
   B.   Claim Defense:
      1.   Notice Of Claim: If a claim or action is brought against the city
under circumstances where indemnification applies, the company, at its sole
expense, shall defend the city if written notice of the claim or action is
given to the company within a period wherein the company is not prejudiced in
the defense of such claim or action by lack of such notice.
      2.   Control Of Litigation: If the company undertakes the defense, the
company shall have complete control of such claim or action, but it may not
settle without the consent of the city, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld.
      3.   Third Party Claim: This subsection is not, as to third parties, a
waiver of any defense or immunity otherwise available to the city. In defending
any action on behalf of the city, the company is entitled to assert every
defense or immunity that the city could assert in its own behalf. (Ord. 223, 9-
5-1995)
7-5-8: COMPANY DEFAULT:
   A.   Notice: If the company is in default in the performance of the work

from the city of the default, the city may terminate the rights of the company
under the permit. The notice of default must be in writing and specify the
provisions of the permit under which the default is claimed and state the
grounds of the claim. The notice must be served on the company by personally
delivering it to an officer thereof at its principal place of business in
Minnesota or by certified mail to that address.
   B.   City Action On Default: If the company is in default in the performance
of the work authorized by the permit, the city may, after the above notice to
the company and failure of the company to cure the default, take such action as
may be reasonably necessary to abate the condition caused by the default. The
company must reimburse the city for the city's reasonable costs, including
costs of collection and attorney fees incurred as a result of the company
default. The security posted under section
7-5-3 of this chapter will be applied by the city first toward payment for such
reimbursement. (Ord. 223, 9-5-1995)
7-5-9: EXISTING FACILITIES:
Companies with facilities, in, on, over, under or along public ground on the
effective date hereof must take prompt action to comply with this chapter and
the permits authorized for this chapter. A company, however, is not required to
reapply for a permit obtained from the city prior to the effective date hereof.
A company is not required to pay the difference between the permit fee of a
previously obtained permit and the equivalent newly obtained permit under this
chapter. All other provisions of this chapter apply to existing facilities.

writing that the meter be tested. If the test shows a meter to be inaccurate,
it shall be repaired or replaced. (1982 Code § 3.225)
   F.   Adjustment Of Bill: If a test shows a meter to be inaccurate by more
than five percent (5%), the bill for the immediate past service period and for
the elapsed portion of the current service period shall be adjusted
accordingly. If by reason of stoppage of the meter or any other reason it is

of water entering the sewer system, or, if appropriate, the amount of water
which does not and cannot enter the sanitary sewer system.

   E.   Avoid Damage To Electric Facilities: The company must take reasonable

law.
   C.   Projects With Federal Funding: Relocation, removal, or rearrangement of
any electric facilities made necessary because of the extension into or through

claims occasioned through its own negligence except for losses or claims

by lack of such notice. If company is required to indemnify and defend, it will
thereafter have control of such litigation, but company may not settle such
litigation without the consent of the city, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. This section is not, as to third parties, a waiver of
any defense or immunity otherwise available to the city; and company, in
defending any action on behalf of the city shall be entitled to assert in any
action every defense or immunity that the city could assert in its own behalf.
This franchise agreement shall not be interpreted to constitute a waiver by the
city of any of its defenses of immunity or limitations on liability under
Minnesota statutes chapter 466. (Ord. 301, 12-18-2012)

9-1-10: FRANCHISE FEE:
   A.   Form: During the term of the franchise hereby granted, and in addition
to permit fees being imposed or that the city has a right to impose, the city
may charge the company a franchise fee. The fee may be: 1) a percentage of
gross revenues received by the company for its operations within the city, or
2) a flat fee per customer based on a metered service to retail customers
within the city or on some other similar basis, or 3) a fee based on units of
energy delivered to any class of retail customers within the corporate limits
of the city. The method of imposing the franchise fee, the percentage of
revenue rate, or the flat rate based on metered service may differ for each
customer class or combined the methods described in items 1) through 3) of this
subsection in assessing the fee. The city shall seek to use a formula that
provides a stable and predictable amount of fees, without placing the company
at a competitive disadvantage. If the company claims that the city required fee
formula is discriminatory or otherwise places the company at a competitive
disadvantage, the company shall provide a formula that will produce a
substantially similar fee amount to the city and reimburse the city's
reasonable fees and costs in reviewing and implementing the formula. The city
will attempt to accommodate the company but is under no franchise obligation to
adopt the company proposed franchise fee formula and each review will not delay
the implementation of the city imposed fee.
   B.   Separate Ordinance: The franchise fee shall be imposed by separate
ordinance duly adopted by the city council, which ordinance shall not be
adopted until at least one hundred twenty (120) days after written notice
enclosing such proposed ordinance has been served upon the company. The fee
shall become effective with the first billing cycle of the next month following
the month the city adopts such ordinance.
   C.   Condition Of Fee: The separate ordinance imposing the fee shall not be
effective against the company unless it lawfully imposes a fee of the same or
substantially similar amount on the sale of electric energy within the city by
any other electric energy supplier, provided that, as to such supplier, the
city has the authority or contractual right to require a franchise fee or
similar fee through a previously agreed upon franchise.
   D.   Collection Of Fee: The franchise fee shall be payable not less than
quarterly during complete billing months of the period for which payment is to
be made. The franchise fee formula may be changed from time to time, however
the change shall meet the same notice requirements and the fee may not be
changed more often than annually. Such fee shall not exceed any amount that the
company may legally charge to its customers prior to payment to the city. Such
fee is subject to substantial reductions to account for uncollectibles and
customer refunds incurred by the company. The company agrees to make available
for inspection by the city at reasonable times all records necessary to audit
the company's determination of the franchise fee payments.
   E.   Continuation Of Franchise Fee: If this franchise expires and the city
and the company are unable to agree upon terms of a new franchise, the
franchise fee, if any being imposed by the city at the time this franchise
expires, will remain in effect until a new franchise is agreed upon. (Ord. 301,
12-18-2012)
9-1-11: PROVISIONS OF CHAPTER:
   A.   Severability: Every section, provision, or part of this chapter is
declared separate from every other section, provision, or part; and if any
section, provision, or part shall be held invalid, it shall not affect any
other section, provision, or part; provided, however, that if the city is
unable to enforce its franchise fee provisions for any reason the city will be
allowed to amend the franchise agreement to impose a franchise fee pursuant to
statute. Where a provision of any other city ordinance conflicts with the
provisions of this chapter, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail.
   B.   Limitation On Applicability: This chapter constitutes a franchise
agreement between the city and company as the only parties and no provision of
this franchise shall in any way inure to the benefit of any third person
(including the public at large) so as to constitute any such person as a third
party beneficiary of the agreement or of any one or more of the terms hereof,
or otherwise give rise to any cause of action in any person not a party hereto.
(Ord. 301, 12-18-2012)
9-1-12: AMENDMENT PROCEDURE:
Either party to this franchise agreement may at any time propose that the
agreement be amended. This chapter may be amended at any time by the city
passing a subsequent ordinance declaring the provisions of the amendment, which
amendatory ordinance shall become effective upon the filing of company's
written consent thereto with the city clerk after city council adoption of the
amendatory ordinance. (Ord. 301, 12-18-2012)

9-2-3: CONDITIONS OF USE:
   A.   Location Of Facilities: Gas facilities must be located, constructed,
installed and maintained so as not to interfere with the city utility system or
the safety and convenience of ordinary travel along, over and under public
ways. The company's construction, reconstruction, operation, repair,
maintenance, location, and relocation of gas facilities is subject to other
reasonable ordinances and regulations of the city consistent with authority
granted to the city to manage its public ways and public grounds under state
law and to the extent not inconsistent with a specific term of this franchise.
   B.   Field Location: Field locations for their respective facilities will be
provided by the company and city in accordance with Minnesota statutes 216D,
under the Gopher State One Call system.
   C.   Right Of Way Permit Required: Except for the verification of field
location, the company may not open or disturb the surface of any public way or
public ground without first having obtained a right of way permit from the city
if required by a separate ordinance, for which the city may impose a reasonable
fee. The permit conditions imposed on the company may not be more burdensome
than those imposed on other entities for similar facilities or work. The
company may, however, open and disturb the surface of any public way or public
ground without a right of way permit if: 1) an emergency exists requiring the
immediate repair of gas facilities and 2) the company gives notice to the city
before, if possible, commencement of the emergency repair. Within two (2)
business days after commencing the repair, the company must apply for any
required permits and pay the required fees.
   D.   Restoration: After undertaking any work requiring the opening of any
public way, the company shall restore the public way in accordance with
Minnesota administrative rules, part 7819.1100 and applicable city ordinances
consistent with law. Company shall restore a public ground to as good a
condition as formerly existed. All work shall be completed as promptly as
weather permits, and if company shall not promptly perform and complete the
work, remove all dirt, rubbish, equipment and material, and put the public way
or public ground in the said condition, the city shall have, after demand to
company to cure and the passage of a reasonable period of time following the
demand, but not to exceed five (5) days, the right to make the restoration of
the public way or public ground at the expense of company.
This remedy is in addition to any other remedies available to the city for
noncompliance with this section, including, but not limited to, adherence to
the requirements of the right of way permit.
   E.   Avoid Damage To Gas Facilities: The company must take reasonable
measures to prevent the gas facilities from causing damage to persons or
property. The company must take reasonable measures to protect the gas
facilities from damage that could be inflicted on the gas facilities by
persons, property or the elements. The company must take protective measures
when the city performs work near the gas facilities, if given reasonable notice
by the city of such work prior to its commencement.
   F.   Notice Of Improvements: The city must give the company reasonable
written notice of plans for improvements to public ways or public grounds where
the city has reason to believe that gas facilities may affect or be affected by
the improvement. The notice will contain: 1) the nature and character of the
improvements, 2) the public ways or public grounds upon which the improvements
are to be made, 3) the extent of the improvements, 4) the time when the city
will start the work, and 5) if more than one public way or public ground is
involved, the order in which the work is to proceed. The notice will be given
to company a sufficient length of time, considering seasonal working
conditions, in advance of the actual commencement of the work to permit company
to make any additions, alterations or repairs to its gas facilities the company
deems necessary. The company shall have the right to request additional time in
advance of the actual commencement of the work if required to make any
necessary additions, alterations or repairs to its gas facilities.
   G.   Mapping Information: The city may require the company to provide
complete and accurate mapping information for any of its gas facilities in
accordance with the requirements of Minnesota rules 7819.4100. At the request
of company, any information requested by the engineer which qualifies as a
"trade secret" under Minnesota statutes section 13.37(b) shall be treated as
trade secret information as detailed therein. (Ord. 298, 3-6-2012)
9-2-4: RELOCATIONS:
   A.   Relocation Of Gas Facilities In Public Ways: The company shall comply
with Minnesota rules, part 7819.3100 and applicable city ordinances consistent
with law. The city must give reasonable written notice to the company that a
possible relocation of gas facilities is required. The engineer and company
representatives will meet in an attempt to resolve facilities conflict. To the
extent that an alternative to relocation of gas facilities which is reasonably
acceptable to city cannot be developed, the company must relocate its gas
facilities at its own expense. The city must give the company reasonable
written notice of plans to vacate for a city improvement project, or to grade,
regrade or change the alignment of any public way, or to construct or
reconstruct any city utility system.
   B.   Relocation Of Gas Facilities In Public Ground: The city may require the
company to relocate gas facilities from public ground upon a finding by the
city that the gas facilities have become or will become a substantial
impairment of the public use to which the public ground is or will be put. The
relocation or removal will be at the company's expense and shall comply with
applicable city ordinances consistent with law. The provision of this
subsection applies only to gas facilities constructed in reliance on this
franchise and the company does not waive its rights under an easement or
prescriptive right in the public ground.
   C.   Vacation Of Public Ways: The city must give the company at least two
(2) weeks' notice of a proposed vacation of a public way. The city and the
company shall comply with Minnesota rules 7819.3200 and applicable ordinances
consistent with law. Except where required for a city street or other
improvement project or as otherwise provided in subsection B of this section,
the vacation of a public way, after the installation of gas facilities, does
not deprive the company of its rights to operate and maintain the gas
facilities until the reasonable cost of relocating the same and the loss and
expense resulting from such relocation are first paid to the company by the
city or the party requesting the vacation. The city is not liable to the
company for failure to specifically preserve a right of way in the manner
permitted by law.
   D.   Projects With Federal Funding: Relocation, removal or rearrangement of
any gas facilities made necessary because of the extension into or through the
city of a federally aided highway project will be governed by the provisions of
Minnesota statutes section 161.46. (Ord. 298, 3-6-2012)
9-2-5: DEFENSE AND INDEMNIFICATION:
   A.   Indemnification Of City: Company shall indemnify and hold harmless the
city from any and all liability on account of injury to persons or damage to
property occasioned by the construction, maintenance, repair, inspection of,
the issuance of permits, or the operation of the gas facilities located in the
public ways and public grounds. The city shall not be indemnified or held
harmless for liability, losses, claims, proceedings or causes of action caused
through its own negligence except for liability, losses, claims, proceedings or
actions arising out of or alleging the city's negligence as to the issuance of
permits for, or inspection of, the gas facilities or company's plans.
   B.   Defense Of City: In the event a suit, action, claim or proceeding is
brought against the city under circumstances where this agreement to indemnify
applies, the company shall, at its sole cost and expense, defend the city in
such suit, action, claim or proceeding if written notice thereof is promptly
given to the company within a period of time wherein the company is not
prejudiced by lack of such notice. If the company is required to indemnify and
defend the city, the company shall have control of the defense. Company may not
settle such suit, action, claim or proceeding without the consent of the city,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. This section is not, and
shall not be interpreted or shall not constitute as to third parties, a waiver
of any defense or immunity available to the city. The company, in defending any
suit, action, claim or proceeding on behalf of the city, shall be entitled to
assert in such suit, action, claim or proceeding every defense or immunity the
city could assert on its own behalf. This franchise agreement shall not be
interpreted to constitute a waiver by the city of any of its defenses of
immunity or limitations on liability pursuant to Minnesota law or statute.

of this chapter. Any governmental unit succeeding the city shall, without the

provided in this chapter. (Ord. 298, 3-6-2012)
9-2-8: FRANCHISE FEE:
   A.   Separate Ordinance: The city hereby reserves the right to implement, by
passage of a separate ordinance, a franchise fee to be collected and remitted
by the company to the city. Said franchise fee will be in accordance with state
law and regulations. In the event such a franchise fee is implemented, the
company agrees to make available for inspection by the city at reasonable times
all records necessary to audit the company's determination of the franchise fee
payments. The separate ordinance shall not be adopted until at least thirty
(30) days after written notice enclosing such proposed ordinance has been
served upon the company. The fee shall become effective ten (10) days after
written notice enclosing such adopted ordinance has been served upon the
company by certified mail.
   B.   Condition Of Fee: The separate ordinance imposing the fee shall not be
effective against the company unless it lawfully imposes a fee of the same or
substantially similar amount on the sale of gas energy within the city by any
other gas energy supplier, provided that, as to such supplier, the city has the
authority or contractual right to require a franchise fee or similar fee
through a previously agreed upon franchise.
   C.   Collection Of Fee: The franchise fee shall be payable not less than
quarterly during complete billing months of the period for which payment is to
be made. The franchise fee formula may be changed from time to time, however,
the change shall meet the same notice requirements and the fee may not be
changed more often than annually. Such fee shall not exceed any amount that the
company may legally charge to its customers prior to payment to the city. Such
fee is subject to subsequent reductions to account for uncollectibles and
customer refunds incurred by the company. The company agrees to make available
for inspection by the city at reasonable times all records necessary to audit
the company's determination of the franchise fee payments.
   D.   Continuation Of Franchise Fee: The franchise fee, if any, being imposed
by the city at the time the most recent of any previous franchise granted to
the company by the city expired remains in effect until it is changed in the
manner provided for implementation of such fee. If this franchise expires and
city and the company are unable to agree upon terms of a new franchise, the
franchise fee, if any, being imposed by the city at the time this franchise
expires, will remain in effect until a new franchise is agreed upon. (Ord. 298,
3-6-2012)
9-2-9: ADDITIONS TO CITY AND AREA DEVELOPMENT ZONES:
   A.   Additions Of Territory: In case any additions of territory are made to
the city, company shall serve all inhabitants of such additional territory in
the same manner and on the same terms as those of the territory now within its
limits. In the event that such additional service requires extension of the gas
facilities, such extensions shall be subject to the provisions of the
applicable rate schedules and general terms attached to the rate schedules as
filed by the company with the Minnesota public utilities commission, all of
which are by reference made part of this franchise. Should said extension of
gas facilities be deemed by the company as not economically feasible, company
shall allow a third party to make a contribution in aid of construction in the
amount of the difference in cost between the total project cost and the amount
that is determined to be financially feasible by the company. This contribution
in aid of construction shall not constitute an ownership position of the gas
facilities by the contributing third party. Failure on the part of the company
to allow a third party to make such a contribution may be considered a default
in the performance hereof, subject to subsection 9-2-2F of this chapter. (Ord.
298, 3-6-2012)

every other section, provision, or part; and if any section, provision, or part
shall be held invalid, it shall not affect any other section, provision, or
part. Where a provision of any other city ordinance conflicts with the
provisions of this chapter, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail. (Ord.
298, 3-6-2012)
9-2-14: LIMITATION ON APPLICABILITY:
This chapter constitutes a franchise agreement between the city and company as
the only parties and no provision of this franchise shall in any way inure to

constitute any such person as a third party beneficiary of the agreement or of

action in any person not a party hereto. (Ord. 298, 3-6-2012)

of general applicability, regardless of which requirement was first adopted

users.

   A.   Establishment Of Tax Districts: Pursuant to Minnesota statute 272.67,
the city of Dawson hereby divides the area within its corporate limits into an
urban service district and a rural service district. Said districts shall be
constituted as separate taxing districts for the purpose of all municipal
property taxes, except those levied for the payment of bonds, and judgments and
interest thereon.
   B.   Criteria/Definitions:
      1.   The urban service district shall include all properties located
within the corporate limits of the city of Dawson, except those properties
which are included in a rural service district.
      2.   The rural service district shall include only unplatted lands, which
need not be contiguous to one another, and which, in the judgment of the city
council at the time of the adoption of the ordinance, are rural in character,
and are not developed for commercial, industrial, or urban residential
purposes, and, for these reasons, are not benefited to the same degree as other
lands located within the limits of the city of Dawson and financed by general
taxation.
The lands described on exhibit A attached to the ordinance codified herein are
hereby included in the rural service district.
   C.   Zoning District Designation: The Dawson city zoning ordinance is hereby
amended by changing the district map and adding to the zoning ordinance a new
zoning district known as RS, rural service district.
In rural service districts, the following regulations shall apply, unless
otherwise provided herein:
      1.   The property must be rural in character.
      2.   The property must not be developed, or used, for commercial,
industrial, or residential purposes. (Ord. 266, 4-3-2007)
      3.   (Rep. by Ord. 297, 1-17-2012)
      4.   The property must be unused and seeded, or used for agricultural
purposes only.
For purposes of this district, "agricultural purposes" shall include only the
following uses:
Agricultural uses, including farm crops, and farm and agricultural related
buildings and structures (but not residential dwellings), subject to Minnesota
pollution control standards, but not including feedlots, manure spreading,
livestock, or other commercial or industrial operations.
      5.   Farm and agriculture related buildings and structures existing (but
no residential dwellings) at the time a property is first included in the rural
service district may continue to be utilized for agricultural purposes.
Existing buildings and structures may be repaired or replaced, if destroyed by
wind or fire, but may not be expanded. No permit shall be granted to construct
any new or additional buildings or structures.
      6.   The following uses may be permitted by conditional use permit:
Landscape nurseries or forestlands.
Privately owned recreational uses, such as golf courses, golf driving ranges,
and similar outdoor recreational activities which require relatively large
amounts of land.
   D.   Change In Use Of Property In RS District: Whenever application is made
for a permit for construction of a commercial, industrial, or residential
building, or improvement, or whenever such improvement or building is commenced
without a permit, the Dawson city council shall make and enter an order for
resolution transferring such parcel, or part thereof, from the rural service
district to the urban service district.
Any application for platting of the property shall also permit the governing
body of the city of Dawson to make and enter an order by resolution
transferring such parcel from the rural service district to the urban service
district.
   E.   Tax Ratio: In the judgment of the Dawson city council, the ratio which
exists between the benefits resulting from tax supported municipal service to
parcels in the rural service district to parcels in the urban service district
is equal to property taxes levied within Riverside township, plus any municipal
property taxes levied for payment of bonds, and judgments, and interest
thereon.
The property tax rate levied upon property in a rural service district shall be
equal to the levy rate imposed for properties in Riverside township, except
those levied for the payment of bonds, judgments and interest thereon.
   F.   Annexed Land: Any property which is annexed to the city of Dawson after
the adoption hereof, and which is included in the rural service district as
part of the annexation order, shall be reviewed by the city council if the
property is not developed for a period of five (5) years after annexation to
determine whether inclusion in the rural service district is still appropriate.
The Dawson city council may review the use of the property at any sooner time.
By amendment of this section, such parcel shall be included in the urban
service district if any area adjacent thereto is determined by the city council
to be substantially developed as urban property.
   G.   Required City Services:
      1.   The city of Dawson shall not provide any city water, storm sewer,
sanitary sewer, or other utility service to any property located in the rural
service district.

      2.   Unaccessible To Municipal System: Where the municipal sewer system
is not reasonably accessible to the subdivision and, in the judgment of the
planning commission, extension of the municipal sewage system to the
subdivision will not take place in the foreseeable future, private sewage
disposal systems on individual lots consistent with all city, county and state
regulations applicable thereto will be allowed.
   H.   Utilities: Every lot in a subdivision shall be capable of being served
by utilities, and easements acceptable to the utility companies shall be

When the plans of streets and other improvements have been approved as provided
in this chapter, the subdivider shall first notify the city clerk of his
intention to proceed with the construction or installation of said streets and
improvements; notification shall be made at least fifteen (15) days before any
such construction or installation shall commence so as to give the city
officials an opportunity to inspect the site prior to commencement of work and

13-1-1: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION; FINDINGS; PURPOSE:
   A.   Statutory Authorization: The legislature of the state of Minnesota has,
in Minnesota statutes chapters 103F and 462 for municipalities, delegated the
responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations designed to
minimize flood losses. Therefore, the city council of the city of Dawson,
Minnesota, does ordain as follows:
   B.   Findings Of Fact:
      1.   Flood Hazard Areas: The flood hazard areas of Dawson, Minnesota, are
subject to periodic inundation which results in potential loss of life, loss of
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety, and general welfare.
      2.   Methods Used To Analyze Flood Hazards: This chapter is based upon a
reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which is consistent with the
standards established by the Minnesota department of natural resources.
      3.   National Flood Insurance Program Compliance: This chapter is adopted
to comply with the rules and regulations of the national flood insurance
program codified as 44 code of federal regulations parts 59 - 78, as amended,
so as to maintain the community's eligibility in the national flood insurance
program.
   C.   Statement Of Purpose: It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize those losses
described in subsection B1 of this section by provisions contained herein.
(Ord. 260, 2-21-2006)
13-1-2: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   A.   Applicable Lands: This chapter shall apply to all lands within the
jurisdiction of Dawson shown on the official zoning map and/or the attachments
thereto as being located within the boundaries of the floodway, flood fringe,
or general floodplain districts.
   B.   Establishment Of Official Zoning Map: The official zoning map together
with all materials attached thereto is hereby adopted by reference and declared
to be a part of this chapter. The attached material shall include the flood
insurance study for Lac Qui Parle County, Minnesota, and incorporated areas
prepared by the federal emergency management agency and dated March 16, 2006,
and the flood insurance rate map panels numbered 27073C0383C, 27073C0387C and
27073C0391C dated March 16, 2006, therein. The official zoning map shall be on
file in the office of the city clerk and the city manager.
Note: For future annexation of floodplain lands, it is a requirement of the
national flood insurance program that a community legally apply the provisions
of its floodplain ordinance to the annexed land on the date of annexation (see
subsection H of this section). The flood insurance rate map panels adopted into
this subsection must be inclusive enough so that they encompass all of the
unincorporated area of the county that may be annexed into the city into the
foreseeable future. This may mean that a city will need to adopt flood
insurance rate map panels in addition to those flood map panels that contain
the current corporate boundaries of the city.
   C.   Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation: The regulatory flood protection
elevation shall be an elevation no lower than one foot (1') above the elevation
of the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation caused by
encroachments on the floodplain that result from designation of a floodway.
   D.   Interpretation:
      1.   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this
chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation
or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes.
      2.   The boundaries of the zoning districts shall be determined by
scaling distances on the official zoning map. Where interpretation is needed as
to the exact location of the boundaries of the district as shown on the
official zoning map, as for example where there appears to be a conflict
between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions and there is a formal
appeal of the decision of the zoning administrator, the board of adjustment
shall make the necessary interpretation. All decisions will be based on
elevations on the regional (100-year) flood profile, the ground elevations that
existed on the site at the time the community adopted its initial floodplain
ordinance or on the date of the first national flood insurance program map
showing the area within the 100-year floodplain if earlier, and other available
technical data. Persons contesting the location of the district boundaries
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present their case to the board of
adjustment and to submit technical evidence.
   E.   Abrogation And Greater Restrictions: It is not intended by this chapter
to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the
provisions of this chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent
with this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
   F.   Warning And Disclaimer Of Liability: This chapter does not imply that
areas outside the floodplain districts or land uses permitted within such
districts will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not
create liability on the part of the city of Dawson or any officer or employee
thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   G.   Severability: If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this
chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby.
   H.   Annexations: The flood insurance rate map panels adopted by reference
into subsection B of this section may include floodplain areas that lie outside
of the corporate boundaries of the city of Dawson at the time of adoption of
this chapter. If any of these floodplain land areas are annexed into the city
of Dawson after the date of adoption hereof, the newly annexed floodplain lands
shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter immediately upon the date of
annexation into the city of Dawson. (Ord. 260, 2-21-2006)
13-1-3: DEFINITIONS:
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall
be interpreted so as to give them the same meaning as they have in common usage

those portions of the adjoining floodplain which are reasonably required to
carry or store the regional flood discharge.
LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking
of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a basement area,
is not considered a building's lowest floor.
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is
built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include the term "recreational vehicle".
OBSTRUCTION: Any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment,
projection, excavation, channel modification, culvert, building, wire, fence,
stockpile, refuse, fill, structure, or matter in, along, across, or projecting
into any channel, watercourse, or regulatory floodplain which may impede,
retard, or change the direction of the flow of water, either in itself or by
catching or collecting debris carried by such water.
PRINCIPAL USE OR STRUCTURE: All uses or structures that are not accessory uses
or structures.
REACH: A hydraulic engineering term to describe a longitudinal segment of a
stream or river influenced by a natural or manmade obstruction. In an urban
area, the segment of a stream or river between two (2) consecutive bridge
crossings would most typically constitute a reach.
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE: A vehicle that is built on a single chassis, is four
hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, is designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and is designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but
as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal
use. For the purposes of this chapter, the term recreational vehicle shall be
synonymous with the term travel trailer/travel vehicle.
REGIONAL FLOOD: A flood which is representative of large floods known to have
occurred generally in Minnesota and reasonably characteristic of what can be
expected to occur on an average frequency in the magnitude of the 100-year
recurrence interval. Regional flood is synonymous with the term "base flood"
used in a flood insurance study.
REGULATORY FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION: An elevation no lower than one foot (1')
above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation
caused by encroachments on the floodplain that result from designation of a
floodway.
STRUCTURE: Anything constructed or erected on the ground or attached to the
ground or on site utilities, including, but not limited to, buildings,
factories, sheds, detached garages, cabins, manufactured homes, recreational
vehicles not meeting the exemption criteria specified in subsection 13-1-10C1
of this chapter and other similar items.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure where the
cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Within any consecutive three hundred sixty five (365)
day period, any reconstruction, rehabilitation (including normal maintenance
and repair), repair after damage, addition, or other improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the
market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred "substantial
damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either:
   A.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
   B.   Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic
structure". For the purpose of this chapter, "historic structure" shall be as
defined in code of federal regulations, part 59.1.
VARIANCE: A modification of a specific permitted development standard required
in an official control including this chapter to allow an alternative
development standard not stated as acceptable in the official control, but only
as applied to a particular property for the purpose of alleviating a hardship,
practical difficulty or unique circumstance as defined and elaborated upon in a
community's respective planning and zoning enabling legislation. (Ord. 260, 2-
21-2006)

Structural works for flood control such as levees, dikes and floodwalls
constructed to any height where the intent is to protect individual structures
and levees or dikes where the intent is to protect agricultural crops for a
frequency flood event equal to or less than the 10-year frequency flood event.
Structures accessory to the uses listed in subsection A of this section and the
uses listed in this subsection.
   D.   Standards For Floodway Conditional Uses:
      1.   All Uses: No structure (temporary or permanent), fill (including
fill for roads and levees), deposit, obstruction, storage of materials or
equipment, or other uses may be allowed as a conditional use that will cause
any increase in the stage of the 100-year or regional flood or cause an
increase in flood damages in the reach or reaches affected.
      2.   Floodway Conditional Uses: All floodway conditional uses shall be
subject to the procedures and standards contained in section
13-1-11-4 of this chapter.
      3.   Permissible In Underlying District: The conditional use shall be
permissible in the underlying zoning district if one exists.
      4.   Fill:
         a.   Fill, dredge spoil, and all other similar materials deposited or
stored in the floodplain shall be protected from erosion by vegetative cover,
mulching, riprap or other acceptable method.
         b.   Dredge spoil sites and sand and gravel operations shall not be
allowed in the floodway unless a long term site development plan is submitted
which includes an erosion/sedimentation prevention element to the plan.
         c.   As an alternative, and consistent with subsection D4b of this
section, dredge spoil disposal and sand and gravel operations may allow
temporary, on site storage of fill or other materials which would have caused
an increase to the stage of the 100-year or regional flood but only after the
governing body has received an appropriate plan which assures the removal of
the materials from the floodway based upon the flood warning time available.
The conditional use permit must be title registered with the property in the
office of the county recorder.
      5.   Accessory Structures:
         a.   Accessory structures shall not be designed for human habitation.
         b.   Accessory structures, if permitted, shall be constructed and
placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the flow
of floodwaters.
            (1)   Whenever possible, structures shall be constructed with the
longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow; and
            (2)   So far as practicable, structures shall be placed
approximately on the same flood flow lines as those of adjoining structures.
         c.   Accessory structures shall be elevated on fill or structurally
dry floodproofed in accordance with the FP-1 or FP-2 floodproofing
classifications in the state building code. As an alternative, an accessory
structure may be floodproofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 floodproofing classification
in the state building code, provided the accessory structure constitutes a
minimal investment, does not exceed five hundred (500) square feet in size at
its largest projection, and for a detached garage, the detached garage must be
used solely for parking of vehicles and limited storage. All floodproofed
accessory structures must meet the following additional standards:
            (1)   The structure must be adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure and shall be designed
to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls;
            (2)   Any mechanical and utility equipment in a structure must be
elevated to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or properly
floodproofed; and
            (3)   To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there
must be a minimum of two (2) "automatic" openings in the outside walls of the
structure having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every
square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. There must be openings on at
least two (2) sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings must be no
higher than one foot (1') above the lowest adjacent grade to the structure.
Using human intervention to open a garage door prior to flooding will not
satisfy this requirement for automatic openings.
      6.   Storage Of Materials And Equipment:
         a.   The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of
flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or
plant life is prohibited.
         b.   Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if readily
removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning and in
accordance with a plan approved by the governing body.
      7.   Structural Works For Flood Control: Structural works for flood
control that will change the course, current or cross section of protected
wetlands or public waters shall be subject to the provisions of Minnesota
statute, chapter 103G. Communitywide structural works for flood control
intended to remove areas from the regulatory floodplain shall not be allowed in
the floodway.
      8.   Levee, Dike Or Floodwall: A levee, dike or floodwall constructed in
the floodway shall not cause an increase to the 100-year or regional flood and
the technical analysis must assume equal conveyance or storage loss on both
sides of a stream. (Ord. 260, 2-21-2006)
13-1-6: FLOOD FRINGE DISTRICT (FF):
   A.   Permitted Uses: Permitted uses shall be those uses of land or
structures listed as permitted uses in the underlying zoning use district(s).
If no preexisting, underlying zoning use districts exist, then any residential
or nonresidential structure or use of a structure or land shall be a permitted
use in the flood fringe district, provided such use does not constitute a
public nuisance. All permitted uses shall comply with the standards for flood
fringe district "permitted uses" listed in subsection B of this section and the
"standards for all flood fringe uses" listed in subsection E of this section.
   B.   Standards For Flood Fringe Permitted Uses:
      1.   All structures, including accessory structures, must be elevated on
fill so that the lowest floor including basement floor is at or above the
regulatory flood protection elevation. The finished fill elevation for
structures shall be no lower than one foot (1') below the regulatory flood
protection elevation and the fill shall extend at such elevation at least
fifteen feet (15') beyond the outside limits of the structure erected thereon.
      2.   As an alternative to elevation on fill, accessory structures that
constitute a minimal investment and that do not exceed five hundred (500)
square feet at its largest projection may be internally floodproofed in
accordance with subsection 13-1-5D5c of this chapter.
      3.   The cumulative placement of fill where at any one time in excess of
one thousand (1,000) cubic yards of fill is located on the parcel shall be
allowable only as a conditional use, unless said fill is specifically intended
to elevate a structure in accordance with subsection B1 of this section.
      4.   The storage of any materials or equipment shall be elevated on fill
to the regulatory flood protection elevation.
      5.   The provisions of subsection E of this section shall apply.
   C.   Conditional Uses: Any structure that is not elevated on fill or
floodproofed in accordance with subsections B1 and B2 of this section and/or
any use of land that does not comply with the standards in subsections B3 and
B4 of this section shall only be allowable as a conditional use. An application
for a conditional use shall be subject to the standards and criteria and
evaluation procedures specified in subsections D and E of this section and
section
13-1-11-4 of this chapter.
   D.   Standards For Flood Fringe Conditional Uses:
      1.   Alternative Elevation Methods: Alternative elevation methods other
than the use of fill may be utilized to elevate a structure's lowest floor
above the regulatory flood protection elevation. These alternative methods may
include the use of stilts, pilings, parallel walls, etc., or above grade,
enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages. The base or floor of
an enclosed area shall be considered above grade and not a structure's basement
or lowest floor if: a) the enclosed area is above grade on at least one side of
the structure; b) it is designed to internally flood and is constructed with
flood resistant materials; and c) it is used solely for parking of vehicles,
building access or storage. The above noted alternative elevation methods are
subject to the following additional standards:
         a.   Design And Certification: The structure's design and as built
condition must be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect
as being in compliance with the general design standards of the state building
code and, specifically, that all electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and
air conditioning equipment and other service facilities must be at or above the
regulatory flood protection elevation or be designed to prevent floodwater from
entering or accumulating within these components during times of flooding.
         b.   Specific Standards For Above Grade, Enclosed Areas: Above grade,
fully enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages must be
designed to internally flood and the design plans must stipulate:
            (1)   A minimum area of openings in the walls where internal
flooding is to be used as a floodproofing technique. There shall be a minimum
of two (2) openings on at least two (2) sides of the structure and the bottom
of all openings shall be no higher than one foot (1') above grade. The
automatic openings shall have a minimum net area of not less than one square
inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding unless a
registered professional engineer or architect certifies that a smaller net area
would suffice. The automatic openings may be equipped with screens, louvers,
valves, or other coverings or devices, provided that they permit the automatic
entry and exit of floodwaters without any form of human intervention; and
            (2)   That the enclosed area will be designed of flood resistant
materials in accordance with the FP-3 or FP-4 classifications in the state
building code and shall be used solely for building access, parking of vehicles
or storage.
      2.   Basements: Basements, as defined by section
13-1-3 of this chapter, shall be subject to the following:
         a.   Residential basement construction shall not be allowed below the
regulatory flood protection elevation.
         b.   Nonresidential basements may be allowed below the regulatory
flood protection elevation, provided the basement is structurally dry
floodproofed in accordance with subsection D3 of this section.
      3.   Nonresidential Structures: All areas of nonresidential structures
including basements to be placed below the regulatory flood protection
elevation shall be floodproofed in accordance with the structurally dry
floodproofing classifications in the state building code. Structurally dry
floodproofing must meet the FP-1 or FP-2 floodproofing classification in the
state building code and this shall require making the structure watertight with
the walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and the effects of buoyancy. Structures floodproofed to the FP-3 or FP-
4 classification shall not be permitted.
      4.   Control Plan; Shoreland Ordinance: When at any one time more than
one thousand (1,000) cubic yards of fill or other similar material is located
on a parcel for such activities as on site storage, landscaping, sand and
gravel operations, landfills, roads, dredge spoil disposal or construction of
flood control works, an erosion/sedimentation control plan must be submitted
unless the community is enforcing a state approved shoreland management
ordinance. In the absence of a state approved shoreland ordinance, the plan
must clearly specify methods to be used to stabilize the fill on site for a
flood event at a minimum of the 100-year or regional flood event. The plan must
be prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer or other
qualified individual acceptable to the governing body. The plan may incorporate
alternative procedures for removal of the material from the floodplain if
adequate flood warning time exists.
      5.   Storage Of Materials And Equipment:
         a.   The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of
flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or
plant life is prohibited.
         b.   Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if readily
removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning and in
accordance with a plan approved by the governing body.
      6.   Other Applicable Provisions: The provisions of subsection E of this
section shall also apply.
   E.   Standards For All Flood Fringe Uses:
      1.   Vehicular Access: All new principal structures must have vehicular
access at or above an elevation not more than two feet (2') below the
regulatory flood protection elevation. If a variance to this requirement is
granted, the board of adjustment must specify limitations on the period of use
or occupancy of the structure for times of flooding and only after determining
that adequate flood warning time and local flood emergency response procedures
exist.
      2.   Commercial Uses: Accessory land uses, such as yards, railroad
tracks, and parking lots may be at elevations lower than the regulatory flood
protection elevation. However, a permit for such facilities to be used by the
employees or the general public shall not be granted in the absence of a flood
warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area would be
inundated to a depth and velocity such that when multiplying the depth (in
feet) times velocity (in feet per second) the product number exceeds four (4)
upon occurrence of the regional flood.
      3.   Manufacturing And Industrial Uses: Measures shall be taken to
minimize interference with normal plant operations especially along streams
having protracted flood durations. Certain accessory land uses such as yards
and parking lots may be at lower elevations subject to requirements set out in
subsection E2 of this section. In considering permit applications, due
consideration shall be given to needs of an industry whose business requires
that it be located in floodplain areas.
      4.   Fill: Fill shall be properly compacted and the slopes shall be
properly protected by the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable
method. The federal emergency management agency (FEMA) has established criteria
for removing the special flood hazard area designation for certain structures
properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation. FEMA's
requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection
standards for multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should
be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of
special flood hazard area designation will be requested.
      5.   Hydraulic Capacity: Floodplain developments shall not adversely
affect the hydraulic capacity of the channel and adjoining floodplain of any
tributary watercourse or drainage system where a floodway or other encroachment
limit has not been specified on the official zoning map.
      6.   Recreational Vehicles: Standards for recreational vehicles are
contained in subsection 13-1-10C of this chapter.
      7.   Manufactured Homes: All manufactured homes must be securely anchored
to an adequately anchored foundation system that resists flotation, collapse
and lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be
limited to, use of over the top or frame ties to ground anchors. This
requirement is in addition to applicable state or local anchoring requirements
for resisting wind forces. (Ord. 260, 2-21-2006)
13-1-7: GENERAL FLOODPLAIN DISTRICT:
   A.   Permissible Uses:
The uses listed in subsection 13-1-5A of this chapter shall be permitted uses.
All other uses shall be subject to the floodway/flood fringe evaluation
criteria pursuant to subsection B of this section. Section
13-1-5 of this chapter shall apply if the proposed use is in the floodway
district and section
13-1-6 of this chapter shall apply if the proposed use is in the flood fringe
district.
   B.   Procedures For Floodway And Flood Fringe Determinations Within The
General Floodplain District:
      1.   Upon receipt of an application for a permit or other approval within
the general floodplain district, the applicant shall be required to furnish
such of the following information as is deemed necessary by the zoning
administrator for the determination of the regulatory flood protection
elevation and whether the proposed use is within the floodway or flood fringe
district:
         a.   A typical valley cross section(s) showing the channel of the
stream, elevation of land areas adjoining each side of the channel, cross
sectional areas to be occupied by the proposed development, and high water
information.
         b.   Plan (surface view) showing elevations or contours of the ground,
pertinent structure, fill, or storage elevations, the size, location, and
spatial arrangement of all proposed and existing structures on the site, and
the location and elevations of streets.
         c.   Photographs showing existing land uses, vegetation upstream and
downstream, and soil types.
         d.   Profile showing the slope of the bottom of the channel or flow
line of the stream for at least five hundred feet (500') in either direction
from the proposed development.
      2.   The applicant shall be responsible to submit one copy of the above
information to a designated engineer or other expert person or agency for
technical assistance in determining whether the proposed use is in the floodway
or flood fringe district and to determine the regulatory flood protection
elevation. Procedures consistent with Minnesota regulations 1983, parts
6120.5000 - 6120.6200 and 44 code of federal regulations part 65 shall be
followed in this expert evaluation. The designated engineer or expert is
strongly encouraged to discuss the proposed technical evaluation methodology
with the respective department of natural resources' area hydrologist prior to
commencing the analysis. The designated engineer or expert shall:
         a.   Estimate the peak discharge of the regional flood.
         b.   Calculate the water surface profile of the regional flood based
upon a hydraulic analysis of the stream channel and overbank areas.
         c.   Compute the floodway necessary to convey or store the regional
flood without increasing flood stages more than 0.5 foot. A lesser stage
increase than 0.5 foot shall be required if, as a result of the additional
stage increase, increased flood damages would result. An equal degree of
encroachment on both sides of the stream within the reach shall be assumed in
computing floodway boundaries.
      3.   The zoning administrator shall present the technical evaluation and
findings of the designated engineer or expert to the governing body. The
governing body must formally accept the technical evaluation and the
recommended floodway and/or flood fringe district boundary or deny the permit
application. The governing body, prior to official action, may submit the
application and all supporting data and analyses to the federal emergency
management agency, the department of natural resources or the planning
commission for review and comment. Once the floodway and flood fringe district
boundaries have been determined, the governing body shall refer the matter back
to the zoning administrator who shall process the permit application consistent
with the applicable provisions of sections
13-1-5 and
13-1-6 of this chapter. (Ord. 260, 2-21-2006)
13-1-8: SUBDIVISIONS:
   A.   Review Criteria: No land shall be subdivided which is unsuitable for
the reason of flooding, inadequate drainage, water supply or sewage treatment
facilities. All lots within the floodplain districts shall be able to contain a
building site outside of the floodway district at or above the regulatory flood
protection elevation. All subdivisions shall have water and sewage treatment
facilities that comply with the provisions of this chapter and have road access
both to the subdivision and to the individual building sites no lower than two
feet (2') below the regulatory flood protection elevation. For all subdivisions
in the floodplain, the floodway and flood fringe district boundaries, the
regulatory flood protection elevation and the required elevation of all access
roads shall be clearly labeled on all required subdivision drawings and
platting documents.
   B.   Floodway/Flood Fringe Determinations In The General Floodplain
District: In the general floodplain district, applicants shall provide the
information required in subsection 13-1-7B of this chapter to determine the
100-year flood elevation, the floodway and flood fringe district boundaries and
the regulatory flood protection elevation for the subdivision site.
   C.   Removal Of Special Flood Hazard Area Designation: The federal emergency
management agency (FEMA) has established criteria for removing the special
flood hazard area designation for certain structures properly elevated on fill
above the 100-year flood elevation. FEMA's requirements incorporate specific
fill compaction and side slope protection standards for multi- structure or
multi-lot developments. These standards should be investigated prior to the
initiation of site preparation if a change of special flood hazard area
designation will be requested. (Ord. 260, 2-21-2006)
13-1-9: PUBLIC UTILITIES, RAILROADS, ROADS, AND BRIDGES 1 :
   A.   Public Utilities: All public utilities and facilities such as gas,
electrical, sewer, and water supply systems to be located in the floodplain
shall be floodproofed in accordance with the state building code or elevated to
above the regulatory flood protection elevation.
   B.   Public Transportation Facilities: Railroad tracks, roads, and bridges
to be located within the floodplain shall comply with sections
13-1-5 and
13-1-6 of this chapter. Elevation to the regulatory flood protection elevation
shall be provided where failure or interruption of these transportation
facilities would result in danger to the public health or safety or where such
facilities are essential to the orderly functioning of the area. Minor or
auxiliary roads or railroads may be constructed at a lower elevation where
failure or interruption of transportation services would not endanger the
public health or safety.
   C.   On Site Sewage Treatment And Water Supply Systems: Where public
utilities are not provided:
      1.   On site water supply systems must be designed to minimize or
eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems; and
      2.   New or replacement on site sewage treatment systems must be designed
to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and
discharges from the systems into floodwaters and they shall not be subject to
impairment or contamination during times of flooding. Any sewage treatment
system designed in accordance with the state's current statewide standards for
on site sewage treatment systems shall be determined to be in compliance with
this section. (Ord. 260, 2-21-2006)

13-1-10: MANUFACTURED HOMES, MANUFACTURED HOME PARKS AND PLACEMENT OF
RECREATIONAL VEHICLES:
   A.   New manufactured home parks and expansions to existing manufactured
home parks shall be subject to the provisions placed on subdivisions by section
13-1-8 of this chapter.
   B.   The placement of new or replacement manufactured homes in existing
manufactured home parks or on individual lots of record that are located in
floodplain districts will be treated as a new structure and may be placed only
if elevated in compliance with section
13-1-6 of this chapter. If vehicular road access for preexisting manufactured
home parks is not provided in accordance with subsection 13-1-6E1 of this
chapter, then replacement manufactured homes will not be allowed until the
property owner(s) develops a flood warning emergency plan acceptable to the
governing body.
      1.   All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system that resists flotation, collapse and lateral
movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use
of over the top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in
addition to applicable state or local anchoring requirements for resisting wind
forces.
   C.   Recreational vehicles that do not meet the exemption criteria specified
in subsection C1 of this section shall be subject to the provisions of this
chapter and as specifically spelled out in subsections C3 and C4 of this
section.

this chapter if they are placed in any of the areas listed in subsection C2 of
this section and further they meet the following criteria:
         a.   Have current licenses required for highway use.
         b.   Are highway ready, meaning: 1) on wheels or the internal jacking
system, 2) are attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities
commonly used in campgrounds and recreational vehicle parks, and 3) the
recreational vehicle has no permanent structural type additions attached to it.
         c.   The recreational vehicle and associated use must be permissible
in any preexisting, underlying zoning use district.
      2.   Areas Exempted For Placement Of Recreational Vehicles:
         a.   Individual lots or parcels of record.
         b.   Existing commercial recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds.
         c.   Existing condominium type associations.

of this section lose this exemption when development occurs on the parcel
exceeding five hundred dollars ($500.00) for a structural addition to the
recreational vehicle or exceeding five hundred dollars ($500.00) for an
accessory structure such as a garage or storage building. The recreational
vehicle and all additions and accessory structures will then be treated as a
new structure and shall be subject to the elevation/floodproofing requirements
and the use of land restrictions specified in sections
13-1-5 and
13-1-6 of this chapter. There shall be no development or improvement on the
parcel or attachment to the recreational vehicle that hinders the removal of
the recreational vehicle to a flood free location should flooding occur.
      4.   New Recreational Vehicle Parks, Subdivisions: New commercial
recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds and new residential type subdivisions
and condominium associations and the expansion of any existing similar use
exceeding five (5) units or dwelling sites shall be subject to the following:
         a.   Any new or replacement recreational vehicle will be allowed in
the floodway or flood fringe districts, provided said recreational vehicle and
its contents are placed on fill above the regulatory flood protection elevation
and proper elevated road access to the site exists in accordance with
subsection 13-1-6E1 of this chapter. No fill placed in the floodway to meet the
requirements of this section shall increase flood stages of the 100-year or
regional flood.
         b.   All new or replacement recreational vehicles not meeting the
criteria of subsection C4a of this section may, as an alternative, be allowed
as a conditional use if in accordance with the following provisions and the

appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision,
or determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement or
administration of this chapter.
   C.   Variances: The board of adjustment may authorize upon appeal in
specific cases such relief or variance from the terms of this chapter as will
not be contrary to the public interest and only for those circumstances such as
hardship, practical difficulties or circumstances unique to the property under
consideration, as provided for in the respective enabling legislation for
planning and zoning for cities or counties as appropriate. In the granting of
such variance, the board of adjustment shall clearly identify in writing the
specific conditions that existed consistent with the criteria specified in this
chapter, any other zoning regulations in the community, and in the respective
enabling legislation that justified the granting of the variance. No variance
shall have the effect of allowing in any district uses prohibited in that
district, permit a lower degree of flood protection than the regulatory flood
protection elevation for the particular area, or permit standards lower than
those required by state law. The following additional variance criteria of the
federal emergency management agency must be satisfied:
      1.   Variances shall not be issued by a community within any designated
regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood
discharge would result.
      2.   Variances shall only be issued by a community upon: a) a showing of
good and sufficient cause, b) a determination that failure to grant the
variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and c) a
determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased
flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public
expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or
conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      3.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
   D.   Hearings: Upon filing with the board of adjustment of an appeal from a
decision of the zoning administrator, or an application for a variance, the
board of adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for a hearing and give due
notice to the parties in interest as specified by law. The board of adjustment
shall submit by mail to the commissioner of natural resources a copy of the
application for proposed variances sufficiently in advance so that the
commissioner will receive at least ten (10) days' notice of the hearing.
   E.   Decisions: The board of adjustment shall arrive at a decision on such
appeal or variance within ten (10) days. In passing upon an appeal, the board
of adjustment may, so long as such action is in conformity with the provisions
of this chapter, reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or modify the order,
requirement, decision or determination of the zoning administrator or other
public official. It shall make its decision in writing setting forth the
findings of fact and the reasons for its decisions. In granting a variance the
board of adjustment may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards such as
those specified in subsection 13-1-11-4F of this chapter, which are in
conformity with the purposes of this chapter. Violations of such conditions and
safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted,
shall be deemed a violation of this chapter punishable under section
13-1-14 of this chapter. A copy of all decisions granting variances shall be
forwarded by mail to the commissioner of natural resources within ten (10) days
of such action.
   F.   Appeals: Appeals from any decision of the board of adjustment may be
made, and as specified in this community's official controls and also by
Minnesota statutes.
   G.   Flood Insurance Notice And Record Keeping: The zoning administrator
shall notify the applicant for a variance that: 1) the issuance of a variance
to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased
premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty five dollars
($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage and 2) such
construction below the 100-year or regional flood level increases risks to life
and property. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all
variance actions. A community shall maintain a record of all variance actions,
including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in
its annual or biennial report submitted to the administrator of the national
flood insurance program. (Ord. 260, 2-21-2006)
13-1-11-4: CONDITIONAL USES:
The city of Dawson's planning and zoning board shall hear and decide
applications for conditional uses permissible under this chapter. Applications
shall be submitted to the city manager who shall forward the application to the
planning and zoning board for consideration.
   A.   Hearings: Upon filing with the planning and zoning board an application
for a conditional use permit, the planning and zoning board shall submit by
mail to the commissioner of natural resources a copy of the application for
proposed conditional use sufficiently in advance so that the commissioner will
receive at least ten (10) days' notice of the hearing.
   B.   Decisions: The planning and zoning board shall arrive at a decision on
a conditional use within ten (10) days. In granting a conditional use permit
the planning and zoning board shall prescribe appropriate conditions and
safeguards, in addition to those specified in subsection F of this section,
which are in conformity with the purposes of this chapter. Violations of such
conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the
conditional use permit is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this chapter
punishable under section
13-1-14 of this chapter. A copy of all decisions granting conditional use
permits shall be forwarded by mail to the commissioner of natural resources
within ten (10) days of such action.

in passing on conditional use permit applications within all floodplain
districts:
      1.   Require the applicant to furnish such of the following information
and additional information as deemed necessary by the planning and zoning board
for determining the suitability of the particular site for the proposed use:
         a.   Plans in triplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location,
dimensions, and elevation of the lot, existing or proposed structures, fill,
storage of materials, floodproofing measures, and the relationship of the above
to the location of the stream channel; and
         b.   Specifications for building construction and materials,
floodproofing, filling, dredging, grading, channel improvement, storage of
materials, water supply and sanitary facilities.
      2.   Transmit one copy of the information described in subsection C1 of
this section to a designated engineer or other expert person or agency for
technical assistance, where necessary, in evaluating the proposed project in
relation to flood heights and velocities, the seriousness of flood damage to
the use, the adequacy of the plans for protection, and other technical matters.
      3.   Based upon the technical evaluation of the designated engineer or
expert, the planning and zoning board shall determine the specific flood hazard
at the site and evaluate the suitability of the proposed use in relation to the
flood hazard.
   D.   Factors Upon Which The Decision Of The Planning And Zoning Board Shall
Be Based: In passing upon conditional use applications, the planning and zoning
board shall consider all relevant factors specified in other sections of this
chapter, and:
      1.   The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments.
      2.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands or
downstream to the injury of others or they may block bridges, culverts or other
hydraulic structures.
      3.   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of
these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary conditions.
      4.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      5.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
      6.   The requirements of the facility for a waterfront location.
      7.   The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding
for the proposed use.
      8.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and
development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
      9.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for the area.
      10.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      11.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site.
      12.   Such other factors which are relevant to the purposes of this
chapter.
   E.   Time For Acting On Application: The planning and zoning board shall act
on an application in the manner described above within ten (10) days from
receiving the application, except that where additional information is required
pursuant to subsection C of this section, the planning and zoning board shall
render a written decision within ten (10) days from the receipt of such
additional information.
   F.   Conditions Attached To Conditional Use Permits: Upon consideration of
the factors listed above and the purpose of this chapter, the planning and
zoning board shall attach such conditions to the granting of conditional use
permits as it deems necessary to fulfill the purposes of this chapter. Such
conditions may include, but are not limited to, the following:
      1.   Modification of waste treatment and water supply facilities.
      2.   Limitations on period of use, occupancy, and operation.
      3.   Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed restrictions.
      4.   Requirements for construction of channel modifications, compensatory

      5.   Floodproofing measures, in accordance with the state building code
and this chapter. The applicant shall submit a plan or document certified by a
registered professional engineer or architect that the floodproofing measures
are consistent with the regulatory flood protection elevation and associated
flood factors for the particular area. (Ord. 260, 2-21-2006)
13-1-12: NONCONFORMING USES:
   A.   A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful
before the passage or amendment of this chapter but which is not in conformity
with the provisions of this chapter may be continued subject to the following
conditions. Historic structures, as defined in section
13-1-3 of this chapter, shall be subject to the provisions of subsections A1
through A5 of this section.
      1.   No such use shall be expanded, changed, enlarged, or altered in a
way that increases its nonconformity.
      2.   Any structural alteration or addition to a nonconforming structure
or nonconforming use which would result in increasing the flood damage
potential of that structure or use shall be protected to the regulatory flood
protection elevation in accordance with any of the elevation on fill or
floodproofing techniques (i.e., FP-1 through FP-4 floodproofing
classifications) allowable in the state building code, except as further
restricted for substantial improvements in subsection A6 of this section.
      3.   Reserved for future use.
      4.   If any nonconforming use is discontinued for twelve (12) consecutive
months, any future use of the building premises shall conform to this chapter.
The assessor shall notify the zoning administrator in writing of instances of
nonconforming uses that have been discontinued for a period of twelve (12)
months.
      5.   If any nonconforming use or structure is substantially damaged, as
defined in section
13-1-3 of this chapter, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with
the provisions of this chapter. The applicable provisions for establishing new
uses or new structures in sections
13-1-5 and
13-1-6 of this chapter will apply depending upon whether the use or structure
is in the floodway or flood fringe district, respectively.
      6.   If a "substantial improvement" occurs, as defined in section
13-1-3 of this chapter, from any combination of a building addition to the
outside dimensions of the existing building or a rehabilitation,
reconstruction, alteration, or other improvement to the inside dimensions of an
existing nonconforming building, then the building addition and the existing
nonconforming building must be the elevation on fill or FP-1 or FP-2 dry
floodproofing requirements of section
13-1-5 or
13-1-6 of this chapter for new structures, depending upon whether the structure
is in the floodway or flood fringe district, respectively. If a substantial
improvement occurs only from a building addition, the existing structure must
also meet the elevation on fill or FP-1 or FP-2 dry floodproofing requirements
for new structures if any alteration is made to the common wall in excess of
installing a standard doorway. (Ord. 260, 2-21-2006)
13-1-13: AMENDMENTS:
The floodplain designation on the official zoning map shall not be removed from
floodplain areas unless it can be shown that the designation is in error or
that the area has been filled to or above the elevation of the regulatory flood
protection elevation and is contiguous to lands outside the floodplain. Special
exceptions to this rule may be permitted by the commissioner of natural
resources if he determines that, through other measures, lands are adequately
protected for the intended use.
All amendments to this chapter, including amendments to the official zoning
map, must be submitted to and approved by the commissioner of natural resources
prior to adoption. Changes in the official zoning map must meet the federal
emergency management agency's (FEMA) technical conditions and criteria and must
receive prior FEMA approval before adoption. The commissioner of natural
resources must be given ten (10) days' written notice of all hearings to
consider an amendment to this chapter and said notice shall include a draft of
the chapter amendment or technical study under consideration. (Ord. 260, 2-21-
2006)
13-1-14: VIOLATION; PENALTY:
   A.   Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with
any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards
established in connection with grants of variances or conditional uses) shall
constitute a misdemeanor and shall be punishable as defined by law.
   B.   Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city of Dawson from taking
such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.
Such actions may include, but are not limited to:
      1.   In responding to a suspected ordinance violation, the zoning
administrator and local government may utilize the full array of enforcement
actions available to it including, but not limited to, prosecution and fines,
injunctions, after the fact permits, orders for corrective measures or a
request to the national flood insurance program for denial of flood insurance
availability to the guilty party. The community must act in good faith to
enforce these official controls and to correct ordinance violations to the
extent possible so as not to jeopardize its eligibility in the national flood
insurance program.
      2.   When an ordinance violation is either discovered by or brought to
the attention of the zoning administrator, the zoning administrator shall
immediately investigate the situation and document the nature and extent of the
violation of the official control. As soon as is reasonably possible, this
information will be submitted to the appropriate department of natural
resources and federal emergency management agency regional office along with
the community's plan of action to correct the violation to the degree possible.
      3.   The zoning administrator shall notify the suspected party of the
requirements of this chapter and all other official controls and the nature and
extent of the suspected violation of these controls. If the structure and/or
use is under construction or development, the zoning administrator may order
the construction or development immediately halted until a proper permit or
approval is granted by the community. If the construction or development is
already completed, then the zoning administrator may either:
         a.   Issue an order identifying the corrective actions that must be
made within a specified time period to bring the use or structure into
compliance with the official controls; or
         b.   Notify the responsible party to apply for an after the fact
permit/development approval within a specified period of time not to exceed
thirty (30) days.
      4.   If the responsible party does not appropriately respond to the
zoning administrator within the specified period of time, each additional day
that lapses shall constitute an additional violation of this chapter and shall
be prosecuted accordingly. The zoning administrator shall also, upon the lapse
of the specified response period, notify the landowner to restore the land to
the condition which existed prior to the violation of this chapter. (Ord. 260,
2-21-2006)
