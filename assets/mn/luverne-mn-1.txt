mentioned.
SEC. 1.05. WARDS.
   The City shall be divided into two wards. Each ward shall be composed of
contiguous territory as regular and compact in form as practical, depending
upon the geography of the area involved and shall
be as nearly equal in population as possible. That portion of the City lying
north of a line running east and west as established by ordinance shall be
termed Ward Number 1, and that portion of the City lying south of said line
shall be termed Ward Number 2. The Council may at any time reapportion the
wards using a statistically verifiable means to estimate population so as to
make the wards as nearly equal in population as practicable, and to adopt such
change by ordinance.

new Council, or by reason of the death, resignation, removal from office,
removal from the City, continuous absence from the City for more than three
months, or conviction of a felony of any such person whether before or after
his qualification, or by reason of the failure of any member of the Council
without good cause to perform any of the duties of membership in the Council
for a period of three months. In each such case the Council shall by resolution
declare such vacancy to exist and shall forthwith appoint an eligible person to
fill the same until the next regular municipal election when the office shall
be filled for the unexpired term. In the event aCouncil Member moves his
residence from the ward from which he was elected to the other ward within the
City, no vacancy shall be deemed to exist during the unexpired portion of the
current term, but he should serve to the end of such term as though there had
been no such removal. Nor shall a change in ward boundaries as herein provided
in any way affect the current term of any Council Member. However, a candidate
for election or re-election to the office of Council Member must be a bona fide
resident of the ward from which he seeks election and meet all other
requirements of such candidate.

the filing of a new petition for the same purpose, nor shall it prevent the
Council from referring the ordinance to the registered voters at the next
regular or any special election at its option.
SEC. 6.06. ACTION OF COUNCIL ON PETITION.
   When the petition is found to be sufficient, the City Administrator shall so
certify to the Council at its next meeting, stating the number of petitioners
and the percentage of the total number of voters which they constitute, and the
Council shall at once read the ordinance and refer it to an appropriate
committee, which may be a committee of the whole. The Council shall thereupon
provide for public hearings upon the ordinance, after the holding of which the
ordinance shall be finally acted upon by the Council not later than 65 days
after the date upon which it was submitted to the Council by the City
Administrator. If the Council fails to pass the proposed ordinance, or passes
it in a form different from that set forth in the petition and unsatisfactory
to the petitioners, the proposed ordinance shall be submitted by the Council to
the vote of the registered voters at the next election; but if the number of
signers of the petition is at least 200, the Council shall call a special
election upon the measure. Such special elections shall be held not less than
30 nor more than 45 days from the date of final action on the ordinance by the
Council or after the expiration of 65 days from the date of submissions to the
Council when there has been no final action; but if a regular election is to
occur within three months, the Council may submit the ordinance at that
election. If the Council passes the proposed ordinance with amendments and at
least
four-fifths of the committee of petitioners does not express their
dissatisfaction with such amended form by a statement filed with the City
Administrator within 10 days of the adoption thereof by the Council, the
ordinance need not be submitted to the registered voters.
SEC. 6.07. INITIATIVE BALLOTS.
   The ballots used when voting upon any such proposed ordinance shall state
the substance of the ordinance and shall give the voters the opportunity to
vote either “yes” or “no” on the question of adoption. If a majority of the
registered voters voting on any such ordinance vote in favor of it, it shall
thereupon become an ordinance of the City. Any number of proposed ordinances
may be voted upon at the same election but the voter shall be allowed to vote
for or against each separately. In case of inconsistency between two initiated
ordinances approved at one election, the one approved by the higher percentage
of registered voters voting on the question shall prevail to the extent of the
inconsistency.
SEC. 6.08. INITIATION OF CHARTER AMENDMENTS.
    Nothing in this Charter shall be construed as in any way affecting the
right of the registered voters under the Constitution and statutes of Minnesota
to propose amendments to this Charter.
   Referendum
SEC. 6.09. THE REFERENDUM.
   If prior to the date when an ordinance takes effect a petition is signed by
at least 100 qualified registered voters of the City, if filed with the City
Administrator requesting that any such ordinance be repealed or be submitted to
a vote of the registered voters, the ordinance shall thereby be prevented from
going into operation. The Council shall thereupon reconsider the ordinance at
it's next regular meeting, and either repeal it or by aye and no vote reaffirm
it's adherence to the ordinance as passed. In the latter case the Council shall
immediately order a special election to be held thereon, or submit the
ordinance at the next election, pending which the ordinance shall remain
suspended. If a majority of the registered voters voting thereon is opposed to
the ordinance, it shall not become effective; but if a majority of the
registered voters voting thereon favors the ordinance, it shall go into effect
immediately or on the date therein specified.
SEC. 6.10. REFERENDUM PETITIONS.
   The requirements laid down in Sections 6.03 and 6.04 above as to the
formation of committees for the initiation of ordinances and as to the form of
petitions and signature papers shall apply to the
referendum as far as possible, but with such verbal changes as may be
necessary. A referendum petition shall read as follows:

circulator.
SEC. 6.14. FILING OF PETITION.
   Within 30 days after the filing of the original certificate, the committee
shall file the completed petition in the office of the City Administrator. The
City Administrator shall examine the petition within the next five days, and if
he finds it irregular in any way, or finds that the number of signers is less
than 500, he shall so notify one or more members of the committee. The
committee shall then be given ten days in which to file additional signature
papers and to correct the petition in all other respects, but they may not
change the statement of the grounds upon which the recall is sought. If at the
end of that time
the City Administrator finds the petition still insufficient or irregular, he
shall notify all the members of the committee to that effect and shall file the
petition in his office. No further action shall be taken thereon.
SEC 6.15. RECALL ELECTION.
   If a petition or amended petition is found sufficient, the City
Administrator shall transmit it to the Council without delay, and shall also
officially notify the person sought to be recalled of the sufficiency of the
petition and of the pending action. the Council shall at its next meeting, by
resolution, provide for the holding of a special election not less than 45, nor
more than 60 days, after such meeting, but if any other election is to occur
within 60 days after such meeting, the Council may in its discretion provide
for the holding of the recall election at that time.
SEC. 6.16. PROCEDURE AT RECALL ELECTION.
   The City Administrator shall include with the published or posted notice of
the election the statement of the grounds for the recall and also, in not more
than 500 words, the answer of the officer concerned in justification of his
course in office. Candidates to succeed the officer to be recalled shall be
nominated in the usual way, and the election shall be conducted as far as
possible, in accordance with the usual procedure in municipal elections.
SEC. 6.17. FORM OF RECALL BALLOT.
    Unless the officer whose removal is sought resigns within ten days after
the receipt by the Council of the completed recall petition, the form of the
ballot at such election shall be as near as may be:
“Shall                                               be recalled?” the name of
the officer whose recall is sought being inserted in the blank, and the
registered voters shall be permitted to vote separately “yes” or “no” upon this
question. The ballot shall also contain the names of the candidates to be voted
upon to fill the vacancy, in case the recall is successful, under the caption:
“Candidates to fill the place of                , if recalled”; but the officer
whose recall is sought shall not himself be a candidate upon such ballot. If a
majority of those voting on the question of recall vote in favor of recall, the
official shall be thereby removed from office, and the candidate who receives
the highest number of votes for his place shall be elected thereto for the
remainder of the unexpired term. If the officer sought to be recalled resigns
within ten days after the receipt by the Council of the completed recall
petition, the form of ballot at the election shall be the same, as nearly as
possible, as the form in use at a regular election.

CHAPTER 7: TAXATION AND FINANCES
SECTION 7.01. COUNCIL TO CONTROL FINANCES.

auditing and settlement of accounts, and the safekeeping and disbursement of
public moneys.
SEC. 7.02. FISCAL YEAR.
   The fiscal year of the City shall be the calendar year.
SEC. 7.03. SYSTEM OF TAXATION.
   Subject to the State Constitution, and except as forbidden by it or by State
law, the Council shall have full power to provide by ordinance for a system of
local taxation. This authority includes the power by ordinance to assess, levy,
and collect taxes on all subjects or objects of taxation except as limited or
prohibited by the State Constitution, by this Charter or by laws imposing
restrictions upon the City irrespective of Charter provisions.

budget as directed by a budget calendar to be established by the Council which
meets the requirements of State law or, in the absence thereof, by September 1.

activities for the ensuing fiscal year and, except as required by law or
Charter, shall contain such information and be in such form as the City
Administrator deems desirable or the Council may require. It shall include a
summary and show in detail all estimated income and all proposed expenditures,
including debt service and comparative figures for the current fiscal year,
actual and estimated, and the preceding fiscal year. In addition to showing

calendar but not later than at the first regular monthly meeting of the Council
in September and at subsequent meetings until a budget is adopted for the
ensuing year. The meetings shall be so conducted as to give interested citizens
a reasonable opportunity to be heard. The Council may revise the proposed
budget but no amendment to the budget shall increase the authorized
expenditures to an amount greater than the estimated fund balances. The Council
shall hold a public hearing on the budget and proposed tax levy prior to
adoption by resolution. The budget resolution shall set forth the total for
each budgeted fund and each department with such segregation as to objects and
purposes of expenditures as the Council deems necessary for purposes of budget
control. The Council shall also adopt a resolution levying the amount of taxes
provided in the budget and the City Administrator shall certify the tax
resolution to the County Auditor in accordance with law. Adoption of the budget
resolution shall constitute appropriations at the beginning of the fiscal year
of the sums fixed in the resolution for the several purposes named.
Appropriations for capital projects may be continuing appropriations extending
into the next fiscal year. The budget resolution may be supported by further
background information detailing the particulars of each line item budget
appropriations and shall serve only as a guide for the internal financial
budget control of the City.
SEC. 7.07. ENFORCEMENT OF THE BUDGET.
   The City Administrator shall enforce strictly the provisions of the budget
resolution. He shall not authorize any payment or the incurring of any
obligation by the City unless an appropriation has been made for the same and
there is a sufficient unexpended balance left after deducting the total past
expenditures and encumbrances against the appropriation. No officer or employee
of the City shall place any order or make any purchase for a purpose not
authorized in the budget resolution. Any obligation incurred by any person for
any purpose not authorized in the budget resolution or for any amount exceeding
an appropriation shall be a personal obligation upon the person incurring the
obligation. No check shall be issued or transfer made to any account other than
one owned by the City until the claim
to which it relates has been supported by an itemized bill, payroll, or time-
sheet or other document approved and signed by the responsible City officer who
vouches for its correctness and reasonableness.

the appropriations beyond the estimated revenue sources except to the extent
that such sources exceed the estimate. At any time the Council may, be
resolution approved by a majority of its members, reduce the sums appropriated
for any purpose by the budget resolution, or authorize the transfer of sums
from unencumbered balances of appropriations in the budget resolution to other
purposes.
SEC. 7.09. FUNDS.
   There shall be maintained in the City Treasury a general fund and such other
funds as may be required by statute, ordinance or resolution. The Council may,
by ordinance or resolution, make inter-fund loans, except from trust and agency
funds, as it may deem necessary and appropriate.
SEC. 7.10. CITY INDEBTEDNESS.
   Except as provided in Sections 7.11 and 7.12, no obligations shall be issued
to pay current expenses, but the Council may issue and sell obligations for any
other municipal purpose in accordance with law and within the limitations
prescribed by law. Except in the case of obligations for which an election is
not required by this Charter or by law, no such obligations shall be issued and
sold without the approval of the majority of the voters voting on the questions
at a general or special election.

SEC. 7.11. ANTICIPATION CERTIFICATES.
   At any time after January 1, the Council may issue certificates of
indebtedness in anticipation of State and Federal aids and the collection of
taxes levied the previous year for any fund and not yet collected. The total
amount of certificates issued against any fund for any year together with
interest thereon until maturity shall not exceed the total of State and Federal
aids and current taxes due to the fund and uncollected at the time of issuance.
Such certificates shall be issued on such terms and conditions as the Council
may determine, but they shall become due not later than the earlier of the
estimated date of collection of said revenues or 18 months after the date of
issuance. The proceeds of the tax levied and such State or Federal aids as the
governing body may have allocated for the fund against which tax anticipation
certificates are issued and the full faith and credit of the City shall be
irrevocably pledged for the redemption of the certificates.

SEC. 7.12. EMERGENCY DEBT CERTIFICATES.
   If in any year the receipts from taxes or other sources should from some
unforeseen cause become insufficient for the ordinary expenses of the City, or
if any calamity or other public emergency necessitates the making of
extraordinary expenditures, the Council may by ordinance issue on such terms
and in such manner as the Council determines emergency debt certificates to run
not to exceed three years. A tax sufficient to pay principal and interest on
such certificates with the margin required by law shall be levied as required
by law. The ordinance authorizing an issue of such emergency debt certificates
shall state the nature of the emergency and be approved by a unanimous vote of
the Council. It may be passed as an emergency ordinance.
SEC. 7.13. BANK LOANS.
   Whenever the Council, by resolution, deems it necessary and advantageous, it
may borrow money from any bank for the purpose of financing any authorized
capital improvement or other purpose as allowed by this Charter or by law. Such
loans shall be payable within a maximum period of ten (10) years and shall be
issued on such terms and in such manner as the Council may determine. If the
amount of the obligations to be issued exceeds twenty-five hundredths of one
percent (0.25%) of the assessor's latest gross market value, as finally
equalized, of all taxable property within the City, excluding money and
credits, they shall not be issued for at least ten days after publication in
the official newspaper of a Council resolution determining to issue them; and
if before the end of that time, a petition asking for an election on the
proposition signed by 100 registered voters is filed with the City
Administrator, such obligations shall not be issued until the proposition for
their issuance has been approved by a majority of the votes cast on the
question at a regular or special election. A tax levy shall be made for the
payment of the principal and interest on such obligations as in the case of
bonds as prescribed by law. In addition, the City may borrow money in
accordance with the provisions of this section from sources other than banks.

case exceed the benefits to the property.

of any utility owned by the City, upon such rentals and conditions as it may
deem necessary; but such contract shall be embodied in and let only by an
ordinance approved by unanimous vote of the Council and subject to popular
referendum. Such ordinance shall not be an emergency ordinance. In no case
shall such contract be for a longer term than ten years.
SEC. 11.05. PUBLIC UTILITY; HOW SOLD.

his respective office or employment, give a corporate surety bond to the City
in such form and in such amount as may be fixed by the Council as security for
the faithful performance of his official duties and the safekeeping of the
public funds. Such bonds may be either individual or blanket bonds in the
discretion of the Council. They shall be approved by the City Council, and

outstanding indebtedness, the Council may by ordinance or resolution designate
some other public use for the proceeds.

   (D)   General provisions.
      (1)   Administrative offense. A violation of any provision of the city
code noted in division (C) above is an administrative offense that may be
subject to an administrative citation and civil penalties. Each day a violation
exists shall constitute a separate offense.
      (2)   Code Compliance Officer. The City Administrator shall designate a
city employee to act as the Code Compliance Officer.
      (3)   Exemption. Alcohol and tobacco license violations are not subject
to administrative citation under this section.
      (4)   Civil penalty. Any violation for which an administrative citation

      (5)   Schedule of fines and fees. The standard fine for a violation under

The City Council shall annually review the schedule of fines and fees and may

(Prior Code, § 13.04)
   (E)   Administrative citation procedures.
      (1)   Notice of violation.
         (a)   Upon the discovery of a violation, the Code Compliance Officer
shall issue an administrative citation to the person alleged to be responsible
for the violation. The citation shall state the date, time and nature of the
alleged offense, the actions required to correct the alleged offense, the name
of the issuing Code Compliance Officer, the amount of the scheduled fine and
the manner for paying the fine or appealing the citation.
         (b)   The city shall deliver the administrative citation to the person
alleged to be responsible for the violation in person, by certified mail or it
shall be served by authorized representatives of the Sheriff’s office. In the
case of an offense under Ch. 72 of this code of ordinances, the administrative
citation may be attached to the motor vehicle.
         (c)   The person alleged to be responsible for the violation shall
have ten calendar days to correct the alleged violation after issuance of the
administrative citation. This division (E)(1)(c) shall not apply to violations
under Ch. 72 of this code of ordinances.
         (d)   If the person alleged to be responsible for the violation is
making a good faith attempt to remedy the violation, the Code Compliance
Officer may, in his or her sole discretion, grant an extension to the time
allowed to correct the alleged violation, the length of which must be stated in
writing by the Code Compliance Officer. The Code Compliance Officer shall
promptly inform the person alleged to be responsible for the violation of any
time extension. This division (E)(1)(d) shall not apply to violations under Ch.
72 of this code of ordinances.
         (e)   If the person alleged to be responsible for the violation fails
to correct the violation within the time period provided in the administrative
citation, or in any extension granted thereto, the Code Compliance Officer
shall issue a fine. The Code Compliance Officer must issue the notice of fine
resulting from the administrative citation to the person alleged to be
responsible for the violation in
person, by certified mail or it shall be served by authorized representatives
of the Sheriff’s office. In the case of a violation under Ch. 72 of this code
of ordinances, the notice of fine may be attached directly to the vehicle.
      (2)   Payment. The person alleged to be responsible for the violation
must pay the scheduled fine within 15 calendar days after issuance of the
notice of fine. Penalties for failure to correct the violation or late payment
of the fine may be imposed as set forth in division (D)(5) above. The Code
Compliance Officer may issue additional citations for each day the violation
continues to exist after the date on which the administrative citation is
issued. Payment of the fine associated with an administrative citation does not
relieve the person responsible for the violation from acting to correct the
violation.
      (3)   Abatement. In addition, the City Council may order the violation to
be abated and all fines, costs and other expenses associated with the alleged
violation shall be charged to the person alleged to be responsible for the
violation or to the real property owned by the person alleged to be responsible
for the violation on which the alleged violation has occurred. In cases where
the person alleged to be responsible for the violation does not own property,
the city shall file suit seeking judicial relief to collect the fine,
associated penalties and costs.
(Prior Code, § 13.05)
   (F)   Administrative hearing.
      (1)   General.
         (a)   The administrative hearing provides due process of the law to
any person who is issued an administrative citation. Due process of law
provides that the person alleged to be responsible for the violation shall be
given adequate notice, an opportunity to participate in a hearing and adequate
explanation of the reasons justifying the administrative citation.
         (b)   The person alleged to be responsible for the violation must make
a request for the administrative hearing within 15 days after the date on which
the city issued the fine associated with the administrative citation. All
requests for an administrative hearing must be made in writing to the attention
of the Code Compliance Officer.
      (2)   Administrative Hearing Officer. The City Council shall appoint an
Administrative Hearing Officer, who shall act as the hearing officer for the
administrative hearing. The Administrative Hearing Officer shall be an attorney
licensed to practice in the state. The Administrative Hearing Officer shall be
appointed for a term of two years beginning on January 1 of each odd-numbered
year.

support of any determination that the alleged offense constitutes a violation.
The summary report will include:

the file to the person alleged to be responsible for the violation shall be
considered completed upon mailing of the file via first class mail.
      (5)   Presentation of case. The parties shall have the opportunity to
present testimony and question any witnesses at the administrative hearing, but
strict rules of evidence will not apply. The Administrative Hearing Officer
shall tape record the hearing and receive testimony and exhibits. The
Administrative Hearing Officer must receive and give weight to evidence,
including hearsay evidence that possesses probative value commonly accepted by
reasonable and prudent people in the conduct of their affairs. The
Administrative Hearing Officer shall have the authority to determine that a
violation occurred, to dismiss a citation, to impose the scheduled fine and to
reduce, stay or waive a scheduled fine either unconditionally or upon
compliance with appropriate conditions. When imposing a penalty for a
violation, the Administrative Hearing Officer may consider any or all of the
following factors:

appropriate.
      (6)   Decision.
         (a)   Within 15 calendar days of the date of the administrative
hearing, the Administrative Hearing Officer shall provide the person alleged to
be responsible for the violation with an administrative order constituting its
decision. The decision of the Administrative Hearing Officer shall be final. A
decision in favor of the person alleged to be responsible for the violation
constitutes dismissal of the violation and no fine shall be assessed. If the
Administrative Hearing Officer renders a decision confirming the administrative
citation and finding that a violation has occurred, the person alleged to be
responsible for the violation shall correct the violation and comply with the
citation order. A report of each hearing shall be provided to the City
Administrator.
         (b)   The Administrative Hearing Officer may not impose a fine greater
than the established fine; except that, the Administrative Hearing Officer may
impose a fine for each day that the violation continues if:
            1.   The violation caused or is causing a serious threat of harm to
the public health, safety or welfare; or
            2.   The violator intentionally and unreasonably refused or refuses
to comply with the code requirement.
      (7)   Failure to appear.
         (a)   The failure to attend the hearing constitutes a waiver of the
rights of the person alleged to be responsible for the violation to an
administrative hearing. The Administrative Hearing Officer shall consider the
failure to appear as constituting an admission of the violation.
         (b)   The Administrative Hearing Officer may waive this result upon a
showing of good cause for the failure to appear. Examples of GOOD CAUSE are:
death in the immediate family of the person alleged to be responsible for the
violation; documented incapacitating illness of the person alleged to be
responsible for the violation violator; a court order requiring the person
alleged to be responsible
for the violation to appear for another hearing at the same time; and lack of
proper service of the citation or notice of the hearing. GOOD CAUSE does not
include: forgetfulness; lack of transportation or child care; and intentional
delay.
(Prior Code, § 13.06)
   (G)   Judicial review. An aggrieved party may obtain judicial review of the
decision of the Administrative Hearing Officer as provided in state law.
      (1)   Recovery of civil penalties. If a civil penalty is not paid within
the time specified, the non-payment shall constitute:
         (a)   A lien on the real property upon which the violation occurred if
the property or improvements on the property was the subject of the violation
and the property owner was found responsible for that violation; or
         (b)   A personal obligation of the person alleged to be responsible
for the violation in all other situations.
      (2)   Lien. A lien may be assessed against the property and collected in
the same manner as taxes.
      (3)   Personal obligation. A personal obligation may be collected by
appropriate legal means.
      (4)   Late fees/charges.
         (a)   1.   If, after 15 calendar days of the date on which the fine
was issued to the person found to be responsible for the violation, the fine
has not been paid or a hearing requested, the fine will increase by $50 or 50%
of the fine levied, whichever is greater.
            2.   If, after eight weeks of the date on which the fine was issued
to the person alleged to be responsible for the violation, the fine and
penalties have not been paid, the total fine and penalties shall be assessed to
the property taxes of the person found to be responsible for the violation and
all city licenses issued to the person shall be revoked. For continued
violations, the city may correct the violation and assess the charges for doing
so onto the property taxes of the person found to be responsible for the
violation and criminal charges may be filed.
         (b)   If the same person found to be responsible for the violation is
charged with a subsequent violation within a 12-month period for the same or
substantially similar offense, the fine shall be increased by 25%. After a
third infraction in a 12-month period, the fine shall increase by 50% and after
a fourth infraction in a 12-month period the fine shall increase by 100%.
      (5)   License revocation or suspension. Failure to pay a fine within the
time established for the payment shall constitute grounds for suspending or
revoking any license or permit issued to the person found to be responsible for
the violation.
(Prior Code, § 13.07)
   (H)   Criminal penalties; misdemeanors. The following are misdemeanors,
punishable in accordance with state law:
      (1)   Failure, without good cause, to pay a fine or request a hearing
within 15 days after issuance of an administrative citation;
      (2)   Failure, without good cause, to appear at an administrative hearing
that was scheduled under division (F) above and for which administrative
hearing proper notice was provided;
      (3)   Failure to pay a fine imposed by the Administrative Hearing Officer
within 15 calendar days after it was imposed, or other time as may be
established in the administrative order issued by the Administrative Hearing
Officer; and
      (4)   If the final adjudication in the administrative penalty procedure
is a finding of no violation, then the city may not prosecute a criminal
violation in District Court based on the same set of facts. This does not
preclude the city from pursuing a criminal conviction for a violation of the
same provisions based on a different set of facts. A different date of
violation shall constitute a different set of facts.
(Prior Code, § 13.08)
   (I)   Violation a misdemeanor or petty misdemeanor. Every person violates a
section, division, paragraph or provision of this section when he or she
performs an act thereby prohibited or declared unlawful, or fails to act when
the failure is thereby prohibited or declared unlawful, or performs an act
prohibited or declared unlawful, or fails to act when the failure is prohibited
or declared unlawful by a code adopted by reference by this section and, upon
conviction thereof, shall be punished as follows.
      (1)   Where the specific section, division, paragraph or provision
specifically makes violation a misdemeanor, he or she shall be punished as for
a misdemeanor; where a violation is committed in a manner or under
circumstances so as to endanger or be likely to endanger any person or
property, he or she shall be punished as for a misdemeanor.
      (2)   As to any violation not constituting a misdemeanor under the
provisions of division (I)(1) above, he or she shall be punished as for a petty
misdemeanor.
      (3)   Violation of any section, division, paragraph or provision of this
section shall be deemed continuing in nature, and may be treated as a new and
separate offense on each day (consisting of a 24-hour period commencing at 12:
00 midnight) during which the violation occurs.
(Prior Code, § 13.99)
(Ord. 262, Third Series, effective 5-27-2004; Ord. 263, Third Series, effective

§ 10.99 GENERAL PENALTY AND ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Any person, firm, or corporation who violates any provision of this
code for which another penalty is not specifically provided, shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor. The penalty which may be imposed for
any crime which is a misdemeanor under this code, including Minnesota Statutes
specifically adopted by reference, shall be a sentence of not more than 90 days
or a fine of not more than $1,000, or both.
   (B)   Any person, firm or corporation who violates any provision of this
code, including Minnesota Statutes specifically adopted by reference, which is

is a petty misdemeanor shall be a sentence of a fine of not more than $300.
   (C)   Pursuant to M.S. § 631.48, as it may be amended from time to time, in
either the case of a misdemeanor or a petty misdemeanor, the costs of
prosecution may be added. A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon
each day during which a violation occurs or continues.
   (D)   The failure of any officer or employee of the city to perform any
official duty imposed by this code shall not subject the officer or employee to
the penalty imposed for a violation.
   (E)   In addition to any penalties provided for in this section or in §
10.98, if any person, firm or corporation fails to comply with any provision of
this code, the Council or any city official designated by it, may institute
appropriate proceedings at law or at equity to restrain, correct or abate the
violation.

definitions apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning.
      ABANDONED MOTOR VEHICLE. A motor vehicle as defined in M.S. Ch. 169, as
it may be amended from time to time, that has remained for a period of more
than 48 hours on public property illegally or lacking vital component parts, or
has remained for a period of more than 48 hours on private property without the
consent of the person in control of the property, or in an inoperable condition
such that it has no substantial potential further use consistent with its usual
function, unless it is kept in an enclosed garage or storage building. It shall
also mean a motor vehicle voluntarily surrendered by its owner to and accepted
by the city. A classic car or pioneer car, as defined in M.S. Ch. 168, as it
may be amended from time to time, shall not be considered an ABANDONED MOTOR
VEHICLE within the meaning of this subchapter. Vehicles on the premises of junk
yards or automobile graveyards, which are licensed and maintained in accordance
with the city code, shall not be considered ABANDONED MOTOR VEHICLES within the
meaning of this subchapter.
      VITAL COMPONENT PARTS. Those parts of a motor vehicle that are essential
to the mechanical functioning of the vehicle, including, but not limited to,
the motor, drive train and wheels.
   (B)   Custody. The city shall take into custody and impound any abandoned
motor vehicle.
   (C)   Immediate sale. When an abandoned motor vehicle is more than seven
model years of age, is lacking vital component parts and does not display a

country, it shall immediately be eligible for sale at public auction and shall
not be subject to the notification, reclamation or title provision of this
division (C).
   (D)   Notice.
      (1)   When an abandoned motor vehicle does not fall within the provisions
of division (C) above, the city shall give notice of the taking within ten
days. The notice shall set forth the date and place of
the taking, the year, make, model and serial number of the abandoned motor
vehicle, if the information can be reasonably obtained, and the place where the
vehicle is being held, shall inform the owner and any lien holders of their
right to reclaim the vehicle under division (F) below and shall state that
failure of the owner or lien holder to exercise their right to reclaim the
vehicle and contents be deemed a waiver by them of all rights, title and
interest in the vehicle and a consent to the sale of the vehicle at a public
auction pursuant to division (F) below.
      (2)   The notice shall be sent by mail to the registered owner, if any,
of the abandoned motor vehicle and to all readily identifiable lien holders of
record. If it is impossible to determine with reasonable certainty the identity
and address of the registered owner and all lien holders, the notice shall be
published once in the official newspaper. Published notices may be grouped
together for convenience and economy.
   (E)   Right to reclaim.
      (1)   The owner or any lien holder of an abandoned motor vehicle shall
have a right to reclaim the vehicle from the city upon payment of all towing
and storage charges resulting from taking the vehicle into custody within 15
days after the date of the notice required by this section.

foreclose. For the purposes of this division (E), GARAGE KEEPER is an operator
of a parking place or establishment, an operator of a motor vehicle storage
facility or an operator of an establishment for the servicing, repair or

reclaimed under division (E) above shall be sold to the highest bidder at
public auction or sale, following one published notice published at least seven
days prior to the auction or sale. The purchaser shall be given a receipt in a
form prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles which shall be sufficient
title to dispose of the vehicle. The receipt shall also entitle the purchaser
to register the vehicle and receive a certificate of title, free and clear of
all liens and claims of ownership. Before such a vehicle is issued a new
certificate of title, it must receive a motor vehicle safety check.
      (2)   From the proceeds of the sale of an abandoned motor vehicle, the
city shall reimburse itself for the cost of towing, preserving and storing the
vehicle and all administrative, notice and publication costs incurred pursuant
to this section. Any remainder from the proceeds of a sale shall be held for
the owner of the vehicle or entitled lien holder for 90 days and then shall be
deposited in the General Fund of the city.
   (G)   Disposal of vehicles not sold. Where no bid has been received for an
abandoned motor vehicle, the city may dispose of it in accordance with this
section.
   (H)   Contracts and disposal.
      (1)   The city may contract with any qualified person for collection,
storage, incineration, volume reduction, transportation or other services
necessary to prepare abandoned motor vehicles and other scrap metal for
recycling or other methods of disposal.
      (2)   Where the city enters into a contract with a person duly licensed
by the state’s Pollution Control Agency, the Agency shall review the contract
to determine whether it conforms to the Agency’s plan for solid waste disposal.
A contract that does so conform may be approved by the Agency. Where a contract
has been approved, the Agency may reimburse the city for the costs incurred
under the contract which have not been reimbursed.
      (3)   If the city utilizes its own equipment and personnel for disposal
of the abandoned motor vehicle, it shall be entitled to reimbursement for the
cost thereof along with its other costs as herein provided.

less a pro rata share of the expenses of storage, publication of notice and
sale expenses, but without interest. The payment shall be also made from the
General Fund.
   (E)   Effective law. The City Administrator may elect to proceed under the
provisions of this section or any applicable statutory provisions.

(Prior Code, § 2.73) (Ord. 179, New Series, effective 1-19-1979)
§ 33.31 PETITION DEADLINES.
   No petition for construction of water distribution lines, sewage lines,

year prior to the year of requested construction unless waived by the Council.
(Prior Code, § 2.73) (Ord. 72, Third Series, effective 7-20-1989)
§ 33.32 CLASSIFICATION OF PROJECTS.
   (A)   In general. Public improvements are divided into three classes
specified in the following divisions (B), (C) and (D) below according to their
respective benefit to the whole city, to property specially served by the
improvement and taking into account past city practice.
   (B)   Class A.
      (1)   Class A improvements are those which are of general benefit to the
city at large, including:
         (a)   Public buildings, except a building which is part of an
improvement described in one of the following divisions (B)(1)(b), (B)(1)(c) or
(B)(1)(d) below;
         (b)   Any public park, playground or recreational facility;
         (c)   The installation and maintenance of street lighting systems; and
         (d)   Any improvement not described in M.S. § 429.021, subd. 1, as it
may be amended from time to time.
      (2)   Any such improvement shall be financed from general city funds and
not from special assessments.
   (C)   Class B. Class B improvements are those which are of both general
benefit and special benefit to abutting or nearby property. Class B
improvements include:
      (1)   Trunk water mains larger than six inches;
      (2)   Trunk sanitary sewer mains larger than ten inches;
      (3)   Permanently surfacing arterial streets as defined in division (C)
(4) below;
      (4)   Resurfacing by a bituminous overlay over an existing permanently
surfaced street;
      (5)   Interceptor storm sewers; and
      (6)   The construction of off-street parking facilities.
   (D)   Class C. Class C improvements are those which are primarily if not
exclusively of benefit to property abutting or in the area of the improvement,
including:
      (1)   The construction of water mains no larger than six inches in
diameter;
      (2)   The construction of sanitary sewer mains no larger than ten inches
in diameter;
      (3)   The construction of curbs and gutters;
      (4)   Permanently surfacing residential streets as defined in division
(D)(5) below;
      (5)   Resurfacing by a bituminous overlay over an existing permanently
surfaced street or the replacement of existing curbs and gutter;
      (6)   Storm sewers of a local nature; and
      (7)   Sidewalks in areas not otherwise included in special sidewalk
districts.
   (E)   Financing Class B and C improvements. It is the policy of the city to
finance Class B and C improvements by the methods prescribed in §§
33.33, 33.34 and 33.35 of this chapter. The apportionment of the cost between
benefitted property and the city at large and the method of levying assessments
prescribed in those sections shall be followed in each case unless the Council,
by resolution, finds that because of special circumstances stated in the
resolution, a different policy is necessary or desirable in the particular
case. Any local improvement described in M.S. § 429.02, as it may be amended
from time to time, and not placed in Class A, B or C by this section shall be
financed as the Council determines to be most feasible and equitable in each
case.
(Prior Code, § 2.73) (Ord. 72, Third Series, effective 7-20-1989; Ord. 179, New
Series, effective 1-19-1979)
§ 33.33 ASSESSMENT REGULATIONS FOR CLASS B IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Trunk water mains and sanitary sewers. When a water or sewer main is
laid across or adjacent to unplatted property, the city shall not defer the
assessment against the unplatted property if the assessment would be made for
such an improvement in the case of platted property, but the city shall make
the assessment at the time the assessment against other property is made,
apportioning the assessment against the unplatted property on the basis of
area. When a trunk sewer or water main is constructed and is to serve also as a
lateral sewer or water main for abutting property, the abutting property shall
be assessed for the cost of a lateral sewer or water main of eight inches, plus
its proportionate share of the cost of the excess capacity. Other property
benefitted by the trunk sewer or water main, but unable to utilize it until a
lateral connected to the trunk sewer or water main has been built to serve the
property shall not be assessed for its share of the cost of the trunk sewer or
water main until the lateral is built. The assessment for the lateral shall
then include the property’s share of the trunk sewer or water main. The cost of
the trunk sewer or water main in excess of the lateral assessment shall be
assessed on the basis of area against all properties benefitted. The cost of a
lift station shall be assessed on the basis of area against that property
actually benefitted by the lift station.
   (B)   Arterial street surfacing.
      (1)   For the purpose of this section, the term ARTERIAL STREET is
defined as a street used primarily to carry traffic between the thoroughfares
system and minor residential streets or non-residential areas when classified
as such in the city’s Comprehensive Transportation Plan.
      (2)   When an arterial street is paved with concrete, a bituminous mat or
other permanent surface, the cost of the pavement on a 36-foot roadway shall be
assessed against the benefitted property on the basis of frontage on the
abutting street. When the standard for the paving is higher than those the city
would use for a residential street, the cost to be assessed shall be based on
the cost of paving a residential street of the same width. The rest of the cost
shall be paid from general funds.
(Prior Code, § 2.73) (Ord. 72, Third Series, effective 7-20-1989; Ord. 179, New
Series, effective 1-19-1979)
§ 33.34 ASSESSMENT RULES FOR CLASS C IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Water and sewer. The cost of lateral water mains not exceeding six
inches in diameter and of lateral sanitary sewer mains not exceeding ten inches
in diameter shall be assessed against abutting property on the basis of
frontage. The cost of water mains to be assessed includes the service lines, if
furnished, hydrants and valves. The cost of sewer mains includes lines, if
furnished.
   (B)   Residential streets.
      (1)   For the purpose of this division (B), the term RESIDENTIAL STREETS
is a street used primarily for access to abutting property.
      (2)   The cost of construction of curbs and gutters on any street or of
applying permanent surfaces to residential streets shall be assessed on the
basis of frontage.
   (C)   Sidewalks. The cost of sidewalks shall be assessed on the basis of
frontage.
(Prior Code, § 2.73) (Ord. 34, Third Series, effective 7-25-1987; Ord. 179, New
Series, effective 1-19-1979)
§ 33.35 SPECIAL RULES.
   (A)   Corner lots. In any assessment made on the basis of frontage, except
for water or sanitary sewer, corner lots shall be assessed for footage along
the front of the lot, plus 20% of the side street footage. In the case of an
assessment for a lateral water or sewer main, Class C, corner lots shall be
assessed for the footage along the front side of the lot and shall not be
assessed for the footage along the side street abutting the lot unless the lot
is large enough to accommodate another building which would be benefitted by
construction of the second main. The side yard of a corner lot shall be the
street side not contained in the property address assigned by the city and used
for city utility record purposes. For a bare lot without an address, the side
yard shall be the longest footage until the lot is improved and an address
assigned by the city.
   (B)   Intersections. The cost of water and sewer improvements in street
intersections shall be included as part of the total assessable cost. In the
case of any kind of street improvement or sidewalk improvement, intersection
costs shall be paid by the city.
   (C)   Adjusted frontage. When the amount of an assessment is determined by
frontage, an equivalent front footage shall be determined according to the
following rules when an irregular lot requires such an adjustment to maintain
fairness in the assessment.
      (1)   Front footage shall be measured at setback on cul-de-sacs and
sharply curved streets and irregularly shaped lots.
      (2)   Equivalent front footage shall be determined by dividing the square
footage of the lot by the general lot depth of the subdivision for pie-shaped
lots and irregular shaped lots where other rules do not apply.
   (D)   Federal, state and county aid use. If the city receives financial
assistance from the Federal Government, the state or the county to defray a
portion of the cost of a street improvement project, the aid shall be used
first to reduce the share of the project cost which would be met from general
city funds according to the assessment formula contained in this subchapter. If
the aid is more than the amount of the improvement cost to be borne by the
city, the remainder of the aid so received shall be used to reduce each
individual assessment proportionately.
   (E)   Sidewalks. For all sidewalk improvements in areas other than those
specifically designated as or included in special sidewalk improvement
districts, the assessment shall be made on the basis of 50% of the frontage. In
the case of corner lots, assessment shall be made for 50% of the footage along
the front of the lot, plus 25% of the side street footage.
   (F)   Alleys. In any assessment made on the basis of frontage for alley
right-of-way improvement in the Central Business District as the same is
appropriately zoned under the provisions of Ch. 154 of this code of ordinances,
improved lots located at the intersection of connecting street rights-of-way
shall be assessed at the rate of 20% of the abutting alley footage if:
      (1)   No direct or indirect access is available from the building
improvements to the alley right-of-way for purposes of pedestrian or vehicular
ingress or egress or the delivery or pick up of goods or services; or
      (2)   The Council finds that the alley is not currently used in any way
to benefit the adjoining improved property.
   (G)   Street overlays. For all street resurfacing by a bituminous overlay
over an existing permanently surfaced street, the assessment shall be
calculated on the basis of 20% of the total project cost for both footages
along the front of the lot and side street. The city shall pay the remaining
80% of total project costs. This provision does not apply to public property,
which shall be assessed 100% of the costs attributable to the overlay of the
abutting street.
   (H)   Street reconstructs. For all street improvements requiring
reconstruction of an existing permanently surfaced street, the assessment shall
be calculated on the basis of frontage at the rate of 20% of the total project
costs with frontage footage adjusted as required in division (A) above for
corner lots. The city shall pay the remaining 80% of the total project costs.
This provision does not apply to public property, which shall be assessed 100%
of the costs attributable to the reconstruction of the abutting street.
(Prior Code, § 2.73) (Ord. 30, Third Series, effective 2-8-1987; Ord. 34, Third
Series, effective 7-25-1987; Ord. 58, Third Series, effective 7-7-1988; Ord.

§ 33.36 DEFERMENT OF SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS.
   (A)   The Council may defer the payment of any special assessment on
homestead property owned by a person who is 65 years of age or older, or who is
retired by virtue of permanent and total disability, and the City Administrator
is hereby authorized to record the deferment of special assessments where the
following conditions are met.
      (1)   The applicant must apply for the deferment not later than 30 days
after the assessment is adopted by the Council.
      (2)   The applicant must be 65 years of age, or older, or retired by
virtue of permanent and total disability.
      (3)   The applicant must be the owner of the property.
      (4)   The applicant must occupy the property as his or her principal
place of residence.
      (5)   The projected amount of the first year’s installment of principal
and interest will exceed 1% of the applicant’s income from all sources and the
applicant’s income from all sources does not exceed the low income limit as
established by the Department of Housing and Urban Development for uses in
determining the eligibility for Section VIII housing purposes.
   (B)   The deferment shall be granted for as long as period of time as the
hardship exists and the conditions as aforementioned have been met. However, it
shall be the duty of the applicant to notify the City Administrator of any
change in his or her status that would affect eligibility for deferment.
   (C)   The entire amount of deferred special assessments shall be due within
60 days after loss of eligibility by the applicant. If the special assessment
is not paid within 60 days, the City Administrator shall add thereto interest
at the rate originally certified from the due date through December 31 of the
following year and the total amount of principal and interest shall be
certified to the County Auditor for collection with taxes the following year.
Should the applicant plead and prove, to the satisfaction of the Council, that
full repayment of the deferred special assessment would cause the applicant
particular undue financial hardship, the Council may order that the applicant
pay within 60 days a sum equal to the number of installments of deferred
special assessments outstanding and unpaid to date (including principal and
interest) with the balance thereafter paid according to the terms and
conditions of the original special assessment.
   (D)   The option to defer the payment of special assessments shall terminate
and all amounts accumulated, plus applicable interest shall become due upon the
occurrence of any one of the following:
      (1)   The death of the owner when there is no spouse who is eligible for
deferment;
      (2)   The sale, transfer or subdivision of all or any part of the
property;
      (3)   Loss of homestead status on the property; or
      (4)   Determination by the Council for any reason that there would be no
hardship to require immediate or partial payment.

Third Series, effective 3-18-1993)
§ 33.37 PREPAYMENT AND ASSESSMENT CERTIFICATION.
   (A)   Partial prepayment. After the adoption by the Council of the
assessment roll in any local improvement proceeding, the owner of any property
specially assessed in the proceeding may, prior to the certification of the
assessment of the first installment to the County Auditor, pay to the city any
portion of the assessment. The remaining unpaid balance shall be spread over
the period of time established by the Council for installment payment of the
assessment.
   (B)   Certification of assessments. After the adoption of any special
assessment by the Council, the City Administrator shall transmit a certified

opening into, use, alter or disturb any public sewer or appurtenance thereof
without first obtaining a written permit from the Building Inspector.
   (B)   (1)   There shall be two classes of building sewer permits:
         (a)   For residential and commercial service; and
         (b)   For service to establishments producing industrial wastes.
      (2)   In either case, the owner or his or her agent shall make
application on a special form furnished by the city. The permit application
shall be supplemented by any plans, specifications or other information
considered pertinent in the judgement of the Building Inspector. A permit and
inspection fee shall be paid to the city at the time the application is filed,
the fee to be an amount as currently on file in the city’s sewage rate
schedule.
   (C)   All costs and expense incident to the installation and connection of
the building sewer shall be borne by the owner. The owner shall indemnify the
city from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by
the installation of the building sewer.

§ 53.06 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   (1)   The City Administrator may suspend the sewage treatment services
to any user (after informal notice to the discharger) when the suspension is
necessary, in the opinion of the City Administrator, in order to stop an actual
or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, to the
environment or to the sewage system, or would cause the city to violate any
condition of its NPDES or the state’s disposal system permit.
      (2)   Any user notified of a suspension of the sewage treatment service
shall immediately stop the discharge. In the event of a failure of the user to
comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the City Administrator shall take
such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the
sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the sewage system or
endangerment to any individuals. The City Administrator shall reinstate the
sewage treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the non-complying
discharge. A detailed written statement submitted by the user describing the
causes of any slug or accidental discharge and the measures taken to prevent
any future occurrence shall be submitted to the City Administrator within 15
days of the date of occurrence.
   (B)   In accordance with the procedures set forth in §§
53.01 through
53.06 and 53.20 through 53.26 of this chapter, the City Administrator may
revoke the permit of any user which fails to factually report the sewage
constituents or characteristics; or which refuses reasonable access to the
user’s premises for the purpose of inspection or monitoring or for violation of
conditions of its permit, §§
53.01 through
53.06 and 53.20 through 53.26 of this chapter or applicable state and federal

accidental discharge of substances or wastewater in violation of §§
53.01 through
53.06 and 53.20 through 53.26 of this chapter in order to enable counter-
measures to be taken to minimize damage to the sewage works and the receiving
waters. The notification will not relieve users of liability for any expense,
loss or damage to the sewage works or treatment process, or for any fines
imposed on the city on account thereof under any state or federal law. A notice
shall be permanently posted on the user’s bulletin board or other prominent
place advising employees whom to call in the event of a slug or accidental
discharge. Employers shall ensure
that all employees who may cause or discover such a discharge are advised of
the emergency notification.

taken at the control manhole.
(Prior Code, § 3.21)
§ 53.25 INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.
   The City Administrator shall inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain
whether the purpose of §§
53.01 through
53.06 and 53.20 through 53.26 of this chapter is being met and all requirements
are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is
created or discharged shall allow the City Administrator ready access at all
reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection,
sampling, records examination or in the performance of any of their duties. The
City Administrator, Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) and EPA shall
have the right to set up on the user’s property such devices as are necessary
to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering
operations. Where a user has security measures in force which would require
proper identification and clearance before entry into his, her, their or its
premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with any security guards
so that upon presentation of suitable identification, duly authorized city
employees, the state’s Pollution Control Agency employees and U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency employees bearing proper credentials and
identification shall be permitted to enter all properties for the purpose of
inspection, record, examination, observation and performance of their specific
responsibilities.
(Prior Code, § 3.21)
§ 53.26 SPECIAL CASES.
   No statement contained in this subchapter shall be construed as preventing
any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any industrial
concern whereby any industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be
accepted by the city for treatment, subject to payment therefor, by the
industrial concern. In no event shall the terms and provisions of such special
agreement cause the city to violate its NPDES permit or state disposal system
permit or result in plant interference, pass through, or restrictions on sludge
disposal. Additionally, any special agreement shall not agree to variances for
industries from national categorical pretreatment standards. Whenever it is
determined that any lot, parcel of land, building or premises is discharging
industrial wastes of unusual volume, concentration or character, or of a
greatly variable volume, a special rate for the class of users, taking into
consideration the volume, biochemical oxygen demand value and suspended solids
content of the industrial wastes and the nature of the use made of the sewer
system may be adopted by resolution of the Council.

SUMP PUMP DISCHARGES
§ 53.40 PURPOSE.
   In adopting this subchapter, the City Council finds that the discharge of
water from any roof, surface, ground, sump pump, footing tile or swimming pool
or other natural precipitation into the city sewerage system will and has on
occasion in the past, flooded and overloaded the sewerage system to such an
extent as to cause significant and grave damage to the property of large
numbers of city residents. The damage is caused by the backup of sewage into
the living quarters of residents and in addition to other damage creates a
hazard to health. The City Council, therefore, finds it essential to the
maintenance of health and to minimize damage to property that the provisions of
this subchapter be strictly enforced to avoid emergencies in the future.
(Prior Code, § 3.215)
§ 53.41 DEFINITION AND METHOD.
   No water from any roof, surface, ground, sump pump, footing tile, swimming
pool or other natural precipitation shall be discharged into the sanitary
sewerage system. Dwellings and other buildings and structures which require,
because of the infiltration of water into basements, crawl spaces and the like,
a sump pump system to discharge excess water shall have a permanently installed
discharge line which shall not, at any time, discharge water into the sanitary
sewerage system, except as provided herein. A permanent installation shall be
one which provides for year-round discharge capability to either the outside of
the dwelling, building or structure, or is connected to the city storm sewer or
discharges through the curb and gutter to the street. It shall consist of a
rigid discharge line, without valving or quick connections for altering the
path of discharge and, if connected to the city storm sewer line, include a
check valve.
(Prior Code, § 3.215) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 53.42 DISCONNECTION.
   Any person, firm or corporation having a roof, surface, ground, sump pump,
footing tile or swimming pool now connected and/or discharging into the
sanitary sewer system shall disconnect and/or remove the same. Any disconnects
or openings in the sanitary sewer shall be closed or repaired in an effective,
workmanlike manner, approved by the city.
(Prior Code, § 3.215) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 53.43 INSPECTIONS.
   (A)   At any time, if the city has reason to believe an illegal connection
may exist in a premises, the owner, by written notice, shall comply with the
provisions of §
53.41 of this chapter.
   (B)   As the city deems necessary, persons owning improved real estate that
discharges into the city’s sanitary sewer system shall allow an employee of the
city or a designated representative to inspect the building to confirm there is
no sump pump or other prohibited discharge into the sanitary sewer system. Any
property owner found in violation of this subchapter shall make the necessary
changes to comply with this subchapter.
(Prior Code, § 3.215) (Ord. 167, Third Series, effective 3-9-1995)
§ 53.44 WAIVERS.
   (A)   The city shall have the power and duty of hearing and deciding
requests for waivers from the applicability of the provisions of this
subchapter where strict enforcement would cause undue hardship because of
circumstances unique to the individual property under consideration or cause a
safety problem.
   (B)   Application for waivers pursuant to this section shall be addressed in
writing to the city. The application shall, at a minimum, identify the property
for which the waiver is being applied for, the name of the property owner/
applicant and describe in detail what characteristics of the subject property
create an undue hardship.
   (C)   Within a reasonable time, the city shall make its order deciding on
the matter and serve a copy of the order upon the applicant by mail. Upon
approval of an application for a waiver, a property owner shall be allowed to
temporarily pump directly into the sanitary sewer system between the dates of
October 15 and May 1, and provided the applicant agrees to pay an additional
fee of $35 per year for the additional sewer service, payable October 15 of the
year.

FERC H 61,071, 73 Fed. Reg. 64,099 (10-28-2008).
   (B)   Pursuant to Order No. 719, 18 C.F.R. § 35.28(g)(1) provides: “Each
Commission-approved independent system operator and regional transmission
organization must permit a qualified aggregator of retail customers to bid
demand response on behalf of retail customers directly into the Commission-
approved independent system operator’s or regional transmission organization’s
organized markets, unless the laws and regulations of the relevant electric
retail regulatory authority expressly do not permit a retail customer to
participate.”
   (C)   Pursuant to Order No. 719, 18 C.F.R. § 35.28(g)(1)(i)(A) provides:
“Every Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission
organization that operates organized markets based on competitive bidding for
energy imbalance, spinning reserves, supplemental reserves, reactive power and
voltage control, or regulation and frequency response ancillary service (or its
functional equivalent in the Commission-approved independent system operator’s
or regional transmission organization’s tariff) must accept bids from demand
response resources in these markets for that product on a basis comparable to
any other resources, if the demand response resource meets the necessary
technical requirements under the tariff, and submits a bid under the
Commission-approved independent system operator’s or regional transmission
organization’s bidding rules at or below the market-clearing price, unless not
permitted by the laws or regulations of the relevant electric retail regulatory
authority.”

without the express prior authorization of the City Council.
(Prior Code, § 3.26) (Ord. 18, Fourth Series, effective 6-24-2021)
§ 55.37 ANCILLARY SERVICES PROVIDED BY DEMAND RESPONSE RESOURCES.
   (A)   The municipal electric utility or its authorized designee is the sole
entity permitted to bid demand response on behalf of retail customers served by
the municipal electrical system directly into any Commission-approved
independent system operator’s or regional transmission organization’s organized
markets for energy imbalance, spinning reserves, supplemental reserves,
reactive power and voltage control or regulation and frequency response
ancillary services (or its functional equivalent in the Commission-approved
independent system operator’s or regional transmission organization’s tariff).
   (B)   Retail customers served by the municipal electric utility wishing to
bid their demand response into a Commission-approved independent system
operator’s or regional transmission organization’s organized markets for energy
imbalance, spinning reserves, supplemental reserves, reactive power and
voltage control or regulation and frequency response ancillary services (or its
functional equivalent in the Commission-approved independent system operator’s

§ 55.76 NON-DISTRIBUTED GENERATION INTERCONNECTION GUIDELINES.
   (A)   Scope and purpose.
      (1)   This section is intended to describe the requirements of Luverne
Electric Utilities regarding connection to its system of customer-owned
distributed generation equipment. The guidelines are intended to develop the
minimum requirements for connection of such equipment to the Luverne Municipal
Electric Utility system, and are not intended to be exhaustive. Each
installation will be reviewed by Luverne Municipal Electric Utility staff, and
additional requirements may be placed on the installation under special
circumstances.
      (2)   This document is intended to describe certain equipment that will
be necessary in order to ensure that the level of service provided to Luverne
Municipal Electric Utility's customers is not degraded by the installation of
the proposed distributed generation equipment. It is also intended to ensure
that safe operation of both the generation equipment and Luverne Municipal
Electric Utility's existing distribution system are maintained.
      (3)   Since this is a rapidly developing and changing field, it is
expected that these guidelines will be updated periodically to reflect new
technologies or industry standards. Luverne Municipal Electric Utility reserves
the right to require compliance with new guidelines should they be issued in
the future.
   (B)   Standards. The requirements developed in this chapter are intended to
comply with the following standards and regulatory bodies.
      (1)   Emerging IEEE Standard 1547.
      (2)   State and federal regulatory agency requirements.
      (3)   Requirements of Luverne Municipal Electric Utility's power
suppliers and transmission agents.
      (4)   National Electric Safety Code (latest version).
      (5)   National Electrical Code (latest version), if applicable, IEEE
Standard 519.
   (C)   Classifications of installation.
      (1)   Three types of distributed generation connections covered in this
document are as follows:
         (a)   Open transition. An open transition involves the disconnection
of the utility from the customer's load prior to transferring the load to the
customer's generator. The customer experiences a momentary interruption of
power while the transfer is being made. At no time is the customer generator
attached to the Luverne Municipal Electric Utility's distribution system.
         (b)   Closed transition/short-term parallel. This arrangement allows a
momentary connection of the customer's generator with the Luverne Municipal
Electric Utility's system during the time the customer load is being
transferred from the utility to the customer's generation equipment. Once the
transfer is made, the Luverne Municipal Electric Utility system is disconnected
from the customer load during the time the generator is operating. The length
of time in which the generator and the Luverne Municipal Electric Utility
system are connected is very short. In this arrangement, the customer does not
experience an interruption of service while the transition to and from the
generator is being made.
         (c)   Closed transition/long-term parallel. At this time, Luverne
Municipal Electric Utility does not allow long-term parallel operation of a
distributed generation installation.
      (2)   Protective equipment and interrupting devices vary depending on
which of the above operating modes are present.
      (3)   Disconnecting device. Each generating installation shall have a
three-phase disconnecting device of suitable voltage and current rating to
allow disconnection of the generating facility from Luverne Municipal Electric
Utility's system. The characteristics of this device are dependent on the
proposed operating mode of the generation equipment.
         (a)   Open transition. For an open transition installation, a transfer
switch or equivalent arrangement utilizing the “break before make" operating
characteristics shall be provided. This device shall ensure that the local
customer load bus is disconnected from Luverne Municipal Electric Utility's
system prior to closing the connection to the generator.
         (b)    Closed transition/short-time parallel. A three-phase device
suitable for protective relay operation shall be provided for any installation
that involves paralleling of the generation equipment with the Luverne
Municipal Electric Utility System. The required equipment for the utility side
device shall be a three-pole circuit breaker suitable for interruption of load
and fault current. The device shall be electrically operated such that
protective relaying (described below) can initiate disconnection of the
generator installation from Luverne Municipal Electric Utility's system when a
fault is sensed on Luverne Municipal Electric Utility's system.
   (D)   Protective relaying.
      (1)   It is essential that the delivery of power from the generating
equipment into Luverne Municipal Electric Utility's system, for however brief a
time, be done in a manner to minimize hazards to adjacent property. It is
essential that the generating facility be taken off line from Luverne Municipal
Electric Utility's system immediately whenever a fault is detected on Luverne
Municipal Electric Utility's system. Further, it is critical that the tie to
Luverne Municipal Electric Utility's system be separated whenever Luverne
Municipal Electric Utility's system experiences an outage (no "islanding" can
be allowed).
      (2)   The protective devices listed below are intended to protect Luverne
Municipal Electric Utility's system only. Protection of the generation
equipment is the responsibility of the generation equipment owner.
      (3)   Various protective relaying functions are required for any
arrangement that involves a closed transition or parallel operation of the
generating unit with Luverne Municipal Electric Utility's system. The following
are the minimum protective functions that must be present on the utility
tiebreaker looking out onto Luverne Municipal Electric Utility's system.
         (a)   Phase over-current protection.
         (b)   Over-voltage protection.
         (c)   Under-voltage protection.
         (d)   Over-frequency protection.
         (e)   Under-frequency protection.
         (f)   Ground-fault protection.
         (g)   Reverse-power protection.
      (4)   Many of the above functions can be incorporated into a multi-
function electronic relay. For all installations over 40 kW of nameplate-
generated capacity, the relays must be utility grade (not industrial grade).
Proposed equipment must be approved by Luverne Municipal Electric Utility.
   (E)   Auxiliary equipment. Luverne Municipal Electric Utility will review
the proposed installation, and determine if modifications to its equipment are
necessary. If Luverne Municipal Electric Utility determines that changes to its
equipment are required to accommodate the distributed generation equipment, the
changes will be made by Luverne Municipal Electric Utility, with all or part of
the cost assessed to the customer. Luverne Municipal Electric Utility will
provide an estimate of the cost prior to proceeding.
(Ord. 18, Fourth Series, effective 6-24-2021)
§ 55.77 STANDARD FOR TRANSFORMER PADS FOR TRANSFORMERS 75 TO 500 KVA.
   This is the generic standard Luverne Municipal Electric Utility uses for
transformer pads for transformers 75 to 500 KVA. You must verify the actual
transformer footprint that will be used by Luverne Municipal Electric Utility
prior to pouring.

§ 56.01 STATE LAW.
   Pursuant to M.S. § 444.075, as it may be amended from time to time, the city
establishes a storm water drainage utility and authorizes the imposition of
just and reasonable charges for the use and availability of storm sewer
facilities.
(Prior Code, § 3.24)
§ 56.02 FINDINGS AND DETERMINATIONS.
   (A)   In the exercise of its governmental authority and in order to promote
the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare, the city has
constructed, operated and maintained a storm sewer system (“the system”). This
chapter is adopted in the further exercise of the authority and for the same
purposes.
   (B)   The system, as constructed, heretofore has been financed and paid for
through the imposition of special assessments and ad valorem taxes. It is now
necessary and desirable to provide an alternative method of recovering some or
all of the future costs and improving, maintaining and operating the system
through the imposition of charges as provided in this chapter.
   (C)   In imposing charges, it is necessary to establish a methodology that
undertakes to make them just and equitable. Taking into account the status of
completion of the system, past methods of recovering system costs, the
topography of the city and other relevant factors, it is determined that it
would be just and equitable to assign responsibility for some or all of the
future costs of operating, maintaining and improving the system on the basis of
the expected storm water run-off from the various parcels of land within the
city during a standard rainfall event. For the purposes of this chapter, a
STANDARD RAINFALL EVENT is defined as the 100-year storm of one-day duration.
It is assumed that there is five times as much run-off from impervious land as
land covered with vegetation for the standard rainfall event.
   (D)   (1)   Assigning costs and making charges based upon expected typical
storm water run-off cannot be done with mathematical precision, but can only be
accomplished within reasonable and practical limits.
      (2)   The provisions of this chapter undertake to establish a reasonable
and practical methodology for making the charges.
(Prior Code, § 3.24)
§ 56.03 RATES AND CHARGES.
   (A)   Residential equivalent factor.
      (1)   Rates and charges for the use and availability of the system shall
be determined through the use of a “residential equivalent factor” (“REF”).
      (2)   For the purposes of this chapter, one REF is defined as the ratio
of the average volume of surface water run-off coming from one acre of land and
subjected to a particular use, to the average volume of run-off coming from one
acre of land subjected to typical single-family residential use within the city
during a standard rainfall event.
   (B)   Storm water drainage charges.
      (1)   In determining charges, the City Council shall by resolution
establish a basic system rate to be charged against one acre of land having an
REF of one. The charge to be made against each parcel of land shall then be
determined by multiplying the REF for the parcel’s land use classification
times the parcel’s acreage times the basic system rate. The REFs for the
following land uses within the city and the billing classifications for the
land uses are as follows:
Classification Land Uses REF
Classification Land Uses                                                 REF
1              Cemeteries, parks, golf courses                           0.50
2              Single-family and and each unit in a twin home            1.00
3              Public and private schools and institutional uses         1.30
4              Multiple-family residential and churches                  1.70
5              Commercial                                                2.30
6              Farm land (tillable and pasture)                          0.10
               Undeveloped land in the 100-year flood fringe or floodway
7              zones, or sloughs, ponds and the like without drainage    0.00
               outlet
8              Industrial - sites with more than 500,000 square feet of  3.20
               impervious surface area
 
      (2)   For the purpose of calculating storm water drainage charges, all
developed single-family and duplex parcels shall be considered to have an
acreage of one-third acre per unit. Double bungalows or duplexes shall be
considered to be two units. Farmsteads with accessory structures and out
buildings shall be classed in the single-family/duplex residential class and
considered to have an acreage of two-thirds acre per dwelling unit, plus any
other land at its REF classification.
(Prior Code, §3.24) (Ord. 135, Third Series, effective 7-23-1992; Ord. 139,
Third Series, effective 11-19-1992)
§ 56.04 OTHER LAND USES.
   (A)   Other land uses not listed in the foregoing table shall be classified
by the City Administrator in consultation with the City Engineer by assigning
them to classes most nearly like the listed uses, from the standpoint of run-
off volume for the standard rainfall event.
   (B)   An appeal from the City Engineer’s determination of the property
classification may be made to the City Council.
(Prior Code, §3.24)
§ 56.05 ADJUSTMENT OF CHARGES.
   (A)   The City Council may, by resolution, adopt policies providing for the
adjustment of charges for parcels or groups of parcels, based upon land use
data supplied by affected property owners, which data demonstrates a run-off
volume for the standard rainfall event substantially different from the REF
being used for the parcel or parcels.
   (B)   The adjustment shall be made only upon recommendation of the City
Engineer and shall not be made effective retroactively.
(Prior Code, §3.24)
§ 56.06 EXEMPTIONS.
   Public street rights-of-way are exempt from storm water drainage charges.
(Prior Code, §3.24)
§ 56.07 PAYMENT OF CHARGE AND TAX LIEN.
   Storm water utility bills shall be paid in conjunction with other municipal
utility charges and in accordance with the provisions of the City Charter and
this chapter. Notwithstanding any other provision of city code, storm water
drainage fees are specifically found to benefit the property so billed and
served and shall constitute a lien thereon until paid. Past due fees may be
certified to the County Auditor for collection with the real estate taxes in
the following year pursuant to the City Charter and M.S. §444.075, subd. 3, as
it may be amended from time to time. In addition, the city shall have the right
to bring a civil action or to take other legal remedies to collect unpaid
charges.
(Prior Code, §3.24)
§ 56.08 RECALCULATION OF CHARGES.
   If the property owner or person responsible for paying the storm water
drainage charge questions the correctness of such a charge, the person may have
the determination of the charge recomputed by written request to the City
Administrator. The request shall be made within 30 days of the mailing of the
billing in question.
(Prior Code, §3.24)
§ 56.09 STORM WATER DRAINAGE DISTRICTS.
   The Council may, by resolution, establish storm water drainage districts
within the city and provide for a unique basic system rate for each district
based upon the costs of improving, maintaining and operating the system within
the district. Unless the Council, by resolution, specifically orders otherwise,
funds collected from one district shall not be used in another district;
however, this provision shall not preclude the co-mingling or use of funds for
costs deemed to be common and substantially equivalent to all districts, nor
temporary loans among districts, nor the pledging of revenues from all district
to secure bonds or other indebtedness. All other provisions of this chapter not
in conflict with this section shall apply to each district.

the city may, if it feels that the facilities are adequate and if the owner is
a responsible person, quarantine the animal on the owner’s premises. In this
case, the owner must sign a statement acknowledging the understanding of the
responsibility and assuming the liability that is involved with the quarantine
of the animal that has bitten. The quarantined animal must, at all times, be
available for inspection by the city or its agents during the quarantine
period. At the end of the quarantine period, the animal shall be examined by
the city and, if cleared, the quarantine reflect and, if applicable, reclaimed
by the owner. The owner must pay the expense incurred incident thereto. Any

showing active signs of rabies, suspected of having rabies or known to have
been exposed to rabies, shall be confined under competent observation of a
licensed veterinarian for such time as may be deemed necessary to determine a
diagnosis. Any animal that has bitten or attacked that cannot be captured may
be destroyed in a manner that the head is not damaged and can be submitted for

tranquilizer guns fail and the animal remains running at large. All animals
seized and impounded shall be held for an observation period of not less than
ten days and may be claimed by the owner after examination and clearance by a
licensed veterinarian certifying that the animal is free from rabies. The cost
of the maintenance and examination must be paid prior to release by the owner.
Any animal not claimed shall be kept for an additional five calendar days and
may be disposed of as provided under the provisions of this section.

other manner treat any animal in a cruel or inhumane manner.

insects; however, the placement of the poison shall be in areas which are
inaccessible to domesticated animals.

it to defecate on any public or private property other than that owned by the
owner or attendant or under his or her direct control and with consent of the
owner; or to permit any accumulation thereof on the owner or attendant’s
property. If the animal does defecate on public or private property in
violation of the provisions of this division (G), it shall not be a violation
of the provisions herein if the owner or attendant shall immediately and
thoroughly clean up and remove the fecal material from the property and
properly dispose of it in a manner permitted by law.
   (H)   It is unlawful for any person to abandon or set loose any animal owned
or controlled by the person.

§ 91.20 DUTIES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT.
   The City Administrator or his or her designees shall enforce the provisions
relating to nuisances affecting public health, peace and safety. The law
enforcement officials shall enforce provisions relating to nuisances affecting
morals and decency and shall assist the City Administrator or his or her
designees in the enforcement of health, peace, safety and other nuisances. The
officers shall have the power to inspect private premises and take all
reasonable precautions to prevent the commission and maintenance of public
nuisances.
(Prior Code, § 10.56)
§ 91.21 ABATEMENT.
   Whenever the officer charged with enforcement determines that a public
nuisance is being maintained or exists on premises in the city, the officer
shall notify in writing the owner or occupant of the premises of the fact and
shall order that the nuisance be terminated and abated. The notice shall be
served in person or by certified mail. If the premises are not occupied and the
owner is unknown, the notice may be served by posting it on the premises. The
notice shall specify the steps to be taken to abate the nuisance and the time,
not exceeding 30 days, within which the nuisance is to be abated. If the notice
is not complied with within the time specified, the enforcing officer shall
report the fact forthwith to the City Administrator who shall schedule a
hearing before the Council and give notice thereof to the owner or occupant.
Thereafter, the Council may, after the owner or occupant has an opportunity to
be heard or fails to appear, provide for abating the nuisance by the city. The
notice shall be served in the same manner as notice by the enforcing officer is
served and shall be given at least ten days before the date stated in the
notice when the Council will consider the matter. If notice is given by
posting, at least 30 days shall elapse between the day of posting the notice
and the hearing.
(Prior Code, § 10.56)
§ 91.22 EMERGENCY PROCEDURE; SUMMARY ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   In cases where delay in abatement caused by the notice and procedure
requirements set forth in §
91.21 of this chapter will permit a continuing nuisance to unreasonably
endanger public health, safety or welfare, the City Administrator may order
summary enforcement and abate the nuisance. To proceed with summary
enforcement, the officer charged with enforcement shall determine that a public
nuisance exists or is being maintained on premises in the city and that delay
in abatement of the nuisance will unreasonably endanger public health, safety
or welfare. The enforcement officer shall notify in writing the occupant or
owner of the premises of the nature of the nuisance and of the city’s intention
to seek summary enforcement and the time and place of a meeting with the City
Administrator to consider the question of summary enforcement. The City
Administrator shall determine whether or not the condition identified in the
notice to the owner or occupant is a nuisance, whether public health, safety or
welfare will be unreasonably endangered by delay in abatement required to
complete the procedure set forth in §
91.21 of this chapter and may order that the nuisance be immediately terminated
or abated. If the nuisance is not immediately terminated or abated, the City
Administrator may order summary enforcement and abate the nuisance.
   (B)   Removal of ice/snow, grass and noxious weeds.
      (1)   Declared a hazard. The Council hereby finds that the removal of
snow and ice from public sidewalks, grass and noxious weed mowing will
unreasonably endanger the public health, safety and welfare and that summary
enforcement shall be ordered by the officer charged with enforcement.
      (2)   Abatement. The city may cause to be served upon the owner of the
property upon which such nuisance exists, by registered or certified mail, or
by posting on the premises, a notice ordering such owner to remove the nuisance
within 36 hours after the time of the notice, and stating that in the event the
owner does not comply with such order, the necessary work may be performed or
caused to be performed by the city at the expense of the owner, and that if the
owner does not pay for such expense, the cost of the work will be assessed
against the property benefitted.
(Prior Code, § 10.56) (Ord. 37, Fourth Series, effective 8-24-2023)
§ 91.23 IMMEDIATE ABATEMENT.
   Nothing in this subchapter shall prevent the city, without notice or other
process, from immediately abating any condition which poses an imminent and
serious hazard to human life or safety.
(Prior Code, § 10.56)
§ 91.24 RECOVERY OF COST; PERSONAL LIABILITY.
   The owner of premises on which a nuisance has been abated by the city shall
be personally liable for the cost to the city of the abatement, including
administrative costs. As soon as the work has been completed and cost
determined, the Finance Director or other designated city employee shall
prepare a bill for the cost and mail it to the owner. Thereupon, the amount
shall be immediately due and payable.
(Prior Code, § 10.56)
§ 91.25 ASSESSMENT.
   Any unpaid charges by the city for the cost of elimination of the nuisance
may be collected as a special assessment pursuant to city code.
(Prior Code, § 10.56)
§ 91.26 ADDITIONAL REMEDIES.
   The provision of this subchapter shall not be the exclusive remedy for
abating nuisances, but the city may proceed as the city deems appropriate by
seeking an injunction or other order from a court of competent jurisdiction
requiring abatement, or under any other applicable statutory or city code
provision, or under applicable common law. The filing of criminal charges shall
not prohibit, void or nullify any abatement proceedings or alter any other
remedy available to the city, nor shall the commencement or completing of
abatement proceedings prohibit the filing of criminal charges or conviction
thereof.
(Prior Code, § 10.56) (Ord. 107, Third Series, effective 5-2-1991)
§ 91.27 MANAGED NATURAL LAWN AREA.
   (A)   Intent. The City Council determines some residents' desire to use
portions of lawns on residential parcels for the planting of native vegetation,
which can grow to a height of greater than six inches. The Council finds these
types of plantings may preserve, restore, or maintain natural plants and may
utilize environmentally sound practices. As guidance for the community, this
change in vegetation and lawn use must be properly planned, managed, and
maintained. The transition period must be minimized, or the property is likely
to create a public nuisance and shall be abated.
   (B)   Definitions.
      MANAGED NATURAL LAWN AREA. A planned, intentional, and maintained
planting of native vegetation that is free from noxious weeds as defined by the
Minnesota Department of Natural Resources and may exceed six inches in length.
      NATIVE VEGETATION. Ferns, wildflowers, grasses, sedges, rushes, shrubs,
vines, and forbs that are native to the State of Minnesota ecological section
222 (Minnesota and Northeast Iowa Morainal Section), subsection 251Ba
(Minnesota River Prairie), and subsection 222Mb (Big Woods) as defined by the
Minnesota Department of Natural Resources and that can be found in the
Minnesota Department  of Natural Resources Native Plant Encyclopedia.
      TURF GRASSES. Bluegrass, fescue, and ryegrass blends with non-woody
vegetation interspersed with them, commonly used in regularly cut lawns.
   (C)   Applicability.
      (1)   Residential zoning districts.
      (2)   Managed natural lawn area, as defined in division (B) above, is a
term used to describe a variety of lawn management practices that include but
are not limited to natural lawns, natural landscapes, native lawns, pollinator
gardens, rain gardens, meadow vegetation, native prairie, prairie gardens,
monarch waystations, native plantings, native gardens, and butterfly habitat.
   (D)   Requirements.
      (1)   Any owner of a residential lot in the city may transition an area
of lawn on the lot to a managed natural lawn area not to exceed 30% of the
pervious surface area within the defined setbacks of the lot.
      (2)   A managed natural lawn area may include native vegetation more than
six inches in height and which have gone to seed, may not include any noxious
weeds, must be maintained pursuant to the requirements of this section, and
shall not create a public nuisance.
      (3)   A managed natural lawn area shall not include turf grass lawns left
unattended for the purpose of returning to a natural state.
      (4)   Any managed natural lawn area shall meet the following property-
line setbacks. Corner lots shall have two front setbacks:
         (a)   Front - ten feet.
         (b)   Sides - five feet.
         (c)   Rear - ten feet.
      (5)   A managed natural lawn area shall be cut at least once annually to
a height no greater than 12 inches, and at no time be allowed to grow to a
height of more than 60 inches.
      (6)   When establishing a managed natural lawn area, turf grass and/or
other existing vegetation shall be eliminated, and native vegetation shall be
planted through transplanting or seeding by human or mechanical means. Soil
erosion should be controlled while the ground is bare of plant growth that is
sufficient to inhibit erosion and is the sole responsibility of the owner or
occupant.
      (7)   Properties with a managed natural lawn area must be free of blight,
and blighting factors, free of public nuisances, and other areas of the lawn
must be properly maintained in accordance with the City Code.
      (8)   Managed natural lawn areas shall not be located within any drainage
utility easement, public right-of-way, or within three feet to any driveway or
parking areas.
      (9)   Managed natural lawn areas shall not be located within 20 feet of a
road intersection unless the height of the plantings within 20 feet of an
intersection does not exceed 12 inches in height.
      (10)   At no time shall a managed natural lawn area interfere with
motorists' views of the street or roadway.
   (E)   Failure to maintain.
      (1)   If a property owner chooses to install a managed natural lawn area,
and it is determined by the Weed Inspector that the area fails to meet the
definition and requirements of a managed natural lawn area as defined in
divisions (B) through (D) above, it shall be considered prima facie evidence of
the failure of the owner and occupant to comply with this section.
      (2)   The city may then proceed as follows:
         (a)   Concerning public rights-of-way, the Weed Inspector or his/her
designee shall provide written notice to the property owner, advising such
owner or occupant that the managed natural lawn area must be removed within
five days. If the owner fails to remove the managed natural lawn area, then the
city shall perform the necessary work to remove the managed natural lawn area,
keeping an accurate account of the cost. The cost shall be assessed to the
abutting private property in conformance with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   Concerning private property, the Weed Inspector or his/her
designee shall provide written notice to the property owner advising such owner
that the managed natural lawn area must be brought into compliance with the
requirements of this section within 14 days of receipt of the letter. Such
notice shall also advise the owner that the city shall perform such work, with
the presumed consent of the owner, if the owner fails to bring the managed
natural lawn area into compliance with the requirements of this section. If
city employees are utilized to cut the managed natural lawn area, an accurate
account of the time and charges shall be maintained. Such costs shall be
assessed to the benefitted property in conformance with the provisions of this
chapter.

SHADE TREE DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION
§ 91.40 SHADE TREE PEST CONTROL.
   (A)   Declaration of policy. The health of the trees in the city is
threatened by shade tree pests, and the loss or ill health of trees growing
upon public and private property substantially depreciates the value of
property within the city and impairs the safety, good order, general welfare
and convenience of the public. In addition to and in accordance with M.S. §§
89.001, 89.01, and 89.51 to 89.64, as they may be amended from time to time,
the provisions of this section are adopted as an effort to control and prevent
the spread of these shade tree pests.
   (B)   Jurisdiction. The city shall have control of all street trees, shrubs,
and other plantings now or hereafter in any street, park, public right-of-way
or easement, or other public place within the city limits, and shall have the
power to plant, care for, maintain, remove, and replace such trees, shrubs, and
other plantings.
   (C)   Declaration of a shade tree pest. The Council may by ordinance declare
any vertebrate or invertebrate animal, plant pathogen, or plant in the
community threatening to cause significant damage to a shade tree or community
forest, as defined by M.S. § 89.001, as it may be amended from time to time, to
be a shade tree pest and prescribe control measures to effectively eradicate,
control, or manage the shade tree pest, including necessary timelines for
action.
   (D)   Public nuisances defined. A shade tree pest, as defined by § 94.41
occurring within a defined control zone is a public nuisance.
   (E)   Shade tree pest nuisances are unlawful. It is unlawful for any person
to permit any public nuisance as defined in this section to remain on any
premises the person owns or controls within the city. The nuisance may be
abated as provided in this section.
   (F)   Tree Inspector. The Council may appoint a tree inspector to coordinate
the activities of the city relating to the control and prevention of damage by
shade tree pests. The Tree Inspector will recommend to the Council the details
of any program for the declaration, control, and prevention of shade tree
pests. The Tree Inspector is authorized to enforce or cause to be enforced the
tasks incident to such a program adopted by the Council. The term “tree
inspector” includes any person designated by Council or the Tree Inspector to
carry out activities authorized in this section.
   (G)   Abatement of shade tree pest nuisances. In abating a nuisance, defined
by ordinance under division (C), the organism, condition, plant, tree, wood, or
material identified as injurious to the health of shade trees shall be removed
or effectively treated so as to destroy and prevent as fully as possible the
spread of the shade tree pest. Such abatement procedures shall be carried out
in accordance with the control measures and areas prescribed by §
91.41.
   (H)   Reporting discovery of shade tree pest. Any owner or occupier of land
or any person engaged in tree trimming or removal who becomes aware of the
existence of a public nuisance caused by a shade tree pest as defined under
division (C) shall report the same to the city.
   (I)   Registration of tree care firms. Any person, firm, or corporation that
provides tree care, tree trimming, or removal of trees, limbs, branches, brush,
or shrubs for hire must be registered with the Minnesota Commissioner of
Agriculture under M.S. § 18G.07, as it may be amended from time to time.
   (J)   Inspection and application of control measures.
      (1)   The Tree Inspector is authorized to inspect premises and places
within the city to determine whether shade tree pests exist thereon and to
investigate all reported incidents of shade tree pests. The Tree Inspector is
authorized to take all reasonable measures to prevent the maintenance of public
nuisances and may enforce the provisions relating to abatement in this section.
Diagnosis of shade tree pests may be by the presence of commonly recognized
symptoms; by tests as may be recommended by the commissioner of the Minnesota
Department of Agriculture or the commissioner of the Minnesota Department of
Natural Resources; or other reliable means.
      (2)   Except in situations of imminent danger to human life and safety,
the Tree Inspector shall not enter private property for the purpose of
inspecting or preventing maintenance of public nuisances without the permission
of the owner, resident, or other person in control of the property, unless the
Tree Inspector has obtained a warrant or order from a court of competent
jurisdiction authorizing the entry.
      (3)   No person, firm, or corporation shall interfere with the Tree
Inspector or with anyone acting under the Tree Inspector's authority while
engaged in activities authorized by this section.
   (K)   Standard abatement procedure. Except as provided in divisions (L) and
(N), whenever a Tree Inspector determines with reasonable certainty that a
public nuisance, as described by this chapter, is being maintained or exists on
premises in the city, the Tree Inspector is authorized to abate a public
nuisance according to the procedures in this section.
      (1)   The Tree Inspector will notify in writing the owner of record of
the premises that a public nuisance exists and order that the nuisance be
terminated or abated. The notice may be given in person or by mail. Failure of
any party to receive the mail does not invalidate the service of the notice. A
copy of the notice shall be filed with the City Clerk.
      (2)   The notice of abatement shall state that unless the public nuisance
is abated by the owner, it will be abated by the city at the expense of the
owner. The notice shall specify the control measures to be taken to abate the
nuisance, and provide a reasonable amount of time to abate the nuisance. The
notice will also state that the owner has the right to appeal the determination
that a public nuisance exists by submitting a request in writing to the city
clerk within seven days after service of the notice, or before the date by
which abatement must be completed, whichever comes first.
      (3)   If no timely appeal is submitted, and the control measures
prescribed in the notice of abatement are not complied with within the time
provided by the notice or any additional time granted, the Tree Inspector or
designated person shall have the authority to obtain permission or an
administrative search warrant, enter the property, and carry out abatement in
accordance with the notice of abatement.
   (L)   High-cost abatement. If the Tree Inspector determines that the cost of
abating a nuisance will exceed $5,000 based on a reasonable, good faith
estimate, the written notice referred to in division (K) must provide that if
the nuisance is not abated within the reasonable amount of time provided, the
matter will be referred to the City Council for a hearing. The date, time, and
location of the hearing must be provided in the notice.
   (M)   Appeal procedure. If the City Clerk receives a written request for a
hearing on the question of whether a public nuisance exists, the City Council
shall hold a hearing within 14 calendar days following receipt by the Clerk of
the written request. At least three-days’ notice of the hearing shall be given
to the individual who made the written request for the hearing. The Council may
modify the abatement notice or extend the time by which abatement must be
completed. Each owner, agent of the owner, occupant, and lienholder of the
subject property or properties in attendance, if any, shall be given the
opportunity to present evidence at the hearing. After holding the hearing, the
City Council may issue an order requiring abatement of the nuisance, upon a
majority vote of the City Council present at the hearing.
   (N)   Abatement procedure in event of imminent danger.
      (1)   If the Tree Inspector determines that the danger of infestation to
other shade trees is imminent, and delay in control measures may put public
health, safety, or welfare in immediate danger, the Tree Inspector may provide
for abatement without following divisions (K) or (L). The Tree Inspector must
reasonably attempt to notify the owner of the affected property of the intended
action and the right to appeal the abatement and any cost recovery at the next
regularly scheduled City Council meeting.
      (2)   Nothing in this section shall prevent the city, without notice or
other process, from immediately abating any condition that poses an imminent
and serious hazard to human life or safety.
   (O)   Recovery of cost of abatement; liability and assessment.
      (1)   The owner of premises on which a nuisance has been abated by the
city shall be personally liable for the cost to the city of the abatement,
including administrative costs. As soon as the work has been completed and the
cost determined, the City Clerk or other official shall prepare a bill for the
cost and mail it to the owner. Thereupon the amount shall be immediately due
and payable at the office of the City Clerk.
      (2)   After notice and hearing, as provided in M.S. § 429.061 (which may
be amended from time to time), the city clerk shall, on or before September 1
next following abatement of the nuisance, list the total unpaid charges as well
as other charges for current services to be assessed under M.S. § 429.101, as
it may be amended from time to time, against each separate lot or parcel to
which the charges are attributable. The City Council shall then certify the
charges against the property to the county auditor for collection along with
current taxes the following year or in annual installments as the City Council
may determine in each case.
§ 91.41 DECLARED SHADE TREE PESTS, CONTROL MEASURES, AND CONTROL AREAS.
   (A)   Oak Wilt.
      (1)   Definition. OAK WILT DISEASE is a shade tree pest and is defined as
any living or dead tree, log, firewood, limb, branch, stump, or other portion
of a tree from any species of the genus Quercus existing within the control
area defined that has bark attached and that exceeds three inches in diameter
or ten inches in circumference and contains to any degree any spore or
reproductive structures of the fungus Ceratocystis fagacearum.
      (2)   Control measures. Control measures that may be taken to abate oak
wilt disease are:
         (a)   Installation of a root graft barrier. A root graft barrier can
be ordered installed to prevent the underground spread of oak wilt disease. The
city will mark the location of the root graft barrier. The barrier disrupts
transmission of the fungus within the shared vascular systems of root grafted
trees. The barrier is created by excavating or vibratory plowing a line at
least 42 inches deep between any oak tree infected with oak wilt disease and
each nearby and apparently healthy oak tree within 50 feet of the infected
tree.
         (b)   Removal and disposal of trees.
            1.   On property zoned for residential and commercial use.
               a.   On property that is zoned residential and commercial the
city may mark for removal trees that have the potential to produce spores of
the fungus Ceratocystis fagacearum. After, and in no case before, the
installation of the root graft barrier and no later than May 1 of the year
following infection, all marked trees must be felled. The stump from such
felled trees must not extend more than three inches above the ground or, if
taller, must be completely debarked.
               b.   If, however, after the city prescribes the location for a
root graft barrier, the city determines that installation of the barrier is
impossible because of the presence of pavement or obstructions such as a septic
system or utility line, the city may mark for removal all oak trees whether
living or dead, infected or not and located between an infected tree and the
marked barrier location. These marked trees must be felled and disposed of no
later than May 1 of the year following infection. The stump from such felled
trees must not extend more than three inches above the ground or, if taller,
must be completely debarked.
            2.   On all other property.
               a.   On all other property, the city may mark for removal all
oak trees whether living or dead, infected or not and located between an
infected tree and the marked barrier location. These marked trees must be
felled and disposed of no later than May 1 of the year following infection. The
stump from such felled trees must not extend more than three inches above the
ground or, if taller, must be completely debarked.
               b.   All wood more than three inches in diameter or ten inches
in circumference from such felled trees must be disposed of by burying,
debarking, chipping, or sawing into wane-free lumber, or by splitting into
firewood, stacking the firewood, and immediately covering the woodpile with
unbroken four-mill or thicker plastic sheeting that is sealed into the ground
until October 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
tree was felled, or by burning before May 1 of the year following infection.
Wood chips from infected trees may be stockpiled or immediately used in the
landscape.
      (3)   Control area. The control area for oak wilt disease is defined as
all lands within the boundaries of the city.
   (B)   Emerald Ash Borer.
      (1)   Definition. EMERALD ASH BORER is a shade tree pest and is defined
as an insect that attacks and kills ash trees. The adults are small, iridescent
green beetles that live outside of trees during the summer months. The larvae
are grub- or worm-like and live underneath the bark of ash trees.
      (2)   Control measures. Control measures that may be taken to manage and
abate Emerald Ash Borer are those currently advised by the University of
Minnesota Extension website at http://www.extension.umn.edu/garden/insects/
find/emerald-ash-borer/#management and the Emerald Ash Borer Information
Network at http://www.emeraldashborer.info/resources.php.
      (3)   Control areas. The control area for Emerald Ash Borer is defined as
all lands within the boundaries of the city.
   (C)   Dutch Elm Disease.
      (1)   Definition. DUTCH ELM DISEASE is a shade tree pest and is defined
as a disease of elm trees caused by the fungus Ophiostoma ulmi or Ophiostoma
novo-ulmi, and includes any living or dead tree, log, firewood, limb, branch,
stump, or other portion of a tree from any species of the genus Ulmus existing
within the control area defined that has bark attached and that exceeds three
inches in diameter or ten inches in circumference and could contain bark
beetles or any spore or reproductive structures of the fungus Ophiostoma ulmi
or Ophiostoma novo-ulmi.
      (2)   Control measures. Control measures that may be taken to abate Dutch
elm disease are:
         (a)   Use of fungicide. Fungicides may be effective in preventing
Dutch Elm disease when injected into living trees that do not already show
symptoms of Dutch Elm disease. Fungicide injections on private lands are
optional and, if performed, are at the landowner's expense.
         (b)   Removal and disposal of trees. Prompt removal of diseased trees
or branches reduces breeding sites for elm bark beetles and eliminates the
source of Dutch Elm disease fungus. Trees that wilt before July 15 must be
removed within 20 days of detection. Trees that wilt after July 15 must be
removed by April 1 of the following year. Diseased trees not promptly removed
will be removed by the city at the landowner's expense. Wood may be retained
for use as firewood or saw logs if it is debarked or covered from April 15 to
Oct. 15 with four-mill plastic. The edges of the cover must be buried or sealed
to the ground.
      (3)   Control area. The control area for Dutch elm disease is defined as
all lands within the boundaries of the city.

person, firm, or corporation fails to comply with any provision of this
section, the City Council or any official designated by it may institute
appropriate proceedings at law or at equity to restrain, correct, or abate the
violation.

ensure the integrity of its streets and the appropriate use of the rights-of-
way, the city strives to keep its rights-of-way in a state of good repair and
free from unnecessary encumbrances.
   (B)   Accordingly, the city hereby enacts this new chapter of this code
relating to right-of-way permits and administration. This chapter imposes
reasonable regulation on the placement and maintenance of facilities and
equipment currently within its rights-of-way or to be placed therein at some
future time. It is intended to complement the regulatory roles of state and
federal agencies. Under this chapter, persons excavating and obstructing the
rights-of-way will bear financial responsibility for their work. Finally, this
chapter provides for recovery of out-of-pocket and projected costs from persons
using the public rights-of-way.

   (A)   Timing. The work to be done under the excavation permit, and the
patching and restoration of the right-of-way as required herein, must be
completed within the dates specified in the permit, increased by as many days
as work could not be done because of circumstances beyond the control of the
permittee or when work was prohibited as unseasonal or unreasonable under §
93.17.
   (B)   Patch and restoration. Permittee shall patch its own work. The city
may choose either to have the permittee restore the right-of-way or to restore
the right-of-way itself.
      (1)   City restoration. If the city restores the right-of-way, permittee

patching or restoration performed by permittee or its agents. The permittee
upon notification from the city, shall correct all restoration work to the
extent necessary, using the method required by the city. Said work shall be
completed within five calendar days of the receipt of the notice from the city,
not including days during which work cannot be done because of circumstances
constituting force majeure or days when work is prohibited as unseasonable or
unreasonable under §
93.17.
   (E)   Failure to restore. If the permittee fails to restore the right-of-way
in the manner and to the condition required by the city, or fails to

permittee fails to pay as required, the city may exercise its rights under the
construction performance bond.
§ 93.15 JOINT APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   Joint application. Registrants may jointly apply for permits to
excavate or obstruct the right-of-way at the same place and time.
   (B)   Shared fees. Registrants who apply for permits for the same
obstruction or excavation, which the city does not perform, may share in the
payment of the obstruction or excavation permit fee. In order to obtain a joint
permit, registrants must agree among themselves as to the portion each will pay
and indicate the same on their applications.
   (C)   With city projects. Registrants who join in a scheduled obstruction or
excavation performed by the city, whether or not it is a joint application by
two or more registrants or a single application, are not required to pay the
excavation or obstruction and degradation portions of the permit fee, but a
permit would still be required.
§ 93.16 SUPPLEMENTARY APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   Limitation on area. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the area
of the right-of-way specified in the permit. No permittee may do any work
outside the area specified in the permit, except as provided herein. Any
permittee which determines that an area greater than that specified in the
permit must be obstructed or excavated must before working in that greater area
(i) make application for a permit extension and pay any additional fees
required thereby, and (ii) be granted a new permit or permit extension.
   (B)   Limitation on dates. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the dates
specified in the permit. No permittee may begin its work before the permit
start date or, except as provided herein, continue working after the end date.
If a permittee does not finish the work by the permit end date, it must apply
for a new permit for the additional time it needs, and receive the new permit
or an extension of the old permit before working after the end date of the
previous permit. This supplementary application must be submitted before the
permit end date.
§ 93.17 OTHER OBLIGATIONS.
   (A)   Compliance with other laws. Obtaining a right-of-way permit does not
relieve permittee of its duty to obtain all other necessary permits, licenses,
and authority and to pay all fees required by the city or other applicable
rule, law or regulation. A permittee shall comply with all requirements of
local, state and federal laws, including but not limited to M.S. §§ 216D.01 to
216D.09 (Gopher One Call Excavation Notice System), as it may be amended from
time to time, and Minn. Rules Ch. 7560. A permittee shall perform all work in
conformance with all applicable codes and established rules and regulations,
and is responsible for all work done in the right-of-way pursuant to its
permit, regardless of who does the work.
   (B)   Prohibited work. Except in an emergency, and with the approval of the
city, no right-of-way obstruction or excavation may be done when seasonally
prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable for such work.
   (C)   Interference with right-of-way. A permittee shall not so obstruct a
right-of-way that the natural free and clear passage of water through the
gutters or other waterways shall be interfered with. Private vehicles of those
doing work in the right-of-way may not be parked within or next to a permit
area, unless parked in conformance with city parking regulations. The loading
or unloading of trucks must be done solely within the defined permit area
unless specifically authorized by the permit.
   (D)   Trenchless excavation. As a condition of all applicable permits,
permittees employing trenchless excavation methods, including but not limited
to Horizontal Directional Drilling, shall follow all requirements set forth in
M.S. Ch. 216D, as it may be amended from time to time, and Minn. Rules Ch. 7560
and shall require potholing or open cutting over existing underground utilities
before excavating, as determined by the director.
§ 93.18 DENIAL OR REVOCATION OF PERMIT.
   (A)   Reasons for denial. The city may deny a permit for failure to meet the
requirements and conditions of this chapter or if the city determines that the
denial is necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare or when
necessary to protect the right-of-way and its current use.
   (B)   Procedural requirements. The denial or revocation of a permit must be
made in writing and must document the basis for the denial. The city must
notify the applicant or right-of-way user in writing within three business days
of the decision to deny or revoke a permit. If an application is denied, the
right-of-way user may address the reasons for denial identified by the city and
resubmit its application. If the application is resubmitted within 30 days of
receipt of the notice of denial, no additional application fee shall be
imposed. The city must approve or deny the resubmitted application within 30
days after submission.
§ 93.19 INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS.
   The excavation, backfilling, patching and restoration, and all other work
performed in the right-of-way shall be done in conformance with Minn. Rules
parts 7819.1100 and 7819.5000 and other applicable local requirements, in so
far as they are not inconsistent with the M.S. §§ 237.162 and 237.163, as they
may be amended from time to time. Installation of service laterals shall be
performed in accordance with Minn. Rules Ch. 7560 and these ordinances. Service
lateral installation is further subject to those requirements and conditions
set forth by the city in the applicable permits and/or agreements referenced in
§
93.24(B).
§ 93.20 INSPECTION.
   (A)   Notice of completion. When the work under any permit hereunder is
completed, the permittee shall furnish a completion certificate in accordance
Minn. Rule part 7819.1300.
   (B)   Site inspection. Permittee shall make the work-site available to the
city and to all others as authorized by law for inspection at all reasonable
times during the execution of and upon completion of the work.
   (C)   Authority of director.
      (1)   At the time of inspection, the director may order the immediate
cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the life, health, safety
or well-being of the public.
      (2)   The director may issue an order to the permittee for any work that
does not conform to the terms of the permit or other applicable standards,
conditions, or codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the
violation will be cause for revocation of the permit. Within ten ten days after
issuance of the order, the permittee shall present proof to the director that
the violation has been corrected. If such proof has not been presented within
the required time, the director may revoke the permit pursuant to §
93.23.
§ 93.21 WORK DONE WITHOUT A PERMIT.
   (A)   Emergency situations.
      (1)   Each registrant shall immediately notify the director of any event
regarding its facilities that it considers to be an emergency. The registrant
may proceed to take whatever actions are necessary to respond to the emergency.
Excavators' notification to Gopher State One Call regarding an emergency
situation does not fulfill this requirement. Within two business days after the
occurrence of the emergency, the registrant shall apply for the necessary
permits, pay the fees associated therewith, and fulfill the rest of the
requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with this chapter for
the actions it took in response to the emergency.
      (2)   If the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding a registrant's
facilities, the city will attempt to contact the local representative of each
registrant affected, or potentially affected, by the emergency. In any event,
the city may take whatever action it deems necessary to respond to the
emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the registrant whose facilities
occasioned the emergency.
   (B)   Non-emergency situations. Except in an emergency, any person who,
without first having obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or excavates a
right-of-way must subsequently obtain a permit and, as a penalty, pay double
the normal fee for said permit, pay double all the other fees required by the
city code, deposit with the city the fees necessary to correct any damage to
the right-of-way, and comply with all of the requirements of this chapter.
§ 93.22 SUPPLEMENTARY NOTIFICATION.
   If the obstruction or excavation of the right-of-way begins later or ends
sooner than the date given on the permit, permittee shall notify the city of
the accurate information as soon as this information is known.
§ 93.23 REVOCATION OF PERMITS.
   (A)   Substantial breach. The city reserves its right, as provided herein,
to revoke any right-of-way permit without a fee refund, if there is a
substantial breach of the terms and conditions of any statute, ordinance, rule
or regulation, or any material condition of the permit. A substantial breach by
permittee shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following:
      (1)   The violation of any material provision of the right-of-way permit;
      (2)   An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the right-
of-way permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit
upon the city or its citizens;
      (3)   Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a
right-of-way permit;
      (4)   The failure to complete the work in a timely manner, unless a
permit extension is obtained or unless the failure to complete work is due to
reasons beyond the permittee's control; or
      (5)   The failure to correct, in a timely manner, work that does not
conform to a condition indicated on an order issued pursuant to §
93.20.
   (B)   Written notice of breach. If the city determines that the permittee
has committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any statute,
ordinance, rule, regulation or any condition of the permit, the city shall make
a written demand upon the permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall
state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. A
substantial breach, as stated above, will allow the city, at its discretion, to
place additional or revised conditions on the permit to mitigate and remedy the
breach.
   (C)   Response to notice of breach. Within 24 hours of receiving
notification of the breach, permittee shall provide the city with a plan,
acceptable to the city, that will cure the breach. Permittee's failure to so
contact the city, or permittee's failure to timely submit an acceptable plan,
or permittee's failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be
cause for immediate revocation of the permit. Further, permittee's failure to
so contact the city, or permittee's failure to submit an acceptable plan, or
permittee's failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall
automatically place the permittee on probation for one full year.
   (D)   Cause for probation. From time to time, the city may establish a list
of conditions of the permit, which if breached will automatically place the
permittee on probation for one full year, such as, but not limited to, working
out of the allotted time period or working on right-of-way grossly outside of
the permit authorization.
   (E)   Automatic revocation. If a permittee, while on probation, commits a
breach as outlined above, permittee's permit will automatically be revoked and
permittee will not be allowed further permits for one full year, except for
emergency repairs.
   (F)   Reimbursement of city costs. If a permit is revoked, the permittee
shall also reimburse the city for the city's reasonable costs, including
restoration costs and the costs of collection and reasonable attorneys' fees
incurred in connection with such revocation.
§ 93.24 MAPPING DATA.
   (A)   Information required. Each registrant and permittee shall provide
mapping information required by the city in accordance with Minn. Rules parts
7819.4000 and 7819.4100. Within 90 days following completion of any work
pursuant to a permit, the permittee shall provide the director accurate maps
and drawings certifying the “as-built” location of all equipment installed,
owed and maintained by the permittee. Such maps and drawings shall include the
horizontal and vertical location of all facilities and equipment and shall be
provided consistent with the city's electronic mapping system, when practical
or as a condition imposed by the director. Failure to provide maps and drawings
pursuant to this subsection shall be grounds for revoking the permit holder's
registration.
   (B)   Service laterals. All permits issued for the installation or repair of
service laterals, other than minor repairs as defined in Minn. Rules §
7560.0150 subp. 2, shall require the permittee's use of appropriate means of
establishing the horizontal locations of installed service laterals and the
service lateral vertical locations in those cases where the director reasonably
requires it. Permittees or their subcontractors shall submit to the director
evidence satisfactory to the director of the installed service lateral
locations. Compliance with this division (B) and with applicable Gopher State
One Call law and Minnesota Rules governing service laterals installed after 12-
31-2005 shall be a condition of any city approval necessary for:
      (1)   Payments to contractors working on a public improvement project
including those under M.S. Ch. 429, as it may be amended from time to time; and
      (2)   City approval under development agreements or other subdivision or
site plan approval under M.S. Ch. 462, as it may be amended from time to time.
The director shall reasonably determine the appropriate method of providing
such information to the city. Failure to provide prompt and accurate
information on the service laterals installed may result in the revocation of
the permit issued for the work or future permits to the offending permittee or
its subcontractors.
§ 93.25 LOCATION AND RELOCATION OF FACILITIES.
   (A)   Placement, location, and relocation of facilities must comply with the
Act, with other applicable law, and with Minn. Rules parts 7819.3100, 7819.5000
and 7819.5100, to the extent the rules do not limit authority otherwise
available to cities.
   (B)   Undergrounding. Unless otherwise agreed in a franchise or other
agreement between the applicable right-of-way user and the City, Facilities in
the right-of-way must be located or relocated and maintained underground in
accordance with Chapter 93 of this code.
   (C)   Corridors.
      (1)   The city may assign a specific area within the right-of-way, or any
particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of facilities
that is or, pursuant to current technology, the city expects will someday be
located within the right-of-way. All excavation, obstruction, or other permits
issued by the city involving the installation or replacement of facilities
shall designate the proper corridor for the facilities at issue.
      (2)   Any registrant who has facilities in the right-of-way in a position
at variance with the corridors established by the city shall, no later than at
the time of the next reconstruction or excavation of the area where the
facilities are located, move the facilities to the assigned position within the
right-of-way, unless this requirement is waived by the city for good cause
shown, upon consideration of such factors as the remaining economic life of the
facilities, public safety, customer service needs and hardship to the
registrant.
   (D)   Nuisance. One year after the passage of this chapter, any facilities
found in a right-of-way that have not been registered shall be deemed to be a
nuisance. The city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in
equity, including, but not limited to, abating the nuisance or taking
possession of the facilities and restoring the right-of-way to a useable
condition.
   (E)   Limitation of space. To protect health, safety, and welfare, or when
necessary to protect the right-of-way and its current use, the city shall have
the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional facilities
within the right-of-way. In making such decisions, the city shall strive to the
extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the right-
of-way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the public interest,
the public's needs for the particular utility service, the condition of the
right-of-way, the time of year with respect to essential utilities, the
protection of existing facilities in the right-of-way, and future city plans
for public improvements and development projects which have been determined to
be in the public interest.
§ 93.26 PRE-EXCAVATION FACILITIES LOCATION.
   In addition to complying with the requirements of M.S. §§ 216D.01 to 216D.09
(“One Call Excavation Notice System”), as it may be amended from time to time,
before the start date of any right-of-way excavation, each registrant who has
facilities or equipment in the area to be excavated shall mark the horizontal
and vertical placement of all said facilities. Any registrant whose facilities
are less than 20 inches below a concrete or asphalt surface shall notify and
work closely with the excavation contractor to establish the exact location of
its facilities and the best procedure for excavation.
§ 93.27 DAMAGE TO OTHER FACILITIES.
   When the city does work in the right-of-way and finds it necessary to
maintain, support, or move a registrant's facilities to protect it, the city
shall notify the local representative as early as is reasonably
possible. The costs associated therewith will be billed to that registrant and
must be paid within 30 days from the date of billing. Each registrant shall be
responsible for the cost of repairing any facilities in the right-of-way which
it or its facilities damage. Each registrant shall be responsible for the cost
of repairing any damage to the facilities of another registrant caused during
the city's response to an emergency occasioned by that registrant's facilities.
§ 93.28 RIGHT-OF-WAY VACATION.
   Reservation of right. If the city vacates a right-of-way that contains the
facilities of a registrant, the registrant's rights in the vacated right-of-way
are governed by Minn. Rules parts 7819.3200.
§ 93.29 INDEMNIFICATION AND LIABILITY.
   By registering with the city, or by accepting a permit under this chapter, a
registrant or permittee agrees to defend and indemnify the city in accordance
with the provisions of Minn. Rule part 7819.1250.
§ 93.30 ABANDONED AND UNUSABLE FACILITIES.
   (A)   Discontinued operations. A registrant who has determined to
discontinue all or a portion of its operations in the city must provide
information satisfactory to the city that the registrant's obligations for its
facilities in the right-of-way under this chapter have been lawfully assumed by
another registrant.
   (B)   Removal. Any registrant who has abandoned facilities in any right-of-
way shall remove it from that right-of-way if required in conjunction with
other right-of-way repair, excavation, or construction, unless this requirement
is waived by the city.
§ 93.31 APPEAL.
   A right-of-way user that: (1) has been denied registration; (2) has been
denied a permit; (3) has had a permit revoked; (4) believes that the fees
imposed are not in conformity with M.S. § 237.163, subd. 6, as it may be
amended from time to time; or (5) disputes a determination of the director
regarding §
93.24(B) may have the denial, revocation, fee imposition, or decision reviewed,
upon written request, by the city council. The city council shall act on a
timely written request at its next regularly scheduled meeting, provided the
right-of-way user has submitted its appeal with sufficient time to include the
appeal as a regular agenda item. A decision by the city council affirming the
denial, revocation, or fee imposition will be in writing and supported by
written findings establishing the reasonableness of the decision.

      (1)   Granting. The Council may approve any application for the period of
the remainder of the then current license year or for the entire ensuing
license year. All applications including proposed license periods must be
consistent with this chapter. Prior to consideration of any application for a
license, the applicant shall pay the license fee and, if applicable, pay the
investigation fee. Upon rejection of any application for a license or upon
withdrawal of an application before consideration by the Council, the license
fee shall be refunded to the applicant. Failure to pay any portion of a fee
when due shall be cause for revocation.
      (2)   Issuing. If an application is approved, the City Administrator
shall forthwith issue a license pursuant thereto in the form prescribed by the
city or the Commissioner, as the case may be, and upon payment of the license
fee. All licenses shall be on a calendar year basis unless otherwise specified
herein. For licenses issued and which are to become effective other than on the
first day of the licensed year, the fee to be paid with the application shall
be a pro rata share of the annual license fee. Licenses shall be valid only at
one location and on the premises therein described.
      (3)   Transfer. A license shall be transferable between persons upon
consent of the Council and payment of the investigation fee. No license shall
be transferable to a different location without prior consent of the Council
and payment of the fee for a duplicate license. It is unlawful to make any
transfer in violation of this division (D)(3).
      (4)   Refusal and termination. The Council may, in its sole discretion
and for any reasonable cause, refuse to grant any application. No license shall
be granted to a person of questionable moral character or business reputation.
Licenses shall terminate only by expiration or revocation.
      (5)   Public interest. No license under this chapter may be issued,
transferred or renewed if the results of any investigation show, to the
satisfaction of the Council, that the issuance, transfer or renewal would not
be in the public interest.
      (6)   Revocation or suspension. The Council shall revoke or suspend, for
a period not to exceed 60 days, a license granted under the provisions of this
chapter, or impose a civil fine not to exceed $2,000, for each violation on a
finding that the licensee has failed to comply with a statute, regulation or
provision of the city code relating to alcoholic beverages and/or drugs or
controlled substances. If it shall be made to appear at the hearing thereon
that the violation was not willful, the Council may order suspension; provided
that, revocation shall be ordered upon the third violation or offense. No
suspension or revocation shall take effect until the licensee has been afforded
an opportunity for a hearing before the Council, a committee of the Council or
a hearing under the Administrative Procedures Act, being M.S. §§ 14.001 to
14.69, as they may be amended from time to time, or may be determined by the
Council in action calling the hearing. The hearing shall be called by the
Council upon written notice to the licensee, served in person or by certified
mail, not less than 15, or more than 30, days prior to the hearing date,
stating the time, place and purpose thereof. As additional restrictions or
regulations on licensees under this chapter, city code or statute, the
following shall also be grounds for the action:
         (a)   The licensee suffered or permitted illegal acts upon licensed
premises unrelated to the sale of beer, wine, liquor, drugs or controlled
substances;
         (b)   The licensee had knowledge of the illegal acts upon licenses
premises, but failed to report the same to law enforcement;
         (c)   The licensee failed or refused to cooperate fully with law
enforcement in investigating the alleged illegal acts upon licensed premises;
or
         (d)   The activities of the licensee created a serious danger to
public health, safety or welfare.
      (7)   Corporate applicants and licensees. A corporate applicant, at the
time of application, shall furnish the city with a list of all persons that
have an interest in the corporation and the extent of the interest. The list
shall name all shareholders and show the number of shares held by each, either
individually or beneficially for others. It is the duty of each corporate
licensee to notify the City Administrator in writing of any change in legal
ownership, or beneficial interest in the corporation or in the shares. Any
change in the ownership or beneficial interest in the shares entitled to be
voted at a meeting of the shareholders of a corporate licensee, which results
in the change of voting control of the corporation by the persons owning the
shares therein, shall be deemed equivalent to a transfer of the license issued
to the corporation, and any license shall be revoked 30 days after any change
in ownership or beneficial interest of shares unless the Council has been
notified of the change in writing and has approved it by appropriate action.
The Council, or any officer of the city designated by it, may at any reasonable
time examine the stock transfer records and minute books of any corporate
licensee in order to verify and identify the shareholders, and the Council or
its designated officer may examine the business records of any other licensee
to the extent necessary to disclose the interest which persons other than the
licensee have in the licensed business. The Council may revoke any license
issued upon its determination that a change of ownership of shares in a
corporate licensee or any change of ownership of any interest in the business
of any other licensee has actually resulted in the change of control of the
licensed business so as materially to affect the integrity and character of its
management and its operation, but no such action shall be taken until after a
hearing by the Council on notice to the licensee.
   (E)   Duplicate licenses. Duplicates of all original licenses under this
chapter may be issued by the City Administrator without action by the Council,
upon licensee’s affidavit that the original has been lost, and upon payment of
a fee of $20 for issuance of the duplicate. All duplicate licenses shall be
clearly marked “DUPLICATE”.
   (F)   Posting. All licensees shall conspicuously post their licenses in
their places of business.
   (G)   Resident manager or agent.
      (1)   Before a license is issued or renewed to an individual who is not a
resident of the county, to more than one individual whether or not they are
residents of the county, or to a corporation, partnership or association, the
applicant or applicants shall appoint in writing an individual person who is a
resident of the county as its manager or agent. The resident manager or agent
shall, by the terms of the appointment:
         (a)   Take full responsibility for the conduct of the licensed
premises; and
         (b)   Serve as agent for service of notices and other process relating
to the license.
      (2)   The manager or agent must be a person who, by reason of age,
character, reputation and other attributes, could qualify individually as a
licensee. If the manager or agent ceases to be a resident of the county or
ceases to act in the capacity for the licensee without appointment of a
successor, the license issued pursuant to the appointment shall be
automatically suspended by the City Administrator and subject to permanent
revocation by the Council. The suspension shall remain in effect for up to 60
days until a new resident manager is appointed, background investigated,
approved by the Council, and appropriate investigative fees paid. For the
purposes of this division (G)(2), the term RESIDENT means a bona fide resident
who qualifies to vote and has a residence which, if owned by the manager or
agent, could be homesteaded for real estate tax purposes.
   (H)   Persons disqualified.
      (1)   No license under this chapter may be issued to:
         (a)   A person not a citizen of the United States or a resident alien;
         (b)   A person who within five years of the license application has
been convicted of a willful violation of a federal or state law, or local
ordinance governing the manufacture, sale, distribution or possession for sale
or distribution, of alcoholic beverages;
         (c)   A person who has had an alcoholic beverage license revoked
within five years of the license application, or to any person who at the time
of the violation owns any interest, whether as a holder of more than 5% of the
capital stock of a corporate licensee, as a partner or otherwise, in the
premises or in the business conducted thereon, or to a corporation,
partnership, association, enterprise, business or firm in which any person is
in any manner interested;
         (d)   A person under the age of 21 years;
         (e)   A person not of good moral character and repute; or
         (f)   A person who, within five years of the license application, has
been convicted of a willful violation of any federal or state law, or local
ordinance, governing the manufacture, sale, distribution or possession of any
drug or controlled substance.
      (2)   No person holding a license from the Commissioner as a
manufacturer, brewer or wholesaler may have a direct or indirect interest, in
whole or in part, in a business holding an alcoholic beverage license from the
city.

§ 111.016 APPLICANTS FOR CITY LICENSES.

criminal history information for specified non-criminal purposes of licensing
background checks.
   (B)   Criminal history license background investigations. The County
Sheriff’s Department is hereby required, as the exclusive entity within the
city, to do a criminal history background investigation on the applicants for
the following licenses within the city: beer; wine; and liquor licenses.
      (1)   In conducting the criminal history background investigation in
order to screen license applicants, the County Sheriff’s Department is
authorized to access data maintained in the state’s Bureau of Criminal
Apprehensions computerized criminal history information system in accordance
with BCA policy. Any data that is accessed and acquired shall be maintained at
the County Sheriff’s Department under the care and custody of the chief law
enforcement official or his or her designee. A summary of the results of the
computerized criminal history data may be released by the County Sheriff’s
Department to the licensing authority, including the City Council, the City
Administrator or the designee.
      (2)   Before the investigation is undertaken, the applicant must
authorize the County Sheriff’s Department by written consent to undertake the
investigation. The written consent must fully comply with the provisions of
M.S. Ch. 13, as it may be amended from time to time, regarding the collection,
maintenance and use of the information. Except for the positions set forth in
M.S. § 364.09, as it may be amended from time to time, the city will not reject
an applicant for a license on the basis of the applicant’s prior conviction
unless the crime is directly related to the license sought and the conviction
is for a felony, gross misdemeanor or misdemeanor with a jail sentence. If the
city rejects the applicant’s request on this basis, the city shall notify the
applicant in writing of the following:
         (a)   The grounds and reasons for the denial;
         (b)   The applicant complaint and grievance procedure set forth in
M.S. § 364.06, as it may be amended from time to time;

§ 111.017 RENEWAL LICENSE APPLICATIONS.
   Applications for renewal of all licenses under this chapter shall be made at

waived by the Council for good and sufficient cause.
(Prior Code, § 5.03)
§ 111.018 DELINQUENT TAXES AND CHARGES.
   No license under this chapter shall be granted for operation on any premises
upon which taxes, assessments or installments thereof, or other financial
claims of the city, are owed and are delinquent and unpaid.
(Prior Code, § 5.04)
§ 111.019 LIMITATION OF OWNERSHIP.
   No person shall be granted liquor licenses at more than one location. For
the purpose of this section, any person owning an interest of 5% or more of the
entity to which the license is issued, or the ownership by a member of his or
her immediate family, shall be deemed to be a licensee.
(Prior Code, § 5.05)
§ 111.020 CONDITIONAL LICENSES.
   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the Council may, upon
a finding of the necessity therefor, place the special conditions and
restrictions, in addition to those stated in this chapter, upon any license as
it, in its discretion, may deem reasonable and justified.
(Prior Code, § 5.06) (Ord. 47, Third Series, effective 3-24-1988)
§ 111.021 PREMISES LICENSED.

   (A)   Proof. Applicants for a new or renewal license shall file with the
City Administrator proof of financial responsibility with regard to the
liability imposed by M.S. § 340A.801, as it may be amended from time to time,
or acts amendatory and supplementary thereto, in the manner and in the amount
sufficient to satisfy the requirements of M.S. § 340A.409, as it may be amended
from time to time, or acts amendatory and supplementary thereto, or such other
insurance as may be required from time to time by the Commissioner of Public
Safety. Any liability insurance policy required by this section must further
provide that no cancellation of the same for any cause can be made either by
the insured or the insurance company without first giving ten days’ written
notice to the city of intention to cancel the same, the notice to be addressed
to the City Administrator. Failure of any licensee to maintain insurance
required under this section throughout the license period shall result in the
immediate suspension of the license for up to 60 days and until such time as
the required insurance is obtained and proof filed with the City Administrator.
Upon the administrative suspension, the Council shall thereafter require the
licensee to show cause why the license should not be revoked. An annual
aggregate of $300,000 may be included in the insurance coverage.
   (B)   Documents submitted to Commissioner. All proofs of financial
responsibility and exemption affidavits filed with the city under this section
shall be submitted by the city to the state’s Commissioner of Public Safety.
   (C)   Insurance requirements. No liquor, 3.2% malt liquor or wine license
may be issued, maintained or renewed unless the applicant demonstrates proof of

the applicant’s proof of financial responsibility. A local government may
require higher insurance or bond coverage or a larger deposit of cash or
securities. An insurer may provide the below coverage in combination with other
insurance coverage. The minimum requirement for proof of financial
responsibility is:
      (1)   A certificate that there is in effect for the license period an
insurance policy issued by an insurer providing at least $50,000 of coverage
because of bodily injury to any one person in any one occurrence, $100,000

occurrence, $50,000 for loss of means of support of any one person in any one
occurrence, $100,000 for loss of means of support of two or more persons in any
one occurrence, $50,000 for other pecuniary loss of any one person in any one
occurrence and $100,000 for other pecuniary loss of two or more persons in any
one occurrence;

property abutting on any street shall cause the grass and weeds to be cut from
the property line of the property nearest to the street to the center of the

inches, it shall be prima facie evidence of a failure to comply with this
division (C).
   (D)   City may order work done. The city may, in cases of failure to comply
with this section, perform the work with employees of the city, keeping an
accurate account of the cost thereof for each lot, piece or parcel of land
abutting upon the street.
   (E)   Assessment. If maintenance work described in the foregoing division
(D) is performed by the city, the City Administrator shall forthwith, upon
completion thereof, ascertain the cost attributable to each lot, piece of
parcel of abutting land. The City Administrator shall, at the next regular

same to the City Administrator with his or her reasons for denial, and the
permit shall not be granted unless all conditions and objections of the chief
law enforcement officer are met or removed by the applicant.

safeguard the safety and welfare of the public, sidewalks shall be constructed
along all arterial and major collector streets. The Council may grant
exceptions to the provisions of this division (B) in the following general
instances; provided, however, that, any such exceptions shall require the
specific finding by the Council that construction of a sidewalk is not
necessary to safeguard the public safety and welfare. Generally, exceptions

continuing sidewalks for at least 500 feet; and
      (7)   Industrial zones where workers generally reach their place of
employment by motor vehicle.
   (C)   Exemptions.
      (1)   New sidewalks shall not be required to be constructed as follows:
         (a)   On any side of local streets unless sidewalk exists on more than
50% of the block and two or more houses abut and face on that side;
         (b)   On any side of minor collector streets unless sidewalk is
required under this section on 50% or more of that side of the two most
adjacent blocks of the same street;
         (c)   Any area contained in an active and improved sidewalk
improvement district or other compact neighborhood with limited access
specifically exempted by resolution adopted by majority vote of the Council;
         (d)   All properties on dead-end streets and cul-de-sacs shall be
exempt from construction of sidewalks unless two or more of the affected
property owner’s petition for installation of sidewalks; and

the following circumstances:
            1.   Nature of terrain;
            2.   Insufficient right-of-way;
            3.   Insurmountable engineering problems;
            4.   Safety hazards that would arise by encouraging pedestrian
traffic in dangerous areas such as along railroad tracks; and
            5.   Specimen healthy trees of three inches and greater in diameter
would be substantially damaged.
      (2)   Upon the request by the property owner, the Council may grant
exemptions to the provisions of this subchapter upon specific finding that
construction of a sidewalk is not necessary to safeguard the public safety and
welfare.
      (3)   The City Administrator is hereby empowered to exempt properties
from the requirement that the sidewalk be constructed with the inside edge one
foot outside the property line when:
         (a)   To avoid taking specimen healthy trees or shrubs that cannot be
moved;
         (b)   Sidewalk alignment within a block would be different from
existing walks within the block;
         (c)   Insufficient right-of-way requires full use of the right-of-way;
and
         (d)   Severe grade problems would result.
      (4)   A lot or lots abut an unimproved (lacking curb and gutter) street
that is expected to be scheduled for improvement at some future date and when a
delay of construction to coincide with street construction would be advisable.
(Prior Code, § 7.09)
§ 151.33 CITY TO CONSTRUCT, RECONSTRUCT AND MAINTAIN SIDEWALKS.
   (A)   General. If required sidewalks are not constructed in accordance with
this subchapter, or whenever the city shall deem it necessary and expedient to

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   This chapter is enacted for the following purposes: to safeguard the best
interests of the city; to assist the subdivider in harmonizing his or her
interests with those of the city at large; to prevent piecemeal planning of
subdivisions, undesirable, disconnected patchwork of pattern and the poor
circulation of traffic; to correlate land subdivisions with the City
Comprehensive Plan, which provides a general plan for future community
development; to secure the rights of the public, with respect to public lands
and waters; to improve land records by establishing standards for surveys and
plats; and to discourage inferior development which might adversely affect
property values. It is the purpose and intent of this chapter to make certain
regulations and requirements for the platting of land within the city pursuant
to the authority contained in M.S. Ch. 429, 462 and 505, as they may be amended
from time to time, which regulations the Council deems necessary for the
health, safety and general welfare of the community.
(Prior Code, § 12.01) (Ord. 102, Third Series, effective 2-21-1991)
§ 152.02 JURISDICTION AND APPLICATION.
   This chapter shall apply to all land now lying within, and hereafter annexed
to, the city, and to unincorporated territory located within two miles of its
limits in any direction as provided by law. Except as herein otherwise
provided, this chapter shall apply to the subdivision of a lot, tract or parcel
of land into two or more lots, tracts or other division of land for any
purpose, whether immediate or future, including the resubdivision,
rearrangement or re-platting of land or lots. This chapter shall further apply
to any parcel of land being subdivided, which includes an existing or future
public right-of-way or easement according to the Comprehensive Plan of the city
that has not been previously dedicated. This chapter shall not apply to the
subdivision or allocation of land as open space for common use by owners,
occupants or leaseholders.
(Prior Code, § 12.01) (Ord. 102, Third Series, effective 2-21-1991)
§ 152.03 PLAT APPROVAL REQUIRED.
   No plat for a subdivision or part thereof within the application of this
chapter shall be prepared, presented for approval or approved, except as
prescribed herein. No such plat or any deed or other conveyance attempting to
convey land required to be platted shall be recorded in the County Recorder’s
office, nor shall it have any validity until the provisions of this chapter are
complied with.
(Prior Code, § 12.01) (Ord. 102, Third Series, effective 2-21-1991)
§ 152.04 RESTRICTIONS ON FILING AND RECORDING CONVEYANCES.
   (A)   After the effective date of this section, no conveyance of land to
which this chapter is applicable shall be filed or recorded if the land is
described in the conveyance by metes and bounds or by reference to an
unapproved registered land survey made after 4-21-1961, or to any unapproved
plat.
   (B)   This section does not apply to a conveyance of land if the land:
      (1)   Was a separate parcel of record on the date of adoption of this
section;
      (2)   Was the subject of a written agreement to convey entered into prior
to the date of adoption of this section;
      (3)   Is a single parcel of commercial or industrial zoned land of not
less than five acres and having a width of not less than 300 feet and its
conveyance does not result in the division of the parcel into two or more lots
or parcels, any one of which is less than five acres in area or 300 feet in
width; or
      (4)   Is a single parcel of residential or agricultural zoned land of not
less than 20 acres and having a width of not less that 500 feet and its
conveyance does not result in the division of the parcel into two or more lots
or parcels, any one of which is less than 20 acres in area or 500 feet in
width.
   (C)   (1)   In any case in which compliance with this section will create an
unnecessary hardship and failure to comply would not interfere with the purpose
of this chapter in that the proposed lot or parcel described in the conveyance
is located in an area that is well established and developed, and no future
planning issues need be addressed or could be effectively dealt with given the
nature of existing land configuration and public improvements, the Council may,
upon written application of the owner thereof or his or her agent, waive the
compliance by adoption of a resolution to that effect, and the conveyance with
the accompanying resolution may then be filed or recorded in the County
Recorder’s office.
      (2)   The waiver may be subject to any reasonable requirements the
Council deems necessary to protect the public interest.

governmental authority for the construction of any building, structure or
improvement to the land, or to any lot in a subdivision, as defined herein,
until all requirements of this chapter have been fully complied with.
(Prior Code, § 12.01) (Ord. 102, Third Series, effective 2-21-1991)
§ 152.07 PLAT REVIEW AND CHARGES.
   (A)   All subdividers are hereby on notice that the Council will employ
qualified persons to check and verify surveys and plats hereafter filed for
approval, and to determine the suitability of the plat from the standpoint of
community planning. The persons shall make full reports of their findings to
the Planning Commission and Council.
   (B)   The Council may from time to time establish fees and charges for the
filing and reviewing of preliminary plats. In addition, the subdivider shall
reimburse the city for the cost of legal, profession and technical services
which are reasonably used by the city to examine the plat.

registered land surveys within the jurisdiction of this chapter shall be
presented to the Planning Commission in the form of a preliminary plat in
accordance with the standards set forth in this chapter for preliminary plats
and that the Planning Commission shall first approve the arrangement, sizes and
relationship of proposed tracts in the registered land surveys, and that tracts
to be used as easements or streets should be so dedicated. Unless the approvals
have been obtained from the Planning Commission and Council in accordance with
the standards set forth in this chapter, building permits will be withheld for
buildings on tracts which have been so subdivided by registered land surveys,
and the city may refuse to take over tracts as streets or roads or to improve,
repair or maintain any such tracts unless so approved.
   (B)   Conveyance by metes and bounds. No conveyance may be made of any
parcel or tract in which the land conveyed is described by metes and bounds or
to an unapproved survey or unapproved plat, unless the conveyance of the parcel
is specifically exempted from the provisions of this chapter as noted in §§
152.01 through
152.07 of this chapter or a variance is obtained under §
152.09 of this chapter. Neither the city nor the county or the affected
township, if applicable, shall issue any building permit or zoning permit for
construction of buildings or other improvements on such parcels or tracts which
have been subdivided and conveyed in violation of this chapter and subdivision.
Hereafter, no public utility or governmental entity shall construct an
improvement upon land affected by this chapter unless located within clearly
noted and designated right-of-way or easement on an approved plat, or filed
prior to the effective date of this subdivision, or has otherwise been approved
by the Council. The County Recorder is hereby given notice and instructed to
deny the recording of any such conveyance in violation of the provisions of
this chapter and this section. The prohibitions contained herein are made under
the provisions of M.S. § 462.358, as it may be amended from time to time, and
shall be governed in accordance with the provisions therein.
(Prior Code, § 12.30) (Ord. 149, New Series, effective 1-17-1975; Ord. 102,

offer to sell or otherwise convey any lot or parcel of land as a part of or in
conformity with any plan, plat or replat of any subdivision or area located
within the jurisdiction of this chapter unless the plan, plat or replat shall
have first been recorded in the office of the County Recorder.
   (B)   Receiving and recording unapproved plats. It is unlawful to receive or
record in any public office any plans, plats or replats of land laid out in
building lots and highways, streets, roads, alleys or other portions of the
same intended to be dedicated to public or private use or for the use of
purchasers or owners of lots fronting on or adjacent thereto and located within
the jurisdiction of this chapter, unless the same shall bear thereon, by
endorsement or otherwise, the approval of the Council.
   (C)   Misrepresentation as to construction, supervision or inspection of
improvements. It is unlawful for any subdivider, person, firm or corporation
owning an addition or subdivision of land within the city to represent that any
improvement upon any of the highways, streets or alleys of the addition or

according to the plans and specifications approved by the Council or has been
supervised or inspected by the city when the improvements have not been so
constructed, supervised or inspected.
(Prior Code, § 12.40) (Ord. 149, New Series, effective 1-17-1975) Penalty, see
§
10.99
DESIGN STANDARDS
§ 152.25 BLOCKS.
   (A)   Block length. In general, intersecting streets and roads, determining
block lengths, shall be provided at such intervals as to serve cross-traffic
adequately and to meet existing streets and roads. Where no existing plats
control, the blocks in residential subdivisions shall normally not exceed 1,320
feet in length, except where topography or other conditions justifies a
departure from this maximum. In blocks longer than 800 feet, pedestrian ways
and/or easements through the block may be required near the center of the
block. Blocks for business or industrial use should normally not exceed 600
feet in length.
   (B)   Block width. The width of the block shall normally be sufficient to
allow two tiers of lots of appropriate depth. Blocks intended for business or
industrial use shall be of a width as to be considered most suitable for their
respective use, including adequate space for off-street parking and deliveries.
(Prior Code, § 12.10) (Ord. 149, New Series, effective 1-17-1975)
§ 152.26 LOTS.
   (A)   The minimum lot area, lot width and lot depths shall conform to the
requirements of existing zoning districts in which the plat is situated as
required by Ch. 154 of this code of ordinances. Those plats within the two-mile
jurisdiction of this chapter, but governed by the county’s Zoning Ordinance,
shall meet the lot requirements of the county’s Zoning Ordinance.
   (B)   Corner lots for residential use shall have additional width to permit
appropriate building setback from both roads as required by Ch. 154 of this
code of ordinances.
   (C)   Side lines of lots shall be approximately at right angles to road or
street lines or radial to curved road or street lines.
   (D)   Double frontage lots shall be avoided, except where lots back on a
highway or other arterial road, or where topographic or other conditions render
subdividing otherwise unreasonable. The double frontage lots shall have an
additional depth of at least ten feet in order to allow space for screen
planting along the back lot line.
   (E)   Every lot must have the minimum required frontage on a public
dedicated road or street other than an alley.
   (F)   (1)   Setback or building lines shall be shown on all lots intended
for residential use and shall not be less than the setback required by Ch. 154
of this code of ordinances.
      (2)   On those lots which are intended for business or industrial use,
the setback shall not be less than the setback required by Ch. 154 of this code
of ordinances.
(Prior Code, § 12.10) (Ord. 180, New Series, effective 1-19-1979)
§ 152.27 ROADS, HIGHWAYS, STREETS AND ALLEYS.
   (A)   The arrangement of highways shall conform as nearly as possible to the
city’s Comprehensive Plan. Except for cul-de-sacs, roads and streets normally
shall connect with roads and streets already dedicated in adjoining or adjacent
subdivisions, or provide for future connections to adjoining unsubdivided
tracts, or shall be a reasonable projection of roads in the nearest subdivided
tracts. The arrangement of highways shall be considered in its relation to the
reasonable circulation of traffic, to topographic conditions, to run-off or
storm water, to public convenience and safety and in its appropriate relation
to the proposed use of the area to be served.
   (B)   Local roads and streets should be so planned as to discourage their
use by non-local traffic. Dead-end streets and roads shall be prohibited, but
cul-de-sacs will be permitted where topography or other conditions justify
their use. Cul-de-sacs shall normally not be longer than 500 feet, including a
terminal turn-around which shall be provided at the closed end, with an outside
curb radius of at least 50 feet and a right-of-way radius of not less than 60
feet.
   (C)   Where the plat to be submitted includes only part of the tract owned
or intended for development by the subdivider, a tentative plan of a proposed
future street and road system for the unsubdivided portion shall be prepared
and submitted by the subdivider.
   (D)   When a tract is subdivided into larger than normal building lots or
parcels, the lots or parcels shall be so arranged as to permit the logical
location and openings of future roads and appropriate resubdivision, with
provision for adequate utility connections for the resubdivision.
   (E)   Under normal conditions, roads shall be laid out as to intersect as
nearly as possible at right angles, except where topography or other conditions
justify variations. Under normal conditions, the minimum angle of intersection
of roads shall be 70 degrees. Road intersection jogs with an offset of less
than 125 feet shall be avoided.
   (F)   Wherever the proposed subdivision contains or is adjacent to the
right-of-way of a highway, provision shall be made for a marginal access street
or road approximately parallel and adjacent to the boundary of the right-of-
way, or for a road at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of land
between the road and right-of-way. The distance shall be determined with due
consideration for the minimum distance required for approach connections to
future grade separations or for lot depths.
   (G)   Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial districts;
except that, this requirement may be waived where other definite and assured
provision is made for service access, such as on-site loading, unloading and

justified by special conditions, such as the continuation of an existing alley
in the same block, alleys will not be approved in residential districts.
Alleys, where provided, shall not be less than 20 feet wide. Dead-end alleys
shall be avoided wherever possible, but if unavoidable, the dead-end alleys may
be approved if adequate turn-around facilities are provided at the closed end.
   (H)   Dedication of half streets or roads will not be approved, except where
it is essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision and in
conformity with the other requirements of these regulations, where it is found
that it will be practical to require the dedication of the other half when the
adjoining property is subdivided, or where it becomes necessary to acquire the
remaining half by condemnation so that it may be improved in the public
interest.
   (I)   (1)   For all public ways hereafter dedicated and accepted, the
minimum right-of-way widths for streets and thoroughfares shall be as shown in
the city’s Comprehensive Plan, and where not shown therein, the minimum right-
of-way width for streets, roads, highways, alleys or pedestrian ways included
in any subdivision shall not be less than the minimum dimensions for each
classification as follows:
 
Alleys                        20 feet
Collector streets             60 feet
Marginal service access roads 50 feet
Minor streets                 60 feet
Pedestrian ways               10 feet
Thoroughfares                 80 feet
 
      (2)   Where the existing or anticipated traffic on thoroughfares warrants
greater widths of right-of-way, these shall be required.
   (J)   (1)   The grades in all streets, thoroughfares and alleys in any
subdivision shall not be greater than the maximum grades for each
classification as follows:
 
Alleys            8%
Collector streets 8%
Minor streets     8%
Thoroughfares     5%
 
      (2)   In addition, there shall be a minimum grade on all streets of not
less than 0.005%.
   (K)   (1)   The horizontal and vertical alignment standards on all streets
and thoroughfares shall be as follows.
         (a)   Horizontal, radii of centerline. There shall be a tangent
between all reversed curves of a length in relation to the radii of the curves
so as to provide for a smooth flow of traffic:
 
Collector streets 300 feet
Minor streets     100 feet
Thoroughfares     500 feet
 
         (b)   Vertical. All changes in street grades shall be connected by
vertical parabolic curves in such length as follows:
 
Collector streets or minor streets 50-foot minimum
Thoroughfares                      150-foot minimum
 
   (L)   All proposed streets or roads shall be offered for dedication as
public rights-of-way. No private streets or roads shall be permitted.
(Prior Code, § 12.10)
§ 152.28 EASEMENTS.
   (A)   An easement for utilities at least six feet wide shall be provided
along the side line of lots and/or the rear line of lots where necessary to
form a continuous right-of-way, at least 12 feet in width. If necessary for the
extension of main water or sewer lines or similar utilities, easements of
greater width may be required along lot lines or across lots.
   (B)   Utility easements shall connect with easements established in
adjoining properties. These easements, when approved, shall not thereafter be
changed without the approval of the Council, by ordinance, upon the
recommendation of the Planning Commission.
   (C)   Additional easements for pole guys should be provided at the outside
of turns. Where possible, lot lines shall be arranged to bisect the exterior
angle so that pole guys will fall along side lot lines.
   (D)   Where a subdivision contains or is traversed by a watercourse,
drainage way, channel, lake or stream, a storm water easement, drainage right-
of-way or park dedication, whichever the Planning Commission may deem the most
adequate, conforming substantially with the lines of the watercourse, shall be
provided, together with such further width or construction or both as will be
adequate for the storm water drainage of the area. The width of the easements
shall be determined by the City Engineer.
(Prior Code, § 12.10)
§ 152.29 PUBLIC SITES AND OPEN SPACES.
   (A)   (1)   In subdividing land or resubdividing an existing plat, due
consideration shall be given by the subdivider to the dedication or reservation
of suitable sites for schools, parks, playgrounds, conservation areas or other
public or semi-public recreational areas or open spaces. Areas so dedicated or
reserved shall conform as nearly as possible to the city’s Comprehensive Plan.
All areas to be reserved for or dedicated to public use shall be indicated on
the preliminary plat in order that it may be determined when and in what manner
the areas will be dedicated to or acquired by the appropriate agency. It shall
be required that the subdivider of residential areas dedicate to the city the
following land for use as the city shall see fit; except that, the city may not
sell the lands for building sites to any private party:
 
Subdivisions of up to 50 acres   5% of the platted area
Additional acreage over 50 acres 2% of the platted area
 
      (2)   The dedicated area may be taken in one or more parcels at the
discretion of the city and must be acceptable to the city in respect to
dimension, location and topography.
   (B)   (1)   If, in the judgment of the Council, the area proposed to be
dedicated is not suitable or desirable for park/playground purposes, because of
the location, size or other reason, the Council may require, in lieu of land
dedication, a payment to the city of a sum equal to the percentage listed above
of the average value of the land to be subdivided. The aforementioned value
shall be the value of the land upon approval of the preliminary plat, yet prior
to the installation of improvements, and shall be determined jointly by the
Council or its agent and the subdivider-developer.
      (2)   If the Council and subdivider-developer cannot agree on the land
value, then the land values shall be established on the basis of the average of
two independent appraisals by professional appraisers, one chosen by the
Council and one by the subdivider-developer.
   (C)   Those areas under the jurisdiction of this chapter, but not under the
direct governing authority of the city, shall be required to allow for adequate
open space areas also. All dedications shall be made to the county or adequate
provisions made to ensure maintenance of any park areas. The dedications shall
be in accordance with the above listed percentages.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 153.001 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The purpose of this chapter is to safeguard the health, property and public
welfare by controlling the design, location, use or occupancy of all buildings
and structures through the regulated and orderly development of land and land
uses within the city.
(Prior Code, § 11.01)
§ 153.002 SCOPE, JURISDICTION AND INTERPRETATION.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   The provisions of this chapter shall apply to the construction,
addition, alteration, moving, repair and use of any building, structure, parcel
of land or sign within a jurisdiction, except work located primarily in a
public way, public utility towers and poles, and public utilities unless
specifically mentioned in this chapter.
      (2)   Where, in any specific case, different sections of this chapter
specify different requirements, the more restrictive shall govern. Where there
is a conflict between a general requirement and a specific requirement, the
specific requirement shall be applicable.
      (3)   In fulfilling these purposes, this chapter is intended to benefit
the public as a whole and not a specific person or class of persons. Although,
through the implementation, administration and enforcement of this chapter,
benefits and detriments will be enjoyed or suffered by specific individuals,
such is merely a byproduct of the overall benefit to the whole community.
Therefore, unintentional breaches of the obligations of administration and
enforcement imposed on the jurisdiction hereby shall not be enforceable in
tort.
      (4)   If any portion of this chapter is held invalid for any reason, the
remaining herein shall not be effected.
   (B)   Existing buildings and uses. Lawfully established buildings and uses
in existence at the time of the adoption of this chapter shall be permitted to
have their existing use or occupancy continued; provided, the continued use is
not dangerous to life.
   (C)   Additions, alterations or repairs. Additions, alterations or repairs
shall be permitted to be made to any building or use without requiring the
existing building or use to comply with the requirements of this chapter;
provided, the addition, alteration or repair conforms to that required for a
new building or use.
   (D)   Maintenance. All buildings or uses, both existing and new, and all
parts thereof, shall be maintained. The owner or designated agent shall be
responsible for the maintenance of the buildings and parcels of land. To
determine compliance with this section, the Code Official shall be permitted to
cause any structure or use to be inspected.
   (E)   Moved or temporary buildings, structures and uses.
      (1)   Buildings or structures moved into or within the city shall comply
with the provisions of this chapter for new buildings and structures.
      (2)   Temporary buildings, structures and uses such as reviewing stands
and other miscellaneous structures, sheds, canopies or fences used for
protection of the public shall be permitted to be erected; provided, a special
approval is received from the Code Official for a limited period of time.
Temporary buildings or structures shall be completely removed upon the
expiration of the time limit stated in the permit.
   (F)   Illegal uses. Uses that were illegally established prior to adoption
of this chapter shall remain illegal.
   (G)   Interpretations.
      (1)   The interpretation and application of the provisions of this
chapter shall be by the Code Official. An appeal of an interpretation by the
Code Official shall be submitted to the Board of Adjustments and Appeals,
which, unless otherwise provided, are authorized to interpret the code and such
interpretation, shall be considered final.
      (2)   Uses are permitted within the various zones as described in this
chapter and as otherwise provided herein.
      (3)   It is recognized that all possible uses and variations of uses that
might arise cannot reasonably be listed or categorized. Mixed uses/sites or any
use not specifically mentioned or about which there is any question shall be
administratively classified by comparison with other uses identified in the
zones described in this chapter. If the proposed use resembles identified uses
in terms of intensity and character, and is consistent with the purpose of this
chapter and the individual zone’s classification, it shall be considered as a
permitted/non-permitted use within a general zone classification, subject to
the regulations for the use it most nearly resembles. If a use does not
resemble other identified allowable uses within the zone, it may be permitted
as determined by the hearing body in a public hearing as an amendment to this
chapter pursuant to §
153.020 of this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 11.02)

resulting therefrom shall be assumed by the city.
      (2)   This chapter shall not be construed to relieve from or lessen the
responsibility of any person owning, operating or controlling any building or

liability by reason of the reviews or permits issued under this chapter.

this chapter or desiring a variance from the literal provisions of this

therefor and have the matter heard by the Board of Appeals and Adjustments in
accordance with the provisions of state law and the city code.
   (B)   Procedure.
      (1)   Application for any variance or appeal permissible under the
provisions of this section shall be made to the Board of Appeals and
Adjustments in the form of a written application on such forms as required by
the city. Upon receipt of any application, the Board of Appeals and Adjustments
shall set a time and place for a public hearing before the Board on the
application. At least ten days before the date of the hearing, a notice of the
hearing shall be published once in the official newspaper.
      (2)   The Board of Appeals and Adjustments shall, thereupon, make its
decision upon the application within 30 days of the public hearing, unless the
Board specifically finds that additional time is needed to make its decision,
but in any event the decision must be made within 60 days of the public
hearing.
   (C)   Conditions for a variance.
      (1)   A variance shall be permitted only if it is established that it is
in keeping with the spirit and intent of the general purpose of this chapter
and that the strict enforcement of the provisions of this chapter would cause
an undue hardship because of the circumstances unique to the individual
property under consideration. In its consideration of the standards of
practical difficulties or particular hardship and unique situation, the Board
of Zoning Appeals and Adjustments shall require the presentation of evidence
that:
         (a)   The property in question cannot be put to a reasonable use if
permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by the regulations
governing the district in which it is located;
         (b)   The plight of the landowner is due to circumstances unique to
the property that are not normally applicable to landholdings within the same
district and that were not created by the landowner; and
         (c)   The variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character
of the neighborhood and locality. Economic considerations alone shall not
constitute an undue hardship if reasonable use for the property exists under
the terms of this chapter. Undue hardship also includes, but is not limited to,
inadequate access to direct sunlight for solar energy systems. Special
consideration shall be given for earth sheltered construction, as defined in
M.S. § 216C.06, subd. 2, as it may be amended from time to time, when the
construction is in harmony with the provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   A variance shall be granted only if the evidence, in the judgment
of the Board of Appeals and Adjustments, sustains the conditions enumerated in
division (C)(1) above. Variances from the provisions of this chapter shall be
granted by the Board of Appeals and Adjustments only in accordance with the
provisions of this section.
      (3)   Specific conditions and safeguards may be imposed upon the premises
benefitted by the variance as considered necessary to prevent injurious effects
upon other property in the neighborhood or upon public facilities and services.
Violations of such conditions and safeguards shall constitute a violation of
this chapter.
      (4)   No variance permitting the erection or alteration of a building
shall be valid for a period longer than one year unless a building permit for
the erection or alteration is issued and construction is actually begun within
that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.

be graded to provide proper drainage, and except for areas used for parking,
drives or storage, shall be landscaped with trees, shrubs or planted ground
cover. It shall be the owner’s responsibility to see that this landscaping is
maintained in an attractive and well-kept condition. All adjacent vacant lots,
tracts or parcels under the same ownership shall also be properly maintained.
      (2)   Storage. All raw materials, supplies, finished or semifinished
products and equipment shall be stored in an orderly manner with all materials
stored in neat and well organized stacks, piles or other orderly method
appropriate for the material. In no event shall junk, rubbish, debris, weeds or
tall grass, by-products, salvage and inoperable equipment or any other material
or matter not used in the normal course of business be allowed to accumulate,
or become offensive in any manner, to any measurable degree whatsoever. The
Council may require all raw materials, supplies, finished or semi-finished
products and equipment shall be stored within a completely enclosed building or

finding that the nature of extent of the use being screened is such that a
lesser degree of screening will as adequately promote and protect the use and
enjoyment of the properties within the adjacent residential district, or there
is a finding that a screening of the type required by this chapter would
interfere with provisions of adequate amounts of light and air to same
properties. Loading docks in the I-1 District shall be screened so as not to be
visible from any public street right-of-way within a residential district. All
required screening devices shall be designed so that they are architecturally
harmonious with the principal structures on the site and they shall be properly

dated 11-17-1981 and the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map and Flood Insurance
Rate Map dated 5-17-1982. The Official Zoning Map shall be on file in the
office of the City Administrator.
   (B)   The boundaries of the zoning districts shall be determined by scaling
distances on the Official Zoning Map. Where interpretation is needed as to the
exact location of the boundaries of the district as shown on the Official
Zoning Map, as for example where there appears to be a conflict between a
mapped boundary and actual field conditions, the Board of Appeals and
Adjustments shall make the necessary interpretation based on elevations on the
regional (100-year) flood profile and other available technical data. The
person contesting the location of the district boundary shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to present his or her case to the Board and to submit
technical evidence if he or she so desires.

premises with, and of a nature customarily and clearly incidental and
subordinate to, the principal use or structure.
   BASEMENT. For the purposes of this subchapter, means any area of a
structure, including crawl spaces, having its floor or base subgrade (below
ground level) on all four sides, regardless of the depth of excavation below
ground level.
   COMMISSIONER. The state’s Commissioner of the Department of Natural
Resources.
   EQUAL DEGREE OF ENCROACHMENT. A method of determining the location of
floodway boundaries so that floodplain lands on both sides of a stream are
capable of conveying a proportionate share of flood flows.
   FLOOD. A temporary rise in stream flow or stage that results in inundation
of the areas adjacent to the channel.
   FLOOD FREQUENCY. The average frequency, statistically determined, for which
it is expected that a specific flood state or discharge may be equaled or
exceeded.
   FLOOD FRINGE. The portion of the floodplain outside of the floodway. FLOOD
FRINGE is synonymous with the term FLOODWAY FRINGE used in the Flood Insurance
Study.

floodplains which are reasonably required to carry and discharge the regional
flood.
   HARDSHIP. The property in question cannot be put to any reasonable use under
the conditions allowed by the official controls; the plight of the landowner is
due to circumstances unique to his property, not created by the landowner; and
the variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the
locality. Economic considerations alone shall not constitute a HARDSHIP if a
reasonable use for the property exists under terms of the official controls.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A manufactured home, as defined in M.S. § 327.31, as it
may be amended from time to time.

projection, excavation, channel, modification, culvert, building, wire, fence,
stockpile, refuse, fill, structure or matter in, along, across or projecting
into any channel, watercourse or regulatory flood hazard area which may impede,
retard or change the direction of the flow of water, either in itself or by
catching or collecting debris carried by the water, or that is placed where the
flow of water might carry the same downstream to the damage of life or
property.
   PRINCIPAL USE OR STRUCTURE. All uses or structures that are not accessory
uses or structures.
   REACH. A hydraulic engineering term to describe a longitudinal segment of a
stream or river influenced by a natural or human-made obstruction. In an urban
area, the segment of a stream or river between two consecutive bridge crossings
would most typically constitute a REACH.
   REGIONAL FLOOD. A flood which is representative of large floods known to
have occurred generally in the state and reasonably characteristic of what can
be expected to occur on an average frequency in the magnitude of the 100-year
recurrence interval. REGIONAL FLOOD is synonymous with the term BASE FLOOD used
in the Flood Insurance Study.
   REGULATORY FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION. The regulatory flood protection
elevation within the Floodplain District shall be established by adding one
foot to the base flood water surface elevations with floodway listed in the
Floodway Data Table contained in the Flood Insurance Study. REGULATORY FLOOD
PROTECTION ELEVATIONS between cross-sections shall be interpolated. The
REGULATORY FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION within the Floodplain District shall be
calculated by a qualified registered professional engineer or by the state’s
Department of Natural Resources, in accordance with procedures in §
153.088 of this chapter.
   STRUCTURE. Anything constructed or erected on the ground or attached to the
ground, including, but not limited to, the buildings, factories, sheds,

      (1)   All uses. No structure (temporary or permanent), fill (including
fill for roads and levees), deposit, obstruction, storage of materials or
equipment, or other uses may be allowed as a conditional use that will cause
any increase in the stage of the 100-year or regional flood or cause an
increase in flood damages in the reach or reaches affected.
      (2)   Standards and procedures. All floodplain conditional uses shall be
subject to the procedures and standards contained in §
153.088(D) of this chapter.
      (3)   Fill.
         (a)   Fill, dredge spoil and all other similar materials deposited or
stored in the floodplain shall be protected from erosion by vegetative cover,
mulching, riprap or other acceptable methods.
         (b)   Dredge spoil sites and sand and gravel operations shall not be
allowed in the floodplain unless a long-term site development plan is submitted
which includes an erosion/sedimentation prevention element to the plan.
         (c)   As an alternative, and consistent with division (D)(3)(b) above,
dredge spoil disposal and sand and gravel operations may allow temporary, on-
site storage of fill or other materials which would have caused an increase to
the stage of the 100-year or regional flood but only after the Council has
received an appropriate plan which assures the removal of the material from the
floodplain based upon the flood warning time available.
      (4)   Accessory structures.
         (a)   Accessory structures shall not be designed for human habitation.
         (b)   Accessory structures, if permitted, shall be constructed and
placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the flow
of flood waters:
            1.   Whenever possible, structures shall be constructed with
longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow; and
            2.   As far as practicable, structures shall be placed
approximately on the same flood flow lines as those of adjoining structures.
         (c)   Accessory structures shall be elevated on fill or structurally
dry flood-proofed in accordance with the FP-1 or FP-2 flood-proofing
classifications in the State Building Code. As an alternative, an accessory
structure may be flood-proofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 flood-proofing
classification in the State Building Code; provided, the accessory structure
constitutes a minimal investment, does not exceed 500 square feet in size and,
for a detached garage, the detached garage must be used solely for parking of
vehicles and limited storage. All flood-proofed accessory structures must meet
the following additional standards, as appropriate:
            1.   The structure must be adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure and shall be designed
to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls; and
            2.   Any mechanical and utility equipment in a structure must be
elevated to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or properly
flood-proofed.
      (5)   Storage of materials and equipment.
         (a)   The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of
flooding, flammable, explosive or potentially injurious to human, animal or
plant life is prohibited.
         (b)   Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if
readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning
and in accordance with a plan approved by the Council.
      (6)   Changing course, current and the like. Structural works for flood
control that will change the course, current or cross-section of protected
wetlands or public waters shall be subject to the provision of M.S. Ch. 105, as
it may be amended from time to time. Community-wide structural works for flood
control intended to remove areas from the regulatory floodplain shall not be
allowed in the floodplain.
      (7)   Increase in flood. A levee, dike or floodwall constructed in the
floodplain shall not cause an increase to the 100-year or regional flood and
the technical analysis must assume equal conveyance or storage loss on both
sides of a stream.
   (E)   Standards for permitted and conditional uses in the flood fringe.
      (1)   General. All new principal structures must have vehicular access at
or above an elevation not more than two feet below the regulatory flood
protection elevation. If a variance to this requirement is granted, the Board
of Appeals and Adjustments must specify limitations on the period of use or
occupancy of the structure for times of flooding and only after determining
that adequate flood warning time and local flood emergency response procedures
exist.
      (2)   Commercial uses. Accessory land uses, such as yards, railroad
tracks and parking lots may be at elevations lower than the regulatory flood
protection elevation. However, a permit for such facilities to be used by the
employees or the general public shall not be granted in the absence of a flood
warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area would be
inundated to a depth greater than two feet or be subject to flood velocities
greater than four feet per second upon occurrence of the regional flood.
      (3)   Manufacturing and industrial uses. Measures shall be taken to
minimize interference with normal plant operations especially along streams
having protracted flood durations. Certain accessory land uses such as yards
and parking lots may be at lower elevations subject to requirements set out in
division (E)(2) above. In considering permit applications, due consideration
shall be given to needs of an industry whose business requires that it be
located in floodplain areas.
      (4)   Fill. Fill shall be properly compacted and the slopes shall be
properly protected by the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable
method. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria
for removing the special flood hazard area designation for certain structures
properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation. FEMA’s
requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection
standards for multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should
be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of
special flood hazard area designation will be requested.
      (5)   Hydraulic capacity. Floodplain developments shall not adversely
affect the hydraulic capacity of the channel and adjoining floodplain of any
tributary watercourse or drainage system where a floodway or other encroachment
limit has not been specified on the Official Zoning Map.
      (6)   Travel trailers and the like. Standards for travel trailers and
travel vehicles are contained in §
153.087(C) of this chapter.
      (7)   Manufactured homes. All manufactured homes must be securely
anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system that resists flotation,
collapse and lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to
be limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This
requirement is in addition to applicable state or local anchoring requirements
for resisting wind forces.
(Prior Code, § 11.10)
§ 153.084 FLOODPLAIN EVALUATIONS IN AREAS WITHOUT DETAILED STUDY.
   (A)   Upon receipt of an application for a conditional use permit for a use
within the Floodplain District, the applicant shall be required to furnish such
of the following information as is deemed necessary by the Zoning Administrator
for the determination of the regulatory flood protection elevation and whether
the proposed use is within the floodplain:
      (1)   A typical valley cross-section showing the channel of the stream,
elevation of land areas adjoining each side of the channel, cross-sectional
areas to be occupied by the proposed development and high water information;
      (2)   Plan (surface view) showing elevations or contours of the ground;
pertinent structure, fill or storage elevations; size, location and spatial
arrangement of all proposed and existing structures on the site; location and
elevations of streets; photographs showing existing land uses and vegetation
upstream and downstream; and soil type; and
      (3)   Profile showing the slope of the bottom of the channel or flow line
of the stream for at least 500 feet in either direction from the proposed
development.
   (B)   The applicant shall be responsible to submit one copy of the above
information to a designated engineer or other expert person or agency for
technical assistance in determining whether the purposed use is in the
Floodplain District and to determine the regulatory flood protection elevation.
Procedures consistent with Minnesota Rules, latest supplement, (currently
codified in the 1990 Supplement, Number 1, as Minn. Rules parts 6120.5000
through 6120.6200) shall be followed in this expert evaluation. The designated
engineer or expert is strongly encouraged to discuss the proposed technical
evaluation methodology with the respective Department of Natural Resources area
hydrologist prior to commencing the analysis. The designated engineer or expert
shall:
      (1)   Estimate the peak discharge of the regional flood;
      (2)   Calculate the water surface profile of the regional flood based
upon a hydraulic analysis of the stream channel and overbank areas; and
      (3)   Compute the floodway necessary to convey or store the regional
flood without increasing flood stages more than one-half foot. A lesser stage
increase than one-half foot shall be required if, as a result of the additional
stage increase, increased flood damages would result. An equal degree of
encroachment on both sides of the stream within the reach shall be assumed in
computing floodway boundaries.
   (C)   The Zoning Administrator shall present the technical evaluation and
findings of the designated engineer or expert to the Council. The Council must
formally accept the technical evaluation and the recommended floodplain
boundary or deny the permit application. The Council, prior to official action,
may submit the application and all supporting data and analyses to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, the Department of Natural Resources or the
Planning Commission for review and comment. Once the floodplain boundary has
been determined, the Council shall refer the matter back to the Zoning
Administrator who shall process the permit application consistent with
applicable provisions of §
153.083 of this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 11.10)
§ 153.085 LAND SUBDIVISIONS.

         (b)   Seventy-five feet for lots not served by public sewer.
      (2)   For all subdivisions in the Floodplain District, the regulatory
flood protection elevation, the required elevation of all access roads and
required setbacks shall be clearly labeled on all required subdivision drawings
and platting documents.
   (B)   Floodplain determination. When no detailed study has been performed,
applicants shall provide the information required in §
153.084 of this chapter to determine the 100-year or regional flood elevation,
and the regulatory flood protection elevation for the subdivision site.
   (C)   Removal of special flood hazard area designation. The Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for removing the
special flood hazard area designation for certain structures properly elevated
on fill above the 100-year or regional flood elevation. FEMA’s requirements
incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection standards for
multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should be
investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of special
flood hazard area designation will be requested.
(Prior Code, § 11.10)
§ 153.086 PUBLIC UTILITIES, RAILROADS, ROADS AND BRIDGES.
   (A)   All public utilities and facilities including, but not limited to,

limited to, those specified in division (D)(4) below, which are in conformity
with the purposes of this subchapter. Violations of the conditions and
safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted,
shall be deemed a violation of this chapter punishable under §
153.006 of this chapter.
      (2)   The Board of Appeals and Adjustments shall submit to the
Commissioner of Natural Resources a copy of the application for proposed
variances sufficiently in advance so that the Commissioner will receive at
least ten days’ notice of the hearing. A copy of all decisions granting
variances shall be forwarded to the Commissioner of Natural Resources within
ten days of the action.
      (3)   (a)   The Zoning Administrator shall notify the applicant for a
variance that:
            1.   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the
base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and
            2.   The construction below the 100-year or regional flood level
increases risks to life and property.
         (b)   The notification shall be maintained with a record of all
variance actions. A community shall maintain a record of all variance actions,
including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in
its annual or biennial report submitted to the Administrator of the National
Flood Insurance Program.
      (4)   A certified copy of all variances granted shall be recorded in the
office of the County Recorder.
   (D)   Applications for conditional uses permissible under this subchapter
shall be subject to the general procedures set forth in §§
153.035 through
153.041 of this chapter and to the following requirements.
      (1)   A copy of the conditional use request shall be submitted to the
Commissioner of Natural Resources sufficiently in advance so as to allow
adequate review which in all cases shall be at least ten days prior to the
scheduled hearing. A copy of all decisions granting conditional use permits
shall be forwarded to the Commissioner of Natural Resources within ten days of
the action.
      (2)   Procedures for evaluating proposed conditional uses within the
Floodplain (FP) District.
         (a)   Upon receipt of an application for a conditional use permit for
a use within the General Floodplain District, the applicant shall be required
to furnish such of the following information as is deemed necessary by the
Council and Planning Commission for the determination of the regulatory flood
protection elevation, and whether the proposed use is located in the floodway
or the flood fringe:
            1.   A typical valley cross-section showing the channel of the
stream, elevation of land areas adjoining each side of the channel, cross-
sectional areas to be occupied by the proposed development and high water
information;
            2.   Plan (surface view) showing elevations or contours of the
ground, pertinent structure, fill or storage elevations, size, location; and
spatial arrangement of all proposed and existing structures on the site;
location and elevations of streets; photographs showing existing land uses and
vegetation upstream and downstream; and soil type;
            3.   Profile showing the slope of the bottom of the channel or flow
line of the stream for at least 500 feet in either direction from the proposed
development;
            4.   Plans drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions
and elevation of the lot, existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of
materials, flood-proofing measures and the relationship of the above to the
location of the channel; and
            5.   Specifications for building construction and materials, flood-
proofing, filling, dredging, grading, channel improvement, storage of
materials, water supply and sanitary facilities.
         (b)   One copy of the above information shall be transmitted to a
designated engineer or other expert person or agency for technical assistance
in determining whether the proposed use is in the floodway or flood fringe, the
regulatory flood protection elevation, project effects on flood velocities, the
seriousness of flood damage to the use, the adequacy of the plans for
protection and other technical matters. Procedures consistent with Minnesota
Rules, latest supplement, (currently codified in the 1990 Supplement, Number 1,
as Minn. Rules parts 6120.5600 and 6120.5700) shall be followed in this expert
evaluation. The designated engineer or expert shall:
            1.   Estimate the peak discharge of the regional flood;
            2.   Calculate the water surface profile of the regional flood
based upon a hydraulic analysis of the stream channel and over bank areas; and
            3.   Compute the floodway necessary to convey the regional flood
without increasing flood stages more than one-half foot. An equal degree of
encroachment on both sides of the stream within the reach shall be assumed.
         (c)   Based upon the technical evaluation of the designated engineer
or expert, the Council and Planning Commission shall determine whether the
proposed use is in the floodway or flood fringe and the regulatory flood
protection elevation at the site.
      (3)   In passing upon conditional use permit applications, the Council
and Planning Commission shall consider all relevant factors specified in other
sections of this chapter, and:
         (a)   The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights
or velocities caused by encroachments;
         (b)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands or
downstream to the injury of others;
         (c)   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability
of these systems to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary conditions;
         (d)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         (e)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
         (f)   The requirements of the facility for a waterfront location;
         (g)   The availability of alternative locations not subject to
flooding for the proposed use;
         (h)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development
and development anticipated in the foreseeable future;
         (i)   The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan
and floodplain management program for the area;
         (j)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         (k)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and
         (l)   Such other factors which are relevant to the purposes of this
subchapter.
      (4)   Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purpose of
this chapter, the Council may attach such conditions to the granting of
conditional use permits as it deems necessary to fulfill the purposes of this
chapter. The conditions may include, but are not limited to, the following:
         (a)   Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities;
         (b)   Limitations on period of use, occupancy and operation;
         (c)   Imposition of operational controls, sureties and deed
restrictions;
         (d)   Requirements for construction of channel modifications, dikes,
levees and other protective measures; and
         (e)   Flood-proofing measures, in accordance with the State Building
Code. The applicant shall submit a plan or document certified by a registered
professional engineer or architect that the flood-proofing measures are
consistent with the regulatory flood protection elevation and associated flood
factors for the particular area.
      (5)   A certified copy of all conditional use permits shall be recorded
in the office of the County Recorder.
   (E)   The floodplain designation on the Official Zoning Map shall not be
removed from floodplain areas unless it can be shown that the designation is in
error or that the area has been filled to, at or above the elevation of the
regional flood and is continuous to land outside the floodplain. Special
exceptions to this rule may be permitted by the Commissioner of Natural
Resources if he or she determines that, through other measures, lands are
adequately protected for the intended use. All amendments to this subchapter
including amendments to the Official Zoning Map as it relates to floodplain
areas must be submitted to and approved by the Commissioner of Natural
Resources and Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   (F)   When violation of the floodplain provisions are either discovered by
or brought to the attention of the Zoning Administrator, the Zoning
Administrator shall immediately investigate the situation and document the
nature and extent of the violation of the official control. As soon as is
reasonably possible, this information will be submitted to the appropriate
Department of Natural Resources and Federal Emergency Management Agency
Regional Office along with the community’s plan of action to correct the
violation to the degree possible.
(Prior Code, § 11.10)
§ 153.089 NON-CONFORMING USES.
   A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful before
the initial adoption or amendment to floodplain controls contained in this
subchapter or similar to those contained herein but which now is not in
conformity with the provisions of this subchapter may be continued subject to
the provisions of §
153.002 of this chapter and the following conditions.
   (A)   No such use shall be expanded, changed, enlarged or altered in a way
which increases its non-conformity.
   (B)   Any alteration or addition to a non-conforming structure or non-
conforming use which would result in increasing the flood damage potential of
that structure or use shall be protected to the regulatory flood protection
elevation in accordance with any of the elevation on fill or flood-proofing
techniques (i.e., FP-1 through FP-4 flood-proofing classifications) allowable
in the State Building Code, except as further restricted below.
   (C)   The current cost of all structural alterations or additions to any
non-conforming structure over the life of the structure shall not exceed 50% of
the current market value of the structure on the date it became a non-
conforming use unless the conditions of this subchapter are satisfied. The cost
of all structural alterations and additions constructed since the adoption of
the city’s initial floodplain controls must be calculated into today’s current
cost which will include all costs such as construction materials and a
reasonable cost placed on all manpower or labor. If the current cost of all
previous and proposed alterations and additions exceeds 50% of the current
market value of the structure, then the structure must meet the standards of §
153.082 of this chapter for new structures. It is the intent of this provision
that all values be adjusted to present day values for an as equal a comparison
as possible.
   (D)   If any non-conforming use is discontinued for 12 consecutive months,
any future use of the building premises shall conform to this subchapter. The
real estate tax assessor shall notify the Zoning Administrator in writing of
instances of non-conforming uses which have been discontinued for such a
period.
   (E)   If any non-conforming use or structure is destroyed by any means,
including floods, to an extent of 50% or more of its market value at the time
of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed, except in conformity with the
provisions of this subchapter. The applicable provisions for establishing new
uses or new structures in §
153.083 of this chapter will apply.
   (F)   The Zoning Administrator shall prepare a list of those non-conforming
uses which have been flood-proofed or otherwise adequately protected in
conformity with §
153.088(D)(4) of this chapter. He or she shall present the list to the Council
which may issue a certificate to the owner stating that the uses, as a result
of these corrective measures, are in conformity with the provisions of this
subchapter.
(Prior Code, § 11.10)
PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT
§ 153.100 PURPOSE.
   (A)   It is recognized that this subchapter is structured to regulate land
use and development patterns of a conventional or traditional nature; however,
there are situations where innovative proposals for use of land may be
submitted which do not relate to ordinance controls and would have to be
rejected even though feasible and beneficial to the community. It is to
accommodate the innovative proposals, even those that may “mix” land uses
within a development, exceed stipulated residential densities or depart from
traditional lot sizes, that the PUD District is established. The technology of
land development is constantly changing, and creative, but practical approaches
to the use of land should be encouraged. The provisions of this subchapter are
intended to do so in a manner which is in the best interests of both the
developer and the community.
   (B)   The PUD District when finally established under the provision of this
subchapter shall be applied to and superimposed upon the underlying zoning
districts established in §§
153.055 through
153.062 of this chapter as the same now exist or are amended in the future. It
being the intent of the Council that no provision or regulation of the
underlying zoning district may be varied, modified or set aside unless
specifically allowed in the accepted PUD District final development plan.
(Prior Code, § 11.11)
§ 153.101 REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Ownership. The tract shall be a development of land under unified
control at the time of application, planned and scheduled to be developed as a
whole. However, no authorizations or permits shall be granted for the
development unless the applicant has acquired actual ownership of or executed a
binding sales contract for all of the property comprising the tract. For
purposes of this subchapter, ownership shall include a lease of not less than
50 years’ duration. The term “single ownership” shall include a single owner,
or a group of land owners, acting through a corporation, where each owner
agrees in advance to be bound by the conditions and regulations which will be
effective within the district and to record the covenants, easements and other
provisions with the County Recorder at the appropriate time.
   (B)   Minimum size. No planned unit development shall consist of less than
one-half acre of contiguous land; provided that, a public street, public
highway or easements for drainage or utility purposes shall not prevent the
land from being considered “contiguous”.
   (C)   Comprehensive Plan. The development shall be planned so that it is
consistent with the Comprehensive Plan for the community.
   (D)   Harmony. The planned unit development shall be planned and developed
to harmonize with any existing or imminent development in the area surrounding
the project site.
   (E)   Financing. The financing for the project shall be proven to be
available to the applicant on conditions and in amounts which are sufficient to
assure completion of the planned unit development.
   (F)   Permitted uses.
      (1)   These may include and shall be limited to:
         (a)   Dwelling units in detached, semi-detached, attached groups of
attached, clustered or multi-storied structures, or any combination thereof;
         (b)   Any non-residential use, to the extent the non-residential use
is designed and intended to serve the residents of the planned unit
development, and other uses as exist or may reasonably be expected to exist in
the future; and
         (c)   Public and private education facilities.
      (2)   In a planned unit development designed primarily for other than
uses permitted above, the uses shall be limited to those permitted in the
zoning district in which the use is located.
   (G)   Recreational space. A minimum of 5% of the total area of a planned
unit development shall be set aside for recreational use. The use should be
effectively separated from automobile traffic and parking and be readily
accessible; the term “recreational use” shall not include space devoted to
streets and parking.
   (H)   Density. For planned residential developments proposed in existing
residential zones, an increase in density may be allowed based on Planning
Commission and staff evaluation of design excellence, landscaping and
distinctiveness in site work. The actual amount of density increase shall be a
matter of negotiation between the city and landowner, following review of the
preliminary plan in which an initial density is proposed. In recognizing that
the planned unit development process is designed to encourage flexibility and
innovative planning and design exercises, it becomes a matter of benefit to
both landowner and community to agree upon an appropriate density having
economic, aesthetic and practical value. It is intended that the city be the
arbiter in all cases where density increase is proposed.
(Prior Code, § 11.11)
§ 153.102 PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Preliminary development plan; filing.
      (1)   An applicant for a planned unit development shall submit a
preliminary development plan to the Planning Commission, with a written

years, a schedule showing the proposed times within which applications for
final approval of all sections of the planned unit development are intended to
be filed; and
         (h)   A topographic map of the subject property or properties,
prepared by a registered civil engineer or a licensed land surveyor, covering
the entire tract proposed for development and indicating existing conditions.
Development for an additional area must include at least 350 feet, unless the
city requires a lesser amount, from tract boundaries. The map shall be drawn at
a scale no smaller than 100 feet equal one inch, shall indicate topography at
two-foot contour intervals and show in accurate detail the topography, all
planned and existing buildings and all planned and existing land features and
trees. The Planning Commission may make an exception to this requirement if the
subject property is in a well-developed area with existing public utilities and
improved streets and storm sewers installed.
      (3)   The written statement which is a part of the application shall
include:
         (a)   A description of the character of the planned unit development
and the manner in which it has been planned to comply with the planned unit
development regulations;
         (b)   A statement of proposed financing;
         (c)   Economic feasibility analysis of any business uses if the
property is not zoned for similar business uses at the time of submittal of the
preliminary development plans;
         (d)   A statement of provisions for ultimate ownership and maintenance
of all parts of the development, including streets, structures and open spaces;
and
         (e)   Total estimated population to occupy the planned unit
development, with breakdowns as to the number of school-age children, adults
and families.
   (B)   Preliminary development plan/approval.
      (1)   Within 45 days after receipt of the application by the Planning
Commission, a public hearing upon the application shall be held by the Planning
Commission. The Commission may continue the hearing from time to time and refer
the matter back to the planning staff of the city for a further report;
provided, however, the public hearing or hearings shall be concluded within 45
days of the date of the first public hearing, unless the landowner shall
consent in writing to an extension of time within which the hearings shall be
concluded.
      (2)   Within 15 days after the conclusion of public hearings, the
Planning Commission shall forward the plan to the Council with a written report
recommending to the Council that the plan be disapproved, approved or approved
with modifications, and giving the reasons for these recommendations.
      (3)   The Council shall within 30 days of receipt thereof reject,
tentatively accept or modify the Planning Commission report. Failure to act
shall be deemed a rejection.
      (4)   In the event tentative approval is granted subject to conditions,
the landowner shall, within 45 days after receiving a copy of the conditions of
the Council, notify the Council in writing of the acceptance or refusal to
accept all conditions. Refusal by landowners shall constitute denial of the
plans by the Council. Failure of the landowner to notify the Council of his or
her acceptance or denial of the conditions to the plan constitutes acceptance
of the conditions.
      (5)   The acceptance, rejection or modification shall be based on
findings as set forth below and shall state in full in what respects the plan
would or would not be in the public interest, including, but not limited to,
findings of facts and conclusions based on the following:
         (a)   The plan is consistent with the stated objectives of planned
unit developments and the city’s Comprehensive Plan;
         (b)   The relationship, beneficial or adverse, of the proposed planned
unit development to the area in which it is proposed to be developed;
         (c)   That authorized distribution of buildings, streets and open
space will permit better site planning and thus benefit both the residents of
the development and community as a whole; and
         (d)   That such distribution or location will not unduly increase the
bulk of buildings, density of population or intensity of use to the detriment
of areas outside the development by restricting access to light and air or by
creating traffic congestion.
   (C)   Final development plan; approval.
      (1)   Within six months following the approval of the preliminary
development plan, the applicant shall file with the Planning Commission a final
development plan containing in its final form the information required in the
preliminary plan. In its discretion, and for good cause, the Planning
Commission may extend for six months the period for filing of the final
development plan. A public hearing on an application for a final approval of
the plan or part thereof, shall not be required, providing the plan, or the
part thereof submitted for final approval, is in substantial compliance with
the plan given tentative approval.
      (2)   (a)   In the event the plan as submitted for final approval is not
in substantial compliance with the preliminary plan, the Planning Commission
shall, within 45 days of the date the application for final approval is filed,
so notify the landowner, setting forth the particular ways in which the plan is
not in substantial compliance.
         (b)   The landowner may:
            1.   Treat the notification as denial of the final approval;
            2.   Re-file his or her plan so that it does substantially comply
with the preliminary plan; and
            3.   File a written request with the Planning Commission that it
hold a public hearing on its application for final approval.
         (c)   Any such hearing shall be held within 30 days after request for
such hearings is made. Within 45 days of either the hearing or re-filing, the
Planning Commission shall recommend and the Council shall, by resolution,
either grant final approval of the plan or deny final approval of the plan.
      (3)   Should approval of a planned unit development necessitate a change
in this chapter, the change shall be facilitated by amendment of the ordinance
following notice and public hearing(s) as required by the city ordinance. The
Zoning Administrator shall then change the zoning classification on the
Official Zoning Map if a zoning change was made. The planned unit development
area shall be designated on the Official Zoning Map as an overlying PUD
District whether or not a zoning change was made. The final plan and all
supporting documents shall be filed with the preliminary plan and together they
will form the terms and conditions establishing and governing the PUD District.
      (4)   Building permits shall not be issued for any of the structures, nor
shall land alterations be made until the following conditions are met, waived
or altered upon recommendation of the Planning Commission and approval of the
City Council:
         (a)   Public open space has been dedicated and officially recorded;
         (b)   A cash payment in lieu of land donation has been made to
coincide with construction of each building according to the negotiated
agreement;
         (c)   The design and construction specifications for all utilities,
street improvements and mass grading have been approved by the City Engineer;
         (d)   Any private by-laws, covenants and deed restrictions have been
approved by the City Attorney;
         (e)   The construction plans for proposed structures have been
approved by the Building Inspector;
         (f)   The final plat (if necessary) has been approved by the city and
recorded with appropriate governmental agencies as required by law; and/or
         (g)   The detailed site development plans have been approved by all
appropriate city staff members and the Council and the signatures appear on the
plans.
   (D)   Non-compliance; inspection.
      (1)   In the event that a plan, or a section thereof, is given final
approval and thereafter the landowner shall abandon the plan or the section
thereof that has been finally approved, the landowner shall, within 30 days, so
notify the Council in writing. In the event the landowner shall fail to
commence the planned development within 12 months after final approval has been
granted, the final approval shall terminate and be deemed null and void unless
the time period is extended by the Council upon written application of the
landowner.
      (2)   The Zoning Administrator shall review each planned development at
least once each year until completed and shall make a report (through the
Planning Commission) to the Council on the status of the development in each
PUD District. If development is not progressing according to schedule, the
owner shall be required to submit a written statement to the Zoning
Administrator setting forth the reasons for the lack of progress.
      (3)   Within 30 days of the notice, the Council shall either revoke the
approval of the PUD provisions, and the land shall thereafter be governed by
the regulations applicable in the district in which it is located, or it shall
take such steps as it shall deem necessary to compel compliance with the plans
as approved, or it shall require the owner to seek an amendment of his or her
plan as provided below.
      (4)   After final approval, no planned unit development plan shall be
amended, except by the Council after a public hearing before the Planning
Commission; provided, however, that, the approved development schedule of the
plan may be extended for no more than one year by the Council without any
hearing or Planning Commission action.

§ 153.132 PAYMENT IN LIEU OF PRIVATE ON-SITE PARKING.
   If, in the sole judgment of the Council, it is physically and economically

purpose shall be held in a separate account and used exclusively for the
benefit of public parking in the Central Business District.

or off-street parking or loading space similarly required for any other
building, unless specifically allowed under other provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   No yard, lot or parcel, or combination thereof, which are adjacent
to each other so as to form one lot with continuous frontage and in the same or
similar ownership exercising common control over the entire parcel as a single
unit shall, at any time after the effective date of this chapter, be reduced in
size or area below the minimum requirements set forth in this chapter. Yards or
lots created hereafter must meet at least the minimum size and area
requirements required by the city code.
      (3)   In any district where residential dwellings are permitted, a one-
family detached dwelling may be erected on any lot of official record at the
effective date of this chapter irrespective of its area or width; provided
that, a remaining portion of any adjacent lot of official record is not under
the same or similar ownership exercising common control over the entire parcel
as a single unit; and, further that, all other applicable yard and open space
requirements and setbacks are satisfied or a variance obtained.
   (F)   Accessory uses. The following accessory uses, in addition to those
herein before specified, shall be permitted in any residential district, if the
accessory uses do not alter the character of the premises in respect to their
use for the purposes permitted in the district:
      (1)   The operation of necessary facilities and the equipment in
connection with schools, colleges, universities, hospitals and other
institutions permitted in the district;
      (2)   Recreation, refreshment and service buildings in public parks and
playgrounds; and
      (3)   Fallout shelters.
   (G)   Accessory buildings. Accessory buildings shall occupy the same lot as

      (1)   Separation from main building. All accessory buildings shall be
separated from the main building by ten feet.
      (2)   Private garages. An accessory building used as a private garage
shall be permitted to be located in the rear yard or side yard provided that
setbacks are maintained and the structures do not encroach on recorded
easements. In all residential zones, garages and accessory building shall not
exceed the finished square footage of living space with a cumulative square
footage maximum of 1,200 square feet.
      (3)   Storage buildings. All detached accessory buildings used for
storage or other similar uses shall be permitted to be located in any portion
of the rear yard. No storage building shall be located in the side or front
yard. All storage buildings shall be located no closer than three feet from the
property line, ten feet from any other building or exceed 12 feet in height.
Exception: garages shall be allowed to exceed the height requirement when
constructed in a similar/consistent style with the house. Any storage building
over 120 square feet shall be considered a garage and must meet all State
Building Code requirements and require and building permit.
      (4)   Attachment to other building. In case any accessory building is
attached to the principal or main building, it shall be made structurally a
part of the principal or main building and shall comply in all respects with
the requirements of this chapter applicable to the principal or main building
and the Building Code.
      (5)   Required main structure. On all residential zones no accessory
structure shall exist without a primary dwelling unit on the same parcel or
lot.
   (H)   Placement and screening of microwave dishes in all zoning districts.
      (1)   The purpose of this section is to regulate microwave receiving
dishes within all zoning districts so as to minimize their visual impact.
      (2)   The provisions of this section shall not apply to microwave
receiving dishes having a diameter of one meter (39.4 inches) or less.
      (3)   Any microwave receiving dish shall be screened by sight-obscuring
fences and/or dense landscape buffers.
      (4)   Location on any roof is prohibited.
      (5)   Satellite and/or antenna dishes shall not be located in any front
yard setback or side yard setback.
      (6)   The maximum height from grade level to the highest point of the
receiving dish shall be 15 feet.
      (7)   A zoning permit shall be required for the installation of any dish
or antenna. Zoning permit applications shall require the submission of a site
plan and structural components.
      (8)   Each dish or antenna shall be grounded to protect against natural
lightning strikes in conformance with the National Electrical Code.
      (9)   Dish and antenna electrical equipment and connections shall be
designed and installed in adherence with the National Electrical Code.
   (I)   Screening of microwave dishes in any district.
      (1)   Any ground-mounted microwave receiving dish located in any
district, except for an industrial district shall be screened by dense
landscape buffers.
      (2)   Ground-mounted dishes and antennas shall be set back from all
adjoining lots a distance equivalent to the height of the dish or antenna.
Ground-mounted dishes and antennas shall be located ten feet or more from any
other building or structure on the same lot and shall not be located within a
utility easement. Location shall not adversely obstruct views from an adjacent
property.
(Prior Code, § 11.20)
§ 153.175 FENCES.
   (A)   All fence installations shall be processed with a fence permit
application. No inspection will be required, fees, if any, will be set by
resolution. The application shall contain:
      (1)   Site plan, including lot dimensions, with structure locations
(including setbacks);
      (2)   Location of proposed fence with heights; and
      (3)   Description of materials used for fence.
   (B)   No fence shall exceed six feet in height, from the front of the house
to the back lot lines, and along the back lot line. No fence shall exceed four
feet in height from the front of the house to the front lot line, along front
lot line. Fences erected or other obstructions on corner lots must maintain a
25-foot (from corner pin location) and along the street side, a clear view
triangle. No fence or other obstructions shall exceed three feet in height in
the “clear view area”. It shall be the responsibility of the property owner of
a fence to provide access for reading meters by means of an unlocked gate or
relocation of the meters or reading devices to an accessible location (property
owner’s expense).
   (C)   The city does not dictate which side of the fence must be “finished”.
No fences shall be constructed of light-weight materials such as chicken coop
wire, barbed wire or bamboo. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, chicken
coop wire may be used for vegetable gardens located within the perimeter of
rear or side yards. Products manufactured for other uses such as plywood,
corrugated steel or fiberglass panels are prohibited as allowed fencing
materials.
   (D)   The property owner is responsible for locating property lines.
Property pins may be located at each corner and should be located before a
fence is erected. Property dimensions and street rights-of-way may be obtained
from the Code Official. The owner may also hire a surveyor to locate the
property lines, and this is recommended if the location is in dispute. The city
does not survey properties, or represent a guarantee of lot dimensions or
corner locations. Fences must not encroach on adjacent properties. Maintenance
of both sides of the fence (painting, mowing and the like) should be considered
when determining placement. It is the responsibility of the fence owner to
maintain the fence.
   (E)   The city does not settle property line disputes between neighbors,
including, but not limited to, disputes over placement of fences, hedges and
trees.
   (F)   The city does enforce proper setbacks, as required in other sections
of this chapter. Fences may be placed in easement areas only with approval of
the city’s Public Utilities Departments.
(Prior Code, § 11.21)
NON-CONFORMING LOTS, USES AND STRUCTURES
§ 153.190 INTENT.
   (A)   Within the districts as originally established by this chapter or
amendments thereto or other prior zoning regulations of the city, there exist
lots, structures and uses of land and structures which were lawful before
previous zoning regulations or this chapter were adopted or amended, but which
would be prohibited under the terms of these ordinances and amendments thereto.
   (B)   It is the intent of this subchapter to permit these non-conformities
to continue as provided hereinafter, but not to encourage their survival. The
uses are declared to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts
involved. It is further the intent of this chapter that non-conformities shall
not be enlarged upon, expanded, nor be used as grounds for adding other
structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
   (C)   A non-conforming use of a structure, a non-conforming use of land, or
a non-conforming use of a structure and land shall not be extended or enlarged
after adoption of any ordinance finding such use to be non-conforming by
attachment of additional signs to a building, or the placement of additional
signs or display devices on the land outside the building, or by the addition
of other structures or uses, if the additions are of a nature which would be
prohibited generally in the district involved.
   (D)   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this section shall be deemed to
require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building
on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of
adoption or amendment to this chapter and upon which actual building
construction has been diligently pursued. ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION is hereby defined
to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and
fastening in a permanent manner, and demolition, elimination and removal of an
existing structure in connection with the construction; provided that, actual
construction work shall be diligently pursued until the completion of the
building involved and a building permit is continuously in force and effect for
the construction.
(Prior Code, § 11.23)
§ 153.191 NON-CONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   (A)   In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted,
notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this chapter, a
single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any
single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
chapter which the original provision herein or amendment thereto would have
prohibited the dwelling or accessory building construction. The lot must be in
separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots or parcels in
the same or similar ownership exercising common control over the entire parcel
as a single unit. This provision shall apply even though the lot fails to meet
the requirements for total lot area, width or depth that are generally
applicable in the district; provided that, yard dimensions, setbacks and other
requirements not involving total lot area, width or depth of lots shall conform
to the regulations for the district in which the lot is located unless a
variance is obtained for the requirements.
   (B)   If two or more lots or combination of lots and portions of lots or
parcels, or portions thereof, with continuous frontage are in the same or
similar ownership exercising common control of the entire parcel as a single
unit at any time after the effective date of this chapter, and the lots or
parcels together do not meet the requirements for lot width, depth and total
lot area as established in this chapter, the lands involved shall be considered
to be a non-divisible parcel for the purposes of this chapter, and no portion
of the parcel shall be used or sold which does not meet lot width, depth and
total lot area requirements established by this chapter unless all or a portion
of the land is sold or combined with adjoining other parcels so as to meet or
exceed the requirements. No division of any parcel of land may be made which
leaves any remaining portion of the land with a width, depth or total lot area
below the requirements stated in this chapter unless a variance is obtained.
(Prior Code, § 11.23)
§ 153.192 NON-CONFORMING USES OF LAND.
   Where, at the original effective date of this chapter or amendment thereto,
or other prior zoning regulations of the city, wherein the lawful use of land
existed prior to the adoption thereof and that under the provisions thereof,
the use was no longer permissible under the terms thereof as enacted or
amended, such use may be continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful,
subject to the following provisions.
   (A)   No non-conforming use of land shall be enlarged, increased or extended
to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied on the effective date of the
ordinance making the use non-conforming.
   (B)   No non-conforming use of land shall be moved in whole or in part to
any other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by the use at the effective
date of the ordinance making the use non-conforming.
   (C)   If any non-conforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period
of more than 90 days, any subsequent use of the land shall conform to the
regulations specified in this chapter for the district in which the land is
located.
   (D)   A non-conforming use of land shall not be changed to another non-
conforming use of land. When any non-conforming use of land has been changed to
a conforming use of land, it shall not thereafter be changed to any non-
conforming use.
   (E)   A non-conforming use of land may be changed to lessen the non-
conformity of that use of land. Thereafter, the use of the land may not be
altered so as to increase the non-conformity.
(Prior Code, § 11.23)
§ 153.193 NON-CONFORMING USE OF STRUCTURES.
   (A)   The lawful use of a structure existing at the original effective date
of this chapter, or amendments thereto, or other prior zoning regulations
which, under the provisions of the ordinances or regulations do not conform to
the provisions therein, shall be discontinued within a reasonable period of
amortization of the structure thereafter. A reasonable period of amortization
shall begin after the date of the adoption of the ordinance or regulation
finding it to be non-conforming and shall be considered to be 40 years for
buildings of ordinary wood construction, 50 years for buildings of wood and
masonry construction and 60 years for buildings of fire-proof type
construction. The reasonable period of amortization for other structures shall
be ten years.
   (B)   No structure which contains a non-conforming use may be enlarged,
extended, converted, reconstructed or structurally altered unless the use of
the structure is changed to one permitted within the district in which the
building is located and the non-conforming use thereof shall not thereafter be
resumed.
   (C)   No structure containing a non-conforming use destroyed by any peril or
means to an extent where the cost to repair the damage to the structure equals
or exceeds the most current assessor’s market value prior to the time of the
damage shall be reconstructed or repaired, except in conformity with the
provisions of this chapter.
   (D)   Should the structure containing a non-conforming use be moved for any
reason for any distance whatsoever, it shall thereafter conform to the
regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved.
   (E)   When a structure containing a non-conforming use, or the use and
premises in combination, is discontinued or abandoned for six consecutive
months or any 18 months during any three-year period, the structure, or
structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be used, except in
conformance with the regulations of the district in which it is located.
   (F)   Whenever a structure containing a non-conforming use, or the use and
premises in combination, loses its right to lawful use under the provisions of
this section, the Council may, at any time thereafter, require the use of such
structure to conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located
or its removal and destruction. Failure on the part of the Council to make the
requirement within any period of time after its use becomes unlawful shall not
abrogate its right to do so at any future time.
   (G)   On any structure devoted in whole or in part to any non-conforming
use, work may be done in any 12 consecutive month period on ordinary repairs
and maintenance to non-bearing non-structural walls, fixtures, wiring or
plumbing, to an extent not exceeding 10% of the most current assessed market
value of the structure; provided that, the cubical and habitable space content
of the building as it existed at the time it became non-conforming shall not be
increased.
   (H)   Nothing in this section shall be construed so as to prevent the
restoring of a structure containing a non-conforming use to a safe condition
when the structure is declared to be hazardous or unsafe by an authorized
government official unless the cost of the restoration equals or exceeds the
most current assessor’s market value of the structure or a conditional use
permit is obtained. The restoration shall not extend the non-conforming use of
a structure in any manner, except as reasonably required to eliminate the
hazardous or unsafe condition, nor shall the amortization period for its
existence be extended. Non-structural and minor alterations may be made to any
residential structure containing non-conforming residential dwelling units when
the same will improve the liveability of the units; provided that, it does not
increase the number of dwelling units in the structure. Any non-conforming use
of a structure, or non-conforming use of a structure and premises combination,
to which its non-conformance relates solely to floodplain regulations may, if
permitted by the regulations, alter the structure for purposes of substantially
reducing potential flood damages to the entire structure. In no event shall any
repair or maintenance or other alteration to a non-conforming use of a
structure be allowed which would extend or intensify the non-conforming use of
the structure.
(Prior Code, § 11.23)
§ 153.194 NON-CONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   Well-maintained non-conforming structures which contain conforming uses may
be maintained, altered, enlarged and rebuilt; provided, the altered structure
is no less conforming than before the alteration.
