   All newly elected members of the Commission shall take office at the first
regular meeting in January next following the regular City election at which
they are elected. Thereafter the Commission shall meet at such time or times
each month as may be prescribed by ordinance or resolution; provided, that the
Commission shall hold at least one (1) regular meeting each month. The Mayor,
or any two (2) members of the Commission, may call special meetings of the
Commission upon such notice as is provided by ordinance or statute. Notice of
such meetings may be given to the members of the Commission by any means
provided in its rules. All meetings of the Commission shall be public, except
as otherwise provided by statute, and any citizen shall have access to the
minutes and records thereof at all reasonable times.
SECTION 4.02.  RULES OP PROCEDURE AND QUORUM.
   The Commission shall determine its own rules and order of business. Three
(3) members of the Commission shall constitute a quorum to do business, but a

members.
SECTION 4.03.  ORDINANCES, RESOLUTIONS, AND MOTIONS.
   Except as in this Charter otherwise provided, all legislation shall be by
ordinance. The aye and no vote on ordinances, resolutions, and motions shall be
recorded unless the vote is unanimous. An affirmative vote of at least three
(3) members of the Commission shall be required for the adoption of all
ordinances and resolutions, except as otherwise provided in this Charter.
SECTION 4.04.  ORDINANCE ADOPTION, AMENDMENT AND REPEAL PROCEDURE.
Subd. 1. Form and Adoption. The ordaining clause of all ordinances shall be in
the words, “The City of Glenwood ordains”. Every ordinance, except an emergency
ordinance, shall be introduced in writing and at a regular meeting, and may be
adopted at any meeting occurring at least seven (7) days after the meeting at
which it was introduced. No ordinance shall contain more than one (1) subject
which shall be clearly expressed in its title.
Subd. 2. Signing and Publication. Every ordinance adopted by the Commission
shall be signed by the Mayor or by two (2) other members, attested by the City
Administrator and filed and preserved by him. Every ordinance shall be
published once in the official newspaper. However, as to lengthy ordinances, or
ordinances which include charts or maps, the Commission may, by unanimous vote,
determine that publication of the title and a summary of an ordinance would
clearly inform the public of the intent and effect of such ordinance, and
direct that only the title and summary be published with a notice that a
printed copy of the ordinance is available for inspection during regular office
hours at the office of the City Administrator and at the City Library. The text
of the summary shall be approved by the Commission prior to publication. Such
publication shall be deemed to fulfill all legal requirements for publication
as completely as if the entire ordinance had been published. Proof of
publication shall be attached to and filed with the ordinance. To the extent
and in the manner provided by law an ordinance may incorporate by reference a
statute of Minnesota, a State administrative rule or a regulation, a code, or
ordinance or part thereof without publishing the material referred to in full.
Subd. 3. Emergency. An emergency ordinance is an ordinance necessary for the
immediate preservation of the public peace, health, morals, safety or welfare
in which the emergency is defined and declared in a preamble thereto. No
prosecution shall be based upon the provisions of any emergency ordinance until
twenty-four (24) hours after the ordinance has been filed with the City
Administrator and posted in three (3) conspicuous places or until the ordinance
has been once published in the official newspaper, unless the person charged
with violation had actual notice of the adoption of the ordinance prior to the
act or omission of which complaint is made.
Subd. 4. When Effective. An emergency ordinance shall take effect immediately
upon its adoption or at such later date as is fixed therein. Every other
ordinance shall take effect seven (7) days after publication or at such later
date as is fixed therein. Every ordinance adopted by the voters of the City
shall take effect immediately upon its adoption, or at such later time as is
fixed therein.
Subd. 5. Amendment or Repeal. Every ordinance repealing a previous ordinance or
section or subdivision of a codification shall give the number, if any, and the
title of the ordinance or section or subdivision to be repealed in whole or in
part. No ordinance or section, or subdivision shall be amended by reference to
the title alone, but such an amending ordinance shall set forth in full each
section, subdivision or subparagraph so amended.
SECTION 4.05.  CODIFICATION OF ORDINANCES.
   The City may revise, re-arrange and codify its ordinances with such
additions and deletions as may be deemed necessary by the Commission. Such
ordinance code shall be published in book, pamphlet or continuously revised
loose-leaf form and copies shall be made available by the Commission at the
office of the City Administrator for general distribution to the public free or
at a reasonable charge. Distribution in such published form shall be a
sufficient notice of any ordinance provision not previously published.
SECTION 4.06.  RESOLUTIONS.
   Every resolution shall be presented in writing unless such form is waived by
the unanimous consent of the Commission. All resolutions shall be signed by the
Mayor or two (2) other members of the Commission, attested by the City
Administrator and filed and preserved by him. All resolutions take effect
immediately upon adoption or at such later date as is fixed therein.
CHAPTER 5

SECTION 5.01.  REGULAR CITY ELECTION.
   A regular City election shall be held on the first Tuesday after the first
Monday in November of each even-numbered year at such place or places as the
Commission may designate. There shall be no City primary election, but the
candidate for Mayor (in alternate elections), and the two (2) candidates for
Commissioner, receiving a plurality of the votes over the other candidates
shall be elected.
SECTION 5.02.  SPECIAL ELECTIONS.
   The Commission may by resolution order a special election and provide all
means for holding it. The procedure at such election shall conform as nearly as
possible to that prescribed for other municipal elections.
SECTION 5.03.  ELECTION NOTICE.
   The City Administrator shall give at least two (2) weeks previous notice of
the time and place of holding all elections and of the officers to be elected,
or the issue to be decided, by posting in at least one (1) public place in each
voting precinct and by publication at least once in the official newspaper, but
failure to give such notice shall not invalidate such election.
SECTION 5.04.  CANVASS OF ELECTIONS.
   The Commission shall meet and canvass the election returns within five (5)
days after any election, and shall make full declaration of the results as soon
as possible, and file a statement thereof with the City Administrator. This
statement shall include: (a) the total number of good ballots cast; (b) the
total number of spoiled or defective ballots; (c) the vote for each candidate,
with an indication of those who were elected, or the result of any issue
decided; (d) a true copy of the ballots used; (e) the names of the judges and
clerks of election; and (f) such other information as may seem pertinent. The

to elections shall apply to municipal elections.
CHAPTER 6
INITIATIVE, REFERENDUM, AND RECALL
SECTION 6.01.  POWERS RESERVED BY THE PEOPLE.
   The people of the City reserve to themselves the power, in accordance with
the provisions of this Charter, to initiate and adopt any ordinance, except an
ordinance appropriating money or authorizing the levy of taxes, to require such
an ordinance when adopted by the Commission to be referred to the registered
voters for approval or disapproval, and to recall elected public officials.
These powers shall be called the initiative, the referendum, and the recall,
respectively.
SECTION 6.02.  FURTHER REGULATIONS.
   The Commission may provide by ordinance such further regulations for the
initiative, referendum, and recall, not inconsistent with this Charter, as it
deems necessary.
Initiative
SECTION 6.03.  INITIATION OF MEASURES.
   Any five (5) registered voters may form themselves into a committee for the
initiation of any ordinance except as provided in Section
6.01. Before circulating any petition they shall file a certified copy of their
proposed ordinance with the City Administrator together with their names and
addresses as members of such committee. They shall also attach a verified copy
of the proposed ordinance to each of the signature papers herein described,
together with their names and addresses as sponsors therefor.
SECTION 6.04.  FORM OF PETITION AND OF SIGNATURE PAPERS.
   The petition for the adoption of any ordinances shall consist of the
ordinance, together with all signature papers and affidavits thereto attached.
Such petition shall not be complete unless signed by fifty registered voters.
All the signatures need not be on one (1) signature paper, but the circulator
of every such paper shall make an affidavit that each signature appended to the
paper is the genuine signature of the person whose name it purports to be. Each
signature paper shall be in substantially the following form:
Initiative Petition
proposing an ordinance to ______________ (stating the purpose of the
ordinance), a copy of which ordinance is hereto attached. This ordinance is
sponsored by the following committee of registered voters:
      Name               Address
      1. _________________   __________________________________
      2. _________________   __________________________________
      3. _________________   __________________________________
   The undersigned registered voters understanding the terms and the nature of
the ordinance hereto attached, petition the Commission for its adoption, or, in
lieu thereof, for its submission to the registered voters for their approval.
      1. ____________________________   _____________________________
      2. ____________________________   _____________________________
      3. ____________________________   _____________________________
   At the end of the list of signatures shall be appended the affidavit of the
circulator mentioned above.
SECTION 6.05.  FILING OF PETITIONS AND ACTION THEREON.
   All the signature papers shall be filed in the office of the City
Administrator as one (1) instrument. Within five (5) days after the filing of
the petition, the City Administrator shall ascertain by examination the number
of registered voters whose signatures are appended thereto and whether this
number is at least fifty (50).
   If he finds the petition insufficient or irregular, he shall at once notify
one or more of the committee of sponsors of that fact, certifying the reasons
for his finding. The committee shall then be given thirty (30) days in which to
file additional signature papers and to correct the petition in all other
particulars.
   If at the end of that period the petition is found to be still insufficient
or irregular, the Administrator shall file it in his office and shall notify
each member of the committee of that fact. The final finding of the
insufficiency or irregularity of a petition shall not prejudice the filing of a
new petition for the same purpose, nor shall it prevent the Commission from
referring the ordinance to the registered voters at the next regular or any
special election at its option.
SECTION 6.06.  ACTION OF COMMISSION ON PETITION.
   When the petition is found to be sufficient, the City Administrator shall so
certify to the Commission at its next meeting, stating the number of
petitioners and the percentage of the total number of voters which they
constitute, and the Commission shall at once read the ordinance and refer it to
an appropriate committee, which may be a committee of the whole. The Commission
shall thereupon provide for public hearings upon the ordinance, after the
holding of which the ordinance shall be finally acted upon by the Commission
not later than sixty-five (65) days after the date upon which it was submitted
to the Commission by the City Administrator. If the Commission fails to adopt
the proposed ordinance, or it is adopted in a form different from that set
forth in the petition and unsatisfactory to the petitioners, the proposed
ordinance shall be submitted by the Commission to the vote of the registered
voters at the next election; but if the number of signers of the petition is at
least equal to fifteen (15) percent of the number of voters casting ballots at
the last regular municipal election, the Commission shall call a special
election upon the measure. Such special Election shall be held not less than
thirty (30) nor more than forty-five (45) days from the date of final action on
the ordinance by the Commission or after the expiration of sixty-five (65) days
from the date of submission to the Commission when there has been no final
action; but if a regular election is to occur within three (3) months, the
Commission may submit the ordinance at that election. If the Commission passes
the proposed ordinance with amendments and at least four-fifths (4/5) of the
committee of petitioners do not express their dissatisfaction with such amended
form by a statement filed with the City Administrator within ten (10) days of
the adoption thereof by the Commission, the ordinance need not be submitted to
the registered voters.
SECTION 6.07.  INITIATIVE BALLOTS.
   The ballots used when voting upon any such proposed ordinance shall state
the substance of the ordinance and shall give the voters the opportunity to
vote either “yes” or “no” on the question of adoption. If a majority of the
registered voters voting on any such ordinance vote in favor of it, it shall
thereupon become an ordinance of the City. Any number of proposed ordinances
may be voted upon at the same election but the voter shall be allowed to vote
for or against each separately. In case of inconsistency between two (2)
initiated ordinances approved at one (1) election, the one (1) approved by the
higher percentage of registered voters voting on the question shall prevail to
the extent of the inconsistency.
SECTION 6.08.  INITIATION OF CHARTER AMENDMENTS.
   Nothing in this Charter shall be construed as in any way affecting the right
of the registered voters under the Constitution and statutes of Minnesota to
propose amendments to this Charter.
Referendum
SECTION 6.09.  THE REFERENDUM.
   If, prior to the date when an ordinance takes effect, a petition is signed
by a number at least equal to fifteen (15) percent of the number of voters
casting ballots in the last regular municipal election, and is filed with the
City Administrator requesting that any such ordinance be repealed or be
submitted to a vote of the registered voters, the ordinance shall thereby be
prevented from taking effect. The Commission shall thereupon reconsider the
ordinance at its next regular meeting, and either repeal it or by aye and no
vote reaffirm its adherence to the ordinance as passed. In the latter case the
Commission shall immediately order a special election to be held thereon, or
submit the ordinance at the next election, pending which the ordinance shall
remain suspended. If a majority of the registered voters voting thereon is
opposed to the ordinance, it shall not become effective; but if a majority of
the registered voters voting thereon favors the ordinance, it shall go into
effect immediately or on the date therein specified.
SECTION 6.10.  REFERENDUM PETITIONS.
   The requirements laid down in Sections
6.03 and
6.04 above as to the formation of committees for the initiation of ordinances
and as to the form of petitions and signature papers shall apply to the
referendum as far as possible, but with such verbal changes as may be
necessary. A referendum petition shall read as follows:
Referendum Petition
proposing the repeal of an ordinance to (stating the purpose of the ordinance),
a copy of which ordinance is hereto attached. The proposed repeal is sponsored
by the following committee of registered voters:

attached and believing it to be detrimental to the welfare of the City,
petition the Commission for its submission to a vote of the registered voters
for their approval or disapproval.
      Name                              Address

      2. ______________________________       ______________________________
      3. ______________________________       ______________________________
SECTION 6.11.  REFERENDUM BALLOTS.

down in Section
6.07 of this Charter for initiative ballots.
Recall
SECTION 6.12.  THE RECALL.
   Any five (5) registered voters may form themselves into a committee for the
purpose of bringing about the recall of any elected officer of the City. The
committee shall certify to the City Administrator the name of the officer whose
removal is sought, a statement of the grounds for removal in not more than two
hundred and fifty (250) words, and their intention to bring about his recall. A
copy of this certificate shall be attached to each signature paper and no
signature paper shall be put into circulation previous to such certification.
SECTION 6.13.  RECALL PETITIONS.
   The petition for the recall of any official shall consist of a certificate
identical with that filed with the City Administrator together with all the
signature papers and affidavits thereto attached. All the signatures need not
be on one (1) signature paper, but the circulator of every paper shall make an
affidavit that each signature appended to the paper is the genuine signature of
the person whose name it purports to be. Each signature paper shall be in
substantially the following form:
Recall Petition
proposing the recall of _______________________ from his office as ____________
which recall is sought for  the reasons set forth in the attached certificate.
This movement is sponsored by the following committee of registered voters:

   At the end of the list of signatures shall be appended the affidavit of the
circulator.
SECTION 6.14.  FILING OF PETITION.
   Within thirty (30) days after the filing of the original certificate, the
committee shall file the completed petition in the office of the City
Administrator. The City Administrator shall examine the petition within the
next following five (5) days, and if he finds it irregular in any way or finds
that the number of signers is less than twenty-five (25) percent of the number
of voters casting ballots in the last regular municipal election, he shall so
notify one (1) or more members of the committee. The committee shall then be
given ten (10) days in which to file additional signature papers and to correct
the petition in all other respects, but they may not change the statement of
the grounds upon which the recall is sought. If at the end of that time the
City Administrator finds the petition still insufficient or irregular, he shall
notify all the members of the committee to that effect and shall file the
petition in his office. No further action shall be taken thereon.
SECTION 6.15.  RECALL ELECTION.
   If a petition or amended petition is found sufficient, the City
Administrator shall transmit it to the Commission without delay, and shall also
officially notify the person sought to be recalled of the sufficiency of the
petition and of the pending action. The Commission shall at its next meeting,
by resolution, provide for the holding of a special election not less than
forty-five (45) nor more than sixty (60) days after such meeting, but if any
other election is to occur within sixty (60) days after such meeting, the
Commission may in its discretion provide for the holding of the recall election
at that time.
SECTION 6.16.  PROCEDURE AT RECALL ELECTION.
   The City Administrator shall include with the published or posted notice of
the election the statement of the grounds for the recall and also, in not more
than five hundred (500) words, the answer of the officer concerned in
justification of his course in office. Candidates to succeed the officer to be
recalled shall be nominated in the usual way, and the election shall be
conducted as far as possible, in accordance with the usual procedure in
municipal elections.
SECTION 6.17.  FORM OF RECALL BALLOT.
   Unless the officer whose removal is sought resigns within ten (10) days
after the receipt by the Commission of the completed recall petition, the form
of the ballot at such election shall be as near as may be: “Shall
_________________ be recalled?” the name of the officer whose recall is sought
being inserted in the blank, and the registered voters shall be permitted to
vote separately “yes” or “no” upon this question. The ballot shall also contain
the names of the candidates to be voted upon to fill the vacancy, in case the
recall is successful, under the caption: “Candidates to fill the place of
___________, if recalled”; but the officer whose recall is sought shall not
himself be a candidate upon such ballot. If a majority of those voting on the
question of recall vote in favor of recall, the official shall be thereby
removed from office, and the candidate who receives the highest number of votes
for his place shall be elected thereto for the remainder of the unexpired term.
If the officer sought to be recalled resigns within ten (10) days after the
receipt by the Commission of the completed recall petition, the form of ballot
at the election shall be the same, as nearly as possible, as the form in use at
a regular election.
CHAPTER 7
TAXATION AND FINANCES
SECTION 7.01.  COMMISSION TO CONTROL FINANCES.
   The Commission shall have full authority over the financial affairs of the
City. It shall provide for the collection of all revenues and other assets the
auditing and settlement of accounts, and the safekeeping and disbursement of
public moneys.
SECTION 7.02.  FISCAL YEAR.
   The fiscal year of the City shall be the calendar year.
SECTION 7.03.  SYSTEM OF TAXATION.
   Subject to the State Constitution, and except as forbidden by it or by State
law, the Commission shall have full power to provide by ordinance for a system
of local taxation. This authority includes the power by ordinance to assess,
levy, and collect taxes on all subjects or objects of taxation except as
limited or prohibited by the State Constitution, by this Charter or by laws
imposing restrictions upon the City irrespective of Charter provisions.
SECTION 7.04.  SUBMISSION OF BUDGET.
   Annually the City Administrator shall submit to the Commission his
recommended budget as directed by a budget calendar to be established by the
Commission or, in the absence thereof, by September 1. The budget shall provide
a complete financial plan for all City funds and activities for the ensuing
fiscal year and, except as required by law or Charter, shall contain such
information and be in such form as the City Administrator deems desirable or
the Commission may require. It shall include a summary and show in detail all
estimated income and all proposed expenditures, including debt service and
comparative figures for the current fiscal year, actual and estimated, and the
preceding fiscal year. In addition to showing proposed expenditures for current
operations, it shall show proposed capital expenditures to be made during
ensuing years and the proposed method of financing each such capital
expenditure. For each utility operated by the City, the budget shall show
anticipated net surplus or deficit and the proposed method of its disposition.
The total proposed operating budget to be provided from the property tax shall
not exceed the amounts authorized by law and this Charter.
SECTION 7.05.  COMMISSION ACTION ON BUDGET.
   The budget shall be considered at the first regular monthly meeting of the
Commission in September and at subsequent meetings until a budget is adopted
for the ensuing year. The meetings shall be so conducted as to give interested
citizens a reasonable opportunity to be heard. The Commission may revise the
proposed budget but no amendment to the budget shall increase the authorized
expenditures to an amount greater than the estimated fund balances. The
Commission shall adopt the budget not later than the first week of October by a
resolution which shall set forth the total for each budgeted fund and each
department with such segregation as to objects and purposes of expenditures as
the Commission deems necessary for purposes of budget control. The Commission
shall also adopt a resolution levying the amount of taxes provided in the
budget and the City Administrator shall certify the tax resolution to the
County Auditor in accordance with law not later than October 10. Adoption of
the budget resolution shall constitute appropriations at the beginning of the
fiscal year of the sums fixed in the resolution for the several purposes named.
The sums constituting an individual appropriation shall be the aggregate of all
minor line item amounts contained in the detailed budget resolution for major
categories of expenditures by general function or department within each fund.
The Commission shall, when adopting each budget, determine such major
categories in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices.
SECTION 7.06.  ENFORCEMENT OF THE BUDGET.
   The City Administrator shall enforce strictly the provisions of the budget.
He shall not authorize any payment or the incurring of any obligation by the
City unless an appropriation has been made for the same and there is a
sufficient unexpended balance left after deducting the total past expenditures
and encumbrances against the appropriation. No officer or employee of the City
shall place any order or make any purchase for a purpose not authorized in the
budget resolution. Any obligation incurred by any person in the employ of the
City for any purpose not authorized in the budget resolution or for any amount
exceeding an appropriation shall be a personal obligation upon the person
incurring the obligation. No check shall be issued or transfer made to any
account other than one (1) owned by the City until the claim to which it
relates has been supported by an itemized bill, payroll, or time-sheet or other
document approved and signed by the responsible City officer who vouches for
its correctness and reasonableness.
SECTION 7.07.  ALTERATIONS IN THE BUDGET.
   After the budget resolution has been adopted, the Commission shall not
increase the appropriations beyond the estimated revenue sources except to the
extent that such sources exceed the estimate. At any time the Commission may,
by resolution approved by a majority of its members, reduce the sums
appropriated for any purpose by the budget resolution, or authorize the
transfer of sums from unencumbered balances of appropriations in the budget
resolution to other purposes.
SECTION 7.08.  FUNDS.
   There shall be maintained in the City Treasury a general fund and such other
funds as may be required by statute, ordinance or resolution. The Commission
may, by ordinance or resolution, make inter-fund loans, except from trust and
agency funds, as it may deem necessary and appropriate.
SECTION 7.09.  CITY INDEBTEDNESS.
   Except as provided in Sections
7.10 and
7.11, no obligations shall be issued to pay current expenses, but the
Commission may issue and sell obligations for any other municipal purpose in
accordance with law and within the limitations prescribed by law. Except in the
case of obligations for which an election is not required by this Charter or by
law, no such obligations shall be issued and sold without the approval of the
majority of the voters voting on the question at a general or special election.
SECTION 7.10.  ANTICIPATION CERTIFICATES.
   At any time after January 1, the Commission may issue certificates of
indebtedness in anticipation of State and Federal aids and the collection of
taxes levied the previous year for any fund and not yet collected. The total
amount of certificates issued against any fund for any year together with
interest thereon until maturity shall not exceed the total of State and Federal
aids and current taxes due to the fund and uncollected at the time of issuance.
Such certificates shall be issued on such terms and conditions as the
Commission may determine, but they shall become due not later than April 1 of
the year following their issuance. The proceeds of the tax levied and such
State or Federal aids as the governing body may have allocated for the fund
against which tax anticipation certificates are issued and the full faith and
credit of the City shall be irrevocably pledged for the redemption of the
certificates.
SECTION 7.11.  EMERGENCY DEBT CERTIFICATES.
   If in any year the receipts from taxes or other sources should from some
unforeseen cause become insufficient for the ordinary expenses of the City, or
if any calamity or other public emergency necessitates the making of
extraordinary expenditures, the Commission may by ordinance issue on such terms
and in such manner as the Commission determines emergency debt certificates to
run not to exceed three (3) years. A tax sufficient to pay principal and
interest on such certificates with the margin required by law shall be levied
as required by law. The ordinance authorizing an issue of such emergency debt
certificates shall state the nature of the emergency and be approved by a
unanimous vote of the Commission. It may be passed as an emergency ordinance.
SECTION 7.12.  BANK LOANS.
   Whenever the Commission, by resolution, deems it necessary and advantageous,
it may borrow money from any bank for the purpose of financing any authorized
capital improvement or other purpose as allowed by this Charter or by law. Such
loans shall be payable within a maximum period of seven (7) years and shall be
issued on such terms and in such manner as the Commission may determine. If the
amount of the obligations to be issued to finance any such purchase exceeds one
(1) percent of the assessed valuation of the City, excluding money and credits,
they shall not be issued for at least thirty (30) days after publication in the
official newspaper of a Commission resolution determining to issue them; and
if, before the end of that time, the petition asking for an election on the
proposition, signed by at least a number equal to fifteen (15) percent of the
number of voters casting ballots in the last regular municipal election, is
filed with the City Administrator, such obligations shall not be issued until
the proposition for their issuance has been approved by a majority of the votes
cast on the question at a regular or special election. A tax levy shall be made
for the payment of the principal and interest on such obligations as in the
case of bonds as prescribed by law. In lieu of borrowing money by bank loans as
authorized by this Section, the Commission may issue any other form of legal
City obligation as allowed by law or by this Charter.
CHAPTER 8
PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS AND SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS
SECTION 8.01.  POWER TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS AND LEVY ASSESSMENTS.
   The City shall have the power to make any and every type of public
improvement not forbidden by the laws of this State and to levy special
assessments to pay all or any part of the cost of such improvements as are of a
local character. The amounts assessed to benefited property to pay for such
local improvements may equal the cost of the improvement, including all costs
and expenses connected therewith, with interest, until paid, but shall in no
case exceed the benefits to the property.
SECTION 8.02.  ASSESSMENTS FOR SERVICES.
   The Commission may provide by ordinance that the cost of sprinkling, snow or
rubbish removal, or of any other service to streets, sidewalks, or other public
property, or the costs of any services to other property undertaken by the City
may be assessed against the property benefited and collected in like manner as
are special assessments.
SECTION 8.03.  LOCAL IMPROVEMENTS REGULATIONS.
   After this Charter takes effect local improvements commenced prior thereto
shall be completed and assessments may be levied and securities issued for the
financing thereof as prescribed by the law (or Charter provisions) applicable
thereto. The Commission may prepare and adopt a comprehensive ordinance
prescribing the procedure which shall be followed thereafter in making all
local improvements and levying assessments therefor. The Commission may elect
to use State law or the local improvement ordinance for the purpose of
providing local improvements and assessments thereof.
SECTION. 8.04.  PUBLIC WORK; HOW PERFORMED.
   Public works, including all local improvements, may be constructed,
extended, repaired, and maintained either directly by day labor or by contract.
The City shall require contractors to give bonds for the protection of the City
and all persons furnishing labor and materials pursuant to the laws of the
State.
CHAPTER 9
EMINENT DOMAIN
SECTION 9.01.  POWER TO ACQUIRE PROPERTY.
   The City may acquire, by purchase, gift, devise, or condemnation, any
property, corporeal or incorporeal, either within or without its corporate
boundaries, which may be needed by the City for any public use or purpose.
Easements for slopes, fills, sewers, building lines, poles, wires, pipes, and
conduits for water, gas, heat, and power or for any other public use, may be
acquired by gift, devise, purchase, or condemnation in the manner provided by
law. All such property acquisitions, including condemnation, shall be made
under provisions of State law or other applicable law or regulation.
CHAPTER 10
FRANCHISES
SECTION 10.01.  FRANCHISES REQUIRED.
   Except as otherwise provided by law, no person, firm, or corporation shall
place or maintain any permanent or semi-permanent fixtures in, over, upon, or
under any street or public place for the purpose of operating a public utility
or for any other purpose, without a franchise therefor from the City. A
franchise shall be granted only by ordinance, which shall not be an emergency
ordinance. Every ordinance granting a franchise shall contain all the terms and
conditions of the franchise. The grantee shall bear the costs of publication of
the franchise ordinance and shall make a sufficient deposit with the City
Administrator to guarantee publication before the ordinance is passed.
SECTION 10.02.  TERM.
   No exclusive or perpetual franchise shall ever be granted. No franchise for
a term exceeding fifteen years shall be effective until approved by a majority
of the registered voters voting thereon at a special election called for that
purpose. The cost of the special election shall be borne by the proposed
grantee named in the franchise.
SECTION 10.03.  PUBLIC HEARING.
   Before any franchise ordinance is adopted, the Commission shall hold a
public hearing on the matter. Notice of such hearing shall be published at
least once in the official newspaper not less than ten  (10) days prior to the
date of the hearing.
SECTION 10.04.  POWER OF REGULATION RESERVED.
   Subject to any applicable law the Commission may by ordinance reasonably
regulate and control the exercise of any franchise, including the maximum
rates, fares, or prices to be charged by the grantee.
SECTION 10.05.  RENEWALS OR EXTENSIONS.
   Every renewal or modification of a franchise, including an existing
franchise, shall be subject to the same limitations and shall be granted in the
same manner as a new franchise.
SECTION 10.06.  CONDITIONS IN EVERY FRANCHISE.
   Every franchise which does not contain the provisions prescribed in this
Section shall be absolutely void and incapable of ratification by estoppel or
otherwise. Every franchise shall contain the following provisions: (1) That the
grantee shall be subject to and will perform on its part all the terms of
Sections
10.01 through
10.07, inclusive, as well as all other pertinent provisions of this Charter;
(2) That the grantee shall in no case claim or pretend to exercise any power to
fix fares, rates and charges; but that such fares, rates and charges shall at
all times be just, fair and reasonable for the services rendered and shall in
all cases be fixed and from time to time changed in the manner provided in
Section
10.04 of this Charter; (3) That the Commission shall have the right to require
reasonable extensions of any public service system from time to time, and to
make such rules and regulations as may be required to secure adequate and
proper service and to provide sufficient accommodations for the public; (4)
That the grantee shall not issue any capital stock on account of the franchise
or the value thereof, and that the grantee shall have no right to receive upon
condemnation proceedings brought by the City to acquire the public utility
exercising such franchise, any return on account of the franchise or its value;
(5) That no sale or lease of said franchise shall be effective until the
assignee or lessee shall have filed in the office of the City Administrator an
instrument, duly executed, reciting the facts of such sale or lease, accepting
the terms of the franchise, and agreeing to perform all the conditions required
of the grantee thereunder. The assignee or lessee shall also file a bond in
such amount and with such conditions as the Commission may require, which bond
shall run to the City as obligee, with sureties satisfactory to the Commission,
and shall obligate the assignee or lessee to discharge all obligations and
liabilities imposed by said franchise; (6) That every grant, in said franchise
contained, of permission for the erection of poles, masts or other fixtures in
the streets and for the attachment of wires thereto, or for the laying of
tracks in, or of pipes or conduits under the streets or public places, or for
the placing on the streets or other public places of any permanent or semi-
permanent fixtures whatsoever, shall be subject to the conditions that the
Commission shall have the power to require such alterations therein, or
relocation or rerouting thereof, as the Commission may at any time deem
necessary for the safety, health or convenience of the public, and particularly
that it shall have the power to require the removal of poles, masts and other
fixtures bearing wires and the placing under ground of all wires for whatsoever
purposes used; (7) Every franchise and every extension or removal of such
franchise, shall contain a provision for its acceptance in writing by the
grantee within thirty days after its passage by the Commission and before its
submission to a vote of the people in case of a referendum. No such franchise
shall be binding upon the City until its acceptance by the grantee. Such
acceptance shall be construed to be an acceptance of, and consent to, all the
terms, conditions and limitations contained in the ordinance granting the
franchise as well as of the provisions of this Charter; (8) Every franchise
shall be granted subject to the right of the City to acquire all rights and
property thereunder within the City limits by eminent domain. The violation by
the holder of any franchise of any of the express provisions prescribed by this
Section, or a failure to supply a reasonably adequate service under any
franchise, shall be a sufficient cause for the forfeiture of all rights under
such franchise by a resolution of the Commission.
SECTION 10.07.  LIMITATIONS.
   The enumeration in this Charter of particular matters which must be included
in every franchise shall not be construed as limiting the right of the City to
insert in such franchise such other and further conditions and restrictions as
the Commission may deem necessary or proper to protect the City’s interests;
nor shall anything contained in this Charter limit the right or power possessed
by the City over existing franchises.
CHAPTER 11

SECTION 11.01.  ACQUISITION AND OPERATION OF UTILITIES.
   The City may own and operate, any gas, water, heat, power, light, telephone
or other public utility for supplying its own needs for utility service or for
supplying utility service to private consumers or both. It may construct all
facilities reasonably needed for that purpose and may acquire any existing
utility properties so needed; but no proceedings to acquire any such public
utility shall be consummated unless the City has the money in the treasury to
pay for acquisition or has made provision for paying for the property proposed
to be acquired. The operation of all public utilities owned by the City shall
be under the supervision of the Commission.
SECTION 11.02.  RATES AND FINANCES.
   Upon recommendations made by the City Administrator or upon its own motion,
the Commission may fix rates, fares and prices, for municipal utilities but
such rates, fares and prices shall be just and reasonable. In like manner the
Commission may prescribe the time and manner in which payments for all such
services shall be made, and may make such other regulations as may be
necessary, and prescribe penalties for violation of such regulations.
SECTION 11.03.  PURCHASE IN BULK.
   The Commission may, in lieu of providing for the local production of gas,
electricity, water, and other utilities, purchase the same in bulk and resell
them to local consumers at such rates as it may fix.
SECTION 11.04.  LEASE OF PLANT.
   The Commission may, if the public interests will be served thereby, contract
with any responsible person, co-partnership, or corporation, for the operation
of any utility owned by the City, upon such rentals and conditions as it may
deem necessary; but such contract shall be embodied in and let only by an
ordinance approved by unanimous vote of the Commission and subject to popular
referendum. Such ordinance shall not be an emergency ordinance. In no case
shall such contract be for a longer term than ten (10) years.
SECTION 11.05.  PUBLIC UTILITY; HOW SOLD.
   No public utility owned by the City shall be sold or otherwise disposed of
by the City unless the full terms of the proposition of sale or other
disposition are embodied in an ordinance approved by a majority of the
registered voters voting thereon at a general or special election. In the case
of a water works or light plant, any sale, lease, or abandonment shall be
subject, in addition, to the requirements of State law.

in such form and in such amount as may be fixed by the Commission as security
for the faithful performance of his official duties and the safekeeping of the
public funds. Such bonds may be either individual or blanket bonds in the
discretion of the Commission. They shall be approved by the Commission, and
approved as to form by the City Attorney, and filed with the City

bonds not inconsistent with this Charter shall be complied with. The premiums
on such bonds shall be paid by the City.

outstanding indebtedness, the Commission may by resolution designate some other
public use for the proceeds.

supplementary to the provisions of this Charter.

these provisions. Unreasonable refusal to permit the inspection of or entrance
to the property shall be grounds for termination of any and all permits,
licenses or city service to the property. Mailed notice shall be given to the

(1988 Code, § 1.11)
§ 10.98  SUPPLEMENTAL ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES.
   (A)   In addition to those administrative penalties established in this code
and the enforcement powers granted in §
10.20, the City Commission is authorized to create by resolution, adopted by a
majority of the members of the Commission, supplemental administrative
penalties. The resolution may be in a form established by the City Commission.
The resolution may not proscribe administrative penalties for traffic offenses
designated by M.S. § 169.999.
   (B)   These administrative penalty procedures in this section are intended
to provide the public and the city with an informal, cost effective and
expeditious alternative to traditional criminal charges for violations of
certain provisions of this code. The procedures are intended to be voluntary on
the part of those who have been charged with those offenses.
   (C)   Administrative penalties for violations of various provisions of the
code, other than those penalties established in the code or in statutes that
are adopted by reference, may be established from time to time by resolution of
a majority of the members of the City Commission. In order to be effective, an
administrative penalty for a particular violation must be established before
the violation occurred.
   (D)   In the discretion of the peace officer, City Clerk or other person
giving notice of an alleged violation of a provision of this code, in a written
notice of an alleged violation, sent by first class mail to the person who is
alleged to have violated the code, the person giving notice may request the
payment of a voluntary administrative penalty for the violation directly to the
City Treasurer within 14 days of the notice of the violation. A sample notice
is contained in the Appendix to this chapter. In the sole discretion of the
person giving the notice of the alleged violation, the time for payment may be
extended an additional 14 days, whether or not requested by the person to whom
the notice has been given. In addition to the administrative penalty, the
person giving notice may request in the notice to the alleged violator to adopt
a compliance plan to correct the situation resulting in the alleged violation
and may provide that if the alleged violator corrects the situation resulting
in the alleged violation within the time specified in the notice, that the
payment of the administrative penalty will be waived.
   (E)   At any time before the payment of the administrative penalty is due,
the person who has been given notice of an alleged violation may request to
appear before the City Commission to contest the request for payment of the
penalty. After a hearing before the Commission, the Commission may determine to
withdraw the request for payment or to renew the request for payment. Because
the payment of the administrative penalty is voluntary, there shall be no
appeal from the decision of the Commission.
   (F)   At any time after the date the payment of the administrative penalty
is due, if the administrative penalty remains unpaid or the situation creating
the alleged violation remains uncorrected, the city, through its Attorney, may
bring criminal charges in accordance with state law and this code. Likewise,
the city, in its discretion, may bring criminal charges in the first instance,
rather than requesting the payment of an administrative penalty, even if a
penalty for the particular violation has been established by Commission
resolution. If the administrative penalty is paid, or if any requested
correction of the situation resulting in the violation is completed, no
criminal charges shall be initiated by the city for the alleged violation.
§ 10.99  GENERAL PENALTY AND ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Any person, firm or corporation who violates any provision of this
code for which another penalty is not specifically provided, shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor. The penalty which may be imposed for
any crime which is a misdemeanor under this code, including state statutes
specifically adopted by reference, shall be a sentence of not more than 90 days
or a fine of not more than $1,000, or both.
   (B)   Any person, firm or corporation who violates any provision of this
code, including state statutes specifically adopted by reference, which is
designated to be a petty misdemeanor shall, upon conviction be guilty of a
petty misdemeanor. The penalty which may be imposed for any petty offense which
is a petty misdemeanor shall be a sentence of a fine of not more than $300.
   (C)   Pursuant to M.S. § 631.48, as it may be amended from time to time, in
either the case of a misdemeanor or a petty misdemeanor, the costs of
prosecution may be added.  A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon
each day during which a violation occurs or continues.
   (D)   The failure of any officer or employee of the city to perform any
official duty imposed by this code shall not subject the officer or employee to
the penalty imposed for a violation.
   (E)   In addition to any penalties provided for in this section or in §
10.98, if any person, firm or corporation fails to comply with any provision of
this code, the Commission or any city official designated by it, may institute
appropriate proceedings at law or at equity to restrain, correct or abate the
violation.
APPENDIX A:  NOTICE OF CODE VIOLATION
To:  (Name and address of person who is alleged to have violated the code)
From:  (Name and title of city official giving the notice)
Re:  Alleged violation of Section of the city code, relating to (give title of
section)
Date:  (Date of notice)
   I  hereby allege that on (date of violation) you violated §                
of the city code relating to                                                   
                                                                               
   .
   The City Commission has by resolution established an administrative penalty
in the amount of $       for this violation.
   Payment of this administrative penalty is voluntary, but if you do not pay
it the city may initiate criminal proceedings for this alleged violation.
   Payment is due within 14 days of the date of this notice. Before the due
date, you may request an additional 14-day extension of the time to pay the
administrative penalty.
   As an alternative to the payment of this administrative penalty, if the
situation that gave rise to this alleged violation is corrected by            
           (establish date), then the payment of the administrative penalty
will be waived.
   Even if the administrative penalty is paid, the city reserves the right to
institute appropriate proceedings at law or at equity to restrain, correct or
abate the violation.
   Before the due date, you may request to appear before the City Commission to
contest the request for payment of the penalty. After a hearing before the
Commission, the Commission may determine to withdraw the request for payment or
to renew the request for payment. Because the payment of the administrative
penalty is voluntary, there shall be no appeal from the decision of the
Commission.
   If you pay the administrative penalty, the city will not initiate criminal
proceedings for this alleged violation. However, the Commission, or any city
official designated by it, may institute appropriate proceedings at law or at
equity to restrain, correct or abate the violation.
   Payment of the administrative penalty may be made by check, cash or money
order to the City Treasurer.
Signed:

   (A)   Disposal of abandoned motor vehicles.

definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
         ABANDONED MOTOR VEHICLE.  A motor vehicle as defined in M.S. Chapter
169, as it may be amended from time to time, that has remained for a period of
more than 48 hours on public property illegally or lacking vital component
parts, or has remained for a period of more than 48 hours on private property
without the consent of the person in control of the property, or in an
inoperable condition such that it has no substantial potential further use
consistent with its usual function unless it is kept in an enclosed garage or
storage building. It shall also mean a motor vehicle voluntarily surrendered by
its owner to and accepted by the city. A classic car or pioneer car, as defined
in M.S. Chapter 168, as it may be amended from time to time, shall not be
considered an abandoned motor vehicle within the meaning of this section.
Vehicles on the premises of junk yards or automobile graveyards, which are
licensed and maintained in accordance with the city code, shall not be
considered ABANDONED MOTOR VEHICLES within the meaning of this section.
         VITAL COMPONENT PARTS.  The parts of a motor vehicle that are
essential to the mechanical functioning of the vehicle, including, but not
limited to, the motor, drive train and wheels.
      (2)   Custody. The city may take into custody and impound any abandoned
motor vehicle.
      (3)   Immediate sale. When an abandoned motor vehicle is more than seven
model years of age, is lacking vital component parts and does not display a
license plate currently valid in the state or any other state or foreign
country, it shall immediately be eligible for sale at public auction, and shall
not be subject to the notification, reclamation or title provisions of this
division (A).
      (4)   Notice.
         (a)   When an abandoned motor vehicle does not fall within the
provisions of division (A)(3) above, the city shall give notice of the taking
within ten days. The notice shall set forth the date and place of the taking,
the year, make, model and serial number of the abandoned motor vehicle, if the
information can be reasonably obtained, and the place where the vehicle is
being held, shall inform the owner and any lien holders of their right to
reclaim the vehicle under division (A)(5) below, and shall state that failure
of the owner or lien holder to exercise his or her right to reclaim the vehicle
and contents shall be deemed a waiver by him or her of all rights, title and
interest in the vehicle and a consent to the sale of the vehicle and contents
at a public auction pursuant to division (A)(6) below.
         (b)   The notice shall be sent by mail to the registered owner, if
any, of the abandoned motor vehicle and to all readily identifiable lien
holders of record. If it is impossible to determine with reasonable certainty
the identity and address of the registered owner and all lien holders, the
notice shall be published once in the official newspaper. Published notices may
be grouped together for convenience and economy.
      (5)   Right to reclaim.
         (a)   The owner or any lien holder of an abandoned motor vehicle shall

and storage charges resulting from taking the vehicle into custody within 15
days after the date of the notice required by this division (A).

storage facility, or an operator of an establishment for the servicing, repair

not reclaimed under division (A)(5) above shall be sold to the highest bidder
at public auction or sale, following one notice published at least seven days
prior to the auction or sale. The purchaser shall be given a receipt in a form
prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles which shall be sufficient title
to dispose of the vehicle. The receipt shall also entitle the purchaser to
register the vehicle and receive a certificate of title, free and clear of all
liens and claims of ownership. Before such a vehicle is issued a new
certificate of title, it must receive a motor vehicle safety check.
         (b)   From the proceeds of the sale of an abandoned motor vehicle, the
city shall reimburse itself for the cost of towing, preserving and storing the
vehicle, and all administrative, notice and publication costs incurred pursuant
to this division (A). Any remainder from the proceeds of a sale shall be held
for the owner of the vehicle or entitled lien holder for 90 days and then shall
be deposited in the General Fund of the city.

an abandoned motor vehicle, the city may dispose of it in accordance with this
division (A).

storage, incineration, volume reduction, transportation or other services
necessary to prepare abandoned motor vehicles and other scrap metal for
recycling or other methods of disposal.
         (b)   Where the city enters into a contract with a person duly
licensed by the State Pollution Control Agency, the Agency shall review the
contract to determine whether it conforms to the Agency’s plan for solid waste
disposal. A contract that does so conform may be approved by the Agency. Where
a contract has been approved, the Agency may reimburse the city for the costs
incurred under the contract which have not been reimbursed.
         (c)   If the city utilizes its own equipment and personnel for

into the General Fund of the city and expenses thereof paid therefrom. The
former owner, if he or she makes claim within eight months from the date of
publication of the notice herein provided, and upon application and
satisfactory proof of ownership, may be paid the amount of cash or negotiables

and delivered to consumers under the then applicable rate applied to the amount
of the utilities taken as metered or ascertained in connection with the rates.
   (C)   Discontinuance of service. All municipal utilities may be shut off or
discontinued whenever it is found that:
      (1)   The owner or occupant of the premises served, or any person working
on any connection with the municipal utility systems, has violated any
requirement of the city code relative thereto, or any connection therewith;
      (2)   It is the policy of the city to discontinue utility service to
customers by reason of nonpayment of bills only after notice and a meaningful
opportunity to be heard on disputed bills.

billing.  This official shall be authorized to order that the customer's
service not be discontinued and shall have the authority to make a final
determination of the customer's complaint.
         (d)   Requests for delays or waiver of payment will not be
entertained; only questions of proper and correct billing will be considered. 
In the absence of payment of the bill rendered or resort to the hearing
procedure provided herein, service will be discontinued at the time specified,
but in no event until the charges have been due and unpaid for at least 30
days.
         (e)   When it becomes necessary for the city to discontinue utility
service to a customer for nonpayment of bills, service will be reinstated only
after all bills for service then due have been paid, along with a turn-on

buildings, at all reasonable times under the circumstances, in or upon which
private property a municipal utility, or connection therewith, is installed,
for the purpose of inspecting, repairing, reading meters, connecting or
disconnecting the municipal utility service.
   (F)   Meter test. Whenever a consumer shall request the city to test any
utility meter in use by him, such a request shall be accompanied by a cash
deposit for each meter to be tested. If any such meter is found to be
inaccurate, the same shall be replaced with an accurate meter and the deposit
thereon refunded. If the meter shall be found to be accurate in its recordings
or calculations, it shall be reinstalled and the deposit shall be retained by
the city to defray the cost of the test.
   (G)   Unlawful acts.
      (1)   It is unlawful for any person to willfully or carelessly break,

   (H)   Municipal utility services and charges a lien.
      (1)   Payment for all municipal utility (as that term is defined in §
50.01) service and charges shall be the primary responsibility of the owner of
the premises served and shall be billed to him or her, unless otherwise
contracted for and authorized in writing by the owner and the tenant, as agent
for the owner, and consented to by the city. The city may collect the same in a
civil action or, in the alternative and at the option of the city, as otherwise
provided in this division (H)(1).
      (2)   Each such account is hereby made a lien upon the premises served.
All the accounts which are more than thirty days past due may, when authorized
by resolution of the Commission, be certified by the City Administrator, to the
County Auditor, and the City Administrator in so certifying shall specify the
amount thereof, the description of the premises served, and the name of the
owner thereof. The amount so certified shall be extended by the Auditor on the
tax rolls against the premises in the same manner as other taxes, and collected
by the County Treasurer, and paid to the city along with other taxes.

unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   INFLOW.  Water other than wastewater that enters a sewerage system
(including sewer service connections) from sources such as roof leaders, cellar
drains, yard drains, area drains, foundation drains, sump pumps, drains from
springs and swampy areas, manhole covers, cross connections between storm
sewers and sanitary sewers, catch basins and cooling drainage. INFLOW does not
include, and is distinguished from, infiltration.
(Ord. 56, passed 9-2-1997)
§ 50.21  EXTRANEOUS WATERS.
   (A)   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged unpolluted water
(inflow) from any roof, surface, groundwater sump pump, footing tile, swimming
pool or other natural precipitation into the sanitary sewer system. Dwellings
and other buildings and structures which require, because of infiltration of
water into basements, crawl spaces and the like, a sump pump discharge system
shall have a permanently installed discharge line which shall not at any time
discharge water into the sanitary sewer system, except as provided in division
(D) below. A permanent installation shall be one which provides for year round
discharge capability to either the outside of the dwelling, building or
structure, or is connected to the city storm sewer or discharges to the curb
and gutter or the street. It shall consist of elements that do not allow
altering the path of discharge.
   (B)   Before July 1, 1997, any person, firm or corporation having a roof
surface, groundwater sump pump, footing tile, swimming pool or other facility
or device now connected and/or discharging into the sanitary sewer system shall
disconnect and/or remove the same. Any disconnects or openings in the sanitary
sewer shall be closed or repaired in an effective, workmanlike manner, as
approved by the City Administrator or his or her designated agent.
   (C)   Any person refusing to allow the person’s property to be inspected for
extraneous water connections within 14 days of the date city employees or their
designated representatives are denied admittance to the property, shall become
subject to the penalties hereafter provided for in §
10.99. Any person found to violate this provision shall make the necessary
changes to comply with this provision relating to the discharge of unpolluted
waters (inflow) into the sanitary sewer system and furnish proof of the changes
to the city within 90 days. Each sump pump connection identified may be
reinspected by the city, or a licensed plumber, to confirm compliance.
   (D)   The City Administrator, Public Works Director and Utilities
Commissioner shall have the authority and duty of hearing and deciding requests
for waivers from the application of division (A) above where strict enforcement
would cause undue hardship because of circumstances or cause a safety hazard.
      (1)   Application for waivers pursuant to this provision shall be
addressed in writing to the City Administrator.
      (2)   The application shall, at a minimum, identify the property for
which the waiver is being sought, the name of the property owner/applicant, and
describe in detail what characteristics of the subject property create an undue
hardship.
      (3)   Within a reasonable time, the City Administrator shall make a
decision on the matter and serve a copy of the order upon the applicant by
mail. The holder of a waiver shall allow a city employee to certify that prior
to April 1 of each subsequent year the holder’s discharge water connection has
been removed from the sanitary sewer.
      (4)   Failure to provide the certification will place the waiver holder
in violation and subject to the penalties provided in division (E) below. Any
waiver granted shall be recorded with the Office of the County Recorder.
      (5)   The city shall record the waiver, but the property owner shall be
responsible for the filing fee. If the property owner brings the system into
total compliance, a release of waiver shall be filed by the city upon request
of the property owner upon payment of the filing fee.
   (E)   Properties identified as having sump pump connections will be
reinspected by the city to confirm compliance upon sale of the property.

   (A)   Infiltration/inflow elimination during construction. During any new
construction, renovation or demolition the property connection or connections
to the sanitary sewer shall be protected through the use of a cover plug in
order to eliminate the potential for inflow to enter the sanitary sewer system.
Any such water collected shall not be allowed to enter the sanitary sewer
system at any time.
   (B)   Sump pump requirements for new construction. All new buildings with
groundwater sump systems are required, prior to final inspection by city
personnel, to have the sump pump installed.
(Ord. 56, passed 9-2-1997)
§ 50.23  POWERS AND AUTHORITY OF INSPECTORS.
   Authorized city personnel, or their designated representatives, bearing
proper credentials and identification, shall be permitted to enter all
properties for the purposes of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling
and testing in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter. Persons or
occupants of premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow
authorized city personnel ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of
the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination or

   Unmetered service may be provided for construction, flooding skating rinks
and any other purpose. The service shall be at a duly adopted rate. Where it is
difficult or impossible to accurately measure the amount of water taken,
unmetered service may be provided and the unmetered rate applied; provided,
however, that by acceptance thereof the consumer agrees to have the city
estimate the water used. In so estimating, the city shall consider the use to
which the water is put and the length of time of unmetered service.

§ 52.07  VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   Any person violating any provision of this section shall be provided
by the city with written notice setting forth the nature of the violation and
providing a reasonable time limit for the satisfactory correction thereof. The
offender shall, within the time so limited, permanently cease all violations.
   (B)   Any person violating any of the provisions of this section shall be
liable to the city for any expenses, loss or damage resulting from or
occasioned by the violation.
(1988 Code, § 3.30-7)  Penalty, see §

§ 52.08  SEWER SERVICE CHARGES.
   (A)   As an equitable share of the expenses incurred by the city in the
construction, administration, operation, maintenance and replacement of the
sewerage works, each user will pay to the city a quarterly amount based upon
the following formula:
            A = F(UC+DC)
            Where:   A = Service charge to user, with units of wastewater.
F = Volume of wastewater from user expressed in units of 1,000 gallons per
quarter (often assumed equal to actual water usage).
UC = User charge.
DC = Debt service charge.
   (B)   Average city unit costs shall be computed annually, and shall include
operation and maintenance costs (including replacement costs) and annual
construction costs. Any industrial or other user which discharges pollutants
which cause an increase in the cost of treatment and management of the effluent
from the treatment plant shall be responsible for the payment of the increased
costs. Each user of the city sewer system that does not have a metered source
of water must install an accurate water or wastewater flow metering device (at
user’s expense) that will serve as a basis for estimating the volume of
wastewater discharged, and determining the sewer service charge. All users of
city water that is not discharged to the city sanitary sewer system may install
a separate water system and meter (one only in the same building as the main
meter) to isolate and meter non-sewered water for which no sewer charge is
required. If at any time after this independent system is installed, water from
this system enters the sanitary sewer system, the user will be subject to the
penalties of this section and shall be ordered to eliminate the independent
system if this violation is continued.
   (C)   To ensure the required financial surveillance, the City Administrator
shall annually review the cash flows associated with providing wastewater
treatment service for the city, and shall report the findings to the Commission
at the regular April meeting of each year. Any inequities and/or shortages of
revenue caused by unforeseen changes in the cost revenue pattern of the
wastewater treatment facilities shall be remedied immediately by a Commission
resolution adjusting the unit cost figures. Adjusted unit figures shall be
computed in accordance with this section and the methodology specified in the
“Sewer Charge System Report for Glenwood and Long Beach” as approved by the
State Pollution Control Agency.
   (D)   The Commission may adopt a policy for excluding summer-season non-
sewered water usage (residential lawn and garden irrigation water) from the
volume utilized in computing the residential sewer service charge.

§ 53.002  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this Sewage and Wastewater Treatment Chapter shall be to
provide minimum standards for and regulation of subsurface sewage treatment
systems (SSTS) and septage disposal, including the proper location, design, and
construction; their necessary modification and reconstruction; their operation,
maintenance, and repair to protect surface water and groundwater from
contamination by human sewage and waterborne household and commercial wastes;
to protect the public's health and safety, and eliminate or prevent the
development of public nuisances pursuant to the authority granted under M.S.
Chapters 115 and 145A and Minnesota Rules, Chapters 7080-7082 and as amended
that may pertain to sewage and wastewater treatment.
(Ord. 1, passed 3-25-2015)
§ 53.003  OBJECTIVES.
   The principal objectives of this chapter shall include the following:
   (A)   For the protection of the City of Glenwood's lakes, wetlands, rivers,
streams, and supplies of groundwater essential to the promotion of public
health, safety, and welfare; for the protection of the city's environment and
its socioeconomic growth and development of the city in perpetuity.
   (B)   Given the extensive resources and numerous supplies of surface water
and groundwater and their susceptibility to contamination, regulation of proper
SSTS construction, reconstruction, repair, maintenance, and proper septage
disposal is essential to prevent the entry and migration of contaminants,
thereby ensuring the non-degradation of surface water and groundwater.
   (C)   The provision of establishing minimum standards for SSTS placement,
design, construction, reconstruction, repair, and maintenance to prevent
contamination and, if contamination is discovered, to identify and control its
consequences and abate its source and migration.
   (D)   The provision of establishing minimum standards for septage removal,
transport, treatment, and disposal;
   (E)   The regulation of privy vaults and other non-water carried SSTS;
   (F)   The prevention and control of waterborne disease, lake degradation,
groundwater-related hazards, and public nuisance conditions through plan
reviews, inspections, SSTS surveys, and complaint investigation, as well as
through technical assistance and education.
(Ord. 1, passed 3-25-2015)

protective is considered a system failing to protect groundwater. At a minimum,
a system that is failing to protect groundwater is a system that is a seepage
pit, cesspool, drywell, leaching pit, or other pit; a system with less than the
required vertical separation distance; and a system not abandoned in accordance
with Minnesota Rules, Chapter 7080.2500. A determination of the threat to
groundwater quality for other conditions must be made by a qualified employee
or licensed inspection business. An SSTS that is determined not to be
protective of groundwater shall be upgraded, repaired, replaced, or abandoned
by the owner in accordance with the provisions of this chapter within one year
of the issuance date of a notice of non-compliance. The city will give
consideration to weather conditions as compliance dates are established.

utility for the city. The storm water utility shall be operated as a public
utility pursuant to the city code and applicable Minnesota Statutes. The
revenues derived there from shall be subject to provisions of this section and
M.S. § 444.075. The storm water utility shall be part of the Public Works
Department and shall be administered by the Public Works Director. This chapter
shall apply to the entire city.
(Ord. 115, passed 10-14-2014)
§ 54.03 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless the context specifically indicates otherwise, the following terms, as
used in this section, shall have the meanings hereinafter designated.
   LAND USE. The LAND USE for a given parcel shall be the “tax classification”
for that parcel on record at the Pope County Recorder's Office, or other land
use classification that is updated by the City Zoning Officer.
   MULTI-FAMILY. Land use classification of parcels with four or more living
units.
   RESIDENTIAL. Land use classification of parcels with three or less living
units.
   RESIDENTIAL EQUIVALENCY FACTOR. Referred to herein as “REF”, is the ratio of
the accumulated direct runoff generated by a particular land use to the
accumulated direct runoff generated by the residential land use.
   SURFACE AREA. Referred to herein as “SA”, shall be the area of the parcel in
acres, subject to any standardization, adjustments or exceptions outlined in
this chapter.
   UNIT RATE.  Referred to herein as “UR”, is the rate in dollars per acre to
be charged per one REF.
(Ord. 115, passed 10-14-2014)
§ 54.04  RATES AND CHARGES.
   (A)   Determining the REF.
      (1)   The accumulated direct runoff (Q) used to determine the REFs shall
be calculated based on an evaluation of the land use and application of a
standardized soil type and rainfall event.
      (2)   The calculated direct runoff (Q) shall be based on the runoff
equation in the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) National
Engineering Handbook, Part 630 - Hydrology, Chapter 10 - Estimation of Direct
Runoff from Storm Rainfall. The equation is as follows:
Q =    (P - 0.2S)2
P + 0.8S
Where:
S =   (1000/CN) - 10
P =   2.0 inches (Based on a 24-hour two-inch rainfall event)
CN =    Runoff index (Based on the land use and the Natural Resources
Conservation Services; NRCS Type B soils)
      (3)   (a)   The runoff indices (CN) and REFs for the various land uses
within the city shall be set forth in the table below:
Land Use Runoff Index (CN) REF
Land Use               Runoff Index (CN) REF
Agricultural        Exempt            Exempt
Airport Hangers        85                2.72
Commercial             92                4.23
Industrial             88                3.30

Road right-of-way      Exempt            Exempt
 
         (b)   The REF for land uses not list above shall be determined by the
city based on probable hydrologic response.
   (B)   Establishing unit rates. The City Commission shall from time to time,
by resolution, establish the unit rate for each REF. The unit rate so
established shall be on file with the City Administrator/Clerk and shall be
used to compute the charges for a given parcel of land based on the following
formula:
Storm Water Charges =   (UR) x (REF) x (SA)
   (C)   Standardized charges. The following rules shall apply for the purpose
of simplifying and equalizing charges:  A standard surface area of 0.32 acres
shall be used for residential parcels.
   (D)   Vacant parcels. Land use vacant parcels shall be charged one-half the
amount of non-vacant parcels in that land use category.
(Ord. 115, passed 10-14-2014)
§ 54.05  ADJUSTMENTS AND GENERAL POLICY.
   (A)   Storm water utility fees may be adjusted under any of the following
conditions:
      (1)   Revisions of unit rate.  The estimated expenditures for the
management of storm water shall be reviewed by the City Commission. The unit
rate shall be adjusted accordingly to meet the estimated expenditures and will
follow established procedures for adjustment of utility rates.
      (2)   Minimum or maximum fees.  The City Commission may establish a
minimum or maximum fee.
         (a)   The minimum fee for non-vacant parcels shall be set equal to the
single-family residential standardized fee. The minimum fee for vacant parcels
shall be set at one-half the single-family residential standardized fee.
         (b)   The City Council shall from time to time, by resolution,
establish a maximum fee. The maximum fee so established shall be on file with
the City Administrator/Clerk.
         (c)   Parcel fees limited by the set maximum fee can choose to keep
the maximum fee or be eligible for credit adjustments, but not both.
      (3)   Application for credit.  The city may establish a credit policy and
utilize a credit application form for consideration of fee reduction.
      (4)   Change in development condition of parcel.  As land is developed
and/or redeveloped the fees will be re-computed based on the revised land use.
   (B)   Fee adjustments by credit application.
      (1)   The City Commission may by resolution adopt a storm water utility
policy and credit policy providing for the adjustment of charges for parcels or
groups of parcels based upon hydrologic response substantially different from
the REF being used for the parcel or for parcels which employ BMPs or other
storm water management practices on-site that significantly reduce the quantity
or improve the quality of storm water runoff from the parcel.
      (2)   Such adjustment shall be made only after receiving the
recommendation from the Public Works Director, and shall not be made effective
retroactively. If the adjustment would have the effect of changing the REF for
all or substantially all parcels in a particular land use classification, such
adjustment shall be accomplished by amending the REF table in §
54.04(A).
   (C)   Adjustment to area. The total parcel area as documented in the
Assessor's records will be used to calculate the surface area for a given
parcel, except that apparent errors in the recorded values may be subject to
recalculation by the city. It is the responsibility of the owner or manager of
any parcel to provide the city with necessary surveys, and other information as
the city may reasonably request, to determine if a parcel, or portion of a
parcel, qualifies for an exception or area adjustment. Requests for exceptions
and/or area adjustments will be reviewed after receipt of all requested
information. Exceptions and/or adjustments must be approved by the City
Engineer and Public Works Director, and shall become effective the beginning of
the next billing cycle following approval.
   (D)   Exceptions. The following land uses are exempt from the storm water
utility fees established herein:
      (1)   Public street right-of-way.
      (2)   Wetlands and public waters as defined by state law.
      (3)   Municipally owned property.
      (4)   Publicly-owned park lands, natural areas, and recreational fields.
      (5)   Cemeteries.
      (6)   Parcels with an agriculture county “tax classification” and/or are
situated within the AG (agricultural) zoning district of the city.
   (E)   Falsification of information. Willful failure to provide information
that the city may reasonably request related to the use, development and area
of a premise, or falsification of such information, shall constitute a
violation of this chapter.
   (F)   Estimated charges. If, for any reason, precise information related to
the use, development or area of a premises is not available, then storm water
utility charges for such premise shall be estimated, and billed, based upon
information then available to the city.
   (G)   Billing method. Storm water utility fees will be computed by the city.
Fees shall be collected by the city together with other city utility fees, or
through the use of the county billing system, or by any other method approved
by the city in accordance with the procedures set forth in the city code.
   (H)   Delinquent accounts.  Delinquent and unpaid storm water utility fees
may be certified to the County Auditor for collection with real estate taxes
during the following year or any year thereafter in the manner prescribed in
the city code, pursuant to M.S. § 444.075, Subd. 3.
   (I)   Appeal. If a property owner believes that the fee charged a particular
property is incorrect, she or he may request review and re-computation of said
fee.
   (J)   Full force and effect. This chapter shall be in full force and
effective upon its passage and publication in accordance with the city charter
of the city.

   (A)   Timing. The work to be done under the excavation permit, and the
patching and restoration of the right-of-way as required herein, must be
completed within the dates specified in the permit, increased by as many days
as work could not be done because of circumstances beyond the control of the
permittee or when work was prohibited as unseasonal or unreasonable under this
subchapter.
   (B)   Patch and restoration. The permittee shall patch its own work. The
city may choose either to have the permittee restore the right-of-way or to
restore the right-of-way itself.
      (1)   City restoration. If the city restores the right-of-way, the
permittee shall pay the costs thereof within 30 days of billing. If following
the restoration, the pavement settles due to the permittee’s improper
backfilling, the permittee shall pay to the city, within 30 days of billing,
all costs associated with having to correct the defective work.
      (2)   Permittee restoration. If the permittee restores the right-of-way
itself, it may be required at the time of application for an excavation permit

patching, or restoration performed by the permittee or its agents. The
permittee upon notification from the Clerk, Utilities Superintendent or other
person designated by the Commission, shall correct all restoration work to the
extent necessary, using the method required by the Clerk, Utilities
Superintendent or other person designated by the Commission. The work shall be
completed within five calendar days of the receipt of the notice from the
Clerk, Utilities Superintendent or other person designated by the Commission,
not including days during which work cannot be done because of circumstances
constituting force majeure or days when work is prohibited as unseasonal or
unreasonable under this subchapter.
   (E)   Failure to restore.
      (1)   If the permittee fails to restore the right-of-way in the manner
and to the condition required by the Clerk, Utilities Superintendent or other
person designated by the Commission, or fails to satisfactorily and timely
complete all restoration required by the Clerk, Utilities Superintendent or
other person designated by the Commission, the Clerk, Utilities Superintendent
or other person designated by the Commission at his or her option may do the
work. In that event the permittee shall pay to the city, within 30 days of
billing, the cost of restoring the right-of-way.
      (2)   If the permittee fails to pay as required, the city may exercise
its rights under the construction performance bond.
   (F)   Degradation fee in lieu of restoration. In lieu of right-of-way
restoration, a right-of-way user may elect to pay a degradation fee as

user shall remain responsible for patching and the degradation fee shall not
include the cost to accomplish these responsibilities.
§ 90.22  SUPPLEMENTARY APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   Limitation on area. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the area
of the right-of-way specified in the permit. No permittee may do any work
outside the area specified in the permit, except as provided herein. Any
permittee which determines that an area greater than that specified in the
permit must be obstructed or excavated must before working in that greater area
make application for a permit extension and pay any additional fees required
thereby, and be granted a new permit or permit extension.
   (B)   Limitation on dates.
      (1)   A right-of-way permit is valid only for the dates specified in the
permit. No permittee may begin its work before the permit start date or, except
as provided herein, continue working after the end date.
      (2)   If a permittee does not finish the work by the permit end date, it
must apply for a new permit for the additional time it needs, and receive the
new permit or an extension of the old permit before working after the end date
of the previous permit. This supplementary application must be submitted before
the permit end date.
§ 90.23  DENIAL OF PERMIT.
   The city may deny a permit for failure to meet the requirements and
conditions of this chapter or if the city determines that the denial is
necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare or when necessary to
protect the right-of-way and its current use.
§ 90.24  INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS.
   The excavation, backfilling, patching and restoration, and all other work
performed in the right-of-way shall be done in conformance with Minn. Rules
part 7819.1100, as it may be amended from time to time and other applicable
local requirements, in so far as they are not inconsistent with M.S. §§ 237.162
and 237.163, as they may be amended from time to time.

Minn. Rules part 7819.1300, as it may be amended from time to time.
   (B)   Site inspection. The permittee shall make the work-site available to
city personnel and to all others as authorized by law for inspection at all
reasonable times during the execution of and upon completion of the work.
   (C)   Authority of Clerk, Utilities Superintendent or other person
designated by the Commission.
      (1)   At the time of inspection, the Clerk, Utilities Superintendent or
other person designated by the Commission may order the immediate cessation of
any work which poses a serious threat to the life, health, safety or well-being
of the public.
      (2)   The Clerk, Utilities Superintendent or other person designated by
the Commission may issue an order to the permittee for any work which does not
conform to the terms of the permit or other applicable standards, conditions or
codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the violation will be
cause for revocation of the permit. Within ten days after issuance of the
order, the permittee shall present proof to the Clerk, Utilities Superintendent
or other person designated by the Commission that the violation has been
corrected. If proof has not been presented within the required time, the Clerk,
Utilities Superintendent or other person designated by the Commission may
revoke the permit pursuant to §
90.28.
§ 90.26  WORK DONE WITHOUT A PERMIT.
   (A)   Emergency situations.
      (1)   Each person with facilities in the right-of-way shall immediately
notify the city of any event regarding its facilities which it considers to be
an emergency. The owner of the facilities may proceed to take whatever actions
are necessary to respond to the emergency. Within two business days after the
occurrence of the emergency, the owner shall apply for the necessary permits,
pay the fees associated therewith and fulfill the rest of the requirements
necessary to bring itself into compliance with this chapter for the actions it
took in response to the emergency.
      (2)   If the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding facilities, the
city will attempt to contact the local representative of each facility owner
affected, or potentially affected, by the emergency. In any event, the city may
take whatever action it deems necessary to respond to the emergency, the cost
of which shall be borne by the person whose facilities occasioned the
emergency.
   (B)   Non-emergency situations. Except in an emergency, any person who,
without first having obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or excavates a
right-of-way must subsequently obtain a permit, and as a penalty pay double the
normal fee for the permit, pay double all the other fees required by this code,
deposit with the city the fees necessary to correct any damage to the right-of-
way and comply with all of the requirements of this chapter.
§ 90.27  SUPPLEMENTARY NOTIFICATION.
   If the obstruction or excavation of the right-of-way begins later or ends
sooner than the date given on the permit, the permittee shall notify the Clerk,
Utilities Superintendent or other person designated by the Commission of the
accurate information as soon as this information is known.
§ 90.28  REVOCATION OF PERMITS.
   (A)   Substantial breach.
      (1)   The city reserves its right, as provided herein, to revoke any
right-of-way permit, without a fee refund if there is a substantial breach of
the terms and conditions of any statute, ordinance, rule or regulation, or any
material condition of the permit.
      (2)   A substantial breach by the permittee shall include, but shall not
be limited, to the following:
         (a)   The violation of any material provision of the right-of-way
permit;
         (b)   An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the
right-of-way permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or
deceit upon the city or its citizens;
         (c)   Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a
right-of-way permit;
         (d)   The failure to complete the work in a timely manner; unless a

reasons beyond the permittees control; or
         (e)   The failure to correct, in a timely manner, work that does not
conform to a condition indicated on an order issued pursuant to §
90.25.
   (B)   Written notice of breach. If the city determines that the permittee
has committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any statute,
ordinance, rule, regulation or any condition of the permit the city shall make
a written demand upon the permittee to remedy that violation. The demand shall
state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. A
substantial breach, as stated above, will allow the city, at its discretion, to
place additional or revised conditions on the permit to mitigate and remedy the
breach.
   (C)   Response to notice of breach. Within 24 hours of receiving
notification of the breach, the permittee shall provide the city with a plan,
acceptable to the city, that will cure the breach. The permittee’s failure to
so contact the city, or the permittee’s failure to submit an acceptable plan,
or the permittee’s failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be
cause for immediate revocation of the permit.
   (D)   Reimbursement of city costs. If a permit is revoked, the permittee
shall also reimburse the city for the city’s reasonable costs, including
restoration costs and the costs of collection and reasonable attorneys’ fees
incurred in connection with the revocation.

   (A)   Information required. Each permittee shall provide mapping information
required by the city in accordance with Minn. Rules parts 7819.4000 and
7819.4100, as it may be amended from time to time.
   (B)   Service laterals.
      (1)   All permits issued for the installation or repair of service
laterals, other than minor repairs as defined in Minn. Rules 7560.0150, Subp.
2, shall require the permittee’s use of appropriate means of establishing the
horizontal locations of installed service laterals, and the service lateral
vertical locations in those cases where the city reasonably requires it.
Permittees or other subcontractors shall submit to the city evidence of the
installed service lateral locations.
      (2)   Compliance with this division (B) and with applicable Gopher State
One Call law and Minn. Rules governing service laterals installed after
December 31, 2005, shall be a condition of any city approval necessary for:
         (a)   Payments to contractors working on a public improvement project
including those under M.S. Ch. 429, as it may be amended from time to time; and
         (b)   City approval of performance under development agreements, or
other subdivision or site plan approval under M.S. Ch. 462, as it may be
amended from time to time.
      (3)   The city shall reasonably determine the appropriate method of
providing the information. Failure to provide prompt and accurate information
on the service laterals installed may result in the revocation of the permit
issued for the work or for future permits to the offending permittee or its
subcontractors.
§ 90.30  LOCATION OF FACILITIES.
   (A)   Compliance required. Placement, location and relocation of facilities
must comply with applicable laws, and with Minn. Rules parts 7819.3100,

      (1)   The city may assign specific corridors within the right-of-way, or
any particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of facilities
that is or, pursuant to current technology, the city expects will someday be
located within the right-of-way.
      (2)   All excavation, obstruction or other permits issued by the city
involving the installation or replacement of facilities shall designate the
proper corridor for the facilities at issue.
   (C)   Limitation of space.
      (1)   To protect the health, safety and welfare or when necessary to
protect the right-of-way and its current use, the Clerk, Utilities
Superintendent or other person designated by the Commission shall have the
power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional facilities within
the right-of-way.
      (2)   In making those decisions, the Clerk, Utilities Superintendent or
other person designated by the Commission shall strive to the extent possible
to accommodate all existing and potential users of the right-of-way, but shall
be guided primarily by considerations of the public interest, the public’s
needs for the particular utility service, the condition of the right-of-way,
the time of year with respect to essential utilities, the protection of
existing facilities in the right-of-way, and future city plans for public
improvements and development projects which have been determined to be in the
public interest.
§ 90.31  DAMAGE TO OTHER FACILITIES.

emergency occasioned by that owner’s facilities.
§ 90.32  RIGHT-OF-WAY VACATION.
   If the city vacates a right-of-way which contains the facilities of a
registrant, the registrant’s rights in the vacated right-of-way are governed by
Minn. Rules part 7819.3200, as it may be amended from time to time.
§ 90.33  INDEMNIFICATION AND LIABILITY.

Minn. Rules 7819.1250, as it may be amended from time to time.
§ 90.34  ABANDONED FACILITIES; REMOVAL OF ABANDONED FACILITIES.
   Any person who has abandoned facilities in any right-of-way shall remove
them from that right-of-way if required in conjunction with other right-of-way

junk and unregulated storage and non-mandatory collection of refuse are not
only potential, but immediate, habitat conditions of decay which are
unsanitary, unhealthy, and an ecological blight. The Commission further finds
that such hazardous conditions must not only be halted in the future but also
corrected for the present. The Commission recognizes that the regulations,
prohibitions and remedies provided for herein are bold steps but absolutely
essential to the health of the residents and ecology of the community, and the
conservation of resources by the mandatory recycling of certain materials.

§ 91.02  SHADE TREE DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION.
   (A)   Policy and purpose.  The city has determined that the health of oak
and elm trees is threatened by fatal diseases known as oak wilt and Dutch elm
disease. It has further determined that the loss of oak and elm trees located
on public and private property would substantially depreciate the value of
property and impair the safety, good order, general welfare and convenience of
the public. It is declared to be the intention of the City Commission to
control and prevent the spread of these diseases, and provide for the removal
of dead or diseased trees, as nuisances.
   (B)   Definitions.  For the purpose of this section, the following
definition shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      CITY FORESTER.  The City Administrator, or such other employee of the
city as the City Commission may designate and who shall thereafter qualify,
together with his or her duly designated assistants.
      NUISANCE.
         (a)   Any living or standing  tree infected to any degree with a shade
tree disease; or
         (b)   Any logs, branches,  stumps or other parts of any dead or dying
tree, so infected, unless such parts have been fully burned or treated under
the direction of the City Forester.
      SHADE TREE DISEASE.  Dutch elm disease or oak wilt disease.
   (C)   Scope and adoption by reference. M.S. § 18.023, is hereby adopted by
reference, together with the Rules and Regulations of the Minnesota
Commissioner of Agriculture relating to shade tree diseases; provided that this
section shall supersede such statutes, rules and regulations, only to the
extent of inconsistencies.
   (D)   Unlawful act. It is unlawful for any person to keep, maintain or
permit upon premises owned by him or her or upon public property where he or
she has the duty of tree maintenance, any nuisance as herein defined and in
accordance with M.S. § 18G.13, Subd. 7, Local Pest Control, which allows a city
council, board of county commissioners, or town board may by resolution or
ordinance adopt and enforce regulations to control and prevent the spread of
plant pests and diseases.
   (E)   Inspection and diagnosis.  It is the power and duty of the City
Forester to enter upon public or private property, at any reasonable time, for
the purpose of inspecting for, and diagnosing, shade tree disease.  In cases of
suspected shade tree disease, and in performance of his or her duties, the City
Forester may remove such specimens, samples and biopsies as may be necessary or
desirable for diagnosis.
   (F)   Abatement of nuisance.  Abatement of a nuisance, defined herein, shall
be by spraying, removing, burning, or otherwise effectively treating the
infected tree or wood to prevent spread of shade tree disease.  Such abatement
procedures shall be carried out in accordance with current technical and expert
methods and plans as may be designed by the Commissioner of Agriculture of the
State of Minnesota.  The city shall establish specifications for tree removal
and disposal methods consistent therewith.
   (G)   Procedure for removal of infected trees and wood.
      (1)   Whenever the City Forester finds with reasonable certainty that the
infection, or danger of infection, exists in any tree or wood on any public or
private property, he or she shall proceed as follows:
         (a)   If the City Forester finds that the danger of infection of other
trees is not imminent because of dormancy of shade tree disease, he or she
shall make a written report of his or her finding to the City Commission which
shall proceed  by:
            1.   Abating the nuisance as a public improvement under M.S.
Chapter 429, or
            2.   Abating the nuisance as provided division (B)(2) of this
division.
         (b)   If the City Forester finds that danger of infection of other
trees is imminent, he or she shall notify the owner of the property, or the
abutting property, as the case may be, by certified mail that the nuisance will
be abated within a specified time, not less than five days from the date of
mailing of such notice.  The City Forester shall immediately report such action
to the City Commission, and after the expiration of the time limited by the
notice he or she may abate the nuisance.
         (c)   If the City Forester finds with reasonable certainty that
immediate action is required to prevent the spread of shade tree disease, he or
she may proceed to abate the nuisance forthwith. He or she shall report such
action immediately to the City Commission and to the abutting property owner,
or to the owner of the property where the nuisance is located.
      (2)   Upon receipt of the City Forester’s report required by division (G)
(1)(a) above, the City Commission shall by resolution order the nuisance
abated.  Before action is taken on such resolution, the City Commission shall
publish notice of its intention to meet to consider taking action to abate the
nuisance. This notice shall be mailed to affected property owners and published
once no less than one week prior to such meeting. The notice shall state the
time and place of the meeting, the streets affected, action proposed, the
estimated cost of the abatement, and the proposed basis of assessment, if any,
of costs.  At such hearing or adjournment thereof, the City Commission shall
hear property owners with reference to the scope and desirability of the
proposed project.  The City Commission shall thereafter adopt a resolution
confirming the original resolution with such modifications as it considers
desirable and provide for the doing of the work by day labor or by contract.
      (3)   The City Forester shall keep a record of the costs of abatements
done under this subdivision and shall report monthly to the City Administrator
all work done for which assessments are to be made stating and certifying the
description of the land, lots, parcels involved and the amount chargeable to
each.
      (4)   On or before September 1 of each year the City Administrator shall
list the total unpaid charges for each abatement against each separate lot or
parcel to which they are attributable under this section. The City Commission
may then spread the charges or any portion thereof against the property
involved as a special assessment under M.S. § 429.101 and other pertinent
statutes for certification to the County Auditor and collection the following
year along with current taxes.
      (5)   No damage shall be awarded the owner for destruction of any tree,
wood or part thereof pursuant to this section.
   (H)   Spraying trees.
      (1)   Whenever the City Forester determines that any tree or wood is
infected or threatened with infection, he or she may spray or treat all nearby
high value trees with an effective concentrate or fungicide or both. 
Activities authorized by this subdivision shall be conducted in accordance with
technical and expert opinions and plans of the Commissioner of Agriculture and
under the supervision of the Commissioner and his or her agents whenever
possible.
      (2)   The notice and assessment provisions of division (G) apply to
spraying and treatment operations conducted under this subdivision.

delay or interfere with the City Forester while he or she is engaged in the
performance of duties imposed by this section.
   (J)   Additional duties of city forester. It is the additional duty of the
City Forester to coordinate, under the direction and control of the City
Commission, all activities of the city relating to the control and prevention
of shade tree disease. He or she shall recommend to the City Commission the
details of a program for the control of the diseases, and perform the duties
incident to such a program adopted by the City Commission.
   (K)   Subsidies.  The duty of any property owner to bear the cost of
removing or maintaining trees, whether by private contract or assessment, shall
be subject to a subsidy policy, if any, established by the city for the

§ 112.02  APPLICATIONS AND LICENSES UNDER THIS CHAPTER; PROCEDURE AND
ADMINISTRATION.
   (A)   Application. All applications shall be made at the office of the City
Administrator upon forms prescribed by the city, or if by the Commissioner,
then together with additional information as the City Commission may desire.
Information required may vary with the type of business organization making
application. All questions asked or information required by the application
forms shall be answered fully and completely by the applicant. Every
application for the issuance or renewal of a liquor or beer license must
include a copy of each summons received by the applicant during the preceding
year under M.S. § 340A.802. as it may be amended from time to time.
Applications for on-sale liquor licenses may be submitted to the Commission by
the same person only once during the licensing year.
   (B)   False statements. It is unlawful for any applicant to intentionally
make a false statement or omission upon any application form. Any false
statement in the application, or any willful omission to state any information
called for on the application form shall, upon discovery of the falsehood, work
an automatic refusal of license, or if already issued, shall render any license
issued pursuant thereto void and of no effect to protect the applicant from
prosecution for violation of this chapter, or any part thereof.
   (C)   Application and investigation fees. At the time the initial
application is made, an applicant for a license under this chapter shall
accompany the application with payment of a fee to be considered an application
and investigation fee, not refundable to the applicant, to cover the cost of
the city in processing the application and the investigation of the applicant.
No such fee shall be required of an applicant for a temporary beer license.
   (D)   Action.
      (1)   Granting. The Commission may approve any application for the period
of the remainder of the then current license year or for the entire ensuing
license year. All applications including proposed license periods must be
consistent with this chapter. Prior to consideration of any application for a
license, the applicant shall pay one-half of the license fee, and if
applicable, pay the investigation fee. Upon rejection of any application for a
license, or upon withdrawal of an application before consideration by the
Commission, the license fee shall be refunded to the applicant. Failure to pay
any portion of a fee when due shall be cause for revocation.
      (2)   Issuing. If an application is approved, the City Administrator
shall forthwith issue a license pursuant thereto in the form prescribed by the
city or the Commissioner, as the case may be, and upon payment of the license
fee. All licenses shall be on a calendar year basis, unless otherwise specified
herein. For licenses issued and which are to become effective other than on the
first day of the licensed year, the fee to be paid with the application shall
be a pro rata share of the annual license fee. Licenses shall be valid only at
one location and on the premises therein described.
      (3)   Transfer. No license shall be transferable between persons. No
license shall be transferable to a different location without prior consent of
the Commission and payment of the fee for a duplicate license. It is unlawful
to make any transfer in violation of this division (D)(3).
      (4)   Refusal and termination. The Commission may, in its sole discretion
and for any reasonable cause, refuse to grant any application. No license shall
be granted to a person of questionable moral character or business reputation.
Licenses shall terminate only by expiration or revocation.
      (5)   Public interest. No license under this chapter may be issued,
transferred or renewed if the results of any investigation show, to the
satisfaction of the Commission, that the issuance, transfer or renewal would
not be in the public interest.
      (6)   Revocation or suspension.
         (a)   The Commission shall revoke or suspend, for a period not to
exceed 60 days, a license granted under the provisions of this chapter, or
impose a civil fine not to exceed $2,000, for each violation on a finding that
the licensee has failed to comply with a statute, regulation or provision of
the city code relating to alcoholic beverages. The Commission shall revoke the
license upon conviction of any licensee or agent or employee of a licensee for
violating any law relating to the sale or possession of beer, wine or liquor
upon premises of the licensee, or if the revocation is mandatory by statute.
         (b)   If it shall be made to appear at the hearing thereon that the
violation was not willful, the Commission may order suspension; provided that
revocation shall be ordered upon the third such violation or offense. No
suspension or revocation shall take effect until the licensee has been afforded
an opportunity for a hearing before the Commission, a committee of the
Commission, or a hearing under the Administrative Procedures Act, being M.S. §§
14.001 to 14.69, as may be determined by the Commission in action calling the
hearing.
         (c)   The hearing shall be called by the Commission upon written
notice to the licensee served in person or by certified mail not less than 15,
nor more than 30 days prior to the hearing date, stating the time, place and
purpose thereof. As additional restrictions or regulations on licensees under
this chapter, and in addition to grounds for revocation or suspension stated in
the city code or statute, the following shall also be grounds for the action:
            1.   The licensee suffered or permitted illegal acts upon licensed
premises unrelated to the sale of beer, wine or liquor;
            2.   The licensee had knowledge of the illegal acts upon licensed
premises, but failed to report the same to police;
            3.   The licensee failed or refused to cooperate fully with police
in investigating the alleged illegal acts upon licensed premises; or
            4.   The activities of the licensee created a serious danger to
public health, safety or welfare.
      (7)   Corporate applicants and licensees. A corporate applicant, at the
time of application, shall furnish the city with a list of all persons that
have an interest in the corporation and the extent of the interest. The list
shall name all shareholders and show the number of shares held by each, either
individually or beneficially for others. It is the duty of each corporate
licensee to notify the City Administrator in writing of any change in legal
ownership, or beneficial interest in the corporation or in such shares. Any
change in the ownership or beneficial interest in the shares entitled to be
voted at a meeting of the shareholders of a corporate licensee, which results
in the change of voting control of the corporation by the persons owning the
shares therein, shall be deemed equivalent to a transfer of the license issued
to the corporation, and any such license shall be revoked 30 days after any
such change in ownership or beneficial interest of shares unless the Commission
has been notified of the change in writing and has approved it by appropriate
action. The Commission, or any officer of the city designated by it, may at any
reasonable time examine the stock transfer records and minute books of any
corporate licensee in order to verify and identify the shareholders, and the
Commission or its designated officer may examine the business records of any
other licensee to the extent necessary to disclose the interest which persons
other than the licensee have in the licensed business. The Commission may
revoke any license issued upon its determination that a change of ownership of
shares in a corporate licensee or any change of ownership of any interest in
the business of any other licensee has actually resulted in the change of
control of the licensed business so as materially to affect the integrity and
character of its management and its operation, but no such action shall be
taken until after a hearing by the Commission on notice to the licensee.
   (E)   Duplicate licenses. Duplicates of all original licenses under this
chapter may be issued by the City Administrator without action by the
Commission, upon licensee’s affidavit that the original has been lost, and upon
payment of a fee of $2 for issuance of the duplicate. All duplicate licenses
shall be clearly marked “DUPLICATE”.
   (F)   Posting. All licensees shall conspicuously post their licenses in
their places of business.
   (G)   Resident manager or agent.
      (1)   Before a license is issued under this chapter to an individual who
is a nonresident of the city, to more than one individual whether or not they
are residents of the city, or to a corporation, partnership or association, the
applicant or applicants shall appoint in writing a natural person who is a
resident of the city as its manager or agent.
      (2)   The resident manager or agent shall, by the terms of his or her
written consent:
         (a)   Take full responsibility for the conduct of the licensed
premises; and
         (b)   Serve as agent for service of notices and other process relating
to the license.
      (3)   The manager or agent must be a person who, by reason of age,
character, reputation and other attributes, could qualify individually as a
licensee.
      (4)   If the manager or agent ceases to be a resident of the city or
ceases to act in such capacity for the licensee without appointment of a
successor, the license issued pursuant to the appointment shall be subject to
revocation or suspension.
   (H)   Persons disqualified.
      (1)   No license under this chapter may be issued to:
         (a)   A person not a citizen of the United States or a resident alien;
         (b)   A person who within five years of the license application has
been convicted of a willful violation of a federal or state law, or local
ordinance governing the manufacture, sale, distribution or possession for sale
or distribution, of alcoholic beverages;
         (c)   A person who has had an alcoholic beverage license revoked
within five years of the license application, or to any person who at the time
of the violation owns any interest, whether as a holder of more than five% of
the capital stock of a corporate licensee, as a partner or otherwise, in the
premises or in the business conducted thereon, or to a corporation,
partnership, association, enterprise, business or firm in which any such person
is in any manner interested;
         (d)   A person under the age of 21 years; or
         (e)   A person not of good moral character and repute.
      (2)   No person holding a license from the Commissioner as a
manufacturer, brewer or wholesaler may have any ownership, in whole or in part,
in a business holding an alcoholic beverage license from the city.

sufficient cause.

duties, to be on premises licensed under this chapter more than 30 minutes

establishment is open to the public for serving food.

10.99

should: be accurately located, have well construction determined; and determine
status of use.
         (d)   In 1999, the U.S. EPA finalized the Underground Injection
Control Regulations For Class V Injection Wells, known as the Class V Rule,
Phase 1. The Class V Rule establishes minimum Federal standards for two types
of Class V wells that are of concern in DWSMAs: large capacity cesspools and

the public water supply well(s).
            2.   A groundwater appropriation permit is required from the MnDNR
prior to any use of a high capacity well associated with a mining operation.
         (b)   Wells in mining areas: Wells that are constructed into or
through the aquifer(s) used by a public water supply well(s) may become direct
pathways for contaminants to enter the aquifer if:
            1.   They were not properly constructed;
            2.   They are not adequately maintained; or
            3.   Contaminants are stored or used too close to them. Therefore,
all wells within proposed mining areas should (1) be accurately located, (2)
have well construction determined, and (3) determine status of use.

§ 116.01  PURPOSE.
   Because the city recognizes that many persons under the age of 18 years
purchase or otherwise obtain, possess and use tobacco, tobacco products and
tobacco related devices, and the sales, possession and use are violations of

that most smokers begin smoking before they have reached the age of 18 years,
and that those persons who reach the age of 18 years without having started
smoking are significantly less likely to begin smoking; and because smoking has
been shown to be the cause of several serious health problems which
subsequently place a financial burden on all levels of government, this chapter
shall be intended to regulate the sale, possession and use of tobacco, tobacco
products and tobacco related devices for the purpose of enforcing and
furthering existing laws, to protect minors against the serious effects
associated with the illegal use of tobacco, tobacco products and tobacco
related devices, and to further the official public policy of the state in

      (1)   It is a petty misdemeanor for any person to own, keep, harbor or

taken by any officer as hereinbefore defined and impounded in an animal shelter
and there confined in a humane manner. Impounded animals shall be kept for not

Signed:
__________________________________________
Poundmaster
      (2)   If the owner of the animal be known, written notice of impounding,
in lieu of posted notice, shall be given to the owner thereof, either by mail
or personal service. The date of killing or placement for adoption of the
animal shall be the sixth day after the posting or giving of the notice unless
that date falls on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday, in which case it shall be the
following day.
   (G)   Redemption. Any animal may be reclaimed from the animal shelter by its
owner within the time specified in the notice by the payment to the City
Administrator of the license fee (if required and not paid for the current
year) with the impounding fee plus an amount established by resolution of the
Commission, for each day or fraction of a day that the animal has been confined
as the cost of boarding. Notwithstanding this section, the owner shall remain
subject to all other penalties contained in this section.
   (H)   Disposition of unclaimed animals. Any animal which is not claimed as
provided in division (F) above, within five regular business days after
impounding, shall be painlessly killed and disposed of by the Poundmaster. As
an alternative to the killing and disposal of the animal, the Poundmaster may
transfer the animal to the Pope County Humane Society, Inc., or its successor
for adoption.
   (I)   Permissible return of animals running at large. Notwithstanding the
provisions of division (E) above, if an animal is found running at large and
its owner can be identified and located, the animal need not be impounded, but
may, at the discretion of the officer, be taken to the owner. In that case,
however, proceedings may be taken against the owner for violation of this
section.
   (J)   Confinement of certain animals. Every female animal in heat shall be
confined in a building or other secure enclosure; in a manner that the female
animal cannot come into contact with another animal, except for planned
breeding.
   (K)   Owner obligation for proper care. It is a misdemeanor for any owner to
fail to provide any animal with sufficient good and wholesome food and water,
proper shelter and protection from the weather, veterinary care when needed to
prevent suffering, and with humane care and treatment. It is a misdemeanor for
any person to beat, treat cruelly, torment or otherwise abuse any animal, or
cause or permit any animal fight. It is a misdemeanor for any owner of an
animal to intentionally abandon the animal. Any owner that intentionally
abandons an animal is guilty of a misdemeanor. In addition, the owner shall pay
all reasonable costs incurred by the city in disposing of the animal.
   (L)   Quarantine of certain animals. Any animal which bites a person shall
be quarantined for such time as may be directed by the Health Officer. During
quarantine the animal shall be securely confined and kept from contact with any
other animal. At the discretion of the Health Officer, the quarantine may be on
the premises of the owner; however, if the Health Officer requires other
confinement, the owner shall surrender the animal for the quarantine period to
an animal shelter or shall, at his or her own expense, place it in a veterinary
hospital.
   (M)   Proceedings for destruction of certain animals.
      (1)   Upon sworn complaint to a court of proper jurisdiction that any one
of the following facts exist that any animal at any time, the presiding officer
of the court shall issue a summons directed to the owner of the animal
commanding him or her to appear before the court to show cause why the animal
should not be seized by any police officer, or otherwise disposed of in the
manner authorized in this section. The summons shall be returnable not less
than two, nor more than six days from the date thereof and shall be served at
least two days before the time of appearance mentioned therein:
         (a)   Has destroyed or damaged property or habitually trespasses in a
damaging manner on the property of persons other than the owner;
         (b)   Has attacked or bitten a person or other animal outside the
owner’s or custodian’s premises;
         (c)   Is vicious or shows vicious habits or molests pedestrians or
other animals or interferes with vehicles on the public streets or highways;
         (d)   Is a nuisance as heretofore defined; or
         (e)   Is running at large in violation of this section.
      (2)   Upon the hearing and finding the facts true as complained of, the
court may either order the animal killed at owner’s expense or order the owner
or custodian to remove it from the city, or may order the owner or custodian to
keep it confined to a designated place.
      (3)   If the owner or custodian violates the order, any officer may
impound any animal described in the order. The provisions of this division (M)
are in addition to and supplemental to other provisions of this section. Costs
of the proceeding specified by this division (M) shall be assessed against the
owner or custodian of the animal, if the facts in the complaint are found to be
true; or to the complainant, if the facts are found to be untrue.
   (N)   Summary destruction of certain animals. Whenever an officer has
reasonable cause to believe that a particular animal presents a clear and
immediate danger to residents of the city because it is infected with rabies
(hydrophobia) or because of a clearly demonstrated vicious nature, the officer,
after making reasonable attempts to impound the animal, may summarily destroy
the animal. When any unattended animal shall be injured or diseased, it shall
be impounded. In the event that the capture of the animal cannot be
effectuated, the animal may be destroyed.
   (O)   Appointment of officers. The Commission may from time to time appoint
those persons as may be necessary to assist the police officers of the city in
the enforcement of this section. Those persons shall have police powers insofar
as is necessary to enforce this section, and no person shall interfere with,
hinder or molest them in the exercise of those powers. It is a petty
misdemeanor for any person to refuse upon official inquiry to show or exhibit,
at any reasonable time, any animal in his or her possession or custody.
   (P)   Nonresidents. The divisions of this section requiring a license shall
not apply to nonresidents of the city, provided that dogs of the owners shall
not be kept in the city longer than 30 days without a license and shall be kept
under restraint.

§ 130.13  SOCIAL HOSTS.
   (A)   Findings and purpose.
      (1)   The City Commission finds that:
         (a)   Consumption of alcohol by persons under the age of 21 is harmful
to those persons and constitutes a potential threat to public health from
injuries related to alcohol consumption, such as alcohol overdose or alcohol-
related traffic collisions.
         (b)   Alcohol is also an addictive drug which, if used irresponsibly,
could have drastic effects on those who use it as well as those who are
affected by the actions of an irresponsible user.
         (c)   As a result, gatherings held on private or public property where
alcohol is possessed or consumed by persons under the age of 21 should be
prevented as much as possible.
         (d)   Gatherings involving underage possession and consumption often
occur outside the presence of parents or other responsible adults. However,
there are times when a parent or other adult is present and condones the
activity, and in some circumstances provides the alcohol.
         (e)   Although furnishing alcohol to an underage person is a crime, it
is difficult to prove, and this section is necessary to help further combat
underage consumption.
         (f)   A deterrent effect will be created by holding a person
criminally responsible for hosting a gathering where underage possession or
consumption occurs.
      (2)   The purpose of this section is to discourage underage possession
and consumption of alcohol, even if done within the confines of a private
residence, and to hold persons criminally responsible who host gatherings where
persons under 21 years of age possess or consume alcohol, regardless of whether
the person hosting the gathering supplied the alcohol or was present.
      (3)   The City Commission intends that this section should not target
parents who may have alcoholic beverages on their premises and who have issued
a standing order that alcohol is not to be consumed by underage persons on
those premises.
   (B)   Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following definitions
shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning:
      ALCOHOL.  Ethyl alcohol, hydrated oxide of ethyl, or spirits of wine,
whiskey, rum, brandy, gin, or any other distilled spirits including dilutions
and mixtures thereof from whatever source or by whatever process produced.
      ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE.  Alcohol, spirits, liquor, wine, beer, and every
liquid or solid containing alcohol, spirits, wine, or beer, and which contains
one-half of 1% or more of alcohol by volume and which is fit for beverage

alcoholic beverages will be present; and
         (b)   The person knows that an underage person will attend, or is
likely to attend; and
         (c)   The person fails to take reasonable steps to prevent the
possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages by an underage person; and
         (d)   An underage person consumes an alcoholic beverage, or possesses
an alcoholic beverage with the intent to consume it, at the gathering, event or
premises.
      (2)   Examples of reasonable steps include:
         (a)   Directing, on a one-time basis or as a standing order, that no

         (c)   Checking identification of attendees to determine age; or
         (d)   Supervising the activities of underage persons at the gathering
either in-person or through a responsible adult.
      (3)   A person is not criminally responsible under this section if the
person does not know that a gathering will occur, or does not know that
alcoholic beverages will be present, or does not know that an underage person
will be or is likely to be present. However, if a person has the knowledge
specified in division (C)(1) above, a person who hosts a gathering does not
have to be present at the gathering to be criminally responsible for violation
of this section.

at such a liquor establishment.
      (5)   This section does not apply to a landlord or mortgagee who has not
actually participated in hosting or allowing an event or gathering at a
premises where alcohol is present.
   (E)   Penalty. A violation of this section shall be a misdemeanor.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.01  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION AND POLICY.
   (A)   Statutory authorization. This shoreland ordinance is adopted pursuant
to the authorization and policies contained in M.S. Chapter 103F, as it may be
amended from time to time, Minnesota Regulations, Parts 6120.2500 through
6120.3900, and the planning and zoning enabling legislation in M.S. Chapter
462, as it may be amended from time to time.
   (B)   Policy. The uncontrolled use of shorelands of the city affects the
public health, safety and general welfare by affecting the quality of public
waters, and by impairing the local tax base. Therefore, it is in the best
interests of the public health, safety and welfare to provide for the wise
subdivision, use and development of shorelands of public waters. The
legislature of the state has delegated responsibility to local governments of
the state to regulate the subdivision, use and development of the shorelands
public waters and thus preserve and enhance the quality of surface waters,
conserve the economic and natural environmental values of shorelands, and
provide for the wise use of waters and related land resources. This
responsibility is hereby recognized by the city.
   (C)   General application and interpretation. This section shall apply to
all development, construction, land alteration and subdivision occurring within
the shoreland areas of the city. SHORELAND AREAS are defined as land located
within 1,000 feet from the ordinary high water mark of Lake Minnewaska.

lake, pond or flowage less than ten acres in size in municipalities or 25 acres
in size in unincorporated areas need to be regulated in a local government’s
shoreland regulations. A body of water created by a private use where there was
no previous shoreland may, at the discretion of the City Commission, be exempt
from this chapter.
   (B)   Compliance. The use of any shoreland of public waters, the size and
shape of lots; the use, size, type and location of structures on lots; the
installation and maintenance of water supply and waste treatment systems, the
grading and filling of any shoreland area; the cutting of shoreland vegetation;
and the subdivision of land shall be in full compliance with the terms of this
chapter and other applicable regulations.
   (C)   Administration and enforcement. The City Administrator, acting in
cooperation with the Police Department, is responsible for the administration
and enforcement of this chapter. Violation of any of the provisions of this
chapter or failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violations
of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variances
or conditional uses, shall constitute a misdemeanor and shall be punishable as
provided in §
151.04(B), and as provided in §§
10.99 and
153.008. Violations of this chapter can occur regardless of whether or not a
permit is required for a regulated activity pursuant to §
151.04(A). All remedies for noncompliance enumerated in §
153.008(D) are available to compel compliance with this chapter.
   (D)   Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the
provisions of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall
be liberally construed in favor of the city and shall not be deemed a
limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes.
   (E)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. It is not intended by this
chapter to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed
restrictions; however, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the

instruments that: properly address future vegetative and topographic
alterations, construction of additional buildings, beaching of watercraft and
construction of commercial buildings in residential PUDs; and ensure the long-
term preservation and maintenance of open space in accordance with the criteria
and analysis specified in division (F) below;
      (4)   When necessary, a master plan/drawing describing the project and
the floor plan for all commercial structures to be occupied; and
      (5)   Those additional documents as requested by the Planning Commission
that are necessary to explain how the PUD will be designed and will function.
   (D)   Site “suitable area” evaluation. Proposed new or expansions to
existing planned unit developments must be evaluated using the following
procedures and standards to determine the suitable area for the dwelling unit/
dwelling site density evaluation in division (E) below.
      (1)   The project parcel must be divided into tiers by locating one or
more lines approximately parallel to a line that identifies the ordinary high
water level at the following intervals, proceeding landward:
 
                             Shoreland Tier Dimensions
                             Unsewered (feet) Sewered (feet)
Lake Minnewaska first tier    200              200
Second and additional tiers   267              200
Tributary streams (all tiers) 300              300
 
      (2)   The suitable area within each tier is next calculated by excluding
from the tier area all wetlands, bluffs or land below the ordinary high water
level of public waters. The suitable area and the proposed project are then
subjected to either the residential or commercial planned unit development
density evaluation steps to arrive at an allowable number of dwelling units or
sites.
   (E)   Residential and commercial PUD density evaluation. The procedures for
determining the “base” density of a PUD and density increase multipliers are as
follows. Allowable densities may be transferred from any tier to any other tier
further from the water body, but must not be transferred to any other tier
closer.
      (1)   Residential PUD “base” density evaluation. The suitable area within
each tier is divided by the single residential lot size standard for lakes or,
for rivers, the single residential lot width standard times the tier depth,
unless the local unit of government has specified an alternative minimum lot
size for rivers which shall then be used to yield a base density of dwelling
units or sites for each tier. Proposed locations and numbers of dwelling units
or sites for the residential planned unit developments are then compared with
the tier, density and suitability analyses herein and the design criteria in
division (F) below.
      (2)   Commercial PUD “base” density evaluation.
         (a)   Determine the average inside living area size of dwelling units
or sites within each tier, including both existing and proposed units and
sites. Computation of inside living area sizes need not include decks, patios,
stoops, steps, garages or porches and basements, unless they are habitable
space.
         (b)   Select the appropriate floor area ratio from the following
table:
Commercial Planned Unit Development Floor Area Ratios
Average Unit Floor Area  Sewered Lots and First Second and Additional Tiers
(Sq. Ft.)                Tier on Unsewered Lots
Commercial Planned Unit Development Floor Area Ratios
Average Unit Floor Area  Sewered Lots and First Second and Additional Tiers
(Sq. Ft.)                Tier on Unsewered Lots
1,000                    0.108                  0.054
1,100                    0.116                  0.058
1,200                    0.125                  0.064
1,300                    0.133                  0.068
1,400                    0.142                  0.072
1,500                    0.150                  0.075
*For average unit floor areas less than shown, use the floor area ratios
listed for 200 square feet. For areas greater than shown, use the ratios
listed for 1,500 square feet. For recreational camping areas, use the
ratios listed at 400 square feet. Manufactured home sites in recreational
camping areas shall use a ratio equal to the size of the manufactured home,
or if unknown, the ratio used for 1,000 square feet.
 
         (c)   Multiply the suitable area within each tier by the floor area
ratio for yield total floor area for each tier allowed to be used for dwelling
units or tiers.
         (d)   Divide the total floor area by tier computed in division (E)(2)
(c) above by the average inside living area size determined in division (E)(2)
(a) above. This yields a base number of dwelling units and sites for each tier.
         (e)   Proposed location and numbers of dwelling units or sites for the
commercial planned unit development are then compared with the tier, density
and suitability analyses herein and the design criteria in division (F) below.
      (3)   Density increase multipliers.
         (a)   Increases in the dwelling unit or dwelling site base densities
previously determined are allowable if the dimensional standards in §§
151.35 through
151.42 are met or exceeded and the design criteria in division (F) below are
satisfied. The allowable density increased in division (E)(3)(b) below. below
will only be allowed if structure setbacks from the ordinary high water level
are increased to at least 50% greater than the minimum setback, or the impact
on the water body is reduced an equivalent amount through vegetative
management, topography or additional means acceptable in the local unit of
government and the setback is at least 25% greater than the minimum setback.
         (b)   Allowable dwelling unit or dwelling site density increases for
residential or commercial planned unit developments:
 
Density Evaluation Tiers Maximum Density Increase Within Each Tier (Percent)
First                    50
Second                   100
Third                    200
Fourth                   200
Fifth                    200
 
   (F)   Maintenance and design criteria.
      (1)   Maintenance and administration requirements.
         (a)   Adequate provisions. Before final approval of a planned unit
development, adequate provisions must be developed for preservation and
maintenance in perpetuity of open spaces and for the continued existence and
functioning of the development.
         (b)   Open space preservation. Deed restrictions, covenants, permanent
easements, public dedication and acceptance or other equally effective and
permanent means must be provided to ensure long-term preservation and
maintenance of open space. The instruments must include all of the following
protections:
            1.   Commercial uses prohibited (for residential PUDs);
            2.   Vegetation and topographic alterations other than routine
maintenance prohibited;
            3.   Construction of additional buildings or storage of vehicles
and other materials prohibited; and
            4.   Uncontrolled beaching of watercraft prohibited.
         (c)   Development organization and functioning. Unless an equally
effective alternative community framework is established, when applicable, all
residential planned unit developments must use an owners association with the
following features:
            1.   Membership must be mandatory for each dwelling unit or site
purchaser and any successive purchasers;
            2.   Each member must pay a pro rata share of the association’s
expenses, and unpaid assessments can become liens on units or sites;
            3.   Assessments must be adjustable to accommodate changing
conditions; and
            4.   The association must be responsible for insurance, taxes and
maintenance of all commonly owned property and facilities.
      (2)   Open space requirements. Planned unit developments must contain
open space meeting all of the following criteria:
            1.   At least 50% of the total project area must be preserved as
open space;
            2.   Dwelling units or sites, road right-of-way or land covered by
road surfaces, parking areas or structures, except water-oriented accessory
structures or facilities, are developed areas and shall not be included in the
computation of minimum open space;
            3.   Open space must include areas with physical characteristics
unsuitable for development in their natural state, and areas containing
significant historic sites or unplatted cemeteries;
            4.   Open space may include outdoor recreational facilities for use
by owners of dwelling units or sites, by guests staying in commercial dwelling
units or sites, and by the general public;
            5.   Open space may include subsurface sewage treatment systems if
the use of the space is restricted to avoid adverse impacts on the systems;
            6.   Open space must not include commercial facilities or uses, but
may contain water-oriented accessory structures or facilities;
            7.   The appearance of open space areas, including topography,
vegetation and allowable uses, must be preserved by use of restrictive deed
covenants, permanent easements, public dedication and acceptance, or other
equally effective and permanent means; and
            8.   The shore impact zone, based on normal structure setbacks must
be included as open space. For residential PUDs, at least 50% of the shore
impact zone area of existing developments or at least 70% of the shore impact
zone area of new developments must be preserved in its natural or existing
state. For commercial PUDs, at least 50% of the shore impact zone must be
preserved in its natural state.
      (3)   Erosion control and stormwater management. Erosion control and
stormwater management plans must be developed and the PUD must:
         (a)   Be designed, and the construction managed, to minimize the
likelihood of serious erosion occurring either during or after construction.
This must be accomplished by limiting the amount and length of time of bare
ground exposure. Temporary ground covers, sediments entrapment facilities,
vegetated buffer strips or other appropriate techniques must be used to
minimize erosion impacts on surface water features. Erosion control plans
approved by a soil and water conservation district may be required if project
size and site physical characteristics warrant; and
         (b)   Be designed and constructed to effectively manage reasonably
expected quantities and qualities of stormwater runoff. Impervious surface
coverage within any tier must exceed 25% of the tier area, except that for
commercial PUDs 35% impervious surface coverage may be allowed in the first
tier of general development unit with an approved stormwater management plan
and consistency with §
151.37.
      (4)   Centralization and design of facilities. Centralization and design
of facilities and structures must be done according to the following standards.
         (a)   Planned unit developments must be connected to publicly owned
water supply and sewer systems, if available. On-site water supply and sewage
treatment systems must be centralized and designed and installed to meet or
exceed applicable standards or rules of the State Department of Health and §§
151.36 and
151.42. On-site sewage treatment systems must be located on the most suitable
areas of the development, and sufficient lawn area free of limiting factors
must be provided for a replacement soil treatment system for each sewage
systems.
         (b)   Dwelling units or sites must be clustered into one or more
groups and located on suitable areas of the development. They must be designed
and located to meet or exceed the following dimensional standards for the
relevant shoreland classification: setback from the ordinary high water level,
elevation above the surface water features, and maximum height. Setbacks from
the ordinary high water level must be increased in accordance with division (E)
(3) above for developments with density increases.
         (c)   Shore recreation facilities, including, but not limited to,
swimming areas, docks and watercraft mooring areas and launching ramps, must be
centralized and located in areas suitable for them. Evaluation of suitability
must include consideration of land slope, water depth, vegetation, soils, depth
of groundwater and bedrock or other relevant factors. The number of spaces
provided for continuous beaching, mooring or docking of watercraft must not
exceed one for each allowable dwelling unit or site in the first tier
(notwithstanding existing mooring sites in an existing commercially used
harbor). Launching ramp facilities, including a small dock for loading and
unloading equipment, may be provided for use by occupants of dwelling units or
sites located in other tiers.
         (d)   Structures, parking areas and other facilities must be treated
to reduce visibility as viewed from public waters and adjacent shorelands by
vegetation, topography, increased setbacks, color or other means acceptable to
the local unit of government, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions. Vegetative
and topographic screening must be preserved, if existing, or may be required to
be provided.
         (e)   Accessory structures and facilities, except water oriented
accessory structures, must meet the required principal structure setback and
must be centralized.
         (f)   Water-oriented accessory structures and facilities may be
allowed if they meet or exceed design standards contained in §
151.36 and are centralized.
   (G)   Conversions. Existing resorts or other land uses and facilities to be
converted to residential planned unit developments if all of the following
standards are met.
      (1)   Proposed conversions must be initially evaluated using the same
procedures for residential planned unit developments involving all new
construction. Inconsistencies between existing features of the development and
these standards must be identified.
      (2)   Deficiencies involving water supply and sewage treatment, structure
color, impervious coverage, open space and shore recreation facilities must be
corrected as part of the conversion or as specified in the conditional use
permit.
      (3)   Shore and bluff impact zone deficiencies must be evaluated and
reasonable improvements made as part of the conversion. These improvements must
include, where applicable, the following:
         (a)   Removal of extraneous buildings, docks or other facilities that
no longer need to be located in shore or bluff impact zones;
         (b)   Remedial measures to correct erosion sites and improve
vegetative cover and screening of buildings and other facilities as viewed from
the water; and
         (c)   If existing dwelling units are located in shore or bluff impact
zones, conditions are attached to approvals of conversions that preclude
exterior expansions in any dimension or substantial alterations. The conditions
must also provide for future relocation of dwelling units, where feasible, to
other locations, meeting all setback and elevation requirements when they are
rebuilt or replaced.
      (4)   Existing dwelling unit or dwelling site densities that exceed
standards in division (E) above may be allowed to continue but must not be
allowed to be increased, either at the time of conversion or in the future.
Efforts must be made during the conversion to limit impacts of high densities
by requiring seasonal use, improving vegetative screening, centralizing shore
recreation facilities, installing new sewage treatment systems, or other means.

151.05. Only land above the ordinary high water level of public waters can be
used to meet lot area standards, and lot width standards must be met at both
the ordinary high water level and at the building line. The sewer lot area
dimensions in division (B) above can only be used if publicly owned sewer
system service is available to the property.
      (2)   One guest cottage may be allowed on lots meeting or exceeding the
duplex lot area and width dimensions presented in this section, provided the
following standards are met:
         (a)   For lots exceeding the minimum lot dimensions of duplex lots,
the guest cottage must be located within the smallest duplex-sized lot that
could be created including the principal dwelling unit;
         (b)   A guest cottage must not cover more than 700 square feet of land
surface and must not exceed 15 feet in height; and
         (c)   A guest cottage must be located or designed to reduce its
visibility as viewed from public waters and adjacent shorelands by vegetation,
topography, increased setbacks or color, assuming summer leaf-on conditions.
      (3)   Lots intended as controlled accesses to public waters or as
recreation areas for use by owners of nonriparian lots within subdivisions are
permissible and must meet or exceed the following standards:
         (a)   They must meet the width and size requirements for residential
lots, and be suitable for the intended uses of controlled access lots;
         (b)   If a controlled access lot is used for docking, mooring or over-
water storage of more than six watercraft, then the width of the lot (keeping
the same lot depth) must be increased by 5% of the requirements for riparian
residential lots for each watercraft beyond six;
         (c)   Controlled access lots must be jointly owned by all purchasers
of lots in the subdivision or by all purchasers of nonriparian lots in the
subdivision who are provided riparian access rights on the access lot; and
         (d)   Covenants or other equally effective legal instruments must be
developed that specify which lots owners have authority to use the access lot
and what activities are allowed. The activities may include watercraft
launching, loading, storage, beaching, mooring or docking. They must also
include other outdoor recreational activities that do not significantly
conflict with general public use of the public water or the enjoyment of normal
property rights by adjacent property owners. Examples of the nonsignificant
conflict activities including swimming, sunbathing or picnicking. The covenants
must limit the total number of vehicles allowed to be parked and the total
number of watercraft allowed to be continuously moored, docked or stored over
water, and must require centralization of all common facilities and activities
in the most suitable locations on the lot to minimize topographic and
vegetation alterations. They must also require all parking areas, storage
buildings and other facilities to be screened by vegetation or topography as
much as practical from view from the public water, assuming summer, leaf-on
condition.

§ 151.36  PLACEMENT, DESIGN AND HEIGHT OF STRUCTURES.
   (A)   Placement of structures on lots.
      (1)   When more than one setback applies to a site, structures and
facilities must be located to meet all setbacks.
      (2)   Where structures exist on the adjoining lots on both sides of a
proposed building site, structure setbacks may be altered without a variance to
conform to the adjoining setbacks from the ordinary high water level, provided
the proposed building site is not located in a shore impact zone or in a bluff
impact zone.
      (3)   Structures shall be located as follows.
         (a)   Structure and on-site sewage system setbacks (in feet) from
ordinary high water level.
 
Public Water      Structures        Sewage Treatment System
                  Unsewered Sewered
Lake Minnewaska   75        50      50
Tributary streams 100       50      75
*One water-oriented accessory structure designed in accordance with division
(B) below may be set back a minimum distance of ten feet from the ordinary
high water level
 
         (b)   Additional structure setbacks. The following additional
structure setbacks apply, regardless of the classification of the water body:
 
Setback From:                                                Setback (in feet)
Top of bluff                                                 30
Unplatted cemetery                                           50
Right-of-way line of federal, state or county highway        50
Right-of-way line of town road, public street or other roads 20
and streets not classified
 
         (c)   Bluff impact zones. Structures and accessory facilities, except
stairways and landings, must not be placed within bluff impact zones.
         (d)   Uses without water-oriented needs. Commercial, industrial,
public and semi-public uses without water-oriented needs must be located on
lots or parcels without public waters frontage, or, if located on lots or
parcels with public waters frontage, must either be set back double the normal
ordinary high water level setback or be substantially screened from view from
the water by vegetation or topography, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions.
   (B)   Design criteria for structures.
      (1)   High water elevations. Structures must be placed in accordance with
any floodplain regulations applicable to the site. Where these controls do not
exist, the elevation to which the lowest floor, including basement, is placed
or flood-proofed must be determined as follows:
         (a)   For lakes, by placing the lowest floor at a level at least three
feet above the highest known water level, or three feet above the ordinary high
water level, whichever is higher;
         (b)   For rivers and streams, by placing the lowest floor at least
three feet above the flood of record, if data is available. If data are not
available, by placing the lowest floor at least three feet above the ordinary
high water level, or by conducting a technical evaluation to determine effects
of proposed construction upon flood stages and flood flows and to establish a
flood protection elevation. Under these three approaches, technical evaluations
must be done by a qualified engineer or hydrologist consistent with parts
6120.5000 to 6120.6200 governing the management of floodplain areas. If more
than one approach is used, the highest flood protection elevation determined
must be used for placing structures and other facilities; and
         (c)   Water-oriented accessory structures may have the lowest floor
placed lower than the elevation determined in this item if the structure is
constructed of flood-resistant materials to the elevation, electrical and
mechanical equipment is placed above the elevation and, if long duration
flooding is anticipated, the structure is built to withstand ice action and
wind-driven waves and debris.
      (2)   Water-oriented accessory structures. Each lot may have one water-
oriented accessory structure not meeting the normal structure setback in
division (A) above if the water-oriented accessory structure complies with the
following provisions:
         (a)   The structure or facility must not exceed ten feet in height,
exclusive of safety rails and cannot occupy an area greater than 250 square
feet. Detached decks must not exceed eight feet above grade at any point;
         (b)   The setback of the structure or facility from the ordinary high
water level must be at least ten feet;
         (c)   The structure or facility must be treated to reduce visibility
as viewed from public waters and adjacent shorelands by vegetation, topography,
increased setbacks or color, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions;
         (d)   The roof may be used as a deck with safety rails, but must not
be enclosed or used as a storage area;
         (e)   The structure or facility must not be designed or used for human
habitation and must not contain water supply or sewage treatment facilities;
and
         (f)   Water-oriented accessory structures used solely for watercraft
storage, and including storage of related boating and water-oriented sporting
equipment, may occupy an area up to 400 square feet provided the maximum width
of the structure is 20 feet as measured parallel to the configuration of the
shoreline.
      (3)   Stairways, lifts and landings. Stairways and lifts are the
preferred alternative to major topographic alterations for achieving access up
and down bluffs and steep slopes to shore areas. Stairways and lifts must meet
the following design requirements:
         (a)   Stairways and lifts must not exceed four feet in width on
residential lots. Wider stairways may be used for commercial properties, public
open-space recreational properties and planned unit developments;
         (b)   Landings for stairways and lifts on residential lots must not
exceed 32 square feet in area. Landings larger than 32 square feet may be used
for commercial properties, public open-space recreational properties and
planned unit developments;
         (c)   Canopies or roofs are not allowed on stairways, lifts or
landings;
         (d)   Stairways, lifts and landings may be either constructed above
ground on posts or pilings, or placed into the ground, provided they are
designed and built in a manner that ensures control of soil erosion;
         (e)   Stairways, lifts and landings must be located in the most
visually inconspicuous portions of lots, as viewed from the surface of the
public water assuming summer, leaf-on conditions, whenever practical; and
         (f)   Facilities such as ramps, lifts or mobility paths for physically
disabled persons are also allowed for achieving access for shore areas,
provided that the dimensional and performance standards of divisions (B)(3)(a)
through (B)(3)(e) above are complied with in addition to the requirements of
Minn. Regulations, Chapter 1340.
      (4)   Significant historic sites. No structure may be placed on a
significant historic site in a manner that affects the values of the site
unless adequate information about the site has been removed and documented in a
public repository.
      (5)   Steep slopes. The City Administrator must evaluate possible soil
erosion impacts and development visibility from public waters before issuing a
permit for construction of sewage treatment systems, roads, driveways,
structures or other improvements on steep slopes. When determined necessary,
conditions must be attached to issued permits to prevent erosion and to
preserve existing vegetation screening of structures, vehicles and other
facilities as viewed from the surface of public waters, assuming summer, leaf-
on vegetation.
   (C)   Height of structures. All structures in city residential districts,
except churches and nonresidential agricultural structures, must not exceed 25
feet in height.
(Ord. 31, passed - -1995)
§ 151.37  SHORELAND ALTERATION.
   Alterations of vegetation and topography will be regulated to prevent
erosion into public waters, fix nutrients, preserve shoreland aesthetics,
preserve historic values, prevent bank slumping and protect fish and wildlife
habitat.
   (A)   Vegetation alterations.
      (1)   Vegetation alteration necessary for the construction of structures
and sewage treatment systems and the construction of roads and parking areas
regulated by §
151.38 are exempt from the vegetation alteration standards that follows.
      (2)   Removal or alteration of vegetation, except for agricultural and
forest management uses are regulated in §
151.40(B) and (C), respectfully, is allowed subject to the following standards.
         (a)   Intensive vegetation clearing within the shore and bluff impact
zones and on steep slopes is not allowed. Intensive vegetation clearing for
forest land conversion to another use outside of these areas is allowable as a
conditional use if an erosion control and sedimentation plan is developed and
approved by the soil and water conservation district in which the property is
located.
         (b)   In shore and bluff impact zones and on steep slopes, limited
clearing of trees and shrubs and cutting, pruning and trimming of trees is
allowed to provide a view to the water from the principal dwelling site and to
accommodate the placement from stairways and landings, picnic areas, access
paths, livestock watering areas, beach and watercraft access areas, and
permitted water-oriented accessory structures or facilities, provided that:
            1.   The screening of structures, vehicles or other facilities as
viewed from the water, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions, is not
substantially reduced;

trees, limbs or branches that are dead, diseased or pose safety hazards.
   (B)   Topographic alterations/grading and filling.
      (1)   Grading and filling and excavations necessary for the construction
of structures, sewage treatment systems and driveways under validly issued
construction permits for these facilities do not require the issuance of a
separate grading and filling permit; however, the grading and filling standards
in this section must be incorporated into the issuance of permits for
construction of structures, sewage treatment systems and driveways.
      (2)   Public road and parking areas are regulated by §
151.38.
      (3)   Notwithstanding divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2) above, a grading and

         (a)   The movement of more than ten cubic yards of material on steep
slopes or within shore or bluff impact zones; and
         (b)   The movement of more than 50 cubic yards of material outside of
steep slopes and shore and bluff impact zones.
      (4)   The following considerations and conditions must be adhered to
during the issuance of construction permits, grading and filling permits,
conditional use permits, variances and subdivision approvals:
         (a)   1.   Grading and filling in any type 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8
wetland must be evaluated to determine how extensively the proposed activity
would affect the following functional qualities of the wetland:
               a.   Sediment and pollutant trapping and retention;
               b.   Storage of surface runoff to prevent or reduce flood
damage;
               c.   Fish and wildlife habitat;
               d.   Recreational use;
               e.   Shoreline or bank stabilization; and
               f.   Noteworthiness, including special qualities such as
historic significance, critical habitat for endangered plants and animals, or
others.
            2.   The evaluation required by this section must also include a
determination of whether the wetland alteration being proposed requires
permits, reviews, or approvals by other local, state or federal agencies such
as a watershed district, the State Department of Natural Resources or the
United States Army Corps of Engineers. The applicant will be so advised.
         (b)   Alterations must be designed and conducted in a manner that
ensures only the smallest amount of bare ground is exposed for the shortest
time possible;
         (c)   Mulches or similar materials must be used, where necessary, for
temporary bare soil coverages, and a permanent vegetation cover must be
established as soon as possible;
         (d)   Methods to minimize soil erosion and to trap sediments before
they reach any surface water feature must be used;
         (e)   Altered areas must be stabilized to acceptable erosion control
standards consistent with the field office technical guides of the local soil
and water conservation districts and the United States Soil Conservation
Service;
         (f)   Fill or excavated material must not be placed in a manner that
creates an unstable slope;
         (g)   Plans to place fill or excavated material on steep slopes must
be reviewed by qualified professionals for continued slope stability and must
not create finished slopes of 30% or greater;
         (h)   Fill or excavated material must not be placed in bluff impact
zones;
         (i)   Any alteration below the ordinary high water level of public
waters must first be authorized by the commissioner under M.S. § 103G.245, as
it may be amended from time to time;
         (j)   Alterations to topography must only be allowed if they are
accessory to permitted or conditional uses and do not adversely affect adjacent
or nearby properties; and
         (k)   Placement of natural rock riprap, including associated grading
of the shoreline and placement of a filter blanket, is permitted if the
finished slope does not exceed three feet horizontal to one foot vertical, the
landward extent of the riprap is within ten feet of the ordinary high water
level, and the height of the riprap above the ordinary high water level does
not exceed three feet.
      (5)   Connections to public waters. Excavations where the intended
purpose is connection to a public water such as boat slips, canals, lagoons and
harbors, must be controlled by local shoreland controls. Permission for
excavations may be given only after the Commissioner has approved the proposed
connection to public waters.
(Ord. 31, passed - -1995)
§ 151.38  PLACEMENT AND DESIGN OF ROAD, DRIVEWAYS AND PARKING AREAS.
   (A)   Public and private roads and parking areas must be designed to take
advantage of natural vegetation and topography to achieve maximum screening
from view from public waters. Documentation must be provided by a qualified
individual that all roads and parking areas are designed and constructed to
minimize and control erosion to public waters consistent with the field office
technical guides of the local soil and water conservation district, or other
applicable technical materials.
   (B)   Roads, driveways and parking areas must meet structure setbacks and
must not be placed within bluff and shore impact zones, when other reasonable
and feasible placement alternative exist. If no alternatives exist, they may be
placed within these areas, and must be designed to minimize adverse impacts.
   (C)   Public and private watercraft access ramps, approach roads and access-
related parking areas may be placed within shore impact zones provided the
vegetative screening and erosion control conditions of this subpart are met.
For private facilities, the grading and filling provisions of §
151.37(B) must be met.
(Ord. 31, passed - -1995)
§ 151.39  STORMWATER MANAGEMENT.
   The following general and specific standards shall apply.
   (A)   General standards.
      (1)   When possible, existing natural drainageways, wetlands and
vegetated soil surfaces must be used to convey, store, filter and retain
stormwater runoff before discharge to public waters.
      (2)   Development must be planned and conducted in a manner that will
minimize the extent of disturbed areas, runoff velocities, erosion potential
and reduce and delay runoff volumes. Disturbed areas must be stabilized and
protected as soon as possible and facilities or methods used to retain sediment
on the site.
      (3)   When development density, topographic features and soil and
vegetation conditions are not sufficient to adequately handle stormwater runoff
using natural features and vegetation, various types of constructed facilities
such as diversions, settling basins, skimming devices, dikes, waterways and

§ 151.43  NONCONFORMITIES.
   Any legally established nonconformities as of the date of this chapter may
continue but will be managed according to the applicable state statutes and
other regulations of  this community for the subjects of alterations and
additions, repair after damage, discontinuance of use, and intensification of
use; except that the following standards will also apply in shoreland areas.
   (A)   Construction on nonconforming lots of record.
      (1)   Lots of record in the office of the county recorder on the date of
enactment of local shoreland controls that do not meet the requirements of
151.35 may be allowed as building sites without variances from lot size
requirements provided the use is permitted in the zoning district, the lot has
been in separate ownership from abutting lands at all times since it became
substandard, was created compliant with official controls in effect at the
time, and sewage treatment and setback requirements of this chapter are met.
      (2)   A variance from setback requirements must be obtained before any
use, sewage treatment system, or building permit is issued for a nonconforming
lot. In evaluating the variance, the Board of Adjustment shall consider sewage
treatment and water supply capabilities or constraints of the lot and shall
deny the variance if adequate facilities cannot be provided.
      (3)   If, in a group of two or more contiguous lots under the same
ownership, any individual lot does not meet the requirements of §
151.35, the lot must not be considered as a separate parcel of land for the
purposes of sale or development. The lot must be combined with one or more
contiguous lots so they equal one or more parcels of land, each meeting the
requirements of §
151.35 as much as possible.
   (B)   Additions/expansions to nonconforming structures.
      (1)   All additions or expansions to the outside dimensions of an
existing nonconf orming structure must meet the setback, height, and others
requirements of §§

reasonable\location for a deck meeting or exceeding the existing ordinary high
water level setback of the structures;
         (c)   The deck encroachment toward the ordinary high water level does
not exceed 15% of the existing setback of the structure from the ordinary high
water level or does not encroach closer than 30 feet, whichever is more
restrictive; and
         (d)   The deck is constructed primarily of wood, and is not roofed or
screened.
   (C)   Nonconforming sewage treatment systems.
      (1)   A sewage treatment system not meeting the requirements of §
151.42 must be upgraded, at a minimum, at any time a permit or variance of any
type is required or any improvement on, or use of, the property. For the
purposes of this provision, a sewage treatment system shall not be considered
nonconforming if the only deficiency is the sewage treatment system's improper
setback from the ordinary high water level.
      (2)   The City Commission has by formal resolution notified the
commissioner of its program to identify nonconforming sewage treatment systems.
The city will require upgrading or replacement of any nonconforming system
identified by this program within a reasonable period of time which will not
exceed two years. Sewage systems installed according to all applicable local
shoreland management standards adopted pursuant to M.S. §§ 105.485 or 103F.221
in effect at the time of installation may be considered as conforming unless
they are determined to be failing, except that systems using cesspools,
leaching pits, seepage pits, or other deep disposal methods, or systems with
less soil treatment area separation above groundwater than required by the
Minnesota Pollution Control Agency's Chapter 7080 for design of on-site sewage
treatment systems, shall be considered nonconforming.

§ 151.44  SUBDIVISION/PLATTING PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Land \suitability.  Each lot created through subdivision, including
planned unit development authorized under §
151.42 must be suitable in its natural site for the proposes use with minimal
alteration. Suitability analysis by the city shall include an assessment
regarding susceptibility to flooding, existence of wetlands, soil and rock
formations with severe limitations for development, severe erosion potential,
steep topography, inadequate watery supply or sewage treatment capabilities, 
near-shore aquatic\conditions unsuitable for water-based recreation, important
fish and wildlife habitat, presence of significant historic sites, or any other
feature of the natural land likely to be harmful to the health, safety, or
welfare of future residents of the proposed subdivision or of the community.
   (B)   Consistency with other controls. Subdivisions must conform to all
official controls of this community. A subdivision will not be approved where a
later variance from one or more standards in official controls would be needed
to use the lots for their intended purpose. In areas not served by publicly
owned sewer and water systems, a subdivision will not be approved unless
domestic water supply is available and a sewage treatment system consistent
with §
151.36 and §
151.42 can be provided for every lot. Each lot shall meet the minimum lot size
and dimensional requirements of §
151.35, including at least a minimum contiguous lawn area, that is free of
limiting factors sufficient for the construction of two standard soil treatment
systems. Lots that would require use of holding tanks must not be approved.
   (C)   Information requirements. Sufficient information must be submitted by
the applicant for the community to make a determination of land suitability.
The information shall include at least the following:
      (1)   Topographic contours at ten-four intervals or less from United
States Geological Survey maps  or more accurate sources, showing limiting site
characteristics;
      (2)   The surface water features required in M.S. § 505.02, Subd. 1, to
be shown on plats, obtained from United States Geological Survey quadrangle
topographic maps or more accurate sources;
      (3)   Adequate soils information to determine suitability for building
and on-site sewage treatment capabilities for every lot from the most current
existing sources or from field investigations such as soil borings, percolation
tests,  or other methods;
      (4)   Information regarding adequacy of domestic water supply; extent of
anticipated vegetation and topographic alterations; near-shore aquatic
conditions, including depths, types of bottom sediments, and aquatic
vegetation; and proposed methods for controlling stormwater runoff and erosion,
both during and after construction activities;
      (5)   Location of 100-year flood plain areas and floodway districts from
existing adopted maps or data; and
      (6)   A line or contour representing the ordinary high water level, the
“toe” and the “top” of bluffs, and the minimum building setback distances from
the top of the bluff and the lake or stream.
   (D)   Dedications. When a land or easement dedication is a condition of
subdivision approval, the approval must provide easements over natural drainage
or ponding areas for management of stormwater and significant wetlands.
   (E)   Platting. All subdivisions that create five or more lots or parcels
that are two and one-half acres or less in size shall be processed as a plat in
accordance with M.S. Chapter 505. No permit for construction of buildings or
sewage treatment systems shall be issued for lots created after these official
controls were enacted unless the lot was approved as part of a formal
subdivision.
   (F)   Controlled access or recreational lots. Lots intended as controlled
accesses to public waters or for recreational use areas for use by nonriparian
lots within a subdivision must meet or exceed the sizing criteria in §
151.35.

(Ord. 66, passed 10-12-1999)
§ 152.08  COMPLETION AND MAINTENANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Costs of improvements. All required improvements shall be made by the
developer, at the developer’s expense, without reimbursement by the local
government. The city, at its discretion, may choose to participate in the costs
of improvements based upon the public benefit of a project, through a
development agreement.
   (B)   Acceptance of dedication offers. Acceptance of formal offers of
dedication of streets, public areas, easements and parks shall be by ordinance
of the governing body. The approval of a subdivision plat by the City
Commission, whether sketch, preliminary or final, shall not be deemed to
constitute or imply the acceptance by the municipality of any street, easement
or park shown on the plat.
   (C)   Inspection of improvements. The Planning Commission shall provide for
inspection of required improvements during construction and ensure their
satisfactory completion. The applicant shall pay to the municipality an
inspection fee based on the estimated cost of inspection. These fees shall be
due and payable upon demand of the municipality and no building permits or
certificates of occupancy shall be issued until all fees are paid. If the Local
Government Engineer finds, upon inspection, that any one or more of the
required improvements have not been constructed in accordance with the
municipality’s construction standards and specifications, the applicant shall
be responsible for properly completing the improvements.
   (D)   Maintenance of improvements. The developer shall be required to
maintain all required public improvements on the individual subdivided lots and
provide for snow removal on streets and sidewalks, if required by the Planning
Commission, until acceptance of the improvements by the governing body. If
there are any certificates of occupancy on a street not yet dedicated to the
local government, the local government may, on 12 hours notice, plow the street
or effect emergency repairs and charge those costs to the developer. Following
the acceptance of the dedication of any public improvement by the local
government, the government may, in its sole discretion, require the subdivider
to maintain the improvement for a period of one year from the date of
acceptance.
   (E)   Deferral of required improvements. Whenever it is deemed necessary by
the governing body to defer the construction of any improvement required under
these regulations because of incompatible grades, future planning, inadequate
or nonexistent connecting facilities, or for other reasons, the subdivider
shall pay his or her share of the costs of the future improvements to the local
government prior to the signing of the final subdivision plat by the Mayor, or
the developer may execute a separate subdivision improvement agreement, secured
by a letter of credit, guaranteeing completion of the deferred improvements
upon demand of the local government.
   (F)   Issuance of building permits and certificates of occupancy.
      (1)   When a subdivision improvement agreement or security has been
required for a subdivision, no certification of occupancy for any building in
the subdivision shall be issued prior to the completion of the required public
improvements and the acceptance of the dedication of those improvements by the
local government.
      (2)   The extent of street improvement shall be adequate for vehicular
access by the prospective occupant(s) and by police and fire equipment prior to
the issuance of an occupancy permit. The developer shall, at the time of the
offer of dedication, submit monies in escrow to the local government in a sum
determined by the Local Government Engineer for the necessary final, if any,
improvement of the street.
      (3)   No building permit shall be issued for the final 10% of lots in a
subdivision, or if 10% be less than two, for the final two lots of a
subdivision, until all public improvements required by governing body for the
subdivision have been fully completed and the local government has accepted the
developer’s offer(s) to dedicate the improvements.
   (G)   Consumer protection legislation and conflicts of interest statutes.
      (1)   No building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be granted or
issued if a developer, or its authorized agent, has violated any federal, state
or local law pertaining to:
         (a)   Consumer protection;
         (b)   Real estate land sales, promotion or practices; or
         (c)   Any applicable conflicts-of-interest legislation with respect to
the lot or parcel of land which is the subject of the permit or certificate
until a court of competent jurisdiction so orders.
      (2)   With respect to any lot or parcel of land described in the
immediately preceding section, if a building permit or certificate of occupancy
has been granted or issued, it may be revoked by the municipality until a court
of competent jurisdiction orders otherwise, provided that in no event shall the
rights of intervening innocent third parties in possession of a certificate of
occupancy be prejudiced by any such revocation.
      (3)   Any violation of a federal, state or local consumer protection law,
including, but not limited to: the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970, being 39

approval any plat or subdivision that does not make adequate provision for
storm and flood water runoff channels or basins. The local government may
require the use of control methods such as retention or detention, and/or the
construction of off-site drainage improvements to mitigate the impacts of the
proposed developments.
   (B)   Location. The applicant may be required by the Planning Commission or
City Commission to carry away, by pipe or open ditch, any spring or surface
water that may exist, either previously to, or as a result of, the subdivision.
The drainage facilities shall be located in the road right-of-way where
feasible or in perpetual unobstructed easements of appropriate width, and shall
be constructed in accordance with the construction standards and
specifications.
   (C)   Upstream drainage. A culvert or other drainage facility shall in each
case be large enough to accommodate potential runoff from its entire upstream
drainage area, whether inside or outside the subdivision.
   (D)   Downstream drainage. Where it is anticipated that the additional
runoff incident to the development of the subdivision will overload an existing

(Ord. 66, passed 10-12-1999)
§ 152.32  EXTENSION POLICIES.
   All public improvements and required easements shall be extended through the
parcel on which new development is proposed. Streets, water lines, wastewater
systems, drainage facilities, electric lines and telecommunications lines shall
be constructed through new development to promote the logical extension of
public infrastructure. The local government may require the applicant of a
subdivision to extend off site improvements to reach the subdivision, or
oversize required public facilities to serve anticipated future development as
a condition of plat approval.
(Ord. 66, passed 10-12-1999)
§ 152.33  MONUMENTS.
   The applicant shall place permanent reference monuments in the subdivision
as required in these regulations and as approved by a registered land surveyor.
   (A)   Monuments. Monuments shall be located on street right-of-way lines, at
street intersections, angle points of curve and block corners. They shall be
spaced so as to be within sight of each other, the sight lines being contained
wholly within the street limits. All monuments required by these regulations
shall be set flush with the ground and planted in such a manner that they will
not be removed by frost. All monuments shall be set in the ground and approved
by a registered land surveyor prior to the time the Planning Commission
recommends approval of the final plat.
   (B)   External boundaries. The external boundaries of a subdivision shall be
monumented in the field by monuments of stone or concrete, not less than 30
inches in length and not less than four inches square or five inches in
diameter. The monument shall be marked on top with a cross, brass plug, iron
rod or other durable material securely embedded or by iron rods or pipes at
least 30 inches long and two inches in diameter. These monuments shall be
placed not more than 1,400 feet apart in any straight line and at all corners,
at each end of all curves, at the point where a curve changes its radius, at
all angle points in any line, and at all angle points along the meander line of
any river or stream, except when the corners or points fall within a street, or
proposed future street, the monuments shall be placed in the side line of the
street.
   (C)   Internal boundaries. All internal boundaries, and those corners and
points not referred to in division (B) above, shall be monumented in the field
by like monuments as described above. These monuments shall be placed at all
block corners, at each end of all curves and at all angle points in any line.
(Ord. 66, passed 10-12-1999)
§ 152.34  LOT IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Lot arrangement. The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be
no foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of topography or other conditions, in
securing building permits to build on all lots in compliance with the zoning
ordinance and health regulations, and in providing direct driveway access to
buildings on the lots from a public street.
   (B)   Lot dimensions. Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards
of the zoning ordinance. The Planning Commission or City Commission may require
lots which are at least double the minimum required area for the zoning
district be arranged so as to allow further subdivision and the opening of
future streets where they would be necessary to serve potential lots, all in
compliance with the zoning ordinance (Chapter 153) and these regulations. In
general, side lot lines shall be at right angles to street lines (or radial to
curving street lines) unless a variation from this rule will give a better
street or lot plan. Dimensions of corner lots shall be large enough to allow
for construction of buildings, observing the minimum front-yard setback from
both streets. Depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for business,
commercial or industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off-
street parking and loading facilities required for the type of uses and
development contemplated, as established in the zoning ordinance.
   (C)   Lot orientation. The lot line common to the street right-of-way shall
be the front line. All lots shall face the front line and a similar line across
the street. Whenever feasible, lots shall be arranged so that the rear line
does not abut the side line of an adjacent lot.
   (D)   Soil preservation and grading. Lots shall be laid out so as to provide
positive drainage away from all building and individual lot drainage shall be
coordinated with the general storm drainage pattern for the area. Drainage
shall be designed so as to avoid concentration of storm water drainage from
each lot to adjacent lots.
   (E)   Debris and waste. No cut trees, timber, debris, junk, rubbish or other
waste materials of any kind shall be buried in any land, left or deposited on
any lot or street at the time of the issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
Removal of those items and materials shall be required prior to issuance of any
certificate of occupancy on a subdivision. No items and materials as described
in the preceding sentence shall be left or deposited in any area of the
subdivision at the time of expiration of any subdivision improvement agreement
or dedication of public improvements, whichever is sooner.
(Ord. 66, passed 10-12-1999)
§ 152.35  ROADS.
   (A)   Roads. Proposed roads shall provide a safe, convenient and functional
system for vehicular, pedestrian and bicycle circulation, be properly related
to the comprehensive plan, and shall be appropriate for the particular traffic
characteristics of each proposed development.
   (B)   Frontage on improved roads. No subdivision shall be approved unless
the area to be subdivided shall have frontage on and access from an existing
street on the official map.
   (C)   Grading and improvement plan. Roads shall be graded and improved and
conform to the local government construction standards and specifications and
shall be approved as to design and specifications by the Local Government
Engineer in accordance with the construction plans required to be submitted
prior to final plat approval.
   (D)   Topography and arrangements. Roads shall be related appropriately to
the topography. All streets shall be arranged so as to obtain as many building
sites as possible at, or above, the grades of the streets. Grades of streets
shall conform as closely as possible to the original topography. A combination
of steep grades and curves shall be avoided.
   (E)   Street integration. All streets shall be properly integrated with the
existing and proposed system of thoroughfares and dedicated rights-of-way
established on the official map and/or master plan.
   (F)   Relationship to development. All thoroughfares shall be properly
related to special traffic generators, such as industries, business districts,
schools and churches, to population densities and to the pattern of existing
and proposed land uses.
   (G)   Minor or local streets. Minor or local streets shall be laid out to
conform as much as possible to the topography to discourage uses by through
traffic, to permit efficient drainage and utility systems and to require the
minimum number of streets necessary to provide convenient and safe access to
property.
   (H)   Layout. The rigid rectangular gridiron street pattern need not
necessarily be adhered to. The use of curvilinear streets or U-shaped streets
shall be encouraged where the use will result in a more desirable layout.
   (I)   Street extension. Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary
lines of the tract to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other
physical conditions, unless, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, the
extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of
the subdivision with the existing layout or the most advantageous future
development of adjacent tracts.
   (J)   Road names. The submitted plat shall not indicate any names for
proposed streets. The governing body shall name all streets. Names shall be
sufficiently different in sound and spelling from other road names in the city
so as not to cause confusion. A road which is, or is planned to be, a
continuation of an existing road shall bear the same name.
   (K)   Road regulatory signs. The applicant shall install the appropriate
road signs, as determined by the Local Government Engineer, or shall deposit
with the local government an amount of money equal to the local government’s
cost of signs and installations at the time of final subdivision approval.
   (L)   Road surfacing and improvements. After utilities have been installed
by the developer, the developer shall construct roads to the widths prescribed
in these regulations. All surfacing shall be of a character as is suitable for
the expected traffic and in harmony with similar improvements in the
surrounding areas. Types of bituminous shall be as determined by the Local
Government Engineer. Adequate provision shall be made for culverts, drains and
bridges. All road pavement shoulders, drainage improvements and structures,
curbs, turnarounds and sidewalks shall conform to all construction standards
and specifications adopted by the Planning Commission, Local Government
Engineer or governing body and shall be incorporated into the construction
plans required to be submitted by the developer for plat approval.
   (M)   Minimum right-of-way and road widths. See the table below.

(Ord. 66, passed 10-12-1999)
§ 152.36  BLOCKS.
   (A)   Width. Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of
lots of appropriate depth. Exceptions to this prescribed block width shall be
permitted in blocks adjacent to major streets or other features which make two
tiers impractical.
   (B)   Length. The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be such as are
appropriate for the locality and the type of development contemplated but block
lengths in residential areas shall not exceed 2,200 feet nor be less than 400
feet in length. Whenever practicable, blocks along major arterial and collector
streets shall be at least 1,000 feet in length.
   (C)   Long blocks. Planning Commission may require the reservation of an
easement through the block to accommodate utilities, drainage facilities or
pedestrian traffic in long blocks.

§ 152.37  STREET LIGHTS.
   Installation of street lights shall be required in accordance with the
design and specification standards approved by the Local Government Engineer.
(Ord. 66, passed 10-12-1999)
§ 152.38  INTERSECTIONS.
   (A)   Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at
right angles. A proposed intersection of two new streets at an angle of less
than 75 degrees is prohibited. An oblique street should be curved approaching
an intersection and should be approximately at right angles for at least 100
feet therefrom. Not more than two streets shall intersect at any one point
unless specifically approved by the Planning Commission.
   (B)   Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street shall,
wherever practicable, coincide with any existing intersections on the opposite
side of the street. Street jogs of less than 150 feet shall not be permitted.
Intersection of major streets shall be at least 800 feet apart.
   (C)   Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade wherever practical.
In hilly or rolling areas, at the approach to an intersection, a leveling area
shall be provided having not greater than a 2% rate at a distance of 60 feet,
measured from the nearest right-of-way line of the intersection street.
   (D)   Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or existing
vegetation inside any lot corner that would create a traffic hazard by limiting
visibility, the developer shall cut the ground and/or vegetation in connection
with the grading of the public right-of-way to the extent deemed necessary to
provide an adequate sight distance.
   (E)   The cross slopes on all streets, including intersections, shall be 3%
or less.
(Ord. 66, passed 10-12-1999)
§ 152.39  SIDEWALKS.
   Sidewalks shall be included within the dedicated non-pavement right-of-way
of all roads in the proposed subdivision. A median strip of grassed or
landscaped area at least two feet wide shall separate all sidewalks from the
edge of the roadway. The City Commission may, upon recommendation of the
Planning Commission, modify this requirement if it is in the best interest of
the public.
(Ord. 66, passed 10-12-1999)
§ 152.40  UTILITIES.
   (A)   Location. All utility facilities, including, but not limited to, gas,
electric power, telephone and CATV cables, shall be located underground
throughout the subdivision. Whenever existing utility facilities are located
above ground, except when existing on public roads and rights-of-way, they
shall be removed and placed underground. All utilities, existing and proposed
throughout the subdivision, shall be shown on the preliminary plat. Underground
service connections to the street property line of each platted lot shall be
installed at the subdivider’s expense. At the discretion of the Planning
Commission, the requirement for service connections to each lot may be waived
in the case of adjoining lots to be retained in single ownership and intended
to be developed for the same primary use.
   (B)   Easements.
      (1)   Easements centered on rear lot lines shall provide for utilities
(private and municipal) and the easements shall be at least ten feet wide.
Proper coordination shall be established between the subdivider and the
applicable utility companies for the establishments of utility easements
established in adjoining properties.
      (2)   When topographical or other conditions are such as to make
impractical the inclusion of utilities within the rear lot lines, perpetual
unobstructed easements at least ten feet in width shall be provided along side
lot lines with satisfactory access to the road or rear lot lines.
(Ord. 66, passed 10-12-1999)
§ 152.41  LAND RESERVATION AND PUBLIC USE.
   (A)   The Planning Commission shall require that land be reserved for parks
and playgrounds or other recreation purposes in locations designated in the
comprehensive plan or other places as deemed appropriate by the Planning
Commission. Each reservation shall be of suitable size, dimension, topography
and general character and shall have adequate road access for the particular
purposes envisioned by the Planning Commission. The area shall be shown and
marked on the plat “Reserved for Park and/or Recreation Purposes”. When the
recreation areas are required, 5% of the total gross area of the subdivision
shall be reserved. The Planning Commission may refer the proposed reservations
to the Park Board for recommendation. The developer shall dedicate all the
recreation areas to the local government as a condition of final subdivision
plat approval.
   (B)   However, when in the judgment of the Planning Commission, a
subdivision is of insufficient size to include an area for park and playground,
or the subdivision is not designated as an area for playground or park in the
comprehensive plan, the owner or applicant shall pay the city a cash sum in
lieu of land reservations. The payment shall be placed in a neighborhood park
and recreation improvement fund. The deposit shall be used by the local
government for improvement of a neighborhood park, playground or recreation
area, including the acquisition of property. The cash sum in lieu of land
reservations shall be 5% of the estimated fair market value of the total gross
area of the subdivision before improvement.
(Ord. 66, passed 10-12-1999)
§ 152.42  PRESERVATION OF NATURAL FEATURES AND AMENITIES.
   Existing features that would add value to residential development or to the
local government as a whole, such as trees, watercourses and falls, beaches,
historic spots and similar irreplaceable assets, shall be preserved in the
design of the subdivision. No trees shall be removed from any subdivision nor
any change of grade of the land effected until approval of the preliminary plat
has been granted. All trees on the plat required to be retained shall be
preserved and all trees where required shall be welled and protected against
change of grade. The preliminary plat shall show the number and locations of
existing trees and indicate all those marked for retention.
(Ord. 66, passed 10-12-1999)
§ 152.43  LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING.
   (A)   Landscaping.
      (1)   All exposed ground areas within the subdivision, including street
rights-of-way, which are not devoted to drives, sidewalks, patios or other
uses, shall be landscaped, with the exception of undisturbed areas containing
existing viable natural vegetation. All landscaped areas shall be kept neat,
clean and uncluttered.
      (2)   Landscaping shall include:
         (a)   Tree planting at the rate of at least one tree per 5,000 square
feet of the gross area of the subdivision. Existing trees retained during
development of the land can be counted towards fulfilling this requirement; and
         (b)   Combination of trees or shrub planting. Ten shrubs count as one
tree. A maximum of 25% of the landscaping requirement may be in the form of
shrubs.
   (B)   Erosion control. All disturbed areas must be sodded or seeded.
Appropriate ground cover is required in all disturbed areas to control erosion.
The developer shall submit an erosion control plan for review by the City
Engineer as part of the preliminary plat review process.
   (C)   Landscaping trees. Required landscaping trees must be mixed between
lots and boulevard. All trees required for landscaping shall be at least one
and one-half inch caliper at four feet above ground level; conifers shall be at
least three feet in height. Landscaping trees shall be indigenous to the area.
All deciduous trees shall be long-lived hardwood species. It is the
responsibility of the developer to ensure to the longevity and maintenance of
all plantings. If any plantings die within a year of construction, the owner
shall replace the plantings.
   (D)   Screening. All commercial or industrial uses which are situated within
75 feet of a residential district shall be screened by the developer of the
commercial or industrial property from the district by a wall or fence of not
less than 100% opacity and up to ten feet in height. The wall or fence shall be
set back from the property line at least five feet. In the setback area shall
be planted a combination of coniferous and deciduous plants, in order to soften
the appearance of the fence or wall for the affected residential area. Walls or
fences of less height or planting screens may be permitted by the City
Commission if there is a finding that the nature or extent of the use being
screened is such that a lesser degree of screening will adequately promote and
protect the use and enjoyment of the residential properties.
   (E)   Escrow deposits for lot improvements.
      (1)   Acceptance of escrow funds. Whenever, because of the season of the
year, any lot improvements required by the subdivision regulations cannot be
performed, the City Administrator may issue a certificate of occupancy,
provided there is no danger to health, safety or general welfare upon accepting
a cash escrow deposit in an amount to be determined by the Local Government
Engineer for the cost of the lot improvements. The subdivision improvement
agreement and security covering the lot improvements shall remain in full force
and effect.
      (2)   Procedures on escrow funds. All required improvements for which
escrow monies have been accepted by the City Administrator at the time of
issuance of a certificate of occupancy shall be installed by the subdivider
within nine months from the date of deposit and issuance of the certificate of
occupancy. If the improvements have not been properly installed at the end of
the time period, the City Administrator shall give two weeks written notice to
the developer requiring it to install the improvements and, if they are not
then installed properly, the City Administrator may request the governing body
to proceed to contract out the work for the installation of the necessary
improvements in a sum not to exceed the amount of the escrow deposit. At the
time of the issuance of the certificate of occupancy for which escrow monies
are being deposited with the City Administrator, the developer shall obtain and
file with the City Administrator, prior to obtaining the certificate of
occupancy, a notarized statement from the purchaser or purchasers of the
premises authorizing the City Administrator to install the improvements at the
end of the nine-month period if the improvements have not been duly installed
by the subdivider.

   (A)   General. When allowed, rezoning of a particular parcel of land may be
allowed from time to time based upon a showing that the subject property is
located adjacent to an alternative zoning district, or a showing that the
existing zoning status is no longer appropriate due to a change of
circumstances not attributable to the owner of the subject property. Rezoning
as specified herein may be allowed or denied by the City Commission after
recommendation by the Planning Commission in accordance with the criteria and
provisions listed herein.
   (B)   Application. Applications for rezoning, in an approved form, will be
filed by the applicant with the Zoning Officer and shall be accompanied by:
      (1)   An application fee in an amount equal to that set from time to time
by resolution of the City Commission, plus the applicant shall be required to
reimburse the city for any expenses incurred for legal and other professional
consultation; and
      (2)   Eight copies of professionally prepared plans drawn to a scale of
one inch equals 50 feet and other supporting data regarding the site and any
natural and constructed features thereon, such as:
         (a)   Size, location and topography of the site;
         (b)   The use of adjacent land;
         (c)   The proposed size, bulk, use and location of all buildings;
         (d)   The location and proposed function of all yards, open spaces,
loading areas, parking areas, driveways, storage areas and accessory
structures;
         (e)   Grading, drainage and landscape plans;
         (f)   Elevations and floor plans of proposed buildings, structures and
other improvements;
         (g)   Locations of proposed utilities and the plans for same; and
         (h)   Any other information required, in the opinion of the Zoning
Officer, to evaluate the application, to determine consistency with the
comprehensive plan, and to ensure compliance with requirements of this chapter
and other applicable code provisions.
   (C)   Review.
      (1)   The Zoning Officer shall within ten days forward the application to
the Planning Commission for review and comment and the application shall be
placed on the Planning Commission agenda for the next regularly scheduled
meeting. A public hearing shall be held on each application within 30 days
after the date scheduled for Planning Commission review. The applicant and all
property owners located within 500 feet of the subject property shall be
notified of the public hearing by U.S. Mail, not less than ten days prior to
the date of the hearing. The notice shall include the date, time and place of
the hearing and shall reasonably identify the subject property.
      (2)   The City Commission may attach such conditions as they deem
necessary to the approval of any re-zoning. The approved site plan and all
attached conditions shall be accepted by the petitioner within 30 days of final
approval. All developments, construction and use shall be in accordance with
the approved zoning. Any development contrary to the approved zoning shall
constitute a violation of this chapter.
(1988 Code, § 11.61)  (Ord. 30, passed 10-11-1994)
§ 153.008  ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Zoning Officer. The Zoning Officer, who shall be appointed by the City
Commission, shall:
      (1)   Administer and enforce the provisions of this chapter in accordance
with its literal terms and shall not have the power to permit construction or
any use or change of use which does not conform to this chapter;
      (2)   Receive and direct applications for certificates of occupancy,
special use permits, re-zoning and building permits to the Planning Commission
for study leading to a report of its findings and recommendations to the City
Commission. Upon approval by the City Commission, he or she shall issue
certificates of occupancy, special use permits, certification of re-zoning and
building permits; and
      (3)   Maintain a permanent file of all certificates and applications as
public records.
   (B)   Certificate of occupancy.
      (1)   A certificate of occupancy shall verify that all applicable
requirements of the Building Code and/or special use conditions for the subject
property have been inspected and met, and shall be obtained before any person
may:
         (a)   Occupy or use any vacant land;
         (b)   Occupy or use any structure hereafter constructed,
reconstructed, moved, altered or enlarged;
         (c)   Change the use of a structure or land to a different use; or
         (d)   Change a nonconforming use.
      (2)   Applications for a certificate of occupancy shall be accompanied by
a plot plan showing clearly the location, dimensions and nature of any
structure involved and other information as the Zoning Officer may require for
administration of this chapter together with a filing fee in accordance with a
schedule determined by resolution from time to time by the City Commission.
   (C)   Unlawful act. It is unlawful for any person to violate any provision
of this chapter. Each day a violation is permitted to exist shall constitute a
separate offense.
   (D)   Enforcement remedies. In case any building, structure or land is, or
is proposed to be, erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, converted,
maintained or used in violation of this chapter, the City Commission, in
addition to other remedies, may establish appropriate fines by resolution, and
institute in the name of the city any appropriate action or proceeding to
prevent, restrain, correct or abate the building, structure or land, or to
prevent, in or about the premises, any act, conduct, business or use
constituting a violation.
   (E)   Amendments. The City Commission may amend this chapter as proposed by
the City Commission, by the Planning Commission or by petition of a person
residing or owning property within the city in accordance with the following
provisions.
      (1)   Petition for amendment shall be filed with the Planning Commission,
and the petitioner, upon filing, shall pay an advertising deposit and a filing
fee in accordance with a schedule determined from time to time by the City
Commission, shall agree in writing to reimburse the city for all expenses for
attorney fees and consulting fees of others such as registered engineers, which
are associated with evaluating this petition.
         (a)   Amendments proposed by the City Commission or the Planning
Commission shall be exempt from all the fees.
         (b)   The Planning Commission shall review the proposed amendment and
report its findings and recommendations in writing to the City Commission and
to the petitioner.
         (c)   The petition shall also include:
            1.   Plans, specifications, data and written statements similar to
those required for filing for a PUD in cases where the proposed project or
development involves eight or more dwelling units or could accommodate eight or
more dwelling units; or, where there is a difference of intensity of land use
of two increments or more with that of an adjoining parcel; or, where the
project has any difference in its intensity of land use with that of two or
more adjacent parcels; or, where the property of the petitioner may be
environmentally sensitive as in cases involving wetlands, shorelands or
watersheds;
            2.   Those items specified elsewhere in this chapter, such as those
required in applying for conditional use permits and PUD approvals; or
            3.   For situations not falling into either of the above
categories, the requirements for submittal shall be established by the Zoning
Officer and the Planning Commission and shall be sufficient so as to provide
the information necessary to evaluate the petition in relation to the
requirements established by this chapter.
      (2)   An amendment not initiated by the Planning Commission shall be
referred to the Planning Commission for study and may not be acted upon by the
City Commission until it has received the recommendation of the Planning
Commission on the proposed amendment or until 60 days have elapsed from the
date of reference of the amendment without a report by the Planning Commission.
      (3)   Before voting on the enactment of an amendment the City Commission
shall hold a public hearing thereon pursuant to public notice. It shall be the
responsibility of the Zoning Officer to:
         (a)   Have notice of the public hearing published in the official
newspaper ten days prior to the hearing; and
         (b)   Give mailed notice of the public hearing to the property within
the affected zone and within 300 feet of the outer boundaries of the property
in question. Failure of any property owner to receive notification, when good
faith effort to notify all the owners has been made, shall not invalidate the
proceedings.
      (4)   If, after any public hearing held upon an amendment, the proposed
amendment is revised or further revised to include land previously not affected
by it the City Commission shall hold another public hearing, pursuant to public
notice, before proceeding to vote on the amendment.
      (5)   The City Commission shall act upon the request within 45 days after
the last public hearing has been held.
      (6)   The findings required for the approval of a proposed amendment
shall be the same as those required for a PUD.
      (7)   Once the proposed amendment has been duly approved, the City
Commission shall direct that the amendment to this chapter be outlined on the
official zoning map and labeled accordingly.
   (F)   Board of Adjustment. The Board of Adjustment shall be the City
Commission. It shall hold meetings, keep minutes and, pursuant to notice, shall
conduct hearings, take testimony under oath and render decisions in writing. A
fee shall be charged in accordance with a schedule as determined from time to
time for any appeal filed with the Board of Adjustment.
      (1)   The Board of Adjustment shall have the power to hear and decide
appeals from any other requirement, decision, grant or refusal made by the
Zoning Officer in the administration of this chapter. An appeal shall be in
writing and filed in duplicate with the Zoning Officer. Within ten days after
filing of the appeal, the Zoning Officer shall transmit to the Board of
Adjustment all papers involved in the proceedings. Upon receipt of the appeal
from the Zoning Officer, the Board of Adjustment shall set a hearing date and
give notice by mail of the time, place and purpose thereof to the appellant and
to the Zoning Officer. The Board of Adjustment may reverse or affirm wholly or
in part any ruling, decision or determination and may issue or direct the
issuance of a permit.
      (2)   The Board of Adjustment, upon appeal, shall have the power to
authorize variances from the requirements of this chapter, and to attach such
conditions to the variance as it deems necessary to assure compliance with the
purpose of this chapter. A variance may be permitted if all the following
requirements are met.
         (a)   Literal enforcement of this chapter would result in undue
hardship because of particular physical surroundings, shape or topographic
conditions of the specific parcel as distinguished from a mere inconvenience,
if the regulations were to be carried out.
         (b)   The unnecessary hardship results from circumstances unique to
the parcel of land for which the variance is sought and applicable, generally,
to other property with the same zoning classification.
         (c)   The hardship is caused by provisions of this chapter and is not
the result of actions of persons presently or formerly having an interest in
the parcel of land.
         (d)   The proposed variance observes the spirit and intent of this
chapter, produces substantial justice and will not be detrimental to the public
welfare or injurious to other land or improvements in the vicinity of the
specific parcel of land.
         (e)   The proposed variance will not impair an adequate supply of
light and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase congestion of the
public streets, or increase the danger of or from fire, or otherwise endanger
the public health, safety or welfare, and is consistent with the City Land Use
Program.
   (G)   Fees. All fees provided for under this chapter, including, but not
limited to, re-zoning, variances, special and conditional use permits, planned
unit developments and amendments, platting and waiver of platting, easement and
alley vacations, shall be fixed and determined by the City Commission, adopted
by resolution, and uniformly enforced. The fees may, from time to time, be
amended by the City Commission by resolution. A copy of the resolution setting
forth currently effective fees shall be kept on file in the office of the City
Administrator and open to inspection during regular business hours.
   (H)   Reimbursement of administrative expense. Every applicant must
reimburse the city for all expenses reasonably incurred by the city in
processing each application submitted under this chapter. For the purposes of
this provision, “application” includes, but is not limited to, applications for
rezoning, variances, special and conditional use permits, planned unit
developments and amendments, platting and waiver of platting, easement and
alley vacations. Costs to be reimbursed include, but are not limited to, those
associated with publication, mailing of notice, duplication of documents, and
other documented administrative expenses as well as legal, engineering and
other professional fees incurred by the city in the course of processing the
application. The reimbursement shall be paid by the applicant within 60 days
following a written demand for reimbursement, and the applicant’s obligation to
reimburse shall apply whether the application in question was approved, denied
or withdrawn. If any applicant fails or refuses to reimburse the city for the
expenses, the city may, upon 15 days notice in writing mailed to the owner of
the premises subject to the application at the address appearing on the tax
rolls of the county, and as an additional and not alternative remedy provided
herein, pay for costs and services and certify all costs to the County Auditor
to be spread upon the tax rolls as a special assessment on the subject
premises.

ZONING DISTRICTS
§ 153.020  DISTRICTS OF THE CITY.
   The zoning districts are so designed as to carry out the intent and purpose
of the comprehensive plan. For the purposes of this chapter, the city is, or
may be, divided into the following districts:
   (A)   R-1 Suburban Residential;
   (B)   R-2 Urban Residential;
   (C)   R-3 Multiple Residential;
   (D)   B-1 Community Business;
   (E)   I-2 Light Industrial;
   (F)   C-1 Conservation;
   (G)   A-1 Agricultural; and
   (H)   MH Mobile Home Rental Park.
(1988 Code, § 11.10-1)
§ 153.021  DISTRICT REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Except for planned unit developments (PUD), all buildings and uses in
each district shall be subject to the requirements for use, lot, yard and
height, the general regulations and conditional use provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   Planned unit development standards may be applied to any residential,
commercial or industrial district at the discretion of the City Commission,
after being requested by the land owner. Where PUD standards differ from those
of the underlying zoning district the PUD standards will apply.
(1988 Code, § 11.10-2)
§ 153.022  USES NOT PROVIDED.
   (A)   A use not specifically designated as a permitted or conditional use
anywhere in the city is considered prohibited.
   (B)   In those cases, the City Commission, the Planning Commission or a
property owner may request a study by the city to determine if the use is
acceptable and if so what zoning district would be most appropriate for the use
and what conditions and standards, if any, should be attached to the
development of the use. If found acceptable, an amendment to this chapter may
be initiated by the City Commission or Planning Commission.
(1988 Code, § 11.10-3)
§ 153.023  ZONING MAP.
   A map officially entitled “Glenwood Zoning Map” is hereby adopted as part of
this chapter. The zoning map attached to the ordinance from which this section
is derived delineates districts of the city. The zoning map delineating the
zoning districts of the city hereby replaces the previous map required under
1988 Code, § 11.10-4.
(1988 Code, § 11.10-4)  (Ord. 52, passed - -1996)
§ 153.024  DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   (A)   District boundaries shown within the lines of roads, streams and
transportation rights-of-way shall be deemed to follow the centerline.
   (B)   The vacation of roads shall not affect the location of the district
boundaries.
   (C)   When the Zoning Officer cannot definitely determine the location of a
district boundary by the centerline, by the scale or dimensions stated on the
zoning map, or by the fact that it clearly coincides with a property line, he
or she shall refuse action, and the Board of Adjustment, upon appeal, shall
interpret the location of the district boundary with reference to the scale of
zoning map and the purposes set forth in all relevant provisions of the
ordinance.
   (D)   Where a district boundary line divides a lot of record into two or
more districts, any portion of the lot within 50 feet of the division may be
used for any use of either district as approved by the Board of Adjustment.

LOT AND YARD REQUIREMENTS
§ 153.050  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   The minimum lot area, minimum width of lot, minimum depth of front yard,
rear yard and minimum width of each side yard for each district shall be as
shown in §
153.051.
   (A)   Lots or parcels which abut on more than one street shall provide the
required front yards along each street.
   (B)   All structures and accessory buildings whether attached to the
principal structure or not, and whether open or enclosed, including porches,
carports, balconies, roof overhangs or platforms above normal grade level,
shall not project into any minimum front, side or rear yard; nor into any
required open space or buffer. Where multi-dwelling buildings (apartments,
townhouses and the like) are to be built on one lot (or parcel) along with
other buildings or structures, the required yards shall be construed to apply
to each building as opposed to each dwelling unit.
   (C)   Any lot of record existing on the effective date of this chapter may
be used for the erection of a structure conforming to the use regulations of
the district in which it is located, even though its area and width are less
than the minimum requirements of this chapter.
   (D)   A buffer including appropriate screening, is hereby required on each
lot boundary of a parcel where due to: rezoning of the parcel, newly zoning the
parcel, creation of a PUD on the parcel or, the granting of a conditional use
or variance for the parcel; a difference in intensity of land use between the
adjacent parcels will occur. On the lot or parcel where the change in intensity
of land use occurs, new structures or uses shall not be located or conducted
closer to any lot boundary of any other lot having a different intensity of
land use value than the distance calculated by applying the following formula:
      (1)   Subtract the assigned intensity of land use values of the
respective parcels using those prescribed in this chapter and, for the first
increment the buffer shall be ten feet and an additional 15 feet of buffer will
be added for each incremental change in value assigned for intensity of land
use beyond the first change.
         (a)   The buffers shall be measured on a line perpendicular to each
boundary and shall run parallel to those boundaries.
         (b)   Example: subtract the intensity land use of R-1 (value=2) from
that of R-3 (value=4) and the difference (4-2=2) would be 2, and the buffer
would be ten feet for the first increment plus 15 feet for the second
increment, or a total of 25 feet (10 feet+15 feet=25 feet). This buffer, where
applicable, shall be in addition to any required side or rear yards specified
under this chapter and applies to a PUD.
      (2)   In any case nonresidential structures or uses shall not be located
closer to any lot line of any other lot in any R Zoning District than the
distance specified in the following schedule:
 
Use                                   Minimum Side or Rear Yard Abutting Any
                                      Lot in Any R District
Churches, schools and public or semi- 40 feet
public structures
Off-street parking spaces and access  20 feet
drives for nonresidential use
Recreation facilities, entertainment
facilities, all business uses and all 60 feet
industrial uses
 
   (E)   Where adjacent structures have front yard set back different from
those required, the minimum front yard setback shall be the average of these
existing structures.

of new fences, as well as for the replacement of fences in the same location.
      (2)   Survey required. Applications for the required fence permit shall,
at the request of the City Administrator, be accompanied by a certificate of
survey verifying and locating property lines and describing the location of the

the property upon which the fence is constructed, and shall be located entirely
upon the property of the fence owner.
   (E)   Non-conforming fences.
      (1)   It is the intent of this section to allow the continuation of non-
conforming fences until they are discontinued as provided herein. However, it

fences and such fences that are declared to be incompatible with permitted
fences within the city. Such fences shall be regulated by the following
provision:

§ 153.076  PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD).
   (A)   The City Commission may designate specific parcels of land as planned
unit developments and authorize uses within the districts which are not
consistent with the provisions of this chapter and the zoning map; provided,
however, that approval of any such development is subject to strict compliance
with the procedures and requirements set forth in this section.
   (B)   Any approval may also contain specific requirements governing the
proposed development and the requirements shall be binding on all construction
within the district.
   (C)   Any requirements so imposed shall prevail over conflicting
requirements set forth elsewhere in this chapter.
      (1)   General requirements. The following requirements apply generally to
all PUDs. An applicant should consider these requirements prior to preparation
and submission of a preliminary plan:
         (a)   Ownership. The tract of land shall be under unified ownership
and control at the time of application and scheduled to be developed as one
unit.
         (b)   Minimum size. No planned unit development may include less
buildable area than three acres of contiguous land.
         (c)   Minimum building spacing and yards.
            1.   Spacing. Spacing between buildings and dedicated streets shall
be at least equivalent to the spacing (front yard) requirements of buildings
similarly developed under the terms of this chapter on separate parcels.
            2.   Lot line yards and buffers. Notwithstanding other provisions
of this section, every building in a PUD abutting the perimeter boundary of the
PUD shall conform to yard requirements for the underlying zoning district plus
buffer requirements; all of which are contained in the lot and yard
requirements of this chapter.
            3.   Internal yards. As to those yards required between buildings
for areas which are wholly within the development and not related to dedicated
streets nor areas abutting perimeter boundaries, the front, side and rear yard
requirements shall be equal to the average height of the two buildings; and any
yard abutting a street or access way which is the property of, and internal to,
the development shall equal the height of that building. In either case these
requirements shall not exceed those for yard requirements of the underlying
district if developed under this chapter on separate parcels.
         (d)   Harmony. The design of the planned unit development shall take
into account the relationship of the site to the area surrounding it, and it
shall be compatible with it. The perimeter of the PUD shall be so designed as
to minimize the undesirable impact of the PUD on adjacent properties and,
conversely, to minimize undesirable impact of adjacent land use on the PUD.
         (e)   Building heights. The requirements of the underlying existing
zoning district shall prevail; however, exceptions may be granted where
distances are maintained from buildings and uses on adjacent tracts, and where
the heights of the proposed structures will not create a height differential of
more than 20 feet, or cause incompatibility with the appearance of structures
in the surrounding area.
         (f)   Permitted uses. Permitted uses may include:
            1.   Any combination of dwelling units in single-family, two-
family, town or row houses and apartments;
            2.   Any nonresidential uses, to the extent such nonresidential use
is designed and intended to serve the residents of the planned unit
development;
            3.   Public and private education facilities; and/or
            4.   Other uses permitted in the underlying zoning district in
which the planned unit development is located.
         (g)   Open spaces. A minimum of 30% of the buildable area of the
residential section of each PUD parcel shall be reserved for common open space
which shall be either held in common ownership by all owners in the PUD or
dedicated for public use with approval of the City Commission. Whenever
possible, common open space shall be linked to the open space areas of
adjoining developments, and buffers created as required in this chapter shall
be credited towards fulfilling open space requirements. Common open space shall
be of such size, shape, character and locations as to be usable for its
intended purpose or shall not be included in the open space calculation.
         (h)   Minimum lot size and density. The minimum lot size requirements

total parcel to be developed. An applicant may make a request to the Planning
Commission for an increase in density from that computed above provided that:
traffic and public safety will not be adversely affected, and that public
utilities, services and facilities are adequate. The request shall allow an
increase to a maximum of 20% under such a request. A request may be reviewed
taking into consideration the unique characteristics of the PUD; provided,
however, that such a request may be granted only if the applicant demonstrates

City Commission of his acceptance or refusal of the conditions to the plan,
constitute refusal of the conditions.
      (5)   Final development plan procedure. Within six months following the
approval of the preliminary development plan, the applicant shall file with the
Zoning Officer a final development plan containing in final form the
information required in the preliminary plan. The City Commission at its
discretion may extend for six months the period for filing of the final
development plan.
         (a)   The Zoning Officer shall send a reproducible print and one other

plan or part thereof shall not be required provided that the plan is in
substantial compliance with the plan given preliminary approval.
         (c)   In the event the plan as submitted for final approval is not in
substantial compliance with the preliminary plan, the City Commission shall
notify the applicant within 45 days of the date of application setting forth
the ways in which the plan is not in substantial compliance.
            1.   The applicant may treat the notification as denial of final
approval; or
            2.   The applicant may file a written request with the City
Commission that it hold a public hearing on his or her request for final
approval. Any such hearing shall be held within 30 days after the request for
such a hearing. Within 45 days of the hearing the City Commission shall either
grant final approval or deny final approval to the plan.
         (d)   In the event a plan is given final approval and the applicant
shall abandon the plan or in the event the applicant shall fail to begin
construction of the planned unit development within 12 months after final
approval has been granted, final approval shall terminate unless a time period
is extended by the City Commission.
      (6)   Final development plan specifications. The final development plan
filed with the Zoning Officer shall contain in final form all the information
required in the preliminary plan.
      (7)   Findings required. The findings necessary for approval of the
preliminary and final development plans shall be based on the following and
describe in what respect the plan would or would not be in the public interest.
         (a)   The plan is not in conflict with the city land use plan.
         (b)   The plan is designed to form a desirable and unified development
within its own boundaries.
         (c)   The proposed uses will not be detrimental to present and future
land uses in the surrounding area.
         (d)   Any exceptions to the standard requirements of the zoning and
subdivision ordinance are justified by the design of the development.
         (e)   The planned development will be compatible with the surrounding
property and land uses and will not have an undue and adverse impact on the
reasonable enjoyment of neighboring property.
         (f)   The plan will not create an excessive burden on parks, schools,
streets, fire protection and other public facilities and utilities which serve
or are proposed to serve the planned development. These burdens could be in the
form of economic hardship or as hazards to the health and safety of the
neighborhood or the population in general.
         (g)   The plan does not create a public health, fire or safety hazard
to the adjoining property owners.
      (8)   Zoning. Once the proposed plan has been approved, the Planning
Commission shall propose an amendment to this chapter for action by the City
Commission as outlined in the administrative portion of this chapter. The
planned unit development shall be outlined on the city zoning map and labeled
PUD.
      (9)   Annual review. The Planning Commission shall review all Planned
Unit Development Districts within the city at least once each year and shall
make a report to the City Commission on the status of the development in each
of the Planned Unit Development Districts. If the City Commission finds that
development has not occurred within 12 months from the original approval, the
City Commission may instruct the Planning Commission to initiate rezoning to
the original zoning district and remove the Planned Unit Development District
from the zoning map.
