to determine whether the provisions of this code enacted to protect the health,
safety and welfare of the people are being complied with and to enforce these

and to enforce these provisions. Unreasonable refusal to permit the inspection
of or entrance to the property shall be grounds for termination of any and all
permits, licenses or city service to the property. Mailed notice shall be given
to the licensee, owner, resident or other person in control of the property,
stating the grounds for the termination, and the licensee, owner, resident or
other person in control of the property shall be given an opportunity to appear
before the City Administrator to object to the termination before it occurs,

regularly scheduled or special meeting.

the city to enter private property in urgent emergency situations where there
is an imminent danger in order to protect the public health, safety and
welfare.
§ 10.98 SUPPLEMENTAL CITY PENALTIES.
   (A)   Purpose. Administrative offense procedures established pursuant to
this section are intended to provide the public and the city with an informal,
cost effective and expeditious alternative to traditional criminal charges for
violations of certain city ordinance provisions. The procedures are intended to
be voluntary on the part of those who have been charged with administrative
offenses. At any time prior to the payment of the city penalty as is provided
for thereafter, the individual may withdraw from participation in the
procedures, in which event the city may bring criminal charges in accordance
with law. Likewise, the city, at its discretion, may choose not to initiate an
administrative offense and may bring criminal charges in accordance with law.
Likewise, the city, at its discretion, may choose not to initiate an
administrative offense and may bring criminal charges in the first instance.
   (B)   “Administrative offense” defined. An “administrative offense” is a
violation of a provision of a city ordinance and is subject to the city
penalties set forth in the schedule of offenses and penalties referred to in
division (G) below.
   (C)   Notice. Any officer of the city's Police Department or any other
person employed by the city, authorized in writing by the City Council, and
having authority to enforce this section, shall, upon determining that there
has been a violation, notify the violator or, in the case of a vehicular
violation, attach to the vehicle a notice of the violation. Said notice shall
set forth the nature, date and time of the violation, the name of the official
issuing the notice and the amount of the scheduled penalty.
   (D)   Payment. Once such notice is given, the alleged violator shall, within
14 days of the time of issuance of the notice, pay the amount set forth on the
schedule of penalties for the violation. The penalty may be paid in person or
by mail, the payment shall be deemed to be an admission of the violation.
   (E)   Failure to pay. In the event a party charged with an administrative
offense fails to pay the penalty, a misdemeanor or petty misdemeanor charge may
be brought against the alleged violator in accordance with applicable statutes.
If the penalty is paid, no further charge shall be brought by the city for the
same violation.
   (F)   Disposition of penalties. All penalties collected pursuant to this
section shall be paid to the city and deposited into the city's General Fund.
   (G)   Offenses and penalties. Violations which may be charged as
administrative offenses and the penalties for such offenses may be established
by resolution of the City Council from time to time. Copies of such resolution
shall be maintained in the office of the City Administrator.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 32.01 HARDSHIP ASSESSMENT DEFERRALS.
   (A)   The City Council may, at its discretion, defer the payment of special
assessments for any homestead property:
      (1)   Owned by a person 65 years of age or older for whom it would be a
hardship to make the payments;
      (2)   Owned by a person who is retired by virtue of a permanent and total
disability for whom it would be a hardship to make the payments; or
      (3)   Owned by a person who is a member of the state’s National Guard or
other military reserves who is ordered into active military service, as defined
in M.S. § 190.05, subd. 5b or 5c, as they may be amended from time to time, as
stated in the person’s military orders, for whom it would be a hardship to make
the payments.
   (B)   (1)   For purposes of this section, the determination of hardship
shall be made by the City Council upon consideration of the following:
         (a)   The total assets and liabilities of the person claiming the
hardship;
         (b)   The total income of the person whether taxable or non-taxable;
         (c)   The value of any assets transferred by the applicant within
three years of the application for deferral of the assessment; and
         (d)   The total expenses of the person.
      (2)   Determination of hardship can also be made on the basis of
exceptional and unusual circumstances not covered by the standards and
guidelines where the determination is made in a non-discriminatory manner and
does not give the applicant an unreasonable preference or advantage over other
applicants.
   (C)   For purposes of this section, a person is deemed to be retired by
virtue of a permanent and total disability if the person is determined to be
permanently and totally disabled by the Social Security Administration.
   (D)   For purposes of this section, the burden of proving the existence of a
hardship shall be the responsibility of the applicant for the deferral of any
payment of a special assessment.
   (E)   The procedure to obtain a deferred assessment is as follows.
      (1)   A homeowner shall make application for deferred payment of special
assessments on forms prescribed by the City Administrator and the County
Auditor. The application may be made at any time while payments of assessments
are due on the property.
      (2)   The application shall be considered by the City Council at its
first regular meeting following receipt of it and a decision shall be made on
the application at the meeting unless additional information is required by the
City Council. In such event, the City Council shall make its decision at its
first regular meeting following receipt of all information it requires to make
its decision. Written notification of the decision of the City Council shall be
provided to the applicant.
      (3)   The City Council shall consider all evidence of hardship presented
to it and make its decision on any application on the basis of written findings
of fact. The City Council shall not grant any request for a deferral of any
payment of a special assessment unless it determines that the payment of the
special assessment would leave the applicant with insufficient funds to pay
applicant’s reasonable living expenses.
      (4)   If the deferred assessment is granted, the City Administrator shall
record a notice thereof with the County Recorder which shall set forth the
amount of the assessment.
      (5)   The City Council may determine, by ordinance or resolution, the
amount of interest, if any, on the deferred assessment and this rate shall be
recorded by the City Administrator along with and in the same manner as the
amount of the assessment.
   (F)   The option to defer the payment of special assessments shall terminate
and all amounts accumulated, plus applicable interest, shall become due upon
the occurrence of any of the following events:
      (1)   The death of the owner, provided that the spouse (if any) is
otherwise not eligible for the benefits hereunder;
      (2)   The sale, transfer or subdivision of the property or any part
thereof;
      (3)   If the property should for any reason lose its homestead status; or

would be no hardship to require immediate or partial payment.

65A.50, as it may be amended from time to time, Trust or Escrow Accounts;

§ 51.03 DISCONNECTION FOR NON-PAYMENT.
   (A)   Reconnection. The city shall endeavor to collect delinquent accounts
promptly. In any case, if satisfactory arrangements for payment have not been
made, the Public Utility Commission may, after the procedural requirements of
division (B) below have been complied with, discontinue service to the
delinquent customer shutting off electrical service. When electrical service to
any premises has been discontinued, service shall not be restored, except upon
payment of all current and delinquent amounts due, together with a fee for
reconnection in the amount set out in the Fee Schedule in §
33.01 of this code of ordinances.
   (B)   Procedure. Electricity shall not be shut off under division (A) above
until notice or an opportunity for hearing have first been given the occupant
of the premises involved. The notice shall be personally served and shall state
that if payment is not made before a date stated in the notice, but not less
than ten days after the date on which the notice is given, the electrical
supply to the premises will be shut off. The notice shall also state that the
occupant may, before the date demand a hearing on the matter, in which case the
electrical supply will not be cut off until after the hearing is held. If the
customer requests a hearing before the date specified, a hearing shall be held
on the matter by the Superintendent of the Public Utilities Commission, at
least one week after the date on which the request is made. If, as a result of

      (2)   Operation of all valves and hydrants will be done only by employees
of the Public Utilities or other authorized agent. Under no circumstances shall
the contractor or his employees open or close valves in the distribution system
or operate fire hydrants connected to mains except when authorized. This
provision applies both to the valves and hydrants on existing mains, and to
newly installed valves and hydrants and mains at the time of and after they are
opened to receive water from city mains.
   (C)   Hydrostatic (pressure) testing. After chlorine has been introduced
into the main, a pressure and leakage test shall be conducted by the contractor
under the supervision of the APU. The main shall remain isolated from adjacent
mains and a gauge pressure of at least 150 psi shall be applied by pumping
clean water containing 25 mg/l of chlorine. The duration of each pressure test
shall be a minimum of two hours.
   (D)   Disinfection. Hypochlorite solution (calcium hypochlorite - HTH,
sodium hypochlorite - bleach) shall be used of such strength to produce a
concentration of 25 mg/l of chlorine in the main. The chlorinating agent shall
be applied at the beginning within three feet of the valved section of the
pipeline extension through a corporation cock inserted in the top of the new
main. Water shall be supplied by Public Utilities personnel from the existing
city water main so as to flow slowly at a constant rate into the newly
installed water main. The chlorine shall be applied continuously at a constant
rate to develop a column of chlorinated water that will expose all interior
surfaces to a concentration of approximately 25 mg/l. Valves and hydrants shall
be operated so as to disinfect appurtenances and pipe branches. Chlorine
application shall not cease until the entire main is filled with chlorinated
water. If at any time the application of chlorine is interrupted, the flow of
water shall be stopped until chlorine application is resumed. After the main
has been chlorinated, the solution shall remain in the main for at least 24
hours to assure disinfection. After the minimum 24 hours, the solution shall be

guarantee that the minimum sizes of lines and meters will be sufficient. The
sizing and installation of a water service to a residential or commercial
building must be sized per the current Minnesota Plumbing Code. A separate
service line and curb stop is required for each metered service. In a situation
where a lot split has occurred and only one service exists for both dwellings,
the service line and curb stop may be separated for each property split, but
must be metered separately. If an alternate water main is available along the
previous property split, the owner will be required to tap into this main, If
an alternate water main is not available, access may be granted to the property
split by the owner fronting the water main to allow a new service across the
property in a reasonable manner. The part of the water service extending from
the curb stop to the first meter valve within the building or structure shall
be installed and maintained at the expense of the consumer and shall be
installed to meet the requirements of these regulations.

§ 91.01 FINDINGS, PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   To provide for the health, safety and welfare of its citizens and to
ensure the integrity of its streets and the appropriate use of the rights-of-
way, the city strives to keep its rights-of-way in a state of good repair and
free from unnecessary encumbrances.
   (B)   Accordingly, the city hereby enacts this chapter relating to right-of-
way permits and administration. This chapter imposes reasonable regulation on
the placement and maintenance of facilities and equipment currently within its
rights-of-way or to be placed therein at some future time. It is intended to
complement the regulatory roles of state and federal agencies. Under this
chapter, persons excavating and obstructing the rights-of-way will bear
financial responsibility for their work. Finally, this chapter provides for
recovery of out-of-pocket and projected costs from persons using the public
rights-of-way.
   (C)   This chapter shall be interpreted consistently with 1997 Session Laws,
Ch. 123, substantially codified in M.S. §§ 237.16, 237.162, 237.163, 237.79,
237.81 and 238.086 (the “Act”), as they may be amended from time to time, and
the other laws governing applicable rights of the city and users of the right-
of-way. This chapter shall also be interpreted consistent with Minn. Rules
parts 7819.0050 through 7819.9950, where possible. To the extent any provision
of this chapter cannot be interpreted consistently with the Minnesota Rules,
that interpretation most consistent with the Act and other applicable statutory
and case law is intended. This chapter shall not be interpreted to limit the
regulatory and police powers of the city to adopt and enforce general
ordinances necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public.

patching and restoration of the right-of-way as required herein, must be
completed within the dates specified in the permit.
   (B)   Patch and restoration. The permittee shall patch his, her or its own

§ 91.10 SUPPLEMENTARY APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   Limitation on area. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the area
of the right-of-way specified in the permit. No permittee may do any work

      (1)   Make application for a permit extension and pay any additional fees
required thereby; and
      (2)   Be granted a new permit or permit extension.
   (B)   Limitation on dates. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the dates

for a new permit for the additional time it needs, and receive the new permit
or an extension of the old permit before working after the end date of the
previous permit. This supplementary application must be submitted before the
permit end date.
(Ord. 321, passed 11-6-2006)
§ 91.11 OTHER OBLIGATIONS.
   (A)   Compliance with other laws. Obtaining a right-of-way permit does not
relieve the permittee of its duty to obtain all other necessary permits,
licenses and authority and to pay all fees required by the city or other
applicable rule, law or regulation. A permittee shall comply with all
requirements of local, state and federal laws, including, but not limited to,
M.S. §§ 216D.01 through 216D.09 (Gopher One Call Excavation Notice System), as
they may be amended from time to time, and Minn. Rules Ch. 7560. A permittee
shall perform all work in conformance with all applicable codes and established
rules and regulations, and is responsible for all work done in the right-of-way
pursuant to its permit, regardless of who does the work.
   (B)   Prohibited work. Except in an emergency, and only with the approval of
the Director, no right-of-way obstruction or excavation may be done when
seasonally prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable for the work or
between the period of October 1 to May 1 each year.
   (C)   Interference with right-of-way.
      (1)   A permittee shall not so obstruct a right-of-way that the natural
free and clear passage of water through the gutters or other waterways shall be
interfered with. Private vehicles of those doing work in the right-of-way may
not be parked within or next to a permit area, unless parked in conformance
with city parking regulations.
      (2)   The loading or unloading of trucks must be done solely within the
defined permit area unless specifically authorized by the permit.
   (D)   Trenchless excavation. As a condition of all applicable permits,
permittees employing trenchless excavation methods, including, but not limited
to, horizontal directional drilling, shall follow all requirements set forth in
M.S. Ch. 216D, as it may be amended from time to time, and Minn. Rules Ch.
7560, and shall require potholing or open cutting over existing underground
utilities before excavating, as determined by the Director.
(Ord. 321, passed 11-6-2006)
§ 91.12 PERMIT DENIAL.
   The city may deny a permit for failure to meet the requirements and
conditions of this chapter or if the city determines that the denial is
necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare or when necessary to
protect the right-of-way and its current use.
(Ord. 321, passed 11-6-2006)
§ 91.13 INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS.
   The excavation, backfilling, patching and restoration, and all other work
performed in the right-of-way shall be done in conformance with Minn. Rules
parts 7819.1100 and 7819.5000 and other applicable local requirements, in so
far as they are not inconsistent with the M.S. §§ 237.162 and 237.163, as they
may be amended from time to time. Installation of service laterals shall be
performed in accordance with Minn. Rules Ch. 7560 and these ordinances. Service
lateral installation is further subject to those requirements and conditions
set forth by the city in the applicable permits and/or agreements referenced in
§
91.18 of this chapter. Any ferncos and any connection to main sewers must be
completely encased with concrete.
(Ord. 321, passed 11-6-2006)

completed, the permittee shall furnish a completion certificate in accordance
with Minn. Rules part 7819.1300.
   (B)   Site inspection. The permittee shall make the work-site available to
the city and to all others as authorized by law for inspection at all
reasonable times during the execution of and upon completion of the work.
   (C)   Authority of Director.
      (1)   At the time of inspection, the Director may order the immediate
cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the life, health, safety
or well-being of the public.
      (2)   The Director may issue an order to the permittee for any work which
does not conform to the terms of the permit or other applicable standards,
conditions or codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the
violation will be cause for revocation of the permit. Within ten days after
issuance of the order, the permittee shall present proof to the Director that
the violation has been corrected. If the proof has not been presented within
the required time, the Director may revoke the permit pursuant to § 
91.17 of this chapter.
(Ord. 321, passed 11-6-2006)
§ 91.15 WORK DONE WITHOUT PERMIT.
   (A)   Emergency situations.
      (1)   Each registrant shall immediately notify the Director of any event
regarding its facilities which it considers to be an emergency. The registrant
may proceed to take whatever actions are necessary to respond to the emergency.
Excavators’ notification to Gopher State One Call regarding an emergency
situation does not fulfill this requirement. Within two business days after the
occurrence of the emergency, the registrant shall apply for the necessary
permits, pay the fees associated therewith, and fulfill the rest of the
requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with this chapter for
the actions it took in response to the emergency.
      (2)   If the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding a registrant’s
facilities, the city will attempt to contact the local representative of each
registrant affected, or potentially affected, by the emergency. In any event,
the city may take whatever action it deems necessary to respond to the
emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the registrant whose facilities
occasioned the emergency.
   (B)   Non-emergency situations. Except in an emergency, any person who,
without first having obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or excavates a
right-of-way must subsequently obtain a permit, and as a penalty pay double the
normal fee for the permit, pay double all the other fees required by the city,
deposit with the city the fees necessary to correct any damage to the right-of-
way and comply with all of the requirements of this chapter.
(Ord. 321, passed 11-6-2006)
§ 91.16 SUPPLEMENTARY NOTIFICATION.
   If the obstruction or excavation of the right-of-way begins later or ends
sooner than the date given on the permit, the permittee shall notify the city
of the accurate information as soon as this information is known.
(Ord. 321, passed 11-6-2006)
§ 91.17 REVOCATION OF PERMIT.
   (A)   Substantial breach. The city reserves its right, as provided herein,
to revoke any right-of-way permit, without a fee refund, if there is a
substantial breach of the terms and conditions of any statute, ordinance, rule
or regulation, or any material condition of the permit. A substantial breach by
permittee shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following:
      (1)   The violation of any material provision of the right-of-way permit;
      (2)   An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the right-
of-way permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit
upon the city or its citizens;
      (3)   Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a
right-of-way permit;
      (4)   The failure to complete the work in the permitted time; or
      (5)   The failure to correct, in a timely manner, work that does not
conform to a condition indicated on an order issued pursuant to §
91.14 of this chapter.
   (B)   Written notice of breach. If the city determines that the permittee
has committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any statute,
ordinance, rule, regulation or any condition of the permit, the city shall make
a written demand upon the permittee to remedy the violation. The demand shall
state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. A
substantial breach, as stated above, will allow the city, at its discretion, to
place additional or revised conditions on the permit to mitigate and remedy the
breach.
   (C)   Response to notice of breach. Within 24 hours of receiving
notification of the breach, the permittee shall provide the city with a plan,
acceptable to the city, that will cure the breach. The permittee’s failure to
so contact the city, or permittee’s failure to timely submit an acceptable
plan, or the permittee’s failure to reasonably implement the approved plan,
shall be cause for immediate revocation of the permit. Further, the permittee’s
failure to so contact the city, or the permittee’s failure to submit an
acceptable plan, or the permittee’s failure to reasonably implement the
approved plan, shall automatically place the permittee on probation for one
full year.
   (D)   Cause for probation. From time to time, the city may establish a list
of conditions of the permit, which if breached will automatically place the
permittee on probation for one full year, such as, but not limited to, working
out of the allotted time period or working on right-of-way grossly outside of
the permit authorization.
   (E)   Automatic revocation. If a permittee, while on probation, commits a
breach as outlined above, the permittee’s permit will automatically be revoked
and the permittee will not be allowed further permits for one full year, except
for emergency repairs.
   (F)   Reimbursement of city costs. If a permit is revoked, the permittee
shall also reimburse the city for the city’s reasonable costs, including
restoration costs and the costs of collection and reasonable attorneys’ fees
incurred in connection with the revocation.
(Ord. 321, passed 11-6-2006)
§ 91.18 MAPPING DATA.
   (A)   Information required. Each registrant and permittee shall provide
mapping information required by the city in accordance with Minn. Rules parts
7819.4000 and 7819.4100. Within 90 days following completion of any work
pursuant to a permit, the permittee shall provide the Director accurate maps
and drawings certifying the “as-built” location of all equipment installed,
owned and maintained by the permittee. The maps and drawings shall include the
horizontal and vertical location of all facilities and equipment and shall be
provided consistent with the city’s electronic mapping system, when practical
or as a condition imposed by the Director. Failure to provide maps and drawings
pursuant to this division (A) shall be grounds for revoking the permit holder’s
registration.
   (B)   Service laterals.
      (1)   (a)   All permits issued for the installation or repair of service
laterals, other than minor repairs as defined in Minn. Rules part 7560.0150,
subpart 2, shall require the permittee’s use of appropriate means of
establishing the horizontal locations of installed service laterals, and the
service lateral vertical locations in those cases where the Director reasonably
requires it. Permittees or their subcontractors shall submit to the Director
evidence satisfactory to the Director of the installed service lateral
locations. Compliance with this division (B) and with applicable Gopher State
One Call Law and Minnesota Rules governing service laterals installed after 12-
31-2005, shall be a condition of any city approval necessary for:
            1.   Payments to contractors working on a public improvement
project including those under M.S. Ch. 429, as it may be amended from time to
time; and
            2.   City approval of performance under development agreements or
other subdivision or site plan approval under M.S. Ch. 462, as it may be
amended from time to time.
         (b)   The Director shall reasonably determine the appropriate method
of providing the information to the city. Failure to provide prompt and
accurate information on the service laterals installed may result in the
revocation of the permit issued for the work or for future permits to the
offending permittee or its subcontractors.
      (2)   Mapping and installation of locating wire on any service for sewer,
storm sewer, water or electric shall also be done by the city department
responsible for the utility. Service must be kept uncovered until the city has
completed this and approved backfilling to proceed. Any service covered without
approval shall be uncovered at the permittee’s expense. Appropriate city
department must be notified a minimum of 48 hours before any excavation begins,
not counting weekends or holidays. For any inspections or mapping needed during
non-business hours, the permittee shall pay the city applicable overtime rates.
(Ord. 321, passed 11-6-2006)
§ 91.19 LOCATION, RELOCATION OF FACILITIES.
   (A)   (1)   General. Placement, location and relocation of facilities must
comply with the Act, with other applicable law, and with Minn. Rules parts
7819.3100, 7819.5000 and 7819.5100, to the extent the rules do not limit
authority otherwise available to cities.
      (2)   Corridors.
         (a)   The city may assign specific area within the right-of-way, or
any particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of facilities
that is or, pursuant to current technology, the city expects will someday be
located within the right-of-way. All excavation, obstruction or other permits
issued by the city involving the installation or replacement of facilities
shall designate the proper corridor for the facilities at issue.
         (b)   Any registrant who has facilities in the right-of-way in a
position at variance with the corridors established by the city shall, no later
than at the time of the next reconstruction or excavation of the area where the
facilities are located, move the facilities to the assigned position within the
right-of-way, unless this requirement is waived by the city for good cause
shown, upon consideration of such factors as the remaining economic life of the
facilities, public safety, customer service needs and hardship to the
registrant.
      (3)   Nuisance. One year after the passage of this chapter, any
facilities found in a right-of-way that have not been registered shall be
deemed to be a nuisance. The city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at
law or in equity, including, but not limited to, abating the nuisance or taking
possession of the facilities and restoring the right-of-way to a useable
condition.
      (4)   Limitation of space. To protect health, safety and welfare or when
necessary to protect the right-of-way and its current use, the city shall have
the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional facilities
within the right-of-way. In making the decisions, the city shall strive to the
extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the right-
of-way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the public interest,
the public’s needs for the particular utility service, the condition of the
right-of-way, the time of year with respect to essential utilities, the
protection of existing facilities in the right-of-way and future city plans for
public improvements and development projects which have been determined to be
in the public interest.
   (B)   All registrants, permittees, property owners, contractors or others
performing work in the city’s right-of-way areas will comply with the
requirements of M.S. §§ 216D.01 through 216D.09, as they may be amended from
time to time (One Call Excavation Notice System). Any registrant whose
facilities are less than 20 inches below a concrete or asphalt surface shall
notify and work closely with the excavation contractor to establish the exact
location of its facilities and the best procedure for excavation.
(Ord. 321, passed 11-6-2006)
§ 91.20 DAMAGE TO OTHER FACILITIES.
   (A)   When the city does work in the right-of-way and finds it necessary to
maintain, support or move a registrant’s facilities to protect it, the city
shall notify the local representative as early as is reasonably possible. The
costs associated therewith will be billed to that registrant and must be paid
within 30 days from the date of billing.
   (B)   (1)   Each registrant shall be responsible for the cost of repairing
any facilities in the right-of-way which it or its facilities damage.
      (2)   Each registrant shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any
damage to the facilities of another registrant caused during the city’s
response to an emergency occasioned by that registrant’s facilities.

facilities in the right-of-way under this chapter have been lawfully assumed by
another registrant.
   (B)   Removal. Any registrant who has abandoned facilities in any right-of-
way shall remove it from that right-of-way if required in conjunction with
other right-of-way repair, excavation or construction, unless this requirement
is waived by the city.
(Ord. 321, passed 11-6-2006)
§ 91.24 APPEAL.
   (A)   A right-of-way user, as follows, may have the denial, revocation, fee

shall notify the City Council of the noncompliance. The City Council may order
the person receiving the notice to comply with the notice or may provide a
modified order.
      (1)   The order shall be in writing; recite the grounds therefore;
specify the necessary corrections, if any, and provide a reasonable time for
compliance; and shall state that a motion for summary enforcement of the order
will be made to the district court of Aitkin County unless corrective action is
taken, or unless an answer is filed within 21 days.
      (2)   The order shall be served upon the owner of record, or the owner’s
agent if an agent is in charge of the building or property, and upon the
occupying tenant, if there is one, and upon all lienholders of record, in the
manner provided for service of a summons in a civil action. If the owner cannot
be found, the order shall be served upon the owner by posting it at the main
entrance to the building or, if there is no building, in a conspicuous place on
the property, and by three week’s publication in the official newspaper of the
city.
      (3)   A copy of the order with proof of service shall be filed with the
court administrator of Aitkin County District Court no less than five days
prior to the filing of a motion pursuant to § 94.07(B) to enforce the order. At
the time of filing such order the city shall file for record with the county
recorder or registrar of titles a notice of the pendency of the proceeding,
describing with reasonable certainty the ands affected and the nature of the
order. If the proceeding be abandoned the city shall within ten days thereafter
file with the county recorder a notice to that effect.
   (B)   If no answer is served, the city may move the court for the
enforcement of the order. If such a motion is made the court may, upon the
presentation of sufficient proof of service of the order, affirm or modify the
order and enter judgment accordingly, fixing a time after which the governing
body may proceed with the enforcement of the order. The court administrator
shall cause a copy of the judgement to be mailed forthwith to person upon whom
the original order was served.
   (C)   If an answer is filed and served as provided above, further
proceedings in the action shall be governed by the Rules of Civil Procedure for
the District Courts. If the order is sustained following the trial, the court
shall enter judgement and shall fix a time after which the nuisance shall be
abated in compliance with the order as originally filed or modified by the
court. If the order is not sustained, it shall be annulled and set aside. The
court administrator of the court shall cause a copy of the judgement to be
mailed forthwith to the persons upon whom the original order was served.
   (D)   If a judgement is not complied within the time specified, the city may
cause the nuisance to be abated at the expense of the city and recover such
costs as a judgment against the person or persons served. In the alternative,
the City Council may direct the City Administrator to extend the sum as an
assessment against the property upon which the nuisance existed and shall
certify the same to the County Auditor for collection in the same manner as
taxes and special assessments are certified and collected. To cover
administrative costs necessarily incurred in the abatement and assessment
procedure, an administrative fee in the amount of not more than 25% of the cost
to abate the nuisance shall be imposed, except that in no event shall the
administrative fee be less than as set out in the fee schedule in §
33.01 of the code of ordinances.
   (E)   In order to determine the amount of the judgment or assessment as the
case may be, the city shall keep an accurate account of the expenses incurred
in carrying out the order and of all other expenses theretofore incurred in
connection with its enforcement, including specifically, but not exclusively,
filing fees, service fees, administrative fees, publication fees, attorney’s
fees, appraisers’ fees, witness fees, including expert witness fees, and
traveling expenses incurred by the city from the time the order was originally
made, and shall report its action under the order, with a statement of expenses
incurred to the court for approval and allowance. Thereupon the court shall
examine, correct, if necessary, and allow the expense account and enter
judgement or certify the same to the city administrator for assessment, as the
case may be.

   This chapter is adopted by the City of Aitkin City Council for the purpose
of protecting public health and safety by regulating/prohibiting the use of
cannabis and cannabis derived products in public places and places of public
accommodation within Aitkin County. Minnesota Session Law 2023, Chapter 63,
effective in relevant part August 1, 2023, establishes that the adult use,
possession and personal growing of cannabis is legal subject to the
requirements and restrictions of Minnesota Statutes. M.S. § 342.0263, subd. 5
authorizes the adoption of a local ordinance establishing a petty misdemeanor
offense for public use of cannabis. The city intends to be proactive in
protecting public health and safety by enacting an ordinance that will mitigate
threats presented to the public and public health by the public use of
cannabis. The City of Aitkin (hereinafter "the city") recognizes the risks that
unintended access and use of cannabis products and exposure to cannabis and its
effects present to the health, welfare, and safety of members of the public and
in particular the youth within the City of Aitkin.

Code Official, Building Official, City Administrator, Police Department
personnel, or any authorized representative may abate the nuisance unless a
request for a hearing has been timely filed.

§ 113.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   Because the city recognizes that many persons under the age of 18 years
purchase or otherwise obtain, possess and use tobacco, tobacco products,
tobacco-related devices, electronic cigarettes, electronic delivery device and
nicotine or lobelia delivery devices, and the sales, possession, and use are
violations of both state and federal laws; and because studies, which the city
hereby accepts and adopts, have shown that most smokers begin smoking before
they have reached the age of 18 years and that those persons who reach the age
of 18 years without having started smoking are significantly less likely to
begin smoking; and because smoking has been shown to be the cause of several
serious health problems which subsequently place a financial burden on all
levels of government; this chapter intends to regulate the sale, possession and
use of tobacco, tobacco products, tobacco-related devices, electronic
cigarettes, electronic delivery device and nicotine or lobelia delivery devices
for the purpose of enforcing and furthering existing laws, to protect minors
against the serious effects associated with the illegal use of tobacco, tobacco
products, tobacco-related devices, electronic cigarettes, electronic delivery
device and nicotine or lobelia delivery devices, and to further the official
public policy of the state in regard to preventing young people from starting
to smoke as stated in M.S. § 144.391, as amended from time to time.

§ 130.02 SOCIAL HOSTING.
   (A)   Purpose and findings. This section prohibits, and establishes
penalties for, any person hosting an event or gathering where alcohol is
present and being possessed or consumed by persons under 21 years of age. The
City Council intends to discourage underage possession and consumption of
alcohol, even if done within the confines of a private residence, and intends
to hold persons criminally responsible who host events or gatherings where
persons under 21 years of age possess or consume alcohol regardless of whether
the person hosting the event or gathering supplied the alcohol. The City
Council finds that:
      (1)   Events and gatherings held on private or public property where
alcohol is possessed or consumed by persons under the age of 21 may be harmful
to those persons and constitute a potential threat to public health;
      (2)   Prohibiting underage consumption protects underage persons, as well
as the general public, from injuries related to alcohol consumption, such as
alcohol overdose or alcohol-related traffic crashes;
      (3)   Alcohol is an addictive drug which, if used irresponsibly, could
have adverse effects on those who use it as well as those who are affected by
the actions of an irresponsible user;
      (4)   Often, events or gatherings involving underage possession and
consumption occur outside the presence of parents. However, there are times
when the parent(s) is/are present and condone the activity and, in some
circumstances, provide the alcohol;
      (5)   Even though giving or furnishing alcohol to an underage person is a
crime, this section is necessary to help further combat underage consumption;
and/or
      (6)   A deterrent effect will be created by holding a person criminally
responsible for hosting an event or gathering where underage possession or
consumption occurs.
   (B)   Authority. This section is enacted pursuant to M.S. § 145A.05, subd.
1, as it may be amended from time to time.
   (C)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different

business premises involved.
      (1)   This section applies to and permits only outdoor dining activity
and the sale and display of merchandise and goods, and does not permit the
sale, display or provision of services on the public sidewalk. This section
does not apply to or allow the sale and display of merchandise and goods on
public sidewalks by transient vendors, mobile food units other persons who do
not operate a restaurant or retail business in a building on the private
property adjoining the public sidewalk where the sales and display take place.
      (2)   The use of public sidewalks for outdoor dining or sidewalk sales is
only allowed April 1 to November 1 each year.
      (3)   The location of outdoor dining or sidewalk sale areas shall
consider the placement of existing public infrastructure and be located
adjacent to the building, allowing pedestrian traffic to flow closest to the
curb.
      (4)   At minimum a 48-inch clear zone for pedestrian traffic shall be
maintained at all times, not including the curb.
      (5)   Tables, chairs, display racks or any other furnishings, shall be
allowed overnight in the area used for the outdoor dining or sidewalk sales
when the restaurant or business is closed. However, umbrellas or temporary
canopies shall be removed upon closing each night. All furniture placed on the
sidewalk shall be suitable for and manufactured for outdoor use and shall be
maintained in good condition.
      (6)   The use of a portion of the public sidewalk for outdoor dining or
sidewalk sales shall not be an exclusive use nor shall it be construed as
authorizing any permanent installation to be placed in the public right-of-way.
All public improvements, including but not limited to, trees, light poles,
traffic signals, pull boxes or manholes, or any public-initiated sidewalk use
and/or maintenance procedures, shall take precedence over said use of the
public sidewalk at all times.
      (7)   No alcoholic beverages shall be allowed in the outdoor dining area
except with the appropriate on-sale liquor license issued by the city. The
license holder shall, in addition to all other requirements of law, take
reasonable steps to ensure that alcoholic beverages are consumed only by
patrons of the establishment who are of age, and not by passersby or persons
who are not of age or who are obviously intoxicated, and ensure that alcoholic
beverages served to patrons remain on the licensed premises.
      (8)   No outdoor dining areas or sidewalk sales shall become operational
until the business owner has filed with the city evidence of general liability
insurance covering the restaurant or retail business and the city, its
officers, and employees, against liability imposed by law arising out of the
ownership, maintenance, or operation of such outdoor dining activity in the
minimum amount of $1,000,000 per occurrence. The city shall be named as
additional insured in the policy, providing that such insurance policy may not
be canceled except upon 30 days written notice to the city. A certificate of
insurance shall be provided to the city showing proof that the insurance
requirements have been met. The “Description of Operations” portion of the
certificate must identify and acknowledge the sidewalk area where outdoor
dining or sidewalk sales are being conducted.

§ 152.038 LIGHT INDUSTRIAL/COMMERCIAL TRANSITION (LI-CT) DISTRICT.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. To provide a zoning classification for a mix of
light industrial and commercial uses. The areas included in this district have
traditionally seen light industrial uses but as traffic patterns and business
practices are changing, the demand for industrial uses and appropriate
intensity of the uses in relation to neighboring uses has changed. The intent
of this district is to promote adaptive re-use of older industrial buildings
and prevent blight by allowing a mix of commercial and light industrial uses
that are compatible.
   (B)   Compatibility. The Light Industrial/Commercial Transition (LI-CT)
District is most compatible with and should be established next to the Downtown
Mixed Use (DMU) District.
   (C)   Lot and density. Lot and density requirements shall be the same as
those listed in §
152.037(C) of this chapter.
   (D)   Performance standards. Performance standards shall be the same as
those listed in §
152.037(D) of this chapter.
(Ord. 332, passed 5-19-2008)
§ 152.039 INDUSTRIAL (I) DISTRICT.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. To provide a zoning classification for industrial
and heavy commercial uses. Development in this district requires high
automobile accessibility, city sewer and water systems, and municipal storm
water treatment facilities. Industrial districts should be clustered to control
negative impacts of industrial activities and to efficiently facilitate maximum
interaction between industrial and heavy commercial enterprises.
   (B)   Compatibility. The Industrial District is most compatible with and
should be established adjacent to the Highway Commercial (C) District, but in
some circumstances may be compatible with the Downtown Mixed Use (DMU), Urban
Residential (UR) and Urban/Rural Transition Residential (TR) Districts. The
district may not be established in an area where it is completely surrounded by
residential districts.
   (C)   Lot and density requirements.
Buildable lot area - square feet, minimum                  20,000
Building above highest ground water level - feet, minimum  3
Building height - feet, maximum                            45 ft
Impervious surface - percent, maximum                      50%
Lot width - feet, minimum                                  100
Setback, between accessory buildings - feet, minimum       10
Setback, parking from lot line - feet, minimum             10
Setback, rear - feet, minimum                              30
Setback, right-of-way, minimum                             30
Setback, side next to residential district - feet, minimum 30
Setback, side yard - feet, minimum                         30
Setback, sign - feet, minimum                              1
 
   (D)   Performance standards. The following performance standards apply to
all development in this district.
      (1)   Impervious coverage. Impervious coverage may be increased to up to
90% through a conditional use permit on properties where municipal storm water
is available if the following is provided:
         (a)   A vegetation plan for the perimeter of the property that
increases vegetation within the setbacks; and
         (b)   Direct runoff of storm water to adjacent properties and wetlands
shall be eliminated through the use of berms, infiltration ponds, swales,
filtration strips or other permanent means.
      (2)   Compatibility of use. Use shall be compatible with the surrounding
neighborhood. Uses shall not present noise, odor, light nuisances or any other
nuisances.
      (3)   Parking. Adequate off-street parking shall be provided as specified
in §
152.096 of this chapter. On-street parking is not allowed under any
circumstances. In addition, suitable trees and shrubs shall be planted between
parking lots and all adjacent sidewalks, roads, lots and buildings.
      (4)   Lighting. Lighting shall be minimal but sufficient to promote
safety. Lighting shall be downward directional and shall be compatible with the
surrounding development.
      (5)   Fire lanes. Fire lanes shall remain unobstructed at all times.
      (6)   Screening. All sites shall be heavily landscaped to provide 80%
screening to adjacent residential parcels. Percentages shall be determined by
amount of structure that can be seen during leaf-on conditions. A landscaping
and screening plan must be submitted and approved by the Planning Commission
with each conditional use permit.

§ 152.040 LAND USE MATRIX.
   (A)   The land use matrix shown in the following table establishes the
allowable, permitted, accessory, conditional and excluded uses within the city.
   (B)   All uses are considered prohibited unless specifically allowed in this
chapter, even if they are not listed specifically under excluded uses.

OVERLAY DISTRICTS
§ 152.055 GENERAL.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. To establish and maintain districts that overlay
existing zoning district in order to better manage significant areas with
specific needs that cross zoning district boundaries, such as encouraging
growth in areas with existing public facilities or preserving areas with valued
resources and amenities. All sites within an overlay district shall continue to
bear their original zoning, but shall also comply with the provisions of the
overlay district appended.
   (B)   Boundaries. The boundaries are established based on district-specific
criteria and may not be aligned with roads, lot lines or other human-made
boundaries. The boundaries shall be designated on official overlay maps.
Overlay maps are considered part of the Official Zoning Map and are, therefore,
approved and amended following the procedures in §§
152.010 through
152.014 of this chapter.
   (C)   Permits. No subdivision, rezoning, reconstruction, alteration or
addition shall be made to any existing structure, nor shall any additional
structure be constructed upon a site in any overlay district, except in
accordance with the provisions of the applicable overlay district.
   (D)   Districts. The following overlay districts are hereby established:
      (1)   Floodplain Overlay Districts:
         (a)   Floodway District (FW);
         (b)   Flood Fringe District (FF); and
         (c)   General Floodplain District (GF).
      (2)   Mississippi Headwaters Overlay District (MH);
      (3)   Shoreland Overlay District (SH); and
      (4)   Airport Zoning Overlay District (AP).
   (E)   Supremacy. If a provision of an overlay district conflicts with a
provision or provisions of the underlying zoning district, the more restrictive
provision shall apply.
(Ord. 332, passed 5-19-2008)
§ 152.056 FLOODPLAIN OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   (A)   Statutory authorization.
      (1)   Responsibility. The legislature of the state has, in M.S. Ch. 103F
and 462, as they may be amended from time to time, delegated the responsibility
to local government units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood
losses. Therefore, the City Council does ordain as follows.
      (2)   Findings of fact and purpose.
         (a)   This section regulates development in the flood hazard areas of
the city. These flood hazard areas are subject to periodic inundation, which
may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption
of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for
flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base. It is the purpose
of this section to promote the public health, safety and general welfare by
minimizing these losses and disruptions.
         (b)   This section is adopted to comply with the rules and regulations
of the National Flood Insurance Program codified as 44 C.F.R. parts 59 through
78, as amended, so as to maintain the community’s eligibility in the National
Flood Insurance Program.
         (c)   This section is also intended to preserve the natural
characteristics and functions of watercourses and floodplains in order to
moderate flood and storm water impacts, improve water quality, reduce soil
erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitat, provide recreational
opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits and enhance community and economic
development.
   (B)   General provisions.
      (1)   Maps. This section adopts the floodplain maps applicable to the
city and includes three floodplain districts: Floodway, Flood Fringe and
General Floodplain.
         (a)   Where Floodway and Flood Fringe Districts are delineated on the
floodplain maps, the standards in divisions (D) or (E) below will apply,
depending on the location of a property.
         (b)   Locations where Floodway and Flood Fringe Districts are not
delineated on the floodplain maps are considered to fall within the General
Floodplain District. Within the General Floodplain District, the Floodway
District standards in division (D) below apply unless the floodway boundary is
determined, according to the process outlined in division (F) below. Once the
floodway boundary is determined, the Flood Fringe District standards in
division (E) below may apply outside the floodway.
      (2)   Lands to which section applies. This section applies to all lands
within the jurisdiction of the city shown on the Official Zoning Map and/or the
attachments to the map as being located within the boundaries of the Floodway,
Flood Fringe or General Floodplain Districts. The Floodway, Flood Fringe and
General Floodplain Districts are overlay districts that are superimposed on all
existing zoning districts. The standards imposed in the overlay districts are
in addition to any other requirements in this chapter. In case of a conflict,
the more restrictive standards will apply.
      (3)   Incorporation of maps by reference. The following maps together
with all attached material are hereby adopted declared to be a part of the
Official Zoning Map and this chapter. These materials and studies have all been
incorporated into the Floodplain and Shoreland Overlay Zone exhibit prepared by
Bolton & Menk, Inc. and dated November 2015 and shall serve as the exhibit for
the Zoning Administrator to administer the Floodplain and Shoreland Ordinance.
This exhibit is based on FEMA floodplain regulations referenced above and
available online (https://msc.fema.gov/portal).
         (a)   Flood insurance studies:
            1.   City of Aitkin, Minnesota (dated 9-15-1981); and
            2.   Aitkin County, Minnesota and Incorporated Areas (dated 2-2-
1996).
         (b)   The currently effective Flood Insurance Rate Map panels
enumerated below:
            1.   City of Aitkin Panel 2700010001B, effective 3-15-1982;
            2.   Aitkin County Panel 2706280240C, effective 2-2-1996;
            3.   Aitkin County Panel 2706280245B, effective 3-15-1982; and
            4.   Aitkin County Panel 2706280325C, effective 2-2-1996.
         (c)   The currently effective Flood Boundary and Floodway Map panels
enumerated below:
            1.   City of Aitkin Panel 2700010001, effective 3-15-1982; and
            2.   Aitkin County Panel 2706280245, effective 3-15-1982.
      (4)   Regulatory flood protection elevation. The regulatory flood
protection elevation (RFPE) is an elevation no lower than one foot above the
elevation of the regional flood, plus any increases in flood elevation caused
by encroachments on the floodplain that result from designation of a floodway.
      (5)   Interpretation.
         (a)   The boundaries of the zoning districts are determined by scaling
distances on the Flood Insurance Rate Map.
         (b)   Where a conflict exists between the floodplain limits
illustrated on the Official Zoning Map and actual field conditions, the flood
elevations shall be the governing factor. The Zoning Administrator must
interpret the boundary location based on the ground elevations that existed on
the site on the date of the first National Flood Insurance Program map showing
the area within the regulatory floodplain, and other available technical data.
Persons contesting the location of the district boundaries will be given a
reasonable opportunity to present their case to the Planning Commission/Board
of Adjustment and to submit technical evidence.
      (6)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. It is not intended by this
section to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or
other private agreements. However, where this section imposes greater
restrictions, the provisions of this section prevail. All other ordinances
inconsistent with this section are hereby repealed to the extent of the
inconsistency only.
      (7)   Warning and disclaimer of liability. This section does not imply
that areas outside the floodplain districts or land uses permitted within the
districts will be free from flooding or flood damages. This section does not
create liability on the part of the city or its officers or employees for any
flood damages that result from reliance on this section or any administrative
decision lawfully made hereunder.
      (8)   Severability. If any section, clause, provision or portion of this
section is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of law, the
remainder of this section shall not be affected and shall remain in full force.
      (9)   Annexations. The Flood Insurance Rate Map panels adopted by
reference into division (B)(3) above may include floodplain areas that lie
outside of the corporate boundaries of the city at the time of adoption of this
section. If any of these floodplain land areas are annexed into the city after
the date of adoption of this section, the newly annexed floodplain lands will
be subject to the provisions of this section immediately upon the date of
annexation.
      (10)   Detachments. The Flood Insurance Rate Map panels adopted by
reference into division (B)(3) above will include floodplain areas that lie
inside the corporate boundaries of municipalities at the time of adoption of
this section. If any of these floodplain land areas are detached from a
municipality and come under the jurisdiction of the city after the date of
adoption of this section, the newly detached floodplain lands will be subject
to the provisions of this section immediately upon the date of detachment.
   (C)   Establishment of Floodplain Overlay Districts.
      (1)   Districts.
         (a)   Floodway District. The Floodway District includes those areas
designated as floodway on the Flood Insurance Rate Map adopted in division (B)
(3) above.
         (b)   Flood Fringe District. The Flood Fringe District includes those
areas designated as floodway fringe on the Flood Insurance Rate Map adopted in
division (B)(3) above and as illustrated on the Floodplain Exhibit.
         (c)   General Floodplain District. The General Floodplain District
includes those areas designated as Zone A or Zone AE without a floodway on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map adopted in division (B)(3) above, and as illustrated
on the Floodplain Exhibit, but not subject to the criteria in divisions (C)(1)
(a) and (C)(1)(b) above.
      (2)   Compliance. Within the floodplain districts established in this
section, the use of any land, the use, size, type and location of structures on
lots, the installation and maintenance of transportation, utility, water supply
and waste treatment facilities, and the subdivision of land must comply with
the terms of this section and other applicable regulations. All uses not listed
as permitted uses or conditional uses in divisions (D), (E) and (F) below,
respectively, are prohibited. In addition, a caution is provided here that:
         (a)   New and replacement manufactured homes and certain recreational
vehicles are subject to the general provisions of this section and,
specifically, division (G) below;
         (b)   Modifications, additions, structural alterations, normal
maintenance and repair, or repair after damage to existing non-conforming
structures and non-conforming uses of structures or land are regulated by the
general provisions of this section and, specifically, division (G) below;
         (c)   All structures must be constructed with electrical, heating,
ventilation, plumbing and air-conditioning equipment and other service
facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from
entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding;
         (d)   As-built elevations for elevated or flood-proofed structures
must be certified by ground surveys and flood-proofing techniques must be
designed and certified by a registered professional engineer or architect as
specified in the general provisions of this section and specifically as stated
in division (G) below; and
         (e)   Critical facilities, as defined in §
152.003(B) of this chapter, are prohibited in all floodplain districts.
   (D)   Floodway District (FW).
      (1)   Permitted uses. The following uses, subject to the standards set
forth in division (D)(2) below, are permitted uses if otherwise allowed in the
underlying zoning district or any applicable overlay district:
         (a)   General farming, pasture, grazing, outdoor plant nurseries,
horticulture, truck farming, forestry, sod farming and wild crop harvesting;
         (b)   Industrial-commercial loading areas, parking areas and airport
landing strips;
         (c)   Open space uses, including, but not limited to, private and
public golf courses, tennis courts, driving ranges, archery ranges, picnic
grounds, boat launching ramps, swimming areas, parks, wildlife and nature
preserves, game farms, fish hatcheries, shooting preserves, hunting and fishing
areas and single or multiple purpose recreational trails;
         (d)   Residential lawns, gardens, parking areas and play areas; and
         (e)   Railroads, streets, bridges, utility transmission lines and
pipelines; provided that, the Department of Natural Resources’ area hydrologist
is notified at least ten days prior to issuance of any permit, and that the
standards in division (D)(4) below are met.
      (2)   Standards for floodway permitted uses.
         (a)   The use must have a low flood damage potential.
         (b)   With the exception of the uses listed in division (D)(1)(e)
above, the use must not obstruct flood flows or increase flood elevations and
must not involve structures, fill, obstructions, excavations or storage of
materials or equipment.
         (c)   Any facility that will be used by employees or the general
public must be designed with a flood warning system that provides adequate time
for evacuation if the area is inundated to a depth and velocity such that the
depth (in feet) multiplied by the velocity (in feet per second) would exceed a
product of four upon occurrence of the regional (1% chance) flood.
      (3)   Conditional uses. The following uses may be allowed as conditional
uses following the standards and procedures set forth in division (G)(4) below
and further subject to the standards set forth in division (D)(4) below if
otherwise allowed in the underlying zoning district or any applicable overlay
district:
         (a)   Structures accessory to the uses listed in division (D)(4)(a)
below and the uses listed in divisions (D)(3)(b) through (D)(3)(g) below;
         (b)   Extraction and storage of sand, gravel and other materials;
         (c)   Marinas, boat rentals, docks, piers, wharves and water control
structures;
         (d)   Storage yards for equipment, machinery or materials;
         (e)   Placement of fill or construction of fences that obstruct flood
flows. Farm fences, as defined in §
152.003(B) of this chapter, are permitted uses;
         (f)   Travel-ready recreational vehicles meeting the exception
standards in division (G)(2) below; and
         (g)   Levees or dikes intended to protect agricultural crops for a
frequency flood event equal to or less than the ten-year frequency flood event.
      (4)   Standards for floodway conditional uses.
         (a)   All uses. A conditional use must not cause any increase in the
stage of the 1% chance or regional flood or cause an increase in flood damages
in the reach or reaches affected.
         (b)   All floodway conditional uses shall be subject to the procedures
and standards contained in §§
152.265 through
152.278 of this chapter.
         (c)   The conditional use shall be permissible in the underlying
zoning district if one exists.
         (d)   1.   The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of
flooding, flammable, explosive or potentially injurious to human, animal or
plant life is prohibited.
            2.   Fill, dredge spoil and other similar materials deposited or
stored in the floodplain must be protected from erosion by vegetative cover,
mulching, riprap or other acceptable method. Permanent sand and gravel
operations and similar uses must be covered by a long-term site development
plan.
            3.   Temporary placement of fill, other materials or equipment
which would cause an increase to the stage of the 1% chance or regional flood
may only be allowed if the governing body has approved a plan that assures
removal of the materials from the floodway based upon the flood warning time
available.
         (e)   1.   Accessory structures must not be designed for human
habitation.
            2.   Accessory structures, if permitted, must be constructed and
placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the flow
of flood waters:
               a.   Whenever possible, structures must be constructed with the
longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow; and
               b.   So far as practicable, structures must be placed
approximately on the same flood flow lines as those of adjoining structures.
            3.   Accessory structures must be elevated on fill or structurally
dry flood-proofed in accordance with the FP-1 or FP-2 flood-proofing
classifications in the state’s Building Code. All flood-proofed accessory
structures must meet the following additional standards:
               a.   The structure must be adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse or lateral movement and designed to equalize hydrostatic
flood forces on exterior walls; and
               b.   Any mechanical and utility equipment in the structure must
be elevated to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or properly
flood-proofed.
            4.   As an alternative, an accessory structure may be internally/
wet flood-proofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 flood-proofing classifications in the
state’s Building Code; provided, the accessory structure constitutes a minimal
investment and does not exceed 576 square feet in size. A detached garage may
only be used for parking of vehicles and limited storage. All structures must
meet the following standards.
               a.   To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure,
there must be a minimum of two “automatic” openings in the outside walls of the
structure, with a total net area of not less than one square inch for every
square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; and, so far as practicable,
structures must be placed approximately on the same flood flow lines as those
of adjoining structures.
               b.   There must be openings on at least two sides of the
structure and the bottom of all openings must be no higher than one foot above
the lowest adjacent grade to the structure. Using human intervention to open a
garage door prior to flooding will not satisfy this requirement for automatic
openings.
            5.   Structural works for flood control that will change the
course, current or cross section of protected wetlands or public waters are
subject to the provisions of M.S. § 103G.245, as it may be amended from time to
time.
            6.   A levee, dike or floodwall constructed in the floodway must
not cause an increase to the 1% chance or regional flood. The technical
analysis must assume equal conveyance or storage loss on both sides of a
stream.
            7.   Floodway developments must not adversely affect the hydraulic
capacity of the channel and adjoining floodplain of any tributary watercourse
or drainage system.
   (E)   Flood Fringe District (FF).
      (1)   Permitted uses. Permitted uses are those uses of land or structures
allowed in the underlying zoning district(s) that comply with the standards in
division (E)(2) below. If no pre-existing, underlying zoning districts exist,
then any residential or non-residential structure or use of a structure or land
is a permitted use; provided, it does not constitute a public nuisance.
      (2)   Standards for flood fringe permitted uses.
         (a)   All structures, including accessory structures, must be elevated
on fill so that the lowest floor, as defined, is at or above the regulatory
flood protection elevation. The finished fill elevation for structures must be
no lower than one foot below the regulatory flood protection elevation and the
fill must extend at the same elevation at least 15 feet beyond the outside
limits of the structure.
            1.   All service utilities, including ductwork, must be elevated or
water-tight to prevent infiltration of flood waters.
            2.   As an alternative to elevation on fill, an accessory structure
that constitutes a minimal investment and that does not exceed 576 square feet
in size may be internally flood-proofed in accordance with division (D)(4)(e)
above.
         (b)   The cumulative placement of fill or similar material on a parcel
must not exceed 1,000 cubic yards, unless the fill is specifically intended to
elevate a structure in accordance with division (E)(2)(a) above, or if allowed
as a conditional use under division (E)(3)(c) below.
         (c)   The storage of any materials or equipment must be elevated on
fill to the regulatory flood protection elevation.
         (d)   The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of
flooding, flammable, explosive or potentially injurious to human, animal or
plant life is prohibited.
         (e)   Fill must be properly compacted and the slopes must be properly
protected by the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable method.
         (f)   All new principal structures must have vehicular access at or
above an elevation not more than two feet below the regulatory flood protection
elevation, or must have a flood warning/emergency evacuation plan acceptable to
the city.
         (g)   Accessory uses such as yards, railroad tracks and parking lots
may be at an elevation lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation.
However, any facilities used by employees or the general public must be
designed with a flood warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation
if the area is inundated to a depth and velocity such that the depth (in feet)
multiplied by the velocity (in feet per second) would exceed a product of four
upon occurrence of the regional (1% chance) flood.
         (h)   Interference with normal manufacturing/industrial plant
operations must be minimized, especially along streams having protracted flood
durations. In considering permit applications, due consideration must be given
to the needs of industries with operations that require a floodplain location.
         (i)   Flood fringe developments must not adversely affect the
hydraulic capacity of the channel and adjoining floodplain of any tributary
watercourse or drainage system.
         (j)   Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles must meet the
standards of division (G) below.
      (3)   Conditional uses. The following uses and activities may be allowed
as conditional uses, if allowed in the underlying zoning district(s) or any
applicable overlay district, following the procedures in division (G)(4) below.
Conditional uses must meet the standards in divisions (E)(2)(d) through (E)(2)
(j) above and division (E)(4) below.
         (a)   Any non-residential structure that is not elevated on fill or
flood-proofed in accordance with division (E)(2)(a) above.
         (b)   Storage of any material or equipment below the regulatory flood
protection elevation.
         (c)   The cumulative placement of more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill
when the fill is not being used to elevate a structure in accordance with
division (E)(2)(a) above.
      (4)   Standards for flood fringe conditional uses.
         (a)   The standards listed in divisions (E)(2)(d) through (E)(2)(j)
above apply to all conditional uses.
         (b)   Basements, as defined by §
152.003(B) of this chapter, are subject to the following.
            1.   Residential basement construction is not allowed below the
regulatory flood protection elevation.
            2.   Non-residential basements may be allowed below the regulatory
flood protection elevation; provided, the basement is structurally dry flood-
proofed in accordance with division (E)(4)(d) below.
         (c)   All areas of non-residential structures, including basements, to
be placed below the regulatory flood protection elevation must be flood-proofed
in accordance with the structurally dry flood-proofing classifications in the
state’s Building Code. Structurally dry flood-proofing must meet the FP-1 or
FP-2 flood-proofing classification in the state’s Building Code, which requires
making the structure water-tight with the walls substantially impermeable to
the passage of water and with structural components capable of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. Structures wet
flood-proofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 classification are not permitted.
         (d)   The placement of more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill or other
similar material on a parcel (other than for the purpose of elevating a
structure to the regulatory flood protection elevation) must comply with an
approved erosion/sedimentation control plan.
            1.   The plan must clearly specify methods to be used to stabilize
the fill on site for a flood event at a minimum of the regional (1% chance)
flood event.
            2.   The plan must be prepared and certified by a registered
professional engineer or other qualified individual acceptable to the city.
            3.   The plan may incorporate alternative procedures for removal of
the material from the floodplain if adequate flood warning time exists.
         (e)   Storage of materials and equipment below the regulatory flood
protection elevation must comply with an approved emergency plan providing for
removal of the materials within the time available after a flood warning.
         (f)   1.   Alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill
may be utilized to elevate a structure’s lowest floor above the regulatory
flood protection elevation. These alternative methods may include the use of
stilts, pilings, parallel walls and the like, or above-grade, enclosed areas
such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages. The base or floor of an enclosed
area shall be considered above-grade and not a structures basement or lowest
floor if:
               a.   The enclosed area is above-grade on at least one side of
the structure;
               b.   It is designed to internally flood and is constructed with
flood resistant materials; and
               c.   It is used solely for parking of vehicles, building access
or storage. The above-noted alternative elevation methods are subject to the
following additional standards.
                  i.   Design and certification. The structure’s design and as-
built condition must be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect as being in compliance with the general design standards of the
state’s Building Code and, specifically, that all electrical, heating,
ventilation, plumbing and air-conditioning equipment and other service
facilities must be at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or be
designed to prevent flood water from entering or accumulating within these
components during times of flooding.
                  ii.   Specific standards for above-grade, enclosed areas.
Above-grade, fully enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages
must be designed to internally flood and the design plans must stipulate:
                     (A)   The minimum area of openings in the walls where
internal flooding is to be used as a flood-proofing technique. There shall be a
minimum of two openings on at least two sides of the structure and the bottom
of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. The automatic
openings shall have a minimum net area of not less than one square inch for
every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding unless a registered
professional engineer or architect certifies that a smaller net area would
suffice. The automatic openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves
or other coverings or devices; provided that, they permit the automatic entry
and exit of flood waters without any form of human intervention; and
                     (B)   The enclosed area will be designed of flood
resistant materials in accordance with the FP-3 or FP-4 classifications in the
state’s Building Code and shall be used solely for building access, parking of
vehicles or storage.
   (F)   General Floodplain District (GF).
      (1)   Permitted uses.
         (a)   The uses listed in division (D)(1) above are permitted uses.
         (b)   All other uses are subject to the floodway/flood fringe
evaluation criteria specified in division (F)(2) below. Division (D) above
applies if the proposed use is determined to be in the Floodway District.
Division (E) above applies if the proposed use is determined to be in the Flood
Fringe.
      (2)   Procedures for floodway and flood fringe determinations.
         (a)   Upon receipt of an application for a permit or other approval
within the General Floodplain District, the Zoning Administrator must obtain,
review and reasonably utilize any regional flood elevation and floodway data
available from a federal, state or other source.
         (b)   If regional flood elevation and floodway data are not readily
available, the applicant must furnish additional information, as needed, to
determine the regulatory flood protection elevation and whether the proposed
use would fall within the Floodway or Flood Fringe District. Information must
be consistent with accepted hydrological and hydraulic engineering standards
and the standards in division (F)(2)(c) below.
         (c)   The determination of floodway and flood fringe must include the
following components, as applicable:
            1.   Estimate the peak discharge of the regional (1% chance) flood;
            2.   Calculate the water surface profile of the regional flood
based upon a hydraulic analysis of the stream channel and overbank areas; and
            3.   Compute the floodway necessary to convey or store the regional
flood without increasing flood stages more than one-half foot. A lesser stage
increase than one-half foot is required if, as a result of the stage increase,
increased flood damages would result. An equal degree of encroachment on both
sides of the stream within the reach must be assumed in computing floodway
boundaries.
         (d)   The Zoning Administrator will review the submitted information
and assess the technical evaluation and the recommended Floodway and/or Flood
Fringe District boundary. The assessment must include the cumulative effects of
previous floodway encroachments. The Zoning Administrator may seek technical
assistance from a designated engineer or other expert person or agency,
including the Department of Natural Resources. Based on this assessment, the
Zoning Administrator may approve or deny the application.
         (e)   Once the Floodway and Flood Fringe District boundaries have been
determined, the Zoning Administrator must process the permit application
consistent with the applicable provisions of divisions (D) and (E) above.
   (G)   Land development standards.
      (1)   In general. Recognizing that flood-prone areas may exist outside of
the designated floodplain districts, the requirements of this section apply to
all land within the city.
      (2)   Subdivisions. No land may be subdivided which is unsuitable for
reasons of flooding or inadequate drainage, water supply or sewage treatment
facilities. Manufactured home parks and recreational vehicle parks or
campgrounds are considered subdivisions under this chapter.
         (a)   All lots within the floodplain districts must be able to contain
a building site outside of the Floodway District at or above the regulatory
flood protection elevation.
         (b)   All subdivisions must have road access both to the subdivision
and to the individual building sites no lower than two feet below the
regulatory flood protection elevation, unless a flood warning emergency plan
for the safe evacuation of all vehicles and people during the regional (1%
chance) flood has been approved by the governing body. The plan must be
prepared by a registered engineer or other qualified individual, and must
demonstrate that adequate time and personnel exist to carry out the evacuation.
         (c)   For all subdivisions in the floodplain, the Floodway and Flood
Fringe District boundaries, the regulatory flood protection elevation and the
required elevation of all access roads must be clearly labeled on all required
subdivision drawings and platting documents.
         (d)   In the General Floodplain District, applicants must provide the
information required in division (F)(2) above to determine the regional flood
elevation, the Floodway and Flood Fringe District boundaries and the regulatory
flood protection elevation for the subdivision site.
         (e)   If a subdivision proposal or other proposed new development is
in a flood-prone area, any such proposal must be reviewed to assure that:
            1.   All such proposals are consistent with the need to minimize
flood damage within the flood-prone area;
            2.   All public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas,
electrical and water systems are located and constructed to minimize or
eliminate flood damage; and
            3.   Adequate drainage is provided to reduce exposure of flood
hazard.
      (3)   Building sites. If a proposed building site is in a flood-prone
area, all new construction and substantial improvements (including the
placement of manufactured homes) must be:
         (a)   Designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent
floatation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy;
         (b)   Constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to
flood damage;
         (c)   Constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
and
         (d)   Constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and
air-conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/
or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding.
      (4)   Utilities, railroads, roads and bridges public utilities. All
public utilities and facilities such as gas, electrical, sewer and water supply
systems to be located in the floodplain must be flood-proofed in accordance
with the state’s Building Code or elevated to the regulatory flood protection
elevation.
      (5)   Public transportation facilities. Railroad tracks, roads and
bridges to be located within the floodplain must comply with divisions (D) and
(E) above. These transportation facilities must be elevated to the regulatory
flood protection elevation where failure or interruption of these facilities
would result in danger to the public health or safety or where the facilities
are essential to the orderly functioning of the area. Minor or auxiliary roads
or railroads may be constructed at a lower elevation where failure or
interruption of transportation services would not endanger the public health or
safety.
      (6)   On-site water supply and sewage treatment systems. Where public
utilities are not provided:
         (a)   On-site water supply systems must be designed to minimize or
eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems; and
         (b)   New or replacement on-site sewage treatment systems must be
designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems
and discharges from the systems into flood waters and they must not be subject
to impairment or contamination during times of flooding. Any sewage treatment
system designed in accordance with the state’s current statewide standards for
on-site sewage treatment systems is considered to be in compliance with this
section.
      (7)   Manufactured homes, manufactured home parks and recreational
vehicles.
         (a)   Manufactured homes. New manufactured home parks and expansions
to existing manufactured home parks are prohibited in any floodplain district.
For existing manufactured home parks or lots of record, the following
requirements apply.
            1.   Placement or replacement of manufactured home units is
prohibited in the Floodway District.
            2.   If allowed in the Flood Fringe District, placement or
replacement of manufactured home units is subject to the requirements of
division (E) above and the following standards.
               a.   New and replacement manufactured homes must be elevated in
compliance with division (E) above and must be securely anchored to an
adequately anchored foundation system that resists flotation, collapse and
lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use
of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in
addition to applicable state or local anchoring requirements for resisting wind
forces.
               b.   New or replacement manufactured homes in existing
manufactured home parks must meet the vehicular access requirements for
subdivisions in division (G)(2) above.
         (b)   Recreational vehicles. New recreational vehicle parks or
campgrounds and expansions to existing recreational vehicle parks or
campgrounds are prohibited in any floodplain district. Placement of
recreational vehicles in existing recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds in
the floodplain must meet the exemption criteria below or be treated as new
structures meeting the requirements of this section.
            1.   Recreational vehicles are exempt from the provisions of this
section if they are placed in any of the following areas and meet the criteria
listed in division (G)(7)(b)2. below:
               a.   Individual lots or parcels of record;
               b.   Existing commercial recreational vehicle parks or
campgrounds; and
               c.   Existing condominium-type associations.
            2.   Criteria for exempt recreational vehicles:
               a.   The vehicle must have a current license required for
highway use;
               b.   The vehicle must be highway ready, meaning on wheels or the
internal jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type
utilities commonly used in campgrounds and recreational vehicle parks;
               c.   No permanent structural type additions may be attached to
the vehicle;
               d.   The vehicle and associated use must be permissible in any
pre-existing, underlying zoning district;
               e.   Accessory structures are not permitted within the Floodway
District. Any accessory structure in the Flood Fringe District must be
constructed of flood-resistant materials and be securely anchored, meeting the
requirements applicable to manufactured homes in division (G)(7)2.b.; and
               f.   An accessory structure must constitute a minimal investment
            3.   Recreational vehicles that are exempt in division (G)(7)2.b.
above lose this exemption when development occurs on the site that exceeds a
minimal investment for an accessory structure such as a garage or storage
building. The recreational vehicle and all accessory structures will then be
treated as new structures subject to the elevation and flood-proofing
requirements of division (E) above. No development or improvement on the parcel
or attachment to the recreational vehicle is allowed that would hinder the
removal of the vehicle should flooding occur.

section, the most restrictive setback requirements shall apply.
      (4)   Conditional use permits for substandard lots of record as of 1-1-
1981 in any zoning district in the Mississippi Headwaters Corridor.
         (a)   Lots of record in the office of the County Recorder as of 1-1-
1981, which do not meet the requirements of this section, may be allowed as
building sites if the use if allowed within the underlying zoning district; the
lot has been in single and separate ownership for abutting lands at all times
since 1-1-1981; was created compliant with official controls in effect at the
time; and sewage treatment and setback requirements of shoreland control were
met.
         (b)   If, in a group of two or more contiguous lots under the same
ownership, any individual lot does not meet the requirements of this section,
the lot must not be considered as a separate parcel of land for the purposes of
development. The lot must be combined with the one or more contiguous lots so
they equal one or more parcels of land, each meeting the requirements of this
section.
         (c)   Additions to structures on substandard lots of record in the
office of the County Recorder as of 1-1-1981 may be permitted under a
conditional use permit.
         (d)   Substandard lots may be used as a building site under a
conditional use permit; however conditional use permits for substandard lots
are not permitted if they increase the non-conformity of the lot. Conditional
use permits shall not be granted for any land that is designated as wetlands.
         (e)   In granting a conditional use permit, the Planning Commission
shall give consideration to the following:
            1.   Mitigation of impacts to water quality and the environment;
            2.   Storm water management including direction and flow of
drainage and storm water retention areas;
            3.   Connection to city sewer and water systems is required;
            4.   Preparation of a natural landscape protection plan which
shows, among other things, shoreline restoration, side yard plantings,
reduction in tree removal; and
            5.   Shoreline maintenance plan which is approved by the state’s
Department of Natural Resources (DNR) or which is composed exclusively of
plantings approved by the state’s DNR.
   (D)   Minimum standards for new plats or subdivisions of existing lots of
record in the office of the County Recorder as of 1-1-1981. Minimum standards
for new plats or subdivisions of existing lots of record in the office of the
County Recorder as of 1-1-1981 shall be one acre, excluding wetlands. City
sewer and water systems must be utilized where available.
      (1)   The minimum lot requirements for a new plat or subdivision of an
existing lot of record in the office of the County Recorder as of 1-1-1981, in
addition to a 50-foot vegetative buffer zone extending landward from the OHW:

      (2)   A natural landscape protection plan and storm water management plan
must be prepared and approved in connection with any new development. A natural
landscape protection plan must be designed with native vegetation to ensure
bank stability, provide natural migration corridors for wildlife, birds and
insects, as well as shading for fish habitat.
      (3)   New subdivisions governed by this section will be encouraged to
include a system of trails and open space of at least 10% that will enhance the
ability of the public to view and enjoy the Mississippi River and will provide
connections to other open spaces and trails in the area and will be
incorporated into the storm water management plan. Use of wetlands to enhance
trails and open spaces will also be encouraged. Retention ponds are required
for storm water runoff to the Mississippi River.
   (E)   Minimum standards for all Mississippi Headwaters Corridor Zoning
Districts.
      (1)   Natural Landscape Protection Plan (NLPP). Before issuing a permit
for expansion of a structure or new construction, a natural landscape
protection plan shall be submitted to and approved by the city in compliance
with this section. Criteria for the NLPP includes considerations for soil
types, vegetation removal/restoration, erosion control before, during and after
construction, the construction and maintenance of the 50-foot vegetative
buffer.
      (2)   Significant cultural sites.
         (a)   Unplatted cemetery. No structure shall be placed nearer than 50
feet from the boundary of an unplatted cemetery or of a significant cultural
site protected under M.S. § 307.08, as it may be amended from time to time.
         (b)   Significant cultural sites. No structure shall be placed on a
significant cultural site in a manner that affects the value of the site unless
adequate information about the site has been recovered and documented in a
public repository as determined by the city and the state’s Historical Society.
         (c)   Review for presence of significant cultural sites. All zoning
actions within the MHB Overlay District will be reviewed for the presence of
significant historical or cultural sites. Thirty days’ notice will be made to
the state’s Historical Society of pending development on or near significant
cultural sites.
      (3)   Bluff impact zone. Structures and accessory structures or
facilities, except stairways, lifts and landings, shall not be placed within
bluff impact zones or shore impact zones.
      (4)   Steep slopes. Before issuing a permit for the construction of
roads, driveways, structures or other improvements on steep slopes, the slope
must be evaluated for possible soil erosion impacts and development visibility
from public waters. The city will impose conditions to prevent erosion,
preserve existing vegetative screening of structures, assuming summer leaf-on
vegetation, as cost effective preventative measures to maintain the river
amenity and decrease the cited contamination in this stretch for turbidity,
threat to aquatic life, swimming and other potentially harmful results of poor
management practices. No excavation shall be made between the building line and
the water.
      (5)   Stairways, lifts and landings.
         (a)   Stairway and lift width. Stairways and lifts shall not exceed
four feet in width on residential zoned lots. Wider stairways may be used for
resort properties, public open space and recreational properties.
         (b)   Landing area. Landings for stairways and lifts on residential
zoned lots shall not exceed 32 square feet in area.
         (c)   Construction requirements. Stairways, lifts and landings may be
either placed into the ground or constructed above the ground on posts or
pilings; provided that, they are designed and built in a manner that ensures
control of soil erosion.
         (d)   Visibility minimized. Stairways, lifts and landings shall be
located to minimize their visibility from public waters, assuming summer, leaf-
on conditions.
         (e)   Canopies or roofs. Canopies or roofs are not allowed on
stairways, lifts or landings.
         (f)   Handicap access. Facilities that provide access to shore areas
for physically disabled persons are allowed; provided that, the dimensional and
performance standards of this section are met.
      (6)   Decks. Decks not meeting the minimum structure setback requirement
existing on 1-1-1981, may be added to; provided, the following criteria are
met:
         (a)   The deck encroachment toward the ordinary high water mark does
not exceed 15% of the existing shoreline setback from the ordinary high water
mark or does not encroach closer than 30 feet, whichever is more restrictive;
and
         (b)   The deck is constructed primarily of untreated wood and is not
roofed or screened.
      (7)   Commercial and industrial uses.
         (a)   No new commercial, business or industrial uses shall be
permitted within any Mississippi Headwaters Zoning District, except for home
occupations permitted by conditional use permit, and congregate living or
foster care homes permitted by law. Home occupations must be of a nature that
does not threaten water quality (i.e., salvage yards, automotive repair or
other uses where potential for hazardous spills may permeate sandy soils and
migrate to river waters). No waste oil pits or below ground storage, or above
ground storage of potentially harmful measures are allowed, nor home
occupations where these substances may be used or stored, nor any other uses
which may not further the goals of the Mississippi River Headwaters Plan.
         (b)   Non-conforming commercial, business or industrial uses in
existence prior to their incorporation into any Mississippi Headwaters Zoning
District may be continued. No such use shall be expanded, changed, enlarged or
altered in a way which increases its non-conformity. The City Council shall
consider whether any detrimental impacts to water quality and the environment
can be mitigated. In considering mitigation, the Council shall consider such
factors as the direction of gutters to storm sewers, limitation of direct
drainage into the Mississippi River, side yard plantings, reduction of tree
removal, correction of a failing individual sewage treatment system, decrease
in impervious area on site, shoreline maintenance pursuant to a plan approved
by the Department of Natural Resources or plantings approved by the Department
of Natural Resources to approve fish or wildlife habitat.
      (8)   Municipal services city ordinance provisions. All lands within any
Mississippi Headwaters Zoning District shall be subject to the city ordinance
provisions relating to the public water service and public sewerage service
shall be serviced by city sewer and water systems.
      (9)   Docks. Docks may be built in compliance with the state’s Department
of Natural Resources regulations.
      (10)   Maintenance. A maintenance regime for structures and roads in
subdivisions, with financial assurances as needed, is required.
   (F)   Natural landscape protection plan.
      (1)   Requirement:
         (a)   To protect water quality and prevent shoreline erosion, a
natural landscape protection plan shall be completed and reviewed, consistent
with the provisions of this section; and
         (b)   All existing structures are required to construct or maintain a
minimum of a ten-foot natural vegetative buffer.
      (2)   The purpose of a natural landscape protection plan is to:
         (a)   Retain or recreate original hydrologic conditions by minimizing
use of pavements and impervious surfaces and retaining original runoff volume
and velocities;
         (b)   Confine development and construction activities to the least
critical areas by avoiding critical areas such as long, steep slopes, erodible
soils and fragile vegetation;
         (c)   Fit development to terrain;
         (d)   Preserve and utilize the natural drainage system;
         (e)   Maintain a minimum of 50-foot chemically untreated vegetative
buffer zone at the water's edge, as required in this section;
         (f)   Alteration of vegetation and topography should be limited to
prevention of erosion into public waters, fixation of nutrients, stabilization
of shorelines, preservation of historic, archeological or cultural values,
prevention of bank slumping, protection of fish and wildlife habitat and
conservation of natural resources; and
         (g)   The landscape plan should be planned and conducted in a manner
that will minimize the extent of disturbed areas, runoff velocities, erosion
potential and reduce and delay runoff volumes. Disturbed areas must be
stabilized and protected as soon as possible and facilities or methods used to
retain sediment on site.
   (G)   Storm water management plans in Mississippi Headwaters Corridor.
      (1)   Consideration. Proper storm water management must be considered in
all reviews, approvals and permits related to this section. A storm water
management plan shall be submitted with any application.
      (2)   Review provisions. The following provisions shall be considered in
reviewing proper storm water management.
         (a)   Natural features to be used. Existing natural drainage ways,
wetlands and vegetated soils must be used to convey, store, filter and retain
storm water runoff before discharge to public waters.
         (b)   Constructed facilities may be used. When development density,
topographic features, and soil and vegetation conditions are not sufficient to
adequately handle storm water runoff using natural features and vegetation,
various types of constructed facilities such a diversions, settling basins,
skimming devices, dikes, waterways and ponds may be used. Preference must be
given to designs using surface drainage, vegetation and infiltration rather
than buried pipes and human-made material and facilities. Holding structures
must be designed and approved by a licensed engineer.
         (c)   Minimize disturbance. Development must be planned and conducted
in a manner that will minimize the extent of disturbed areas, runoff
velocities, erosion potential and reduce and delay runoff volumes. Disturbed
areas must be stabilized and protected as soon as possible and facilities or
methods used to retain sediment on site.
         (d)   New development or expanded development. New development must
meet the following standards.
            1.   Impervious surface coverage of the lot must not exceed 15% of
total area.
            2.   Facilities constructed for storm water management must be
consistent with the Department of Natural Resources field office technical
guide, which is located at the county’s Soil and Water Conservation Service
District Office.
            3.   Storm water outfalls to the Mississippi River must provide for
filtering or settling of suspended solids and skimming of surface debris before
discharge.
            4.   A natural landscape protection site plan must be prepared to
guide construction and lot development in accordance with this section.
   (H)   Issues addressed by the natural landscape protection plan and the
storm water management plan. In achieving their purpose, the natural landscape
protection plan and the storm water management plan shall address the following
issues:
      (1)   Topography. A topographic map showing the existing contour
elevations at intervals of ten feet is the basis of the natural landscape
protection plan. It is important to note slope steepness and slope length on
this map. The longer and the steeper the slope, the greater the erosion
potential;
      (2)   Drainage patterns. Locate and clearly mark all existing drainage
swales and patterns on the topographic map. Consider where water will
concentrate on the property. Natural drainage areas are overland flows,
depressions, swales and natural watercourses. The natural drainage should be
used to convey runoff on and off the site, but increased runoff should be
limited so erosion does not occur;
      (3)   Soils. Determine and show major soil types on the topographic map.
Plot directly on the map at the same scale for ease of interpretation. Soil
types should be evaluated for potential for flood hazard, natural drainage,
depth to seasonal water table, permeability, shrink-swell potential, texture
and erodibility;
      (4)   Ground cover. Show the existing vegetation on the topographic map.
Features such as tree clusters, grassy areas and unique vegetation should be
shown on the map. Any denuded or exposed soil areas should also be shown on the
topographic map. If at all possible, existing vegetation should be maintained
to minimize erosion. If existing vegetation cannot be maintained, then
construction should be staged, (one site completed before the second is begun),
to minimize erosion. Alternatives are temporary seeding, mulching or temporary
structure controls, such as settling basins, silt fences or bale dams. A
vegetative buffer of natural grasses, shrubs and trees should be maintained for
at least 25 feet at the waters edge. This buffer zone helps protect water
quality, provide habitat for wildlife and maintains the natural aesthetics of
the shoreline; and
      (5)   Adjacent areas. Delineate areas adjacent to the site on the
topographic map. Such features as streams, roads, houses or other buildings and
wooded areas should be shown. Streams which will receive runoff from the site
should be noted. Consider the potential for increased runoff during the
construction and where the runoff will go.
   (I)   Accessory uses within Mississippi Headwaters Corridor. All accessory
uses must meet or exceed structure setback standards. The term “accessory
uses”, as used herein, does not include stairways, lifts and docks. The
following standards must also be met.
      (1)   The structure or facility must not exceed ten feet in height,
exclusive of safety rails. The structure or facility cannot occupy an area
greater than 250 square feet, or, if used solely for watercraft storage,
including storage of related boating and water-oriented sporting equipment, may
occupy an area up to 400 square feet; provided, the maximum width of the
structure is 20 feet as measured parallel to the configuration of the
shoreline. Detached decks must not exceed eight feet above grade at any point.
      (2)   The setback of the structure or facility from the ordinary high
water mark shall not be less than the setback from the principal structure.
      (3)   The structure or facility must be treated to reduce visibility as
viewed from public waters and adjacent shorelands by vegetation, topography,
increased setbacks, color or other means.
      (4)   The roof may be used as a deck with safety rails, but must not be
enclosed or used as a storage area.
      (5)   The accessory use must not be designed or used for human habitation
and must not contain water supply or sewage treatment facilities.
   (J)   Shoreland alteration within the Mississippi Headwaters Corridor.
      (1)   Purpose. Alterations of vegetation and topography will be regulated
to prevent erosion to public waters, fix nutrients, preserve shoreland
aesthetics, preserve historic values, prevent bank slumping, preserve a
corridor for movement of wildlife, protect fish and wildlife habitat, conserve
cultural resources and to preserve the scenic and aesthetic character of the
shoreland within the Mississippi Headwaters Corridor.
      (2)   Vegetative management provisions.
         (a)   Intensive vegetation clearing. Intensive vegetation clearing
within the OHW setback and bluff impact zones and on steep slopes is not
allowed.
         (b)   Alteration. Shoreland alteration should avoid negative impacts,
such as use of steep slopes; increased soil erosion; development visibility;
preservation of existing vegetative screening from the Mississippi River,
assuming summer leaf-on conditions; avoidance of wetlands; avoidance of
excavation between the building line and the Mississippi River; avoidance of
intensive vegetative clearing within the OHW setback; shading of water surfaces
should be maintained or enhanced; limitation of impermeable material to no more
than 15% of the building site; management of long-lived species along the river
front shall be directed toward promotion of large sized trees by using
rotations based on biological age rather than economic age; cuttings shall be
conducted in compliance with a natural landscape protection plan and best
management practices.
         (c)   Limited clearing. In setback areas and bluff impact zones and on
steep slopes, limited clearing of trees and shrubs and cutting, pruning and
trimming of trees is allowed to provide a view to the water from the principal
dwelling site and to accommodate the placement of stairways, landings and
access paths; provided that:
            1.   The screening of structures, vehicles or other facilities as
viewed from the water, assuming summer leaf-on conditions, is maintained;
            2.   Shading of water surfaces is maintained; and
            3.   The above provisions are not applicable to the removal of
trees, limbs or branches that are dead, diseased or pose safety hazards.

accessory to a permitted or conditional use may be permitted if consistent with
the natural landscape protection plan.
         (b)   Grading and filling of the natural topography which is accessory
to a permitted or conditional use shall not be conducted without a grading and
filling permit. A grading and filling permit may be issued only if the
following conditions of division (K)(2) below are met. Grading and filling
shall be performed in a manner which minimizes earth moving, erosion, storm
water runoff, tree clearing and the destruction of natural amenities.
Excavation on lots abutting the Mississippi River shall not be permitted
between the building line and the ordinary high-water mark.
      (2)   Grading and filling standards. Grading and filling of the natural
topography shall also meet the following standards.
         (a)   A one-time permit of ten cubic yards of fill material shall be
allowed. Additional grading and filling work within the Mississippi Headwaters
Corridor shall require a conditional use permit and shall comply with the
following best management practices:
            1.   The smallest amount of bare ground is exposed for as short a
period of time as feasible;
            2.   Temporary ground cover, such as mulch, is used until a
permanent ground cover, such as sod, is planted;
            3.   Methods to prevent erosion and to trap sediment are employed;
            4.   Fill is stabilized to accepted engineering standards;
            5.   Fill or excavated material is not placed in a manner that
creates an unstable slope;
            6.   Plans to place fill or excavated material on steep slopes is
reviewed by a licensed engineer for continued slope stability and in no case
may create finished slopes of 30% or greater;
            7.   Fill or excavated materials are not placed within bluff impact
zones; and
            8.   Disturbed areas are restored in the same building season.
         (b)   Applications for an activity within the Mississippi Headwaters
Corridor will be considered if there are no outstanding violations on the
property or by the applicant.
      (3)   Altering current or cross-section of public waters. Excavation of
materials from, filling in construction of any permanent structures or
navigational obstructions, or any work that will change or diminish the course,
current or cross-section of the Mississippi River is prohibited unless
authorized by a permit from the Commissioner of the Department of Natural
Resources or the Army Corps of Engineers.
      (4)   Drainage, filling or banking of wetlands.
         (a)   Drainage or filling in of wetlands is not allowed within the
Mississippi Headwaters Corridor under this section. The county is the local
government unit for wetland activities that occur in the county. Any draining
or filling of wetlands must be approved by the Wetland Technical Evaluation
Panel (TEP) and the county. The county will further consult with the Department
of Natural Resources and the Army Corps of Engineers.
         (b)   Wetland banking that is allowed by variance due to a hardship
should be conducted in the Upper Mississippi River Corridor in order to benefit
the river.

except stairways and landings, shall not be placed within bluff impact zones.
   (H)   Design criteria for development within the SH Overlay District.
      (1)   High water elevations. Properties elevations shall comply with
floodplain ordinance minimum elevations located in §
152.056(B)(3) of this chapter. In the absence of floodplain data, structures
shall be placed with the lowest floor of the structure at least three feet
above the flood of record, if data are available. If data are not available,
structures must be placed with the lowest floor at least three feet above the
OHW or by conducting a technical evaluation to determine effects of the
proposed construction upon flood stages and flood flows and to establish a
flood protection elevation. All such technical evaluations, regardless of
approach, shall be performed by a qualified licensed engineer or hydrologist
consistent with Minn. Rules parts 6120.5000 to 6120.6200 governing the
management of floodplain areas. If more than one approach is used, the highest
protection elevation determined must be used for placing structures and other
facilities.
      (2)   Stairways, lifts and landings. Stairways and lifts are the
preferred alternative to major topographic alterations for achieving access up
and down bluffs and steep slopes to shore areas. Stairways and lifts must meet
the following design requirements.
         (a)   Stairways and lifts must not exceed four feet in width on
residential lots. Wider stairways may be used for commercial properties, public
open-space recreational properties and planned unit developments.
         (b)   Landings for stairways and lifts on residential lots must not
exceed 32 square feet in area. Landings larger than 32 square feet may be used
for commercial properties, public open-space recreational properties and
planned unit developments.
         (c)   Canopies or roofs are not allowed on stairways, lifts or
landings.
         (d)   Stairways, lifts and landings may be either constructed above
the ground on posts or pilings, or placed into the ground; provided, they are
designed and built in a manner that ensures control of soil erosion.
         (e)   Stairways, lifts and landings must be located in the most
visually inconspicuous portions of lots, as viewed from the surface of the
public water assuming summer, leaf-on conditions, whenever practical.
         (f)   Facilities such as ramps, lifts or mobility paths for physically
handicapped persons are also allowed for achieving access to shore areas;
provided that, the dimensional and performance standards of divisions (H)(2)(a)
to (H)(2)(e) above are complied with in addition to the requirements of Minn.
Rules Ch. 1341.
      (3)   Significant historical sites. No structure may be placed on a
significant historical site in a manner that affects the values of the site
unless adequate information about the site has been removed and documented in a
public repository.
      (4)   Steep slopes. The City Engineer shall evaluate possible soil
erosion impacts and development visibility from public waters prior to the
issuance of a permit for construction of sewage treatment systems, roads,
driveways, structures or other improvements on steep slopes. When determined
necessary, conditions must be attached to issued permits to prevent erosion and
to preserve existing vegetation screening of structures, vehicles and other
facilities as viewed from the surface of public waters, assuming summer, leaf-
on vegetation.
      (5)   Height of structures. All structures in residential districts,
except churches and non-residential agricultural structures, must not exceed 25
feet in height.
   (I)   Shoreland alterations. Alterations of vegetation and topography shall
be regulated to prevent erosion into public waters, fix nutrients, preserve
shoreland aesthetics, preserve historic values, prevent bank slumping and
protect fish and wildlife habitat.

and sewage treatment systems and the construction of roads and parking areas
regulated by division (K) below are exempt from the vegetation alteration
standards that follow.
      (2)   Removal or alteration of vegetation, except for agricultural uses
as regulated in division (N) below is allowed subject to the following
standards.
         (a)   Intensive vegetation clearing within the shore and bluff impact
zones and on steep slopes is not allowed. Intensive vegetation clearing for
forest land conversion to another use outside of these areas is allowable as a
conditional use if an erosion control and sedimentation plan is developed and
approved by the soil and water conservation district in which the property is
located.
         (b)   In shore and bluff impact zones and on steep slopes, limited
clearing of trees and shrubs and cutting, pruning and trimming of trees is
allowed to provide a view to the water from the principal dwelling site and to
accommodate the placement of stairways and landings, picnic areas, access
paths, livestock watering areas, beach and watercraft access areas and
permitted water-oriented accessory structures or facilities; provided that:
            1.   The screening of structures, vehicles or other facilities as
viewed from the water, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions, is not
substantially reduced;
            2.   Along rivers, existing shading of water surfaces is preserved;
and
            3.   The above provisions are not applicable to the removal of
trees, limbs or branches that are dead, diseased or pose safety hazards.
   (J)   Topographic alterations/grading and filling.
      (1)   Grading and filling and excavations necessary for the construction
of structures, sewage treatment systems and driveways under validly issued
construction permits for these facilities do not require the issuance of a
separate grading and filling permit. However, the grading and filling standards
in this section must be incorporated into the issuance of permits for
construction of structures, sewage treatment systems and driveways.
      (2)   Public roads and parking areas are regulated by division (K) below.
      (3)   Notwithstanding divisions (J)(1) and (J)(2) above, a grading and
filling permit will be required for:
         (a)   The movement of more than ten cubic yards of material on steep
slopes or within shore or bluff impact zones; and
         (b)   The movement of more than 50 cubic yards of material outside of
steep slopes and shore and bluff impact zones.
      (4)   The following considerations and conditions must be adhered to
during the issuance of construction permits, grading and filling permits,
conditional use permits, variances and subdivision approvals.
         (a)   The grading, filling or alteration of a wetland shall be
prohibited unless approved by the state or federal authorities in cases where
no other alternatives exist for development.
         (b)   Alterations must be designed and conducted in a manner that
ensures only the smallest amount of bare ground is exposed for the shortest
time possible.
         (c)   Mulches or similar materials must be used, where necessary, for
temporary bare soil coverage and a permanent vegetation cover must be
established as soon as possible.
         (d)   Methods to minimize soil erosion and to trap sediments before
they reach any surface water feature must be used.
         (e)   Altered areas must be stabilized to acceptable erosion control
standards consistent with the field office technical guides of the local soil
and water conservation districts and the United States Soil Conservation
Service.
         (f)   Fill or excavated material must not be placed in a manner that
creates an unstable slope.
         (g)   Plans to place fill or excavated material on steep slopes must
be reviewed by qualified professionals for continued slope stability and must
not create finished slopes of 30% or greater.
         (h)   Fill or excavated material must not be placed in bluff impact
zones.
         (i)   Any alterations below the ordinary high water mark of public
waters must first be authorized by the Commissioner of the Department of
Natural Resources under M.S. Ch. 103G, as it may be amended from time to time.
         (j)   Alterations of topography must only be allowed if they are
accessory to permitted or conditional uses and do not adversely affect adjacent
or nearby properties.
         (k)   Placement of natural rock riprap, including associated grading
of the shoreline and placement of a filter blanket, is permitted if no other
alternatives exist. The permitted riprap placement shall have a finished slope
that does not exceed three feet horizontal to one foot vertical, the landward
extent of the riprap is within ten feet of the ordinary high water mark and the
height of the riprap above the ordinary high water mark shall not exceed three
feet.
      (5)   Connections to public waters. Excavations where the intended
purpose is connection to a public water, such as boat slips, canals, lagoons
and harbors, must be controlled by local shoreland controls. Permission for
excavations may be given only after the Commissioner of the Department of
Natural Resources has approved the proposed connection to public waters.
   (K)   Placement and design of roads, driveways and parking areas.
      (1)   Public and private roads and parking areas must be designed to take
advantage of natural vegetation and topography to achieve maximum screening
from view from public waters. Documentation must be provided by a qualified
individual that all roads and parking areas are designed and constructed to
minimize and control erosion to public waters consistent with the field office
technical guides of the local soil and water conservation district, or other
applicable technical materials.
      (2)   Roads, driveways and parking areas must meet structure setbacks and
must not be placed within bluff and Shore Impact Zones, when other reasonable
and feasible placement alternatives exist. If no alternatives exist, they may
be placed within these areas, and must be designed to minimize adverse impacts.
      (3)   Public and private watercraft access ramps, approach roads and
access-related parking areas may be placed within Shore Impact Zones; provided,
the vegetative screening and erosion control conditions of this division (K)
are met. For private facilities, the grading and filling provisions of division
(J) above must be met.
   (L)   Storm water management. The following standards shall apply to all
properties within the Shoreland Overlay District (SH).
      (1)   When possible, existing natural drainageways, wetlands and
vegetated soil surfaces must be used to convey, store, filter and retain storm
water runoff before discharge to public waters.
      (2)   Development must be planned and conducted in a manner that will
minimize the extent of disturbed areas, runoff velocities, erosion potential
and reduce and delay runoff volumes. Disturbed areas must be stabilized and
protected as soon as possible and facilities or methods used to retain sediment
on the site.
      (3)   When development density, topographic features and soil and
vegetation conditions are not sufficient to adequately handle storm water
runoff using natural features and vegetation, various types of constructed
facilities such as diversions, settling basins, skimming devices, dikes,
waterways and ponds may be used. Preference must be given to designs using
surface drainage, vegetation and infiltration rather than buried pipes and
human-made materials and facilities.
      (4)   Impervious surface coverage of lots must not exceed 25% of the lot
area.
      (5)   When constructed facilities are used for storm water management,
documentation must be provided by a qualified individual that they are designed
and installed consistent with the field office technical guide of the local
soil and water conservation districts.
      (6)   New constructed storm water outfalls to public waters must provide
for filtering or settling of suspended solids and skimming of surface debris
before discharge.
   (M)   Standards for commercial, industrial, public and semi-public uses.
      (1)   Surface water-oriented commercial uses and industrial, public or
semi-public uses with similar needs to have access to and use of public waters
may be located on parcels or lots with frontage on public waters. Those uses
with water-oriented needs must meet the following standards.
         (a)   In addition to meeting impervious coverage limits, setbacks and
other zoning standards in this chapter, the uses must be designed to
incorporate topographic and vegetative screening of parking areas and
structures.
         (b)   Uses that require short-term watercraft mooring for patrons must
centralize these facilities and design them to avoid obstructions of navigation
and to be the minimum size necessary to meet the need.
         (c)   Uses that depend on patrons arriving by watercraft may use signs
and lighting to convey needed information to the public, subject to the
provisions of §§
152.120 through
152.125 of this chapter and the following general standards.
            1.   No advertising signs or supporting facilities for signs may be
placed in or upon public waters. Signs conveying information or safety messages
may be placed in or on public waters by a public authority or under a permit
issued by the County Sheriff.
            2.   Signs may be placed, when necessary, within the Shore Impact
Zone if they are designed and sized to be the minimum necessary to convey
needed information. Signs must only convey the location and name of the
establishment and the general types of goods or services available. Signs shall
not be permitted for any other purpose, shall not be located higher than ten
feet above the ground, and shall not exceed 32 square feet in size. If
illuminated by artificial lights, the lights must be shielded or directed to
prevent illumination out across public waters.
            3.   Other outside lighting may be located within the Shore Impact
Zone or over public waters if it is used primarily to illuminate potential
safety hazards and is shielded or otherwise directed to prevent direct
illumination out across public waters. This does not preclude use of
navigational lights.
      (2)   Uses without water-oriented needs must be located on lots or

   (A)   General provisions.
      (1)   Purpose and authority. The city’s Airport Joint Airport Zoning
Board, created and established by joint action of the City Council and the
Board of Commissioners of the county and the Town Board of Spencer Township,
pursuant to the provisions and authority of M.S. § 360.063, as it may be
amended from time to time, hereby finds and declares that:
         (a)   An airport hazard endangers the lives and property of users of
the Aitkin Airport, and property or occupants of land in its vicinity; and also
if of the obstructive type, in effect reduces the size of the area available
for the landing, takeoff and maneuvering of aircraft, thus tending to destroy
or impair the utility of the airport and the public investment therein;
         (b)   The creation or establishment of an airport hazard is a public
nuisance and an injury to the region served by the Aitkin Airport;
         (c)   For the protection of the public health, safety, order,
convenience, prosperity and general welfare, and for the promotion of the most
appropriate use of land, it is necessary to prevent the creation or
establishment of airport hazards;
         (d)   The prevention of these airport hazards should be accomplished,
to the extent legally possible, by the exercise of the police power without
compensation;
         (e)   The prevention of the creation or establishment of airport
hazards, and the elimination, removal, alteration, mitigation or marking and
lighting of existing airport hazards are public purposes for which political
subdivisions may raise and expend public funds;
         (f)   The Aitkin Airport is an essential public facility that serves
an important public transportation role and provides a public good;
         (g)   This section establishes the Airport Zoning Overlay District to
“better manage significant areas with specific needs that cross Zoning District
Boundaries. All sites within an overlay district shall continue to bear their
original zoning, but shall also comply with the provisions of the overlay
district appended”. (Section 6.1.A). City ordinance recognizes that Overlay
(Airport Zoning) Maps are considered part of the official Zoning Map and all
land uses must comply with the provisions of the applicable overlay district;
         (h)   Section 21 of the Aitkin County Zoning Ordinance recognizes the
Airport Zoning Ordinance to “promote public health, safety, and general welfare
and to protect the lives and property of users of the Aitkin County Airports
and of the owners and occupants of land in their vicinities”. (Section 21.01);
         (i)   The county’s Comprehensive Land Use Plan recognizes the
importance of aviation industry to the community and recommends that the
county:
            1.   Support continued development and maintenance of the airport
system serving the county’s Airport Zoning Ordinance;
            2.   Work with each city or airport manager to assure plans are
developed to reserve space for future airport expansion; and
            3.   Assure that zoning districts surrounding existing airports are
compatible with airport use and expansion and have adequate space for
associated business development.
         (j)   This subchapter amends and replaces the city’s Airport Zoning
Ordinance adopted May, 1972.

   (B)   Rules and regulations.
      (1)   Air space obstruction zoning.
         (a)   Air space zones. In order to carry out the purpose of this
subchapter, as set forth above, the following air space zones are hereby
established: Primary Zone, Horizontal Zone, Conical Zone, Approach Zone,
Precision Instrument Approach Zone and Transitional Zone, and whose locations
and dimensions are as follows.
            1.   Primary Zone.
               a.   All that land which lies directly under an imaginary
primary surface longitudinally centered on a runway and:
                  i.   Runway 16-34: extends 200 feet beyond each end; and
                  ii.   Runway 8-26:
                     A.   Coincides with the 3,145-foot visual turf runway; and
                     B.   Three thousand seven hundred foot non-precision
bituminous runway: extends 200 feet beyond each end. The elevation of any point
on the primary surface is the same as the elevation of the nearest point on the
runway centerline.
               b.   The width of the primary surface is:
                  i.   One thousand feet for Runway 16-34; and
                  ii.   Five hundred fifty-six feet to accommodate the combined
surfaces of both the 3,145 foot visual turf runway and the 3,700 foot non-
precision bituminous runway.
            2.   Horizontal Zone. All that land which lies directly under an
imaginary horizontal surface 150 feet above the established airport elevation,
or a height of 1,356 feet above mean sea level, the perimeter of which is
constructed by swinging arcs of specified radii from the center of each end of
the primary surface of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by lines
tangent to those arcs. The radius of the horizontal surface arc is 10,000 feet
for Runway 16-34 which encompasses the arc of the crosswind runway.
            3.   Conical Zone. All that land which lies directly under an
imaginary conical surface extending upward and outward from the periphery of
the horizontal surface at a slope of 20:1 for a horizontal distance of 4,000
feet as measured outward from the periphery of the horizontal surface.
            4.   Approach Zone. All that land which lies directly under an
imaginary approach surface longitudinally centered on the extended centerline
at each end of a runway. The inner edge of the subchapter’s approach surface is
at the same width and elevation as, and coincides with, the end of the primary
surface. The approach surface inclines upward and outward at a slope of:
               a.   Twenty to one for the 3,145-foot visual turf runway: the
approach surface expands uniformly to a width of 1,250 feet at a distance of
5,000 feet, then continues at the same rate of divergence to the periphery of
the conical surface; and
               b.   Twenty to one for the 3,700 foot non-precision bituminous
runway: the approach surface expands uniformly to a width of 2,000 feet at a
distance of 5,000 feet, then continues at the same rate of divergence to the
periphery of the conical surface.
            5.   Precision Instrument Approach Zone. All that land which lies
directly under an imaginary precision instrument approach surface
longitudinally centered on the extended centerline at each end of Runway 16-34,
a precision instrument runway. The inner edge of the precision instrument
approach surface is at the same width and elevation as, and coincides with, the
end of the primary surface. The precision instrument approach surface inclines
upward and outward at a slope of 50:1 for a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet
expanding uniformly to a width of 4,000 feet, then continues upward and outward
for an additional horizontal distance of 40,000 feet at a slope of 40:1,
expanding uniformly to an ultimate width of 16,000 feet.
            6.   Transitional Zone. All that land which lies directly under an
imaginary surface extending upward and outward at right angles to the runway
centerline and centerline extended at a slope of 7:1 from the sides of the
primary surfaces and from the sides of the approach surfaces until they
intersect the horizontal surface or the conical surface. Transitional surfaces
for those portions of the precision instrument approach surface which project
through and beyond the limits of the conical surface, extend a distance of
5,000 feet measured horizontally from the edge of the precision instrument
approach surface and at right angles to the extended precision instrument
runway centerline.
         (b)   Height restrictions. Except as otherwise provided in this
subchapter, and except as necessary and incidental to airport operations, no
structure or tree shall be constructed, altered, maintained or allowed to grow
in any air space zone created in division (A) above so as to project above any
of the imaginary air space surfaces described in the division (A) above. Where
an area is covered by more than one height limitation, the more restrictive
limitation shall prevail.
         (c)   Boundary limitations. The air space obstruction height zoning
restrictions set forth in this section shall apply for a distance not to exceed
one and one-half miles beyond the perimeter of the airport boundary and in that
portion of an airport hazard area under the approach zone for a distance not
exceeding two miles from the airport boundary.
      (2)   Land use safety zoning.
         (a)   Safety zone boundaries. In order to carry out the purpose of
this subchapter, as set forth above, to restrict those uses which may be
hazardous to the operational safety of aircraft operating to and from the
Aitkin Airport and, furthermore, to limit population and building density in
the runway approach areas, thereby creating sufficient open space to protect
life and property in case of an accident, there are hereby created and
established the following land use safety zones.
            1.   Safety Zone A. All land in that portion of the approach zones
of a runway, as defined in § 153.15(A) of this subchapter, which extends
outward from the end of the primary surface a distance equal to two-thirds of
the planned length of the runway, which distance shall be:
               a.   Three thousand three hundred thirty-four feet for Runway
16-34;
               b.   Two thousand ninety-seven feet for the 3,145-foot visual
turf runway; and
               c.   Two thousand four hundred sixty-seven feet for the 3,700-
foot non-precision bituminous runway.
            2.   Safety Zone B. All land in that portion of the approach zones
of a runway, as defined in § 153.15(A) of this subchapter, which extends
outward from Safety Zone A a distance equal to one-third of the planned length
of the runway, which distance shall be:
               a.   One thousand six hundred sixty-six feet for Runway 16-34;
               b.   One thousand forty-eight feet for the 3,145-foot visual
turf runway; and
               c.   One thousand two hundred thirty-three feet for the 3,700-
foot non-precision bituminous runway.
            3.   Safety Zone C. All land which is enclosed within the perimeter
of the horizontal zone, as defined in § 153.15(A) of this subchapter, and which
is not included in Safety Zone A or Safety Zone B.
            4.   Exceptions established residential neighborhoods. There are no
areas designated as established residential neighborhoods in built up urban
areas based upon the status of development existing on 1-1-1978.
         (b)   Restrictions.
            1.   General. Subject at all times to the height restrictions set
forth in division (B)(1)(b), above, no use shall be made of any land in any of
the safety zones defined in division (B)(2)(a) above, which creates or causes
interference with the operations of radio or electronic facilities on the
airport or with radio or electronic communications between the airport and
aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights
and other lights, results in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport,
impairs visibility in the vicinity of the airport, or otherwise endangers the
landing, taking off or maneuvering of aircraft.
            2.   Zone A. Subject at all times to the height restrictions set
forth in division (B)(1)(b) above and to the general restrictions contained in
division (B)(2)(b)1. above, areas designated as Zone A shall contain no
buildings, temporary structures, exposed transmission lines or other similar
above-ground land use structural hazards, and shall be restricted to those uses
which will not create, attract or bring together an assembly of persons
thereon. Permitted uses may include, but are not limited to, such uses as
agriculture (seasonal crops), horticulture, animal husbandry, raising of
livestock, light outdoor recreation (non-spectator), cemeteries and automobile
parking without lighting or other above ground structures.
            3.   Zone B. Subject at all times to the height restrictions set
forth in division (B)(1)(b) above, and to the general restrictions contained in
division (B)(2)(b)1. above, areas designated as Zone B shall be restricted in
use as follows.
               a.   Each use shall be on a site whose area shall not be less
than three acres.
               b.   Each use shall not create, attract or bring together a site
population that would exceed 15 times that of the site acreage.
               c.   Each site shall have no more than one building plot upon
which any number of structures may be erected.
               d.   A building plot shall be a single, uniform and non-
contrived area, whose shape is uncomplicated and whose area shall not exceed
the following minimum ratios with respect to the total site area:
 
Site Area                       Ratio of
                                Building Site    Maximum Site   Population (15
At Least (acres) But Less Than  Area to Building Plot Area (sq. persons/acre)
                 (acres)        Plot Area        ft.)

3                               4                12:1           10,900
4                               6                10:1           17,400
6                               10               8:1            32,600
10                              20               6:1            72,500

assembly.
            4.   Zone C. Zone C is subject only to height restrictions set
forth in division (B)(1)(b) above and to the general restrictions contained in
division (B)(2)(b)1. above.
            5.   Exemptions; established residential neighborhoods. There are
no areas designated as established residential neighborhoods in built up urban
areas based upon the status of development existing on 1-1-1978.
         (c)   Boundary limitations. The land use zoning restrictions set forth
in this section shall apply for a distance not to exceed one mile beyond the
perimeter of the airport boundary and in that portion of an airport hazard area
under the approach zone for a distance not exceeding two miles from the airport
boundary.
         (d)   Boundary assurances. A certified survey prepared by a licensed
land surveyor shall be required to be submitted with a building/zoning permit
application for properties that are entirely or partially contained within Land
Use Safety Zones A and B, unless the Zoning Administrator determines the
proposed building site is clearly outside the safety zones. For any location
within the air space jurisdiction of this subchapter, the Zoning Administrator
may require a survey that shows the elevation of a proposed structure will
conform to the air space requirements of this subchapter.
      (3)   Airport map. The several zones herein established are shown in
Appendix B to this chapter, the exhibits are attached hereto and made a part
hereof, which, together with such amendments thereto as may from time to time
be made, and all notations, references, elevations, data, zone boundaries and
other information thereon, shall be and the same is hereby adopted as part of
this subchapter. Refer to the local land use authority for underlying land use
and zoning designations, as well as division (A)(4) above for guidance on
conflicts between regulations.
      (4)   Performance standards. To avoid the creation of a use that may have
adverse impacts on overhead flight or to persons or property on the ground, no
land use within the airport’s proximity, regardless whether permitted under the
applicable airport zoning regulations, can operate or perform in a way that
exceeds the following performance standard limits:
         (a)   Is tall enough to be hazardous to the navigation of aircraft,
including tall buildings, smokestacks, construction cranes, trees, cell towers
and wind energy conversion systems;
         (b)   May interfere with electronic navigation aids such as radar
facilities and instrument landing systems that provide for the safe movement of
aircraft. These aides may be located on-airport or off. Non-aviation electronic
sources placed near electronic navigation aids may cause interference.
Similarly, new structures may block the navigation aid signals. Both these
types of situations must be reviewed prior to the placement of the uses and
structures;
         (c)   May cause a visual distraction to pilots approaching the
airport. Distractions can occur from outdoor lights near an airport (e.g., high
mast lighting or stadium lighting), from highly reflective exterior building
materials or from water surfaces. Smoke or steam generated by nearby
businesses, industry or field burning can also create severe visual
difficulties for pilots. Activities that generate a lot of dust can cause
similar problems; and
         (d)   Is deemed to have the potential to create a wildlife hazard to
airport operations as determined by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA),
U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services (USFWS)
and Mn/DOT Aeronautics.
      (5)   Non-conforming uses. Regulations are not retroactive. The
regulations prescribed by this subchapter shall not be construed to require the
removal, lowering or other changes or alteration of any structure or tree not
conforming to the regulations as of the effective date of this subchapter, or
otherwise interfere with the continuance of any non-conforming use. Nothing
herein contained shall require any change in the construction, alteration or
intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was
begun prior to the effective date of this subchapter, and is diligently
prosecuted and completed within two years thereof.
      (6)   Hazard marking and lighting.
         (a)   Non-conforming uses. The owner of any non-conforming structure
or tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation and
maintenance thereon of the markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by
the Zoning Administrator, to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the
vicinity of the airport the presence of the airport hazards. The markers and
lights shall be installed, operated and maintained at the expense of the Aitkin
Airport Commission.
         (b)   Permits and variances. Any permit or variance deemed advisable
to effectuate the purpose of this subchapter and be reasonable in the
circumstances, and granted by the Zoning Administrator or Board, shall require
the owner of the structure or tree in question, at his or her own expense, to
install, operate and maintain thereon the markers and lights as may be
necessary to indicate to pilots the presence of an airport hazard.
   (C)   Administration and enforcement.
      (1)   Permits.
         (a)   Future uses. Except as specifically provided in divisions (C)(1)
(a)1. and (C)(1)(a)2. below, no material change shall be made in the use of
land and no structure shall be erected, altered or otherwise established in any
zone hereby created unless a permit therefore shall have been applied for and
granted by the Zoning Administrator, hereinafter, provided for. Each
application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is
desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to conform to the
regulations herein prescribed. If the determination is in the affirmative, the
permit shall be granted.
               1.   However, a permit for a tree or structure of less than 75
feet of vertical height above the ground shall not be required in the
horizontal and conical zones or in any approach and transitional zones beyond a
horizontal distance of 4,200 feet from each end of the runway, except when the
tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour or topographic features,
would extend the height or land use limit prescribed for the respective zone.
               2.   Nothing contained in this foregoing exception shall be
construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, alteration or
growth of any structure or tree in excess of any of the height limitations
established by this subchapter as set forth in division (B)(1)(b) above and the
land use limitations set forth in division (B)(2) above.
         (b)   Existing uses. Before any existing use or structure may be
replaced, substantially altered or repaired or rebuilt within any zone
established herein, a permit must be secured authorizing the replacement,
change or repair. No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment
or creation of an airport hazard or permit a non-conforming use, structure or
tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective
date of this subchapter or any amendments thereto, or than it is when the
application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for
such a permit shall be granted.
         (c)   Non-conforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the Zoning
Administrator determines that a non-conforming structure or tree has been
abandoned or more than 80% torn down, deteriorated or decayed, no permit shall
be granted that would allow the structure or tree to exceed the applicable
height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations. Whether
application is made for a permit under this division (C)(1)(c) or not, the
Zoning Administrator may order the owner of the abandoned or partially
destroyed non-conforming structure, at his or her own expense, to lower,
remove, reconstruct or equip the same in the manner necessary to conform to the
provisions of this subchapter. In the event the owner of the non-conforming
structure shall neglect or refuse to comply with the order for ten days after
receipt of written notice of the order, the Zoning Administrator may, by
appropriate legal action, proceed to have the abandoned or partially destroyed
non-conforming structure lowered, removed, reconstructed or equipped and assess
the cost and expense thereof against the land on which the structure is or was
located. Unless such an assessment is paid within 90 days from the service of
notice thereof on the owner of the land, the sum shall bear interest at the
rate of 8% per annum from the date the cost and expense is incurred until paid,
and shall be collected in the same manner as are general taxes.

URBAN RESIDENTIAL PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD)
§ 152.070 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to maximize the use of developable land
with the provision of urban services, to protect and preserve the natural
environment and to take full advantage of the existing urban infrastructure by
promoting infill development. The city encourages and promotes the efficient
use of land, flexibility in design and new development concepts. The design of
these developments should provide a quality of life equal to or greater than
that provided in developments built under the standard zoning codes, be
aesthetically pleasing, provide for more efficient land use and reduce the
impact of development on the natural environment and surrounding neighborhood.
(Ord. 332, passed 5-19-2008)
§ 152.071 GENERAL.
   (A)   Urban planned unit development (U-PUD). An urban planned unit
development requires the assistance of professional planning and usually
involves the approval of multiple agencies or other governmental bodies. Where
circumstances are favorable, U-PUDs provide more latitude in land use than
normal development in order to allow for planning, clustering facilities and
consolidating green spaces and internal recreation amenities. While greater
flexibility is allowed in these types of development than what is required in
the underlying zoning district, they must be justified by the significant
improvements and design features beneficial to the residents, neighbors and the
general public. These benefits may include open space protection, provision of
affordable or lifecycle housing, and re-development of blighted areas.
   (B)   Mixed use PUDs. Mixed uses may be allowed where appropriate; provided
that, the use not normally allowed in the underlying zoning district does not
exceed 15% of the building floor area.
   (C)   Zoning provision. Provisions of each zoning district shall govern
within that district, except where addressed by this section.
   (D)   Density. A plan may provide for a greater number of dwelling units
than would otherwise be permitted by the regulations otherwise applicable to
the site; however, the applicant has the burden to show that the excess will
not have an adverse effect on existing public facilities and on the reasonable
enjoyment of neighboring property. Further the Planning Commission and City
Council, in determining the reasonableness of the increase in the authorized
dwelling units density, shall recognize that increased density may be
compensated for additional measures that serve the public interest, which may
be achieved by the inclusion of: the location, amount and proposed use of
common open space; the location, design and type of dwelling units (energy
efficiency, life-cycle housing, affordability); and the physical
characteristics of the site.
   (E)   All PUDs in shoreland must comply with Minn. Rules, part 6120.3800.
The DNR must review and approve all PUDs according to referenced rule.
(Ord. 332, passed 5-19-2008; Ord. 394, passed 8-5-2019)
§ 152.072 DESIGN CRITERIA.
   All U-PUDs shall abide by the following design criteria.
   (A)   Minimum size. A U-PUD shall contain a minimum of three units or sites.
   (B)   Minimum development size. The development shall be placed on property
consisting of one or more parcels that together meet the minimum lot size for
the underlying zoning district, as a minimum.
   (C)   Urban services. All U-PUDs shall have access to, and shall be required
to connect to, available urban service utilities for the provision of sewer and
water. All proposed developments must be adjacent to existing infrastructure
for urban services, or be within an area identified for urban service extension
in the city’s Capital Improvement Plan within the next two years.
   (D)   Setbacks. Setbacks from the exterior boundary of the site shall be the
same as those required in the underlying district. Side setback requirements
shall be waived to allow flexibility in design, but the following shall apply.
      (1)   Individual buildings shall be separated by a minimum of ten feet.
      (2)   The Planning Commission may establish setbacks, as necessary, to
buffer agriculture, forestry and water-use activities from residential uses.
   (E)   Parking. One and one-half spaces per unit are required as a minimum,
unless modified by the conditional use permit, with evidence to support the
modification.
   (F)   Storm water management.
      (1)   All PUDs must develop and maintain a storm water management plan
indefinitely.
      (2)   Capacities of existing drainage ways shall be maintained and shall
not be adversely impacted by the development.
      (3)   Unless specifically allowed by the city, inlets and outlets to
adjacent parcels shall be maintained. Flows from outlets shall be maintained
unless allowed by the city.
      (4)   All PUDs shall contain the ten-year, 24-hour storm event within the
development.
      (5)   Runoff from the parcel shall not be concentrated unless part of a
city storm water management plan.
(Ord. 332, passed 5-19-2008)
§ 152.073 DENSITY CALCULATIONS.
   The overall density of the development shall not exceed the density limits
established herein.
   (A)   (1)   The density shall be computed by dividing the total number of
dwelling units by the acreage of the project, including land dedicated to the
public. Fractional portions of the final answer, after bonus point
calculations, shall not apply towards the total density.
      (2)   Base density shall be determined by the density of the zoning
district the proposed development is located within.
   (B)   All developments with a density of five units or greater shall be
required to provide a minimum of 5% of the total lot area in open space that is
not subject to bonus point calculations. Open space shall be optional for all
developments of less than five units.
   (C)   The permitted base density may be increased by the percentage gained
through bonus points.
   (D)   Density bonuses may be awarded based on, but not limited to,
percentage of open space, amount of park dedication, building materials,
sidewalks and trails, landscaping, screening, assisted living facilities,
amenities, housing affordability, and other considerations that may be
determined by the city.
   (E)   The specific density bonus shall be determined by the use of the
city’s bonus calculator, adopted herein by reference, dated August 1, 2019, and
any subsequent updates.
(Ord. 332, passed 5-19-2008; Ord. 395, passed 9-3-2019)
§ 152.074 PUD COMMON FACILITIES; OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   In the event that certain land areas or structures are provided within
the PUD for private recreational use or as service facilities, the owner of the
land and buildings shall enter into an agreement with the city to assure the
continued operation and maintenance to predetermined reasonable standards.
   (B)   Common areas may be placed under the ownership of one of the
following:
      (1)   Dedicated to the public where a community-wide use would be
anticipated;
      (2)   Landlord control; or
      (3)   Homeowner’s association; provided, all of the following conditions
are met.
         (a)   The homeowner’s association must be established prior to any
sale.
         (b)   Membership must be mandatory for each owner and any successive
buyer.
         (c)   The open space restrictions must be permanent, not for a given
period of years.
         (d)   The association must be responsible for liability insurance,
local taxes and the maintenance of residential and other facilities.
         (e)   Landowners must pay their pro rata share of the cost and the
assessment levied by the association that can become a lien on the property in
accordance with state statutes.
         (f)   The association must be able to adjust the assessment to meet
changed needs.
(Ord. 332, passed 5-19-2008)
§ 152.075 COVENANTS, EASEMENTS AND RESTRICTIONS.
   The final plan shall contain such proposed covenants, easements and other
provisions relating to the bulk, location and density of such residential
units, non-residential uses and public facilities as are necessary for the
welfare of the PUD and are consistent with the best interests of the entire
city. All or any covenants, easements and other provisions which are part of
the final plan, may be modified, enforced, removed or released as deemed
necessary by the City Council for the preservation of the public health,
safety, morals and general welfare of all city residents.
(Ord. 332, passed 5-19-2008)
GENERAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
§ 152.090 WATER QUALITY PROTECTION STANDARDS.
   (A)   Erosion and drainage.

safety hazard in the opinion of the Zoning Administrator.
   (C)   Location and orientation. Fences shall sit on the property of the
property owner installing the fence; fences may abut, but not sit directly on
side lot lines of adjacent parcels. The “good side” of the fence shall face
abutting properties, meaning that the posts shall face in toward the property
on which the fence sits and the finished face of the fence shall face abutting
properties. If the fence is within two feet of a property line, the adjoining
property owner abutting the fence is allowed to finish the side of the fence
facing his or her property.
   (D)   Maintenance. Fences shall be maintained to retain their aesthetic
quality, screening abilities and function. Missing boards, rusting wire and

§ 152.097 DRAINAGE.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   When possible, existing natural drainage ways, wetlands and
vegetated soil surfaces must be used to convey, store, filter and retain storm
water runoff before discharge to public waters.
      (2)   Development must be planned and conducted in a manner that will
minimize the extent of disturbed areas, runoff velocities, erosion potential
and reduce and delay runoff volumes. Disturbed areas must be stabilized and
protected as soon as possible and facilities and methods used to retain
sediment on the site.
      (3)   When development density, topographic features and soil and
vegetation conditions are not sufficient to adequately handle storm water
runoff using natural features and vegetation, various types of constructed
facilities such as diversions, settling basins, skimming devices, dikes,
waterways and ponds must be used. Preference must be given to designs using
surface drainage, vegetation and infiltration rather than buried pipes and
human-made materials and facilities.
   (B)   Drainage plan(s). All development shall contain provisions for
adequate surface or subsurface runoff of storm water and snow melt directed to
natural drainageways. A storm frequency of a five-year, 24-hour storm period
shall be provided for with no structural flooding or ponding.
   (C)   Natural drainage. All development shall provide for the continuance of
natural drainageways, and structures shall be so constructed as to be one foot
above the water level in the drainageway created by a storm of a 100-year
return period or a 1% chance of occurrence.
   (D)   Drainage structures. All drainage structures provided shall be
sufficient in size to pass a five-year, 24-hour storm to a natural drainageway
and to pass a 100-year, 24-hour storm along a drainage way.
   (E)   Drainage storage areas. The use of natural or human-made storm water
storage areas is encouraged. These areas should be vegetated and designed to
naturally lower after a storm.
   (F)   Filling. No filling of areas inundated by the 100-year, 24-hour storm
along drainageways shall be allowed, except by conditional use permit.
   (G)   Impervious areas. All parking areas, heavy use areas, storage areas
and impervious areas shall be designed to allow entrapment of silts and
nutrients prior to discharge to a natural drainage way or public water.
   (H)   Public waters. Newly constructed storm water outfalls to public waters
must provide for filtering or settling of suspended solids and skimming or
surface debris before discharge.
   (I)   Erosion. Erosion control measures shall be provided in all areas
disturbed during any grading or construction. All areas disturbed shall be
covered with topsoils and seeded. Areas subject to concentrated runoff or
steeper than three to one shall be sodded, planted with appropriate deep-rooted
vegetation or protected with an appropriate mulch cover as directed by the City
Engineer.
(Ord. 332, passed 5-19-2008) Penalty, see §
152.999
§ 152.098 GRADING.
   (A)   General. The following activities must be authorized by permit, except
for excavation for permitted structure, drives, sewer systems and parking
areas:
      (1)   Grading and filling disturbing an area greater than one acre;
      (2)   Grading and filling in the Shore Impact Zone; and
      (3)   Any alterations of the natural topography when the slope of the
land is toward a public water or watercourse involving the movement of more
than ten cubic yards of material in a bluff or Shore Impact Zone or more than
50 cubic yards of material anywhere else within a shoreland area.
   (B)   Conditions. The following conditions shall apply.
      (1)   The smallest amount of bare ground is exposed for as short a time
as feasible.
      (2)   Four inches of topsoil is placed, temporary ground cover such as
mulch is used and permanent ground cover such as sod is planted.
      (3)   Methods to prevent erosion and trap sediment are employed.
      (4)   Fill is stabilized to acceptable engineering standards and must not
create an unstable slope.
      (5)   Plans to place fill or excavated material on steep slopes must be
reviewed by a qualified professional for continued slope stability and must not
create finished slopes of 30% or greater.
      (6)   Fill or excavated material must not be placed in bluff impact
zones.
      (7)   Fill placed in a public water below the ordinary high water mark
requires a DNR waters permit and a Corps of Engineers permit.
      (8)   Excavation in the bed of public waters requires a DNR waters permit
and a Corps of Engineers permit.
      (9)   Only clean fill consisting of sand, gravel or rock will be allowed
where contact with water is anticipated. Mineral soil may be allowed elsewhere.
      (10)   Alterations to topography must only be allowed if they are
accessory to permitted or conditional uses and do not adversely affect adjacent
or nearby properties.
      (11)   When applicable, the above conditions shall be consistent with
those provided within this division (B), in addition to those required by
Mississippi Headwaters Board, the state’s DNR and the Army Corps of Engineers.
   (C)   Wetlands. Grading or filling in any protected wetland is prohibited
unless authorized by federal, state, county and local permitting agencies.
   (D)   Public waters. Connections to public waters of boat slips, canals,
lagoons, harbors and similar inland excavations are prohibited.
   (E)   Riprap. The city encourages the use of riprap only as a last resort to
control shoreline erosion. Other methods should be used, including the planting
of native, deep rooted vegetation. If riprap has been found to be the only tool
available, riprap installation shall have the following standards.
      (1)   Gradation. A well-graded mixture of rock sizes should be used
instead of one uniform size.
      (2)   Quality of stone. Riprap must be durable so that freeze/thaw cycles
do not decompose it in a shore time; most igneous stones such as granite have
suitable durability.
      (3)   Riprap depth. The thickness of riprap layers should be at least two
times the maximum stone diameter.
      (4)   Vegetation.
         (a)   Existing vegetation on the shoreline and in the water should be
maintained without disturbance.
         (b)   All bare soil on the slope above the riprap should be stabilized
with seed and mulch, or sod.
         (c)   Wooded, deep rooted vegetation should be planted among the
riprap to help stabilize and create wildlife habitat.
      (5)   Filter material. Filter material is usually required between riprap
and the underlying soil surface to prevent soil from moving through the riprap;
a filter cloth material or a layer of gravel is usually used for the filter.
         (a)   Leaching protection. Leaching can be controlled by installing a
riprap gradation small enough to act as a filter against the channel base
material, or a protective filter can be installed between the riprap and the
base material.
         (b)   Riprap limits. The riprap should extend for a maximum flow
depth, or to a point where vegetation will be satisfactory to control erosion.
         (c)   Curves. Riprap should extend to five times the bottom width
upstream and downstream of the beginning and ending of the curve as well as the
entire curved section.
         (d)   Riprap size. The size of riprap to be installed depends on site-
specific conditions.
         (e)   Riprap prohibitions. Slopes on which riprap is used to stabilize
shorelines shall be no steeper than two to one.
      (6)   Maintenance. Inspections should be made of all sites immediately
after the first rainfall following installation of riprap. This is particularly
important in areas where riprap that is displaced during the storm would impact
culverts. Thereafter, riprapped sites should be checked following large storms,
especially those which are near or exceed the storm frequency used in the
design. Displaced riprap should be removed from its downstream location and new
riprap placed according to the specifications above.

SIGNS
§ 152.120 FINDINGS, PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   Findings. The city hereby finds as follows:
      (1)   Exterior signs have a substantial impact on the character and
quality of the environment;
      (2)   Signs provide an important medium through which individuals may
convey a variety of messages; and
      (3)   Signs can create traffic hazards, aesthetic concerns and detriments
to property values, thereby threatening the public health, safety and welfare.
   (B)   Purpose and intent. It is not the purpose or intent of these sign
standards to regulate the message displayed on any sign; nor is it the purpose
or intent of this chapter to regulate any building design or any display not
defined as a sign, or any sign which cannot be viewed from the outside of a
building. The purpose and intent of this subchapter is to:
      (1)   Regulate the number, location, size, type, illumination and other
physical characteristics of signs within the city in order to protect and
promote the public health, safety and welfare;
      (2)   Maintain, enhance and improve the aesthetic environment of the city
by preventing visual clutter that is harmful to the appearance of the
community;
      (3)   Improve the visual appearance of the city while providing for
effective means of communication, consistent with constitutional guarantees and
the city’s goals of public safety and aesthetics; and
      (4)   Provide for fair and consistent enforcement of the sign regulations
set forth herein under the zoning authority of the city.

chapter;
         (b)   Engaged in the use of alcoholic beverages while on the adult-

gambling by any person on the adult-oriented business premises; and/or
         (c)   Demonstrated the inability to operate or manage an adult-
oriented business in a peaceful and law-abiding manner, thus necessitating
action by law enforcement officers.

notice to the licensee and before a hearing. The notice shall give at least
ten-days’ notice of the time and place of the hearing and shall state the
nature of the charges against the licensee. The notice may be served upon the
licensee personally, or by leaving the same at the licensee’s business premises
with the person in charge thereof.

      (1)   Suspended licenses. The city may revoke a license if a cause of
suspension in division (F) above occurs and the license has been suspended
within the preceding 12 months.

determines that:
         (a)   A licensee gave false or misleading information in the material
submitted to the city during the application process;
         (b)   A licensee or an employee knowingly allowed possession, use or
sale of controlled substances on the premises;

herein.
      (3)   Appeals. The fact that conviction is being appealed shall have no
effect on the revocation of the license.
      (4)   Granting a license after revocation. When the city revokes a
license, the revocation shall continue for one year, and the licensee shall not
be issued an adult-oriented business license for one year from the date that
the revocation became effective. If, subsequent to revocation, the city finds
that the basis for revocation has been corrected or abated, the applicant may
be granted a license if at least 90 days have elapsed since the date the

(e) above, an applicant may not be granted another license until the
appropriate number of years required under division (A)(3) above have elapsed.

objections are raised, the Zoning Administrator shall prepare a resolution of
approval outlining the conditions and stipulations of the renewal for
consideration by the City Council. Council, at its discretion, may approve or

hearing to the DNR, if the proposed variance is in shoreland or floodplain.
   (D)   The applicant shall complete the variance application approved by the
Board of Adjustment. The application shall contain submittal requirements,
criteria for approval, procedure for consideration and city contact
information. The city shall not accept applications where the applicant has
past due fees or charges due to the city until the account is made current.
   (E)   Variances shall only be permitted:
      (1)   When they are in harmony with the general purposes and intent of
the ordinance; and
      (2)   When the variances are consistent with the Comprehensive Plan.
   (F)   Variances may be granted when the applicant for the variance
establishes that there are “practical difficulties” in complying with the
zoning ordinance:
      (1)   PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES, as used in connection with the granting of
a variance, means that:
         (a)   The property owner proposes to use the property in a reasonable
manner not permitted by this chapter;
         (b)   The plight of the property owner is due to circumstances unique
to the property and not created by the owner; and
         (c)   The variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character
of the locality.

not allowed under the zoning ordinance for property in the zone where the
property owner’s land is located with the following exception: the Board of
Adjustment may permit, as a variance, the temporary use of a single-family
dwelling as a two-family dwelling.
   (I)   The Board of Adjustment may impose conditions in the granting of
variances; provided, all conditions are directly related to the variance
request, and each condition bears a rough proportionality to the impact created
by the variance.
   (J)   When costs to the city involved in processing and reviewing an
application exceed the original application fees, the applicant shall reimburse
the city for any additional costs. The expenses may include, but are not
limited to, payroll, mailing costs, consultant fees and other professional
services the city may need to retain in reviewing permits or applications.
   (K)   No variance application shall be accepted by the Zoning Administrator
from a contractor or property owner having outstanding violations. Variances
can only be requested by contractors or property owners with outstanding
violations upon resolution of the violation to the satisfaction of the Planning
Commission.

for a property located within the floodplain, until the applicant demonstrates
that all required state and federal permits have been obtained. The applicant
shall submit a copy of all required state and federal permits to the Zoning
Administrator concurrently with the required variance application form, fee and
all other required application materials.
   (M)   No variance shall permit a lower degree of flood protection than
required under state law. The following additional variance criteria of the
Federal Emergency Management Agency must be satisfied for all properties
located within floodplain which are the subject of a variance considered under
this section.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued if any increase in flood levels
during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued if it is determined by the Board of
Adjustment that the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood
heights.
      (3)   Variances shall be issued only upon the determination by the Board
of Adjustment that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood
hazard, to afford relief.
   (N)   The Zoning Administrator must notify the applicant for a variance
that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to
amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and
      (2)   The construction below the base or regional flood level increases
risks to life and property. The notification must be maintained with a record
of all variance actions.
   (O)   Failure by the owner to act within 12 months on a variance unless
extended by the Board of Adjustment shall void the variance. A second extension
shall require a new public hearing. This provision shall apply to any variance
outstanding at the time of the ordinance adoption.
   (P)   A variance application which has been denied shall not be submitted,
in an exact or substantially similar form, for at least 12 months from the date
of denial.
   (Q)   Violations of the conditions of a variance shall void the variance.

Building Official and Zoning Administrator to assure compatibility with
surrounding uses and ensure adequate safety devices are installed to mitigate
the potential for unplanned issues or incompatible land uses. Any comment or
concern shall be forwarded to the Zoning Administrator within ten days. The
Zoning Administrator will work with the building permit applicant to see the
safety concern mitigated and incompatible land use abated.
   (C)   Where a proposed use requires action of the Board of Adjustment,
Planning Commission or Council or posting of financial security, the action
shall occur and the conditional use permit, variance, zoning district change,
final plat plan approval, or minor subdivision approval shall be issued or

due fees or charges due to the city or the county until the account is made
current.

good cause. A second extension shall be decided by the Planning Commission.
   (J)   Granting of a building permit or zoning permit shall occur when all
requirements of the ordinance have been met, but shall not be considered a
statement of compliance with regional, state or federal codes, statutes or laws
or approval of the design of the structure or accessories or description of the
property. Subsequent actions of the Zoning Administrator shall not be
considered acceptance of structural components or workmanship, but rather shall
be for the purpose of determining general compliance with the ordinance.
   (K)   If the Zoning Administrator determines that any violation of a permit
or other section of the ordinance has occurred, the permit shall become null
and void. Any violation of a building permit or provision of a Building Code
adopted and administered by the city shall be subject to the proper enforcement
procedures under the Building Code or other provision of law, statute or rule
governing the administration and enforcement of the Building Code and this
chapter.
   (L)   A building permit or zoning permit application shall include, in
