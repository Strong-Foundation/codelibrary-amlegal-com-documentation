to time, the City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer shall have the authority to
administer and enforce this code.

designated within the code or by the Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer or City
Council shall have the authority to administer and enforce the provisions
specified. All and any person or persons designated may issue a citation in

   (C)   The City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer and any city official or
employee designated by this code who has the responsibility to perform a duty

premises, inspect or otherwise enter any property to enforce compliance with
this code.
   (D)   (1)   If the licensee, owner, resident or other person in control of a
premises objects to the inspection of or entrance to the property, the City
Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer, peace officer or any employee or official
charged with the duty of enforcing the provisions of this code may, upon a
showing that probable cause exists for the issuance of a valid search warrant
from a court of competent jurisdiction, petition and obtain a search warrant
before conducting the inspection or otherwise entering the property.
      (2)   This warrant shall be only to determine whether the provisions of
this code enacted to protect the health, safety and welfare of the people are
being complied with and to enforce these provisions only, and no criminal
charges shall be made as a result of the warrant.

the people are being complied with and to enforce these provisions.
      (2)   Unreasonable refusal to permit the inspection of or entrance to the
property shall be grounds for termination of any and all permits, licenses or
city service to the property. Mailed notice shall be given to the licensee,
owner, resident or other person in control of the property, stating the grounds
for the termination, and the licensee, owner, resident or other person in
control of the property shall be given an opportunity to appear before the City
Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer to object to the termination before it occurs,

Council at a regularly scheduled or special meeting.
   (F)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of
the city to enter private property in urgent emergency situations where there
is an imminent danger in order to protect the public health, safety and
welfare.
ADMINISTRATIVE CITATIONS
§ 10.35 PURPOSE.
   The City Council finds that there is a need for additional alternative
methods of enforcing the city code. While criminal fines and penalties have
been the most frequent enforcement mechanism, the administrative enforcement of
the city code will increase compliance with the code, will encourage citizens
to become more receptive to enforcement efforts, will be more informal and
cost-effective, and will keep many violations out of the criminal court system.
Accordingly, the City Council finds that the use of administrative citations is
a legitimate alternative method of enforcement of the city code that is also an
effective way to promote the health, safety and welfare of the citizens. This
method of enforcement shall be in addition to and not exclusive of any other
legal remedy, including, without limitation, the filing of criminal charges or
other civil remedies for city code violations.
(Prior Code, § 117.01) (Ord. 20200415-01, passed 4-15-2020)
§ 10.36 DEFINITION.
   ADMINISTRATIVE OFFENSE means any violation of a provision of the city code
or any violation of a condition or requirement of a city-issued permit or
license, and such violations may be subject to the administrative citation
process set forth herein. Each day a violation exists constitutes a separate
administrative offense.
(Prior Code, § 117.03) (Ord. 20200415-01, passed 4-15-2020)
§ 10.37 PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Authority to issue notices.
      (1)   The following representatives of the city shall have the authority
to issue notices for city code administrative offenses:
         (a)   Fire Chief;
         (b)   Assistant Fire Chief;
         (c)   Building Official;
         (d)   Safety/Rental Inspector;
         (e)   City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer; or
         (f)   Deputy Clerk.
      (2)   All notices and citations will be administered through the City
Administrator/Clerk- Treasurer’s office to ensure proper tracking and record
keeping activities are in place.
   (B)   Administrative notice.
      (1)   Upon determining that an administrative offense has occurred, the
city may issue an administrative notice to the violator, either in person or by
regular mail. In the case of a vehicular violation, the administrative notice
may be attached to the vehicle. The notice will state the date, time and nature
of the administrative offense, the action necessary to remedy the
administrative offense and the name of the official issuing the notice.
      (2)   If the violator is making a good faith attempt to remedy the
administrative offense, the city may grant an extension, the length of which
must be agreed upon in writing between the city and the violator.
   (C)   Administrative citation. If the violator fails to correct the
administrative offense within the time period provided in an administrative
notice, the representative listed in division (B)(1) above may issue an
administrative citation. The citation must be issued to the violator in person
or by regular mail. In the case of a vehicular violation, the citation may be
attached to the vehicle. The citation must state the date, time and nature of
the administrative offense, the action necessary to remedy the administrative
offense, the name of the representative issuing the citation, the amount of the
scheduled fine and the manner for paying the fine.
(Prior Code, § 117.05) (Ord. 20200415-01, passed 4-15-2020)
§ 10.38 PAYMENT.
   (A)   Amount. The amount payable for administrative citations shall be
established by §
36.02 of this code of ordinances, as adopted by the City Council. In the event
that a violator is issued a subsequent administrative citation for the same or
substantially similar offense within a 12-month period, the subsequent fee
shall be increased by 50% above the previously charged fee.
   (B)   Effect of payment. Payment of an administrative citation to the city
within ten days of the notice will preclude the city from bringing criminal
charges for the specific violation cited, but will not act to prevent or affect
criminal or petty misdemeanor charges that may result from any ongoing conduct
of the violator, including any and all city code violations that occur after
the issuance of the original administrative citation.
   (C)   Failure to pay.
      (1)   If the violator fails to pay the fee for the violation in the
amount of time specified in the administrative citation, the city may suspend
or revoke any city-issued license that is associated with the administrative
offense and charge the violator criminally for the cited offense. Additionally,
any unpaid fee shall constitute:
         (a)   A lien upon the real property upon which the violation occurred
if the property or improvements on the property was the subject of the
violation and the property owner was found responsible for that violation; or
         (b)   A personal obligation of the violator in all other situations.
      (2)   A lien may be assessed against the property and collected in the
same manner as taxes. A lien may be collected as a special charge, as
authorized by M.S. §§ 366.011 and 366.012, as well as M.S. § 415.01, subd. 2,
as they may be amended from time to time. A personal obligation may be
collected by any appropriate legal means.
(Prior Code, § 117.07) (Ord. 20200415-01, passed 4-15-2020)
§ 10.39 CONTESTING ADMINISTRATIVE CITATIONS.
   (A)   Any person issued an administrative citation under this subchapter
shall have the right to appeal the citation by filing a written notice of
appeal with the City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer within seven days of the
date of the citation. Upon receipt of the written notice, the City
Administrator/Clerk- Treasurer shall schedule the appeal hearing before the
City Council within 30 days from the date of the notice.
   (B)   The appeal will be heard by the City Council. At the hearing, the
parties will have an opportunity to present testimony and documentary evidence
and question witnesses, but strict compliance with Minnesota Rules of Evidence
will not be required. The City Council may impose limitations on the scope of
evidence to be allowed, as well as time limits which may apply to the appeal
hearings, and any other substantive or procedural elements which the City
Council deems appropriate.
   (C)   The City Council shall issue its findings of fact and conclusions, in
writing, within 30 days following the hearing. The City Council, upon finding
that an administrative citation was justified, may uphold the citation as
issued, or may amend the penalties pursuant to those available in §
36.02 of this code of ordinances. If the City Council finds that the
administrative citation was not justified, it may overturn the citation and
take any other action it deems reasonably necessary.
   (D)   (1)   The city may suspend or revoke a city-issued license, permit or
other approval associated with the violation, subject to any applicable
procedural requirements contained in the city code. Suspension or revocation of
a license, permit or other approval is authorized regardless of whether
additional penalties (such as administrative fines) are imposed for the
violation.
      (2)   A hearing on appeal of a citation will meet any hearing requirement
for the suspension or revocation of the license, permit or other approval as
long as notice of the hearing includes notice that suspension or revocation
will also be considered and no additional hearing will be required.
   (E)   Failure to attend the appeal hearing constitutes a waiver of the
violator’s rights to a hearing and an admission of the violation. The City
Council may waive this result upon a showing of good cause. Examples of “good
cause” are: death or incapacitating illness of the accused; a court order
requiring the accused to appear for another hearing at the same time; and lack
of proper service of the citation or notice of the hearing. “Good cause” does
not include forgetfulness and intentional delay.
   (F)   An aggrieved party may obtain judicial review of the decision of the
City Council according to any applicable law.
(Prior Code, § 117.09) (Ord. 20200415-01, passed 4-15-2020)
§ 10.40 DISPOSITION OF PENALTIES.
   All penalties collected pursuant to this subchapter shall be paid to the
city and deposited into the city’s General Fund.
(Prior Code, § 117.11) (Ord. 20200415-01, passed 4-15-2020)
§ 10.41 PENALTIES CUMULATIVE.
   Nothing in this subchapter shall prevent the city from taking such other
actions as are permitted under law, and the penalties provided herein shall be
cumulative.
(Prior Code, § 117.13) (Ord. 20200415-01, passed 4-15-2020)
§ 10.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person, firm or corporation who violates any provision of this
code for which another penalty is not specifically provided, shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor. The penalty which may be imposed for
any crime which is a misdemeanor under this code, including Minnesota Statutes
specifically adopted by reference, shall be a sentence of not more than 90
days, or a fine of not more than $1,000, or both.
   (B)   Any person, firm or corporation who violates any provision of this
code, including Minnesota Statutes specifically adopted by reference, which is
designated to be a petty misdemeanor shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a
petty misdemeanor. The penalty which may be imposed for any petty offense which
is a petty misdemeanor shall be a sentence of a fine of not more than $300.
   (C)   Pursuant to M.S. § 631.48, as it may be amended from time to time, in
either the case of a misdemeanor or a petty misdemeanor, the costs of
prosecution may be added. A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon
each day during which a violation occurs or continues.
   (D) The failure of any officer or employee of the city to perform any
official duty imposed by this code shall not subject the officer or employee to
the penalty imposed for a violation.
   (E)   In addition to any penalties provided for in this section, if any
person, firm or corporation fails to comply with any provision of this code,
the City Council or any city official designated by it may institute
appropriate proceedings at law or at equity to restrain, correct or abate the
violation.
(Prior Code, § 115.09)
APPENDIX A: NOTICE OF CODE VIOLATION
 
To:      (Name and address of person who is alleged to have violated the code)
From:   (Name and title of city official giving the notice)
Re:      Alleged violation of Section of the City Code, relating to (give title of section)
 
 
Date: (Date of notice)
 
I hereby allege that on (date of violation) you violated §                  of the City Code relating to                                                                                                                                      .
 
The City Council has by resolution established an administrative penalty in the amount of $         for this violation.
 
Payment of this administrative penalty is voluntary, but if you do not pay it the city may initiate criminal proceedings for this alleged violation.
 
Payment is due within 14 days of the date of this notice. Before the due date, you may request an additional 14-day extension of the time to pay the administrative penalty.
 
As an alternative to the payment of this administrative penalty, if the situation that gave rise to this alleged violation is corrected by                         (establish date), then the payment of the administrative penalty will be waived.
 
Even if the administrative penalty is paid, the city reserves the right to institute appropriate proceedings at law or at equity to restrain, correct or abate the violation.
 
Before the due date, you may request to appear before the City Council to contest the request for payment of the penalty. After a hearing before the Council, the Council may determine to withdraw the request for payment or to renew the request for payment. Because the
payment of the administrative penalty is voluntary, there shall be no appeal from the decision of the Council.
 
If you pay the administrative penalty, the city will not initiate criminal proceedings for this alleged violation. However, the Council, or any city official designated by it, may institute appropriate proceedings at law or at equity to restrain, correct or abate the
violation.
 
Payment of the administrative penalty may be made by check, cash or money order to the City Treasurer.

acceptable alternatives will be required to contract and pay for collection
from a commercial hauler. Generators wishing to appeal a decision of the City
Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer regarding alternative disposal methods may do so
within 30 days of notice of the City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer’s decision
by giving written notice to the city of the generator’s appeal. The appeal
shall be made to the City Council and shall be accompanied by additional
information as the generator believes will allow the City Council to determine
whether the alternative disposal method proposed by the generator is
environmentally adequate and likely to be implemented. The Council may
condition its approval of alternative disposal methods in a manner, including
requiring the production of written contracts or financial guarantees, as the
Council may determine to be needed to ensure compliance with this chapter.

to insure the safekeeping and proper maintenance of the meter only, and for no
other purpose. The fee is set by §
36.02 of this code of ordinances. The fee stands to the credit of the property
where the meter is installed, rather than to the credit of the owner of the
property at the time of the original fee payment. The water meter fee is non-
refundable.
   (C)   (1)   The city will maintain and repair all meters when rendered
unserviceable through ordinary wear and tear and replace them if necessary.
      (2)   However, where replacement, repair or adjustment of any meter is

freeze-ups or carelessness of the owner or occupant of any premises, the
expense caused the city thereby will be charged against and collected from the
water customer.
   (D)   A consumer may, by written request, have a meter (up to one inch)
tested by the Water Department; at which time, the owner may be present or have
a representative present. If the meter is found to register within 2% of being
correct, a charge will be made for making the test. If the meter is found 2%
incorrectly, no charge will be made for making the test. If the meter is found
to over-register more than 2%, there will be a proportional deduction made from
the previous water bill. A water meter will be considered to register
satisfactorily when it registers within 2% of accuracy. The charges for meter
testing are set by §
36.02 of this code of ordinances.
   (E)   Except for additional or auxiliary meters, water meters are the
property of the city.
   (F)   Authorized city employees have free access at reasonable hours to all
parts of every building and premises connected with the water system for
reading, inspection and repair of meters. Failure to provide access may result
in one or more of the following actions:
      (1)   Imposition, along with and in addition to other charges for
service, a quarterly penalty charged as established by §
36.02 of this code of ordinances;
      (2)   Termination of service to the premises; and
      (3)   Billing and collecting for service to the premises on an estimated
consumption basis whether or not meter readings are being obtained.
   (G)   Commercial or industrial buildings must be metered with one master
meter of adequate size, as approved by the Superintendent. If additional or
auxiliary meters are desired for recording the subdivision of the supply, the
meters must be furnished and set up by the owner or consumer at the owner’s or
the consumer’s expense, and the owner or consumer must assume all
responsibility of reading, billing and maintaining same.

§ 52.41 WATER METER SETTING.
   Water meters must be installed in accordance with the following rules.
   (A)   The service pipe from the water main to the meter, when the same
enters the building, must be brought through the floor in a vertical position.
   (B)   The meter must be located so that the bottom is not less than 12
inches above the finished floor line and not greater than 24 inches above the
finished floor line. A full flow valve must be placed approximately 12 inches
above the floor. A stop and waste valve must be installed on the house side
adjacent to the meter, or just above the meter. The meter must be set not more
than 12 inches measured horizontally from the inside line of the basement wall,
unless an alternate method is approved by the Superintendent. An approved
fitting must be provided to support the meter in the proper vertical position.
Meters larger than one inch must be set on a pedestal.
   (C)   (1)   Meters two inch or greater in size must be equipped with a
bypass line equal to one-half the size of the existing pipe size so that in the
event a meter needs to be tested, repaired or replaced, the building will still
have a minimum amount of water supplied.
      (2)   The bypass line must be valved on each side, in addition to the
meter valves and when completed must be sealed by the city’s Utility
Department. This seal may not be tampered with and will be subject to a fine if
seal is found tampered with or broken.
   (D)   Meter installations must have a full flow valve placed approximately
12 inches above the floor. A stop and waste valve must be installed on the
house side just above the meter. Fittings and pipe are to be red brass or
bronze. Full way valves must be brass 125 pounds standard.

      (1)   The water availability charge must be paid prior to the issuance of
an applicable permit and before connecting to the city’s water system.
      (2)   If, after the initial water availability charge is paid, an
additional building permit is issued, the use of the property changes or a new
water connection is made, the water availability charge will be recalculated
and any additional charges must be paid.
      (3)   The unit charge multiplier for the water availability charge shall
be set forth from time to time by resolution of the City Council.
   (C)   The amount of the water availability charge for a particular property

§ 53.51 GREASE, OIL AND SAND INTERCEPTORS.
   (A)   Grease, oil and sand interceptors will be provided when, in the
opinion of the Superintendent, they are necessary for the proper handling of
liquid wastes containing floatable grease in excessive amounts as specified in
§
53.47(B) of this chapter, any flammable wastes as specified in §
53.46(A) of this chapter, sand or other harmful ingredients; except that, the
interceptors will not be required for private living quarters or dwelling
units. All interceptors will be of the type to be readily and easily accessible
for cleaning and inspection. In the maintaining of these interceptors, the
owner or owners will be responsible for the proper removal and disposal of the
captured materials by appropriate means, and will maintain a record of dates
and means of disposal which are subject to review by the Superintendent. Any
removal and hauling of the collecting materials not performed by the owner’s
personnel must be performed by a currently licensed waste disposal firm.
   (B)   When required by the city, the owner of any property serviced by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastes will install a suitable structure, or
control manhole or manholes with the necessary meters, samplers and other
appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and
measurement of the wastes. The structure will be easily accessible and safely
located, and must be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the
Engineer. The structure will be installed by the owner at his or her expense
and will be maintained by the owner so as to be safe for use at all times.
   (C)   The owners of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying
industrial wastes may, at the discretion of the city, be required to provide
laboratory measurements, tests or analyses of waters or wastes to illustrate
compliance with this chapter and any special condition for discharge
established by the city or regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over the
discharge. The number, type and frequency of sampling and laboratory analyses
to be performed by the owner will be as stipulated in writing by the city. The
industry must supply a complete analysis of the constituents of the wastewater
discharge to assure that compliance with federal, state and local standards are
being met. The owner will report the results of measurements and laboratory
analyses to the city at such times and in a manner as prescribed by the city.
The owner will bear the expense of all measurements, analyses and reporting
required by the city. At such times as deemed necessary, the city reserves the
right to take its own measurements and samples for analysis by an independent
laboratory.
   (D)   The measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter will be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association.
Sampling methods, location, times, duration and frequencies are to be
determined on an individual basis subject to approval by the Superintendent and
engineer.
   (E)   Where required by the city, the owner of any property serviced by a
sanitary sewer will provide protection from an accidental discharge of
prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this chapter. Where
necessary, facilities to prevent accidental discharges of prohibited materials
will be provided and maintained at the owner’s expense. Detailed plans showing
facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection will be
submitted to the Superintendent for review and approval prior to construction
of the facility. Review and approval of the plans and operating procedures will
not relieve any user from the responsibility to modify the user’s facility as
necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter. Users will notify the
Superintendent immediately upon having a slug or accidental discharge of
substances of wastewater in violation of this chapter to enable countermeasures
to be taken by the Superintendent to minimize damage to the wastewater
treatment works. The notifications will not relieve any user of any liability
for any expense, loss or damage to the wastewater treatment system or treatment
process or for any fines imposed on the city on account thereof under any state
and federal law. Employees will ensure that all employees who may cause or
discover such a discharge are advised of the emergency notifications procedure.
   (F)   No person, having charge of any building or other premises which
drains into the public sewer, will permit any substance or matter which may
form a deposit or obstruction to flow or pass into the public sewer. Within 90
days after receipt of written notice from the city, the owner will install a
suitable and sufficient catch basin or waste trap, or if one already exists,
will clean out, repair or alter the same, and perform such other work as the
Superintendent may deem necessary. Upon the owner’s refusal or neglect to
install a catch basin or waste trap or to clean out, repair or alter the same
after the period of 90 days, the Superintendent may cause the work to be
completed at the expense of the owner or representative thereof.
   (G)   (1)   Whenever any service connection becomes clogged, obstructed,
broken or out of order, or detrimental to the use of the public sewer, or unfit
for the purpose of drainage, the owner will repair or cause the work to be done
as the Superintendent may direct.
      (2)   Each day after 90 days, that person neglects or fails to so act
will constitute a separate violation of this chapter, and the Superintendent
may then cause the work to be done and recover from the owner or agent the
expense thereof by an action in the name of the city.
   (H)   The owner or operator of any motor vehicle washing or servicing
facility will provide and maintain in serviceable condition at all times, a
catch basin or waste trap in the building drain system to prevent grease, oil,
dirt or any mineral deposit from entering the public sewer system.

10.99
§ 53.52 CHARGES AND PENALTIES.
   In addition to any penalties that may be imposed for violation of any
provision of this chapter, the city may assess against any person the cost of
repairing or restoring sewers or associated facilities damaged as a result of
the discharge of prohibited wastes by the person, and may collect an assessment
as an additional charge for the use of the public sewer system or in any other
manner deemed appropriate by the city.
(Prior Code, § 710.11) (Ord. 2009-04, passed 10-7-2009)
§ 53.53 SPECIAL AGREEMENTS, ARRANGEMENTS.
   No statement contained in this chapter is construed as preventing any
special agreement or arrangement between the city and any industrial concern
whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by
the city for treatment, subject to payment therefor by the industrial concern;
providing that, national categorical pretreatment standards and the city’s
NPDES and state disposal system permit limitations are not violated.

   (B)   Sewer rates.
      (1)   Schedule. The rate due and payable to the city by each sewer user
within the city for sewer used will be charged per 1,000 gallons, payable
periodically, subject to a minimum charge to each sewer user for each period
during which service is furnished. The minimum charge represents the basic
facility and service cost inherent in the operation of the sewer system. For
services unable to the metered, usage charges will be billed by the average
usage per month per occupant. The charges and usages are set by resolution of
the City Council on an annual basis as part of the fee schedule established by
§
36.02 of this code of ordinances.
      (2)   Estimates. In case the meter is found to have stopped or o be
operating in a faulty manner, the amount of sewer used will be estimated in
accordance with the amount used previously in comparable periods of the year.
      (3)   Billing. Where service is for less than a full billing period, the
charge will be prorated.
      (4)   Minimum rates apply. Where service pipe is laid into the building
with no intention of connecting to the building piping for use immediately, the
minimum rates and charges set in division (B)(1) above apply.
      (5)   Installation. A meter and remote register must be installed on the
street valve or well service in the house, regardless of whether the inside
piping is connected.
      (6)   Continuance. If a sewer customer elects to discontinue the use of
the municipal sewer system, the regular or minimal charge continues until the
service pipe is excavated and disconnected at the curb stop.
      (7)   Special contract. Rates due and payable by each sewer user located
beyond the territorial boundaries of the city will be determined by a special
contract.
   (C)   Penalty for late payment. Each billing for sewer service not paid when
due incurs penalty charge of 10% of the mount past due.
   (D)   Action to collect charges. An amount due for sewer charges may be
certified to the County Auditor for collection with real estate taxes in the
following year in accordance with M.S. § 444.075, as it may be amended from
time to time. This certification will be regardless of who applied sewer
services, whether it was the owner, tenant or other person. Applications for
sewer service will contain an explanation in clear language that unpaid sewer
bills will be collected with real estate taxes the following year.
      (1)   Sewer charges; term. The city may bring a civil action or other
remedies to collect unpaid charges. For purposes of this section, the term
SEWER CHARGES means and includes without limitation sewer rate charges, permit
charges, availability charges, connection charges and any rate or charge
authorized by M.S. § 444.075, as it may be amended from time to time, as

safety, the officer must cause the animal to be humanely destroyed and must
properly dispose of the remains. The owner or keeper of the animal destroyed
under this section shall be responsible for the costs of maintaining and
disposing of the animal, plus the costs of any veterinarian examinations.

occupied by the owner of the dog;
            2.   Provoking, tormenting, abusing or assaulting the dog, or who

requirements of M.S. § 347.52(a) and (c), as they may be amended from time to
time, regarding proper enclosures and notification to the city upon transfer or
death of the dog, until and unless a hearing officer or court of law reverses
the declaration.
      (1)   The city will issue a license to the owner of a dangerous dog if
the owner presents sufficient evidence that:
         (a)   There is a proper enclosure;
         (b)   Written proof that there is a surety bond by a surety company
authorized to conduct business in Minnesota in the sum of at least $300,000,

dangerous dog. The name of the microchip manufacturer and identification number
of the microchip must be provided to the city. If the microchip is not
implanted by the owner, it may be implanted by the city at the owner's expense;

microchip is not implanted by the owner, it may be implanted by the city at the
owner's expense.
      (3)   A pre-license inspection of the premises to insure compliance with

enclosure. While on the owner's property, an owner of a dangerous or
potentially dangerous dog must keep it in a proper enclosure. Inside a
residential home, there must be a secured area maintained where the dog will
stay when persons other than family members are present. If the dog is outside
the proper enclosure, the dog must be muzzled and restrained by a substantial
chain or leash no longer than four feet and under the physical restraint of an
adult. The muzzle must be made in a manner that will prevent the dog from
biting any person or animal but that will not cause injury to the dog or
interfere with its vision or respiration.
   (F)   Notification requirements to city.
      (1)   The owner of a dog that has been declared dangerous or potentially

dog is to be relocated from its current address or if the dog has died. The
notification must be given in writing within 30 days of the relocation or
death. The notification must include the current owner's name and address, and
the new owner's name and the relocation address. If the relocation address is
outside of the city, the city may notify the local law enforcement agency of
the transfer of the dog into its jurisdiction.

is currently renting property, must notify the property owner within 14 days of
city notification if the owned dog is newly declared as dangerous or
potentially dangerous and the owner keeps the dog on the property.
      (3)   No dog that has been previously determined to be dangerous or
potentially dangerous by another jurisdiction shall be kept, owned or harbored
in the city unless the dog's owner complies with the requirements of this
section prior to bringing the dog into the city. Dogs in violation of this
division are subject to impoundment and destruction.
   (G)   Seizure. Animal control may immediately seize any dangerous or
potentially dangerous dog if:
      (1)   After 14 days after the owner has notice that the dog is declared
dangerous or potentially dangerous, the dog is not validly licensed and no
appeal has been filed;
      (2)   After 14 days after the owner has notice that the dog is dangerous,
the owner does not secure the proper liability insurance or surety coverage as
required or such required insurance is cancelled;

   (H)   Reclamation. A dog seized under division (G) above may be reclaimed by
the owner of the dog upon payment of maintenance costs, and presenting proof to
animal control that the requirements of this section have been met. A dog not
reclaimed under this division within seven days may be disposed of and the
owner will be liable to the city for maintenance costs. A person claiming an
interest in a seized dog may prevent disposition of the dog by posting a
security in an amount sufficient to provide for the dog's maintenance costs.
The security must be posted with the city within seven days of the seizure
inclusive of the date seized.
   (I)   Subsequent offenses: seizure. If a person has been convicted of
violating a provision of this section, and the person is charged with a
subsequent violation relating to the same dog, the dog may be seized. If the
owner is convicted of the crime for which the dog was seized, the court may
order that the dog be destroyed in a proper and humane manner and the owner pay
the maintenance costs. If the owner is not convicted and the dog is not
reclaimed by the owner within seven days after the owner has been notified that
the dog may be reclaimed, the dog may be disposed of in manner permitted by
law.
   (J)   Notice, hearings.
      (1)   After a dog has been declared dangerous or potentially dangerous or
has been seized for destruction, the city shall give notice by delivering or
mailing it to the owner of the dog, or by posting a copy of it at the place
where the dog is kept, or by delivering it to a person residing on the
property, and telephoning, if possible. The notice shall include:

      (2)   (a) After a dog has been declared dangerous, potentially dangerous
or has been seized for destruction, the owner may appeal in writing to the city

in a damaging manner on property of persons other than the owner;
      (2)   The dog has been declared dangerous, the owner's right to appeal
hereunder has been exhausted or expired, and the owner has failed to comply

provocation in an attack where more than one dog participated in the attack; or
      (8)   The dog poses a danger to the public's health, safety or welfare.
In determining whether the dog poses a danger to the public's health, safety or
welfare, the following factors may be considered:
         (a)   The dog weighs more than 20 pounds;
         (b)   The strength of the dog, including jaw strength;
         (c)   The dog's tolerance for pain;
         (d)   The dog's tendency to refuse to terminate an attack;

609.226, subd. 1, as it may be amended from time to time.
      (2)   Any person who owns a dangerous or potentially dangerous dog and is
found to be in violation of any of the provisions of this section or had owned
a dangerous or potentially dangerous dog but never achieved compliance with
this section may be prohibited from ownership or custody of another dog for a
period of five years after the original declaration. Any dog found to be in
violation, may be impounded until due process is completed, pursuant to
division (J) above.
      (3)   If any member of a household is prohibited from owning a dog in
divisions (M)(1) or (M)(2) above, unless specifically approved with or without
restrictions by the city, no person in the household is permitted to own a dog.
   (N)   Dog ownership prohibition review. Beginning three years after a
conviction under division (M)(1) above that prohibits a person from owning a
dog, and annually thereafter, the person may request in writing to the Sheriff
or Animal Control Officer that the city review the prohibition.
      (1)   The city may consider such facts as the seriousness of the
violation or violations that led to the prohibition, any criminal convictions,
or other facts that the city deems appropriate. The city may rescind the
prohibition entirely or rescind it with limitations. The city also may
establish conditions a person must meet before the prohibition is rescinded,
including, but not limited to, successfully completing dog training or dog
handling courses.
      (2)   If the city rescinds a person's prohibition and the person
subsequently fails to comply with any limitations imposed by the city or the
person is convicted of any animal violation involving unprovoked bites or dog
attacks, the city may permanently prohibit the person from owning a dog in this
state.

§ 91.002 TREE DISEASES AND SHADE TREE PEST CONTROL.
   (A)   Declaration of policy. The health of the trees in the city is
threatened by shade tree pests, and the loss or ill health of trees growing
upon public and private property substantially depreciates the value of
property within the city and impairs the safety, good order, general welfare
and convenience of the public. In addition to and in accordance with M.S. §§
89.001, 89.01 and 89.51 through 89.64, as those sections may be amended from
time to time, the provisions of this section are adopted to attempt to control
and prevent the spread of these shade tree pests.
   (B)   Jurisdiction. The city shall have control of all street trees, shrubs
and other plantings now or hereafter in any street, park, public right-of-way
or easement or other public place within the city limits, and shall have the
power to plant, care for, maintain, remove and replace such trees, shrubs and
other plantings.
   (C)   Declaration of a shade tree pest. The City Council may declare any
vertebrate or invertebrate animal,   plant pathogen, or plant threatening to
cause significant damage to a shade tree or community forest as defined by M.S.
§ 89.001, as it may be amended from time to time, to be a shade tree pest and
prescribe control measures to effectively eradicate, control or manage the
shade tree pest including necessary time lines for action.
   (D)   Public nuisances declared. A shade tree pest declared by City Council
occurring within a declared control zone is a public nuisance.
   (E)   Shade tree pest nuisances are unlawful. It is unlawful for any person
to permit any public nuisance as defined in this section to remain on any
premises the person owns or controls within the city. The nuisance may be
abated as provided in this section.
   (F)   Definition of control areas. Upon declaring a shade tree pest, the
City Council may define one or more locations within the geographic boundaries
of the city to be within a shade tree pest control area provided such locations
are characterized by biologic, composition, environmental and size factors
favorable to successful application of the control measures prescribed by City
Council.
   (G)   Tree Inspector. The City Council may appoint a Tree Inspector to
coordinate the activities of the city relating to the control and prevention of
damage by shade tree pests. The Tree Inspector will recommend to the City
Council the details of any program for the declaration, control and prevention
of shade tree pests. The Tree Inspector is authorized to enforce or cause to be
enforced the tasks incident to such a program adopted by the Council. The term
TREE INSPECTOR includes any person designated by City Council or the Tree
Inspector to carry out activities authorized in this section.
   (H)   Abatement of shade tree pest nuisances.
      (1)   In abating a nuisance declared by ordinance under divisions (B) and
(C), the organism, condition or plant and any tree, wood or material identified
as injurious to the health of shade trees shall be removed or effectively
treated so as to destroy and prevent as fully as possible the spread of the
shade tree pest. Such abatement procedures shall be carried out in accordance
with the control measures and areas prescribed by ordinance according to
divisions (C) and (K) and (O) .
      (2)   In addition, should the appropriate abatement procedure be removal
and the tree(s) and/or hedge(s) be within the limits of a highway in a rural
area within the city's jurisdiction, M.S. § 160.22, as it may be amended from
time to time, shall be complied with as necessary.
   (I)   Reporting discovery of shade tree pest. Any owner or occupier of land
or any person engaged in tree trimming or removal who becomes aware of the
existence of public nuisance caused by a shade tree pest as defined under
division (C) shall report the same to the city.
   (J)   Registration of tree care firms. Any person, firm or corporation that
provides tree care, tree trimming or removal of trees, limbs, branches, brush
or shrubs for hire must be registered with the Minnesota Commissioner of
Agriculture under M.S. § 18G.07, as it may be amended from time to time.
   (K)   Inspection and application of control measures.
      (1)   The Tree Inspector is authorized to inspect premises and places
within the city to determine whether shade tree pests exist thereon and to
investigate all reported incidents of shade tree pests. The Tree Inspector is
authorized to take all reasonable measures to prevent the maintenance of public
nuisances and may enforce the provisions relating to abatement in this section.
Diagnosis of shade tree pests may be by the presence of commonly recognized
symptoms or by tests as may be recommended by the Commissioner of the Minnesota
Department of Agriculture or the Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of
Natural Resources or other reliable means.
      (2)   Except in situations of imminent danger to human life and safety,
the Tree Inspector shall not enter private property for the purpose of
inspecting or preventing maintenance of public nuisances without the permission
of the owner, resident or other person in control of the property, unless the
Tree Inspector has obtained a warrant or order from a court of competent
jurisdiction authorizing the entry.
      (3)   No person, firm or corporation shall interfere with the Tree
Inspector acting under his or her authority while engaged in activities
authorized by this section.
   (L)   Standard abatement procedure. Except as provided in divisions (M) and
(O), whenever a Tree Inspector determines with reasonable certainty that a
public nuisance as described by this section is being maintained or exists on
premises in the city, the Tree Inspector is authorized to abate a public
nuisance according to the following procedure.
      (1)   The Tree Inspector will notify, in writing, the owner of record or
occupant of the premises of such fact and order that the nuisance be terminated
or abated. The notice may be given in person or by mail. Failure of any party
to receive the mail does not invalidate the service of the notice. A copy of
the notice shall be filed with the City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer.
      (2)   The notice of abatement shall state that unless the public nuisance
is abated by the owner or occupant, it will be abated by the city at the
expense of the owner or occupant. The notice shall specify the control measures
to be taken to abate the nuisance, and provide a reasonable amount of time to
abate the nuisance. The notice will also state that the owner or occupant has
the right to appeal the determination that a public nuisance exists by
submitting a request in writing to the City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer
within seven days after service of the notice, or before the date by which
abatement must be completed, whichever comes first.
      (3)   If no timely appeal is submitted, and the notice of abatement and
its prescribed control measures are not complied with within the time provided
by the notice or any additional time granted, the Tree Inspector or designated
person shall have the authority to obtain permission or an administrative
search warrant, enter the property and carry out abatement in accordance with
the notice of abatement.
   (M)   High cost abatement. If the Tree Inspector determines that the cost of
abating a nuisance will exceed $5,000 based on a reasonable, good faith
estimate, the written notice referred to in division (L) above must provide
that if the nuisance is not abated within the reasonable amount of time
provided, the matter will be referred to the City Council for a hearing. The
date, time and location of the hearing must be provided in the notice.
   (N)   Appeal procedure. If the City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer receives a
written request for a hearing on the question of whether a public nuisance in
fact exists, the City Council shall hold a hearing within seven calendar days
following receipt by the City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer of the written
request. At least three days’ notice shall be given to the individual who made
the written request for the hearing. The Council may modify the abatement
notice or extend the time by which abatement must be completed. Each owner,
agent of the owner, occupant and lienholder of the subject property or
properties in attendance, if any, shall be given the opportunity to present
evidence at the hearing. After holding the hearing, the City Council may issue
an order requiring abatement of the nuisance.
   (O)   Abatement procedure in event of imminent danger.
      (1) If the Tree Inspector determines that the danger of infestation to
other shade trees is imminent and delay in control measures may put public
health, safety or welfare in immediate danger, the Tree Inspector may provide
for abatement without following (L) or (M). The Tree Inspector must reasonably
attempt to notify the owner or occupant of the affected property of the
intended action and the right to appeal the abatement and any cost recovery at
the next regularly scheduled City Council meeting.
      (2)   Nothing in this section shall prevent the city, without notice or
other process, from immediately abating any condition which poses an imminent
and serious hazard to human life or safety.
   (P)   Recovery of cost of abatement; liability and assessment.
      (1)   The owner of premises on which a nuisance has been abated by the
city shall be personally liable for the cost to the city of the abatement,
including administrative costs. As soon as the work has been completed and the
cost determined, the City Deputy or other official shall prepare a bill for the
cost and mail it to the owner. Thereupon the amount shall be immediately due
and payable at the office of the City Deputy.
      (2)   After notice and hearing as provided in M.S. § 429.061, as it may
be amended from time to time, the City Deputy may list the total unpaid charges
along with all other charges as well as other charges for current services to
be assessed under M.S. § 429.101, as it may be amended from time to time,
against each separate lot or parcel to which the charges are attributable. The
City Council may then certify the charges against the property under that
statute and other pertinent statutes to the County Auditor for collection along
with current taxes the following year or in annual installments as the City
Council may determine in each case.
   (Q)   Declared shade tree pests, control measures and control areas.
      (1)   Oak Wilt is declared a shade tree pest and is defined as any living
or dead tree, log, firewood, limb, branch, stump or other portion of a tree
from any species of the genus Quercus existing within the control area defined
that has bark attached and that exceeds three inches in diameter or ten inches
in circumference and contains to any degree any spore or reproductive
structures of the fungus Ceratocystis fagacearum. Control measures prescribed
for abating Oak Wilt Disease are as follows.
         (a)   A root graft barrier can be ordered installed to prevent the
underground spread of Oak Wilt Disease. The city will mark the location of the
root graft barrier. The barrier disrupts transmission of the fungus within the
shared vascular systems of root grafted trees. The barrier is created by
excavating or vibratory plowing a line at least 42 inches deep between any oak
tree infected with Oak Wilt Disease and each nearby and apparently healthy oak
tree within 50 feet of the infected tree.
         (b)   On property that is zoned residential and commercial the city
may mark for removal trees that have the potential to produce spores of the
fungus Ceratocvstis fagacearum. After, and in no case before the installation
of the root graft barrier and no later than May 1 of the year following
infection, all marked trees must be felled. The stump from such felled trees
must not extend more than three inches above the ground or, if taller, must be
completely debarked. If, however, after the city prescribes the location for a
root graft barrier, the city determines that installation of the barrier is
impossible because of the presence of pavement or obstructions such as a septic
system or utility line, the city may mark for removal all oak trees whether
living or dead, infected or not, and located between an infected tree and the
marked barrier location. These marked trees must be felled and disposed of no
later than May 1 of the year following infection. The stump from such felled
trees must not extend more than three inches above the ground or, if taller,
must be completely debarked.
         (c)   On all other property the city may mark for removal all oak
trees whether living or dead, infected or not, and located between an infected
tree and the marked barrier location. These marked trees must be felled and
disposed of no later than May 1 of the year following infection. The stump from
such felled trees must not extend more than three inches above the ground or,
if taller, must be completely debarked.
         (d)   All wood more than three inches in diameter or ten inches in
circumference from such felled trees must be disposed of by burying, debarking,
chipping or sawing into wane-free lumber or by splitting into firewood,
stacking the firewood and immediately covering the woodpile with unbroken four-
millimeter or thicker plastic sheeting that is sealed into the ground until
October 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the tree
was felled or by burning before May 1 of the year following infection. Wood
chips from infected trees may be stockpiled or immediately used in the
landscape.
         (e)   The control area for Oak Wilt Disease is defined as all lands
within the boundaries of the city.
      (2)   Emerald Ash Borer is declared a shade tree pest and is defined as
an insect that attacks and kills ash trees. The adults are small, iridescent
green beetles that live outside of trees during the summer months. The larvae
are grub or worm-like and live underneath the bark of ash trees.
         (a)   Control measures prescribed for abating Emerald Ash Borer are
those provided in the document entitled “Guidelines to Slow the Growth and
Spread of Emerald Ash Borer” from the State Department of Agriculture.
         (b)   The control area for Emerald Ash Borer is defined as all lands
within the boundaries of the city.
      (3)   Dutch Elm Disease is declared a shade tree pest and is defined as a
disease of elm trees caused by the fungus Ophiostoma ulmi or Ophiostoma novo-
ulmi, and includes any living or dead tree, log, firewood, limb, branch, stump
or other portion of a tree from any species of the genus Ulmus existing within
the control area defined that has bark attached and that exceeds three inches
in diameter or ten inches in circumference, and could contain bark beetles or
any spore or reproductive structures of the fungus Ophiostoma ulmi or
Ophiostoma novo-ulmi.
         (a)   Control measures prescribed for abating Dutch Elm Disease are:
            1.   Fungicides may be effective in preventing Dutch elm disease
when injected into living trees that do not already show symptoms of Dutch elm
disease. Fungicide injections on private lands are optional and, if performed,
are at the landowner's expense.
            2.   Prompt removal of diseased trees or branches reduces breeding
sites for elm bark beetles and eliminates the source of Dutch elm disease
fungus. Trees that wilt before July 15 must be removed within 20 days of
detection (alternatively 30 days). Trees that wilt after July 15 must be
removed by April 1 of the following year. Diseased trees not promptly removed
will be removed by the city at the landowner's expense. Wood may be retained
for use as firewood or sawlogs if it is de-barked or covered from April 15 to
October 15 with four-millimeter plastic. The edges of the cover must be buried
or sealed to the ground.
         (b)   The control area for Dutch Elm Disease is defined as all lands
within the boundaries of the city.

taken to abate the nuisance and the time within which the nuisance is to be
abated. If the notice of violation is not complied with within the time
specified, the officer or designated person shall report that fact forthwith to
the City Council. Thereafter, the City Council may, after notice to the owner
or occupant and an opportunity to be heard, determine that the condition
identified in the notice of violation is a nuisance and further order that if
the nuisance is not abated within the time prescribed by the City Council, the
city may seek injunctive relief by serving a copy of the City Council order and
notice of motion for summary enforcement or obtain an administrative search and
seizure warrant and abate the nuisance.
   (C)   Emergency procedure; summary enforcement.
      (1)   Special cases. In cases of emergency, where delay in abatement
required to complete the notice and procedure requirements set forth in
divisions (A) and (B) above will permit a continuing nuisance to unreasonably
endanger public health, safety or welfare, the City Council may order summary
enforcement and abate the nuisance.
      (2)   Endangerment. To proceed with summary enforcement, the officer or
designated person shall determine that a public nuisance exists or is being
maintained on premises in the city and that delay in abatement of the nuisance
will unreasonably endanger public health, safety or welfare.
      (3)   Notice. The officer or designated person shall notify, in writing,
the occupant or owner of the premises of the nature of the nuisance and of the
city’s intention to seek summary enforcement and the time and place of the City
Council meeting to consider the question of summary enforcement.
      (4)   Determination. The City Council shall determine whether or not the
condition identified in the notice to the owner or occupant is a nuisance,
whether public health, safety or welfare will be unreasonably endangered by
delay in abatement required to complete the procedure set forth in division (A)
above, and may order that the nuisance be immediately terminated or abated. If
the nuisance is not immediately terminated or abated, the City Council may
order summary enforcement and abate the nuisance.
   (D)   Immediate abatement. Nothing in this section shall prevent the city,
without notice or other process, from immediately abating any condition which
poses an imminent and serious hazard to human life or safety.
Penalty, see §
91.999
§ 91.024 RECOVERY OF COST.
   (A)   Personal liability. The owner of premises on which a nuisance has been
abated by the city or a person who has caused a public nuisance on a property
not owned by that person shall be personally liable for the cost to the city of
the abatement, including administrative costs. As soon as the work has been
completed and the cost determined, the City Deputy or other official shall
prepare a bill for the cost and mail it to the owner. Thereupon the amount
shall be immediately due and payable at the office of the City Deputy.
   (B)   Assessment. 
      (1)   After notice and hearing as provided in M.S. § 429.061, as it may
be amended from time to time, if the nuisance is a public health or safety
hazard on private property, the accumulation of snow and ice on public
sidewalks, the growth of weeds on private property or outside the traveled
portion of streets, or unsound or insect-infected trees, the City
Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer shall, on or before September 1 next following
abatement of the nuisance, list the total unpaid charges along with all other
charges as well as other charges for current services to be assessed under M.S.
§ 429.101, as it may be amended from time to time, against each separate lot or
parcel to which the charges are attributable.
      (2)   The City Council may then spread the charges against the property
under that statute and other pertinent statutes for certification to the County
Auditor and collection along with current taxes the following year or in annual
installments, not exceeding ten, as the City Council may determine in each
case.

REPEAT NUISANCE SERVICE CALLS
§ 91.085 PURPOSE AND INTENT; SCOPE, APPLICATION.
   (A)   Purpose and intent.
      (1)   The City Council recognizes that the city has limited staff and
resources and finds that properties requiring responses to repeated nuisance
service calls, as defined herein, present a burden to the community at large
because they limit the availability of law enforcement and public safety
protection services to other residents of the city.
      (2)   The purpose of this subchapter is to protect the public safety,
health and welfare and to prevent and abate repeat nuisance service calls to
the same property or location which prevents public safety services from being
available to other residents of the city.
      (3)   It is the intent of the city to impose and collect a repeat
nuisance service call fee from the owner, occupant or responsible party of
property to which the city officials must repeatedly respond for any repeat
nuisance event or activity that generates extraordinary costs to the city. The
repeat nuisance service call fee is intended to cover the city’s cost over and
above its cost of providing normal law enforcement services and public safety
protection city-wide.
   (B)   Scope and application. This subchapter applies to owners, occupants
and responsible parties of private property that is the subject or location of
repeat nuisance service calls. This subchapter applies to repeat nuisance
service calls made by owners, occupants and responsible parties to the County
Sheriff’s Department for responses to locations within the city.
(Prior Code, § 907.01) (Ord. 06-06, passed 12-29-2006)

unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   NUISANCE SERVICE CALL. An activity, conduct or condition occurring upon
private property within the city which will, or will tend to alarm, anger or
disturb others or provoke the breach of the peace to which the County Sheriff’s
Department is required to respond including, but not limited to, the following:
      (1)   Any conduct, activity or condition constituting a violation of
state laws prohibiting or regulating prostitution, gambling, controlled
substances or use of firearms; or
      (2)   Any conduct, activity or condition constituting disorderly conduct
under M.S. Chapter 609, as it may be amended from time to time.
(Prior Code, § 907.03) (Ord. 06-06, passed 12-29-2006)
§ 91.087 NOTICE.
   (A)   A repeat nuisance service call fee may not be imposed against an
owner, occupant or responsible party of property without the city first
providing the owner, occupant or responsible party with written notice of the
two previous nuisance service calls which are the basis for the fee. Upon
receiving information from the County Sheriff’s Department that it has rendered
services or responded to a property within the city on two or more occasions
within a period of 365 days in response to nuisance service calls, the city
will notify the owner, occupant or responsible party that it will impose a
repeat nuisance service call fee upon receiving notice from the County
Sheriff’s Department that it has responded to a third nuisance service call
within that 365-day period.
   (B)   The written notice must state:
      (1)   The nuisance conduct, activity or condition that is or has occurred
or is maintained or permitted on the property;
      (2)   The dates of the nuisance conduct, activities or conditions; and
      (3)   The owner, occupant or responsible party may be subject to a repeat
nuisance service call fee; if a third nuisance service call is rendered to the
property for the same nuisance within a period of 365 days which will be in
addition to the city’s right to seek other legal remedies or actions for
abatement of the nuisance or compliance with the law.
   (C)   The notice must be served personally or by United States mail upon the
owner, occupant or responsible party at the last known address.
(Prior Code, § 907.05) (Ord. 06-06, passed 12-29-2006)

   (A)   Upon receiving information from the County Sheriff’s Department that
it has rendered services or responded to a property within the city on three or
more occasions within a period of 365 days in response to nuisance service
calls, the city will impose a repeat nuisance service call fee upon the owner,
occupant or responsible party by mailing an invoice.
   (B)   The repeat nuisance service call fee under this subchapter will be an
amount as set forth in a City Council resolution.

each additional 30-day period that the fee remains unpaid.
   (B)   Unpaid charges. Delinquent charges for user fees will be certified by

assessment of the delinquent amounts against the respective properties served.
The assessment roll must be delivered by the Deputy Clerk to the City Council
for adoption on or before October 10 of each year.
(Prior Code, § 955.07)
§ 95.05 ALARM REPORT.

the alarm user must submit a written report to the City Administrator/Clerk-
Treasurer within ten days after being notified of the fifth false alarm,

the false alarms. Failure to submit the written report is a violation of this

the content of speech or infringe upon the right to assemble, except for
regulating the time, place and manner of speech and assembly and this chapter

§ 115.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to prescribe licensing requirements for
sexually oriented businesses to protect the public health, safety and welfare
and to prevent criminal activity and the spread of sexually transmitted
diseases. This chapter is intended to supersede the provisions of M.S. §
617.242, as it may be amended from time to time, and render M.S. § 617.242
inapplicable as authorized by the statute.
§ 115.02 FINDINGS.
   The City Council makes the following findings regarding the effect sexually
oriented businesses have on the character of the city’s neighborhoods. In
making these findings, the City Council accepts the recommendations and
conclusions of the Report of the Attorney General’s Working Group on the
Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses, dated June 6, 1989. This chapter
shall have no force and effect until the City Council accepts these
recommendations by a majority of its members, using the model ordinance
contained in Appendix I of the User’s Guide.
   (A)   Sexually oriented businesses can contribute to an increase in criminal
activity in the area in which such businesses are located, increasing the
demands on city crime-prevention programs and law enforcement services.
   (B)   Sexually oriented businesses can be used as fronts for prostitution
and other criminal activity. The experience of other cities indicates that
proper management and operation of such businesses can minimize this risk.
   (C)   Sexually oriented businesses can increase the risk of exposure to
communicable diseases, including acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS),
for which there is currently no cure. Experiences of other cities indicate that
such businesses can facilitate the spread of communicable diseases by virtue of
the design and use of the premises, endangering not only the patrons of such
establishments but also the general public.
   (D)   Sexually oriented businesses can cause or contribute to public health
problems by the presence of live adult entertainment in conjunction with food
and/or drink on the same premises.
   (E)   A licensing and regulatory scheme as prescribed in this chapter can
facilitate the enforcement of the city’s “anti-blight” regulations, and can aid
in monitoring sexually oriented businesses for adverse secondary effects on the
community.
   (F)   The risk of criminal activity and/or public health problems can be
minimized through a licensing and regulatory scheme as prescribed in this
chapter.

36.02), adopted pursuant to § 30.11 of this code, as that ordinance may be
amended from time to time. This fee will be for the purpose of conducting a
preliminary background and financial investigation of the applicant. If the
city believes that the public interest so warrants, it may require a similar
investigation at the time of renewal of a license. If an investigation is
ordered at the time of license renewal, the applicant must pay the fee
specified above, except that the fee will be the smaller of the stated dollar
amount or the actual cost of the investigation. There will be no refund of the
investigation fee after the investigation has begun.
   (B)   The annual fees for a license are set forth in the ordinance
establishing fees and charges (§
36.02), adopted pursuant to § 30.11 of this code, as that ordinance may be
amended from time to time.
   (C)   Each license expires on December 31 of the year in which it is issued.
Fees for licenses issued during the license year will be prorated according to
the number of months remaining in the year. For this purpose an unexpired
fraction of a month will be counted as a whole month having elapsed.
   (D)   No refund of a fee will be made except as authorized by ordinance.
§ 115.10 GRANTING LICENSES.
   (A)   No license may be issued until the Police Department, or the County
Sheriff, if the city has no Police Department, has conducted an investigation
of the representations set forth in the application, the applicant’s moral
character, and the applicant’s financial status. All applicants must cooperate
with this investigation.
   (B)   No license, except for a renewed license, may be issued for a sexually
oriented business until the City Council has held a public hearing. Notice of
the hearing must be made in the same manner as that specified in Chapter 151 of
this code, for a zoning ordinance amendment affecting district boundaries. The
City Council must grant the license unless the applicant or the location does
not meet the requirements of the city code, the application was incomplete, or
the application contained false information or a material omission. If the
application is denied, the city must notify the applicant with the reason(s)
stated for denial. Notification must be sent certified, United States mail,
return receipt requested, to the address provided on the license application.
If the City Council fails to act on the application within 45 days after
receipt of a complete application, the application will be deemed approved. An
applicant wishing to appeal the action of the City Council may seek a writ of
certiorari before the State Court of Appeals.
   (C)   (1)   The City Council may issue a license before an investigation,
notice and public hearing for an applicant who:
         (a)   Had a license within the previous five years for the
establishment that is specified in the application and that is continuing to
operate under a license;
         (b)   Wishes to resume operation of the business without sufficient
time, through no fault of his or her own, to meet the normal procedural
requirements;
         (c)   Had no criminal license convictions, or license suspensions or
revocations during the prior licensed period; and
         (d)   Otherwise qualifies and meets the requirements for a license.
      (2)   In this situation, the City Council may immediately issue an
interim license to the applicant for a period of no longer than 90 days. The
applicant must then proceed through the specified requirements for an
investigation, notice and public hearing. At the public hearing the City
Council will decide whether the license should continue in effect or be
revoked. The applicant has no greater right to continuation of the license than
he or she would have had to issuance of a new license following the normal
procedure without the interim license.
   (D)   (1)   A license will be issued only to the applicant and for the
premises described in the application. No license may be transferred to another
person or place without application in the same manner as an application for a
new license. Transfer of 25% or more of the stock of a corporation or of a
controlling interest of it, whichever is less, will be deemed a transfer of the
license.
      (2)   If the licensee is a corporation that is wholly owned by another
corporation, the same provisions about the transfer of a stock or a controlling
interest will apply to that parent corporation, any second parent corporation
that wholly owns the parent corporation, and all other similarly situated
parent corporations up through the chain of ownership.
      (3)   Transfer of this amount of stock without prior City Council
approval is a ground for revocation or suspension of the license. In addition,
each day the licensee operates under the license after a transfer has taken
place without obtaining City Council approval will be a separate violation of
this chapter.
   (E)   In the case of the death of a licensee, the personal representative of
a licensee may continue operation of the business for not more than 90 days
after the licensee’s death.
§ 115.11 CONDITIONS OF LICENSE.
   (A)   A license is subject to the conditions in this section, all other
provisions of this chapter, and of other applicable regulations, ordinances or
state laws.
   (B)   A licensee is responsible for the conduct of his or her place of
business and the conditions of order in it. The act of an employee of the
licensed premises is deemed the act of the licensee as well, and the licensee
is liable for all penalties provided by this chapter equally with the employee,
except criminal penalties.
   (C)   The license must be posted in a conspicuous place in the premises for
which it is used.
   (D)   Any designated inspection officer of the city may enter, inspect and

wine or intoxicating liquors.

§ 118.01 PURPOSE.
   The city recognizes a need for an organized inspection program of
residential rental units within the city in order to establish minimum
standards for rental units to meet city and state safety, health, fire and
zoning codes within the city and to provide a more efficient system for
compelling both absentee and local landlords to correct violations and properly
maintain rental property within the city. The city recognizes that the most
efficient system to provide for rental inspections is the creation of a program
requiring the licensing of all residential rental units within the city so that
orderly inspections can be undertaken.

134.99   Penalty
§ 134.01 FINDINGS.
   (A)   Repeat sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence
and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual predators who present an
extreme threat to the public safety. Sexual offenders are extremely likely to
use physical violence and to repeat their offenses. Most sexual offenders
commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported and are
prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of sexual
offender victimization to society at large, while incalculable, clearly
exorbitant.
   (B)   It is the intent of this chapter to serve the city’s compelling
interest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety and welfare of its
citizens by creating a civil, non-punitive regulatory scheme, establishing
areas around locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated
numbers, wherein certain sexual offenders and sexual predators are prohibited
from establishing temporary or permanent residence.
(Prior Code, § 965.01)
§ 134.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply

a public utility corporation holding a franchise from the city. The bond must
be conditioned that the holder will perform the work in accordance with the
applicable regulations, will indemnify and save harmless the city from all
damage caused in the execution of such work or costs in connection with the
repair of the streets or alleys excavated, and that the holder will pay any and
all damages that will be suffered by the city by reason of the failure of the
person securing the permit to observe the terms of this subchapter or by reason
of negligence in the execution of the work.

(Prior Code, § 800.19) Penalty, see §

§ 154.010 HARDSHIP ASSESSMENT DEFERRAL.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. In accordance with M.S. §§ 435.191 through
435.195, as may be amended from time to time, this section is adopted by the
City Council for the purpose of deferring the payment of special assessments
for any homestead property located in the city that is:
      (1)   Owned by a person 65 years of age or older or retired by virtue of
a permanent and total disability for whom it would be a hardship to make the
payments; or
      (2)   Owned by a person who is a member of the Minnesota National Guard
or other military reserves who is ordered into active military service, as
defined in M.S. § 190.05, subd. 5b or 5c, as may be amended from time to time,
as stated in the person's military orders, for whom it would be a hardship to
make the payments.
   (B)   Standards for deferment.
      (1)   The City Administrator is hereby authorized to record the deferment
of special assessments where the following conditions are met.
         (a)   The applicant must be 65 years of age or older, or retired by
virtue of permanent and total disability, or a member of the Minnesota National
Guard or other military reserves who is ordered into active military service.
         (b)   The applicant must be the owner of the property.
         (c)   The applicant must occupy the property as his or her principal
place of residence.
         (d)   The average annual payment for assessments levied against the
subject property exceed one percent of the adjusted gross income of the
applicant, as evidenced by the applicant’s most recent Federal income tax
return (excluding the above-mentioned military situation). The average annual
payment of an assessment shall be the total cost of the assessment divided by
the number of years over which it is spread.
      (2)   The deferment shall be granted for as long a period of time as the
hardship exists and the conditions aforementioned have been met. However, it
shall be the duty of the applicant to notify the City Administrator of any
change in status that would affect eligibility for deferment.
      (3)   Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the determination of
hardship on the basis of exceptional and unusual circumstances not covered by
the standards and guidelines, where the determination is made in a
nondiscriminatory manner and does not give the applicant an unreasonable
preference or advantage over other applicants.
   (C)   Procedure to obtain deferred assessment. The homeowner shall make
application for deferred payment of special assessments on forms prescribed by
the city in which the homestead is located. Where the deferred assessment is
granted, the city shall record a notice thereof with the County Recorder who
shall set forth the amount of the assessment. The city may determine by
ordinance or resolution the amount of interest, if any, on the deferred
assessment, and this rate shall be recorded by the Auditor, along with and in
the same manner as the amount of the assessment.
   (D)   Termination of right to deferred payment.
      (1)   The option to defer the payment of special assessments shall
terminate and all amounts accumulated, plus applicable interest, shall become
due upon the occurrence of any of the following events:
         (a)   The death of the owner, provided that the spouse is otherwise
not eligible for the benefits hereunder;
         (b)   The sale, transfer or subdivision of the property or any part
thereof;
         (c)   If the property should for any reason lose its homestead status;
         (d)   The servicemember is no longer on active military service; or
         (e)   If for any reason the taxing authority deferring the payments
shall determine that there would be no hardship to require immediate or partial
payment.
      (2)   The entire amount of deferred special assessments shall be due
within 60 days after loss of eligibility by the applicant. If the deferred
special assessment is not paid within the 60 days, the City Administrator shall
add thereto interest at a per-annum interest rate of two percent above the bond
interest rate, and the total amount of principal and interest shall be
certified to the County Auditor for collection with taxes the following year.
Should the applicant demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Council that full
repayment of the deferred special assessment would cause the applicant
particular undue financial hardship, the city will certify the entire amount of
the deferred special assessments to the County Auditor to be paid according to
the terms and conditions of the original special assessments.
(Ord. 20240612-01, passed 6-12-2024)
PARK DEDICATION
§ 154.020 DEDICATION REQUIRED.
   (A)   As a condition of approval of any plat, replat, subdivision or lot
division allowing development of land for residential, commercial, industrial
or other uses or combination thereof, a reasonable portion of the land to be
divided must be dedicated to the public or preserved for public use as parks,
playgrounds, trails or open space.
   (B)   This requirement applies to plats, replats, subdivisions or lot
divisions that:
      (1)   Create at least one additional lot or provide for at least one
additional dwelling unit;
      (2)   Combine lots for the purpose of development involving changed or
mixed land uses or the intensification of uses; or
      (3)   Consist of a planned unit development as defined and regulated by
the Zoning Code.
   (C)   The dedication requirements are not satisfied if the city reasonably
determines that the land proposed for dedication is unsuitable for public
recreational use. The dedication required by this subchapter is in addition to
dedication required for streets, roads, utilities, storm water ponding areas,
or similar utilities and improvements.
(Prior Code, § 510.01)
§ 154.021 AMOUNT REQUIRED.
   (A)   The amount of land required for dedication is based upon the gross
land area to be subdivided and equals the land the city reasonably finds it
will need to acquire for park or other recreational purposes as a result of
approval of the land division.
   (B)   Generally, 10% of the gross land area to be subdivided must be
dedicated for residential subdivisions and 5% for commercial and industrial
subdivisions.
(Prior Code, § 510.03)
§ 154.022 CASH PAYMENT IN LIEU OF DEDICATION.
   (A)   The city may require a cash payment in lieu of land dedication.
   (B)   In determining to require payment or dedication, the Council will
consider such factors as whether the land is needed in the proposed location,
whether the proposed dedication is suitable for the intended use, and whether a
cash payment would be more beneficial to development of the entire park system.
(Prior Code, § 510.05)
§ 154.023 AMOUNT OF CASH PAYMENT.
   (A)   The cash payment in lieu of dedication is determined by the fair
market value of the undivided land as determined by the City Assessor at the
time of final plat approval, including the value added by existing utilities,
streets and other public improvements serving the property, but excluding the
value added by all other existing improvements to the land.
   (B)   The cash payment is determined by applying the appropriate percentage
stated in §
154.021 of this chapter to the fair market value as determined by the Assessor.
The maximum cash payment is $400 for each dwelling unit in residential
subdivisions and $400 per acre in commercial and industrial subdivisions, or
other such amounts as shall be set by the City Council from time to time.
(Prior Code, § 510.07)
§ 154.024 PARK AND OPEN SPACE FUND.
   Cash payments in lieu of dedication are payable at the time of final

way permits and administration. This chapter imposes reasonable regulation on
the placement and maintenance of facilities and equipment currently within the
city’s rights-of-way or to be placed therein at some future time. It is
intended to complement the regulatory roles of state and federal agencies.
Under this chapter, persons excavating and obstructing the rights-of-way will
bear financial responsibility for their work through the recovery of out-of-
pocket and projected costs from persons using the public rights-of-way.
   (C)   This chapter is to be interpreted consistently with Laws 1997, Chapter

7819.9950, where possible. To the extent that any provision of this chapter
cannot be interpreted consistently with the Minnesota Rules, the interpretation
most consistent with the Act and other applicable statutory and case law is
intended.

      (2)   In rendering a decision on a consolidated permit application, the
city may approve some small wireless facilities and deny others, but may not
use denial of one or more permits as a basis to deny all small wireless
facilities in the application.
   (C)   Tolling of deadline. The 90-day deadline for action on a small
wireless facility permit application may be tolled if:
      (1)   The city receives applications from one or more applicants seeking
approval of permits for more than 30 small wireless facilities within a seven-
day period. In such case, the city may extend the deadline for all such
applications by 30 days by informing the affected applicants in writing of the
extension.
      (2)   The applicant fails to submit all required documents or information
and the city provides written notice of incompleteness to the applicant within
30 days of receipt the application. Upon submission of additional documents or
information, the city shall have ten days to notify the applicant in writing of
any still-missing information.
      (3)   The city and a small wireless facility applicant agree in writing
to toll the review period.

§ 155.27 PERMIT FEES.
   (A)   Fee schedule and fee allocation.
      (1)   The city’s permit fee schedule is available to the public and
established in advance where reasonably possible.
      (2)   The permit fees are designed to recover the city’s actual costs
incurred in managing the right-of-way and are based on an allocation among all
users of the right-of-way, including the city.
   (B)   Utility permit fee. The city must establish a utility permit fee in an
amount sufficient to recover the following costs:
      (1)   City management costs; and
      (2)   Degradation costs, if applicable.
   (C)   Obstruction permit fee. The city must establish the obstruction permit
fee in an amount sufficient to recover the city management costs.
   (D)   Small wireless facility permit fee. The city shall impose a small
wireless facility permit fee in an amount sufficient to recover:
      (1)   Management costs; and
      (2)   City engineering, make-ready and construction costs associated with
collocation of small wireless facilities.
   (E)   Payment of permit fees. A utility permit or obstruction permit may not
be issued without payment of excavation or obstruction permit fees.
   (F)   Non-refundable. Permit fees paid for a permit that the city has
revoked for a breach as stated in §
163.326 are not refundable.
   (G)   Application to franchises. Unless otherwise agreed to in a franchise,
management costs may be charged separately from and in addition to the
franchise fees imposed on a right-of-way user in the franchise.
(Prior Code, § 835.23) (Ord. 2004-04, passed 9-15-2004; Ord. 20171101-01,
passed 11-1-2017)
§ 155.28 RIGHT-OF-WAY PATCHING AND RESTORATION.
   (A)   Timing. Work to be done under the excavation permit and the patching
and restoration of the right-of-way as required herein must be completed within
the dates specified in the permit, increased by as many days as work could not
be done because of circumstances beyond the control of the permittee or when
work was prohibited as unseasonal or unreasonable.
   (B)   Patch and restoration. The permittee must patch its own work. The city
may choose either to have the permittee restore the surface and subgrading
portions of right-of-way or to restore the surface portion of right-of-way
itself.
   (C)   Permittee restoration. If the permittee restores the right-of-way
itself, it must at the time of application for an excavation permit post a
construction performance bond in accordance with the provisions of Minn. Rules
part 7819.3000.
   (D)   City restoration. If the city restores the surface portion of right-
of-way, the permittee must pay the costs thereof within 30 days of billing. If,
following the restoration, the pavement settles or otherwise fails for reasons
not caused by city’s failure to properly restore, the permittee shall pay to
the city, within 30 days of billing, all costs associated with correcting the
defective work.
   (E)   Degradation fee in lieu of restoration. In lieu of right-of-way
restoration, a right-of-way user may elect to pay a degradation fee. However,
the right-of-way user remains responsible for replacing and compacting the
subgrade and aggregate based material in the excavation and the degradation fee
will not include the cost to accomplish these responsibilities.
   (F)   Standards. The permittee must perform patching and restoration
according to the standards and with the materials specified by the city and
comply with Minn. Rules part 7819.1100. In exercising authority over
restoration, the Director is to be guided by the following standards and
considerations:
      (1)   The number, size, depth and duration of the excavations,
disruptions or damage to the right-of-way;
      (2)   The traffic volume carried by the right-of-way; the character of
the neighborhood surrounding the right-of-way;
      (3)   The pre-excavation condition of the right-of-way; the remaining
life-expectancy of the right-of-way affected by the excavation;
      (4)   Whether the relative cost of the method of restoration to the
permit holder is in reasonable balance with the prevention of an accelerated
depreciation of the right-of-way that would otherwise result from the exaction,
disturbance or damage to the right-of-way; and
      (5)   The likelihood that the particular method of restoration would be
effective in slowing the depreciation of the right-of-way that would otherwise
take place.
   (G)   Duty to correct defects. The permittee must correct defects in
patching, or restoration performed by the permittee or its agents. Upon
notification from the city, the permittee shall correct all restoration work to
the extent necessary, using the method required by the city. Unless otherwise
agreed to by the Director, the work must be commenced within two days of
receipt of the notice from the city and be completed within 14 days of
commencement of work, not including days during which work cannot be done
because of circumstances constituting force majeure or days when work is
prohibited as unseasonal or unreasonable.
   (H)   Failure to restore.
      (1)   If the permittee fails to restore the right-of-way in the manner
and to the condition required by the city, or fails to satisfactorily and
timely complete all restoration required by the city, the city must notify the
permittee in writing of the specific alleged failure or failures and allow the
permittee five days from receipt of written notice to cure the failure or
failures, unless otherwise extended by the Director.
      (2)   In the event the permittee fails to cure, the city may perform the
necessary work and permittee must pay to the city, within 30 days of billing,
the cost of restoring the right-of-way.
      (3)   If permittee fails to pay as required, the city may exercise its
rights under the construction performance bond.

passed 11-1-2017)
§ 155.29 JOINT AND INDIVIDUAL APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   Joint trenching. Director may require registrants to jointly apply for
permits to excavate or obstruct the right-of-way at the same place and time.
   (B)   Fees. Registrants who apply for permits for the same obstruction or
excavation, which the city does not perform, may share in the payment of the
obstruction or utility permit fee as established by the city for joint
trenching. Registrants must agree among themselves as to the portion each will
pay and indicate the same on their applications.
   (C)   With city projects. Registrants in a scheduled obstruction or
excavation performed by the city, whether or not it is a joint application by
two or more registrants or a single application, are not required to pay the
utility or obstruction and degradation portions of the permit fee, but a permit
is required.

§ 155.30 SUPPLEMENTARY APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   Limitation on area. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the area
of the right-of-way specified in the permit. A permittee may not do any work
outside the area specified in the permit, except as provided herein. A
permittee who determines that an area greater than that specified in the permit
must be obstructed or excavated must before working in that greater area:
      (1)   Make application for a permit extension and pay any additional fees
required thereby; and
      (2)   Be granted a new permit or permit extension.
   (B)   Limitation on dates. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the dates
specified in the permit. A permittee may not begin work before the permit start
date or, except as provided herein, continue working after the end date. Except
in the case of verbal extensions by the Director, if a permittee does not
finish the work by the permit end date, it must apply for a new permit for the
additional time it needs, and receive the new permit or an extension of the old
permit before working after the end date of the previous permit. This
supplementary application must be submitted before the permit end date.

§ 155.31 DENIAL OR REVOCATION OF PERMIT.
   (A)   Reasons for denial. The city may deny a permit for failure to meet the
requirements and conditions of this chapter or if the city determines that the
denial is necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare or when necessary
to protect the right-of-way and its current use or for the following specific
violations:
      (1)   Failure to register;
      (2)   A proposed excavation within a street or sidewalk surface that has
been constructed or reconstructed within the preceding five years, unless the
Director determines that no other locations are feasible or when necessitated
by emergency;
      (3)   The applicant is subject to revocation of a prior permit issued
pursuant to this chapter;
      (4)   The proposed schedule for the work would conflict or interfere with
an exhibition, celebration, festival or any other similar event;
      (5)   The right-of-way would become unduly congested due to the proposed
facilities and equipment when combined with other uses in the right-of-way;
and/or
      (6)   Businesses or residences in the vicinity will be unreasonably
disrupted.
   (B)   Procedural requirements. The denial or revocation of a permit must be
made in writing and must document the basis for the denial. The city must
notify the applicant or right-of-way user in writing, within three business
days of the decision to deny or revoke a permit. If an application is denied,
the right-of-way user may address the reasons for denial identified by the city
and resubmit its application. If the application is resubmitted within 30 days
of receipt of the notice of denial, no additional application fee shall be
imposed. The city must approve or deny the resubmitted application within 30
days after submission.
(Prior Code, § 835.33) (Ord. 2004-04, passed 9-15-2004; Ord. 20171101-01,
passed 11-1-2017)
§ 155.32 INSTALLATION AND INSPECTIONS.
   (A)   The excavation, backfilling, patching and restoration, and all other
work performed in the right-of-way must be done in conformance with Minn. Rules
parts 7819.1100, 7819.5000 and 7819.5100 and other applicable local
requirements, such as the city standard specifications and details, in so far
as they are not inconsistent with the M.S. §§ 237.162 and 237.163, as they may
be amended from time to time.
(Prior Code, § 835.35)
   (B)   (1)   Site inspection. The permittee must make the work-site available
to the city and to all others as authorized by law for inspection at all
reasonable times during the execution of and upon completion of the work.
      (2)   Authority of Director. At the time of inspection, the Director may
order the immediate cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the
life, health, safety or well-being of the public. The Director may issue an
order to the permittee to correct any work that does not conform to the terms
of the permit or other applicable standards, conditions or code. If the work
failure is a “substantial breach” within the meaning of M.S. § 237.163, subd. 4
(c), as it may be amended from time to time, the order must state that failure
to correct the violation will be cause for revocation of the permit after a
specified period determined by the Director. The permittee shall present proof
to the Director that the violation has been corrected within the time period
set forth by the Director in the order. The proof shall be provided no later
than the next business day following the day of completion. If such proof has
not been presented within the required time, the Director may revoke the
permit.
      (3)   Standards during construction or installation. The permit holder
shall comply with the following standards when engaging in the work:
         (a)   Take such precautions as are necessary to avoid creating
unsanitary conditions. Observe and comply with all laws, rules and regulations
of the state;
         (b)   Conduct the operation and perform the work in a manner as to
ensure the least obstruction and interference to traffic;
         (c)   Take adequate precautions to ensure the safety of the general
public and those who require access to abutting property;
         (d)   If required by the Director, notify adjoining property owners
prior to the commencement of work which may disrupt the use of and access to
such adjoining properties;
         (e)   In all cases where construction work interferes with the normal
use of the construction area, provide for closing the construction area to
traffic or to afford it restricted use of the area and comply with Minnesota
Manual of Uniform Traffic-Control Devices traffic safety signing requirements;
         (f)   Exercise precaution at all times for the protection of persons,
including employees and property;
         (g)   Protect and identify excavations and work operations with
barricade flags, and if required, by flaggers in the daytime, and by warning
lights at night;
         (h)   Provide proper trench protection as required by Occupational
Health and Safety Administration when necessary and depending upon the type of
soil, in order to prevent cave-ins endangering life or tending to enlarge the
excavation;
         (i)   Protect the root growth of trees and shrubbery;
         (j)   Installation of pipe (utility conductors) under portland cement
concrete, asphalt concrete or other high-type bituminous pavements must be done
by jacking, auguring or tunneling as directed by the engineer unless otherwise
authorized. High density polyethylene sleeving shall be an acceptable casing or
sleeving material for telecommunications installations; and
         (k)   When removing pavement of portland cement concrete, asphalt
concrete or high-type built-up bituminous surfacing, the pavement must be
removed on each side of the trench or excavation a distance of nine inches
beyond the trench width and length, in order to provide a shoulder and solid
foundation for the surface restoration.

(Ord. 2004-04, passed 9-15-2004; Ord. 20171101-01, passed 11-1-2017)
§ 155.33 WORK DONE WITHOUT A PERMIT.
   (A)   Emergency situations. A registrant must immediately notify the
Director of any event regarding its facilities that the registrant considers to
be an emergency. The registrant may proceed to take whatever actions are
necessary to respond to the emergency. Within two business days after the
occurrence of the emergency, unless the Director allows a longer time, the
registrant must apply for the necessary permits, pay the fees associated
therewith and fulfill the rest of the requirements necessary to bring itself
into compliance with this chapter for the actions it took in response to the
emergency. If the Director concludes that a registrant is required to perform
work at the facility solely because of an emergency created by another
registrant and the work is performed in the immediate area of the emergency
work, the Director may waive the permit otherwise required by the registrant
called to the emergency created by another party.
   (B)   Contact; safety. If the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding a
registrant’s facilities, the city will contact the registrant’s emergency phone
number as registered with the city or listed in the phone directory. The city
will make the area safe, as necessary. If there is no response from the
registrant, the city may take whatever action it deems necessary to respond to
the emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the permittee or registrant
whose facilities occasioned the emergency.
   (C)   Non-emergency situations. Except in an emergency, a person who,
without first having obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or excavates a
right-of-way must subsequently obtain a permit, pay an unauthorized work permit
fee in an amount established from time to time by the City Council, deposit
with the city the fees necessary to correct any damage to the right-of-way and
comply with all of the requirements of this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 835.39) (Ord. 2004-04, passed 9-15-2004; Ord. 20171101-01,
passed 11-1-2017)
§ 155.34 SUPPLEMENTARY NOTIFICATION.
   If the obstruction or excavation of the right-of-way begins later or ends
sooner than the date given on the permit, the permittee shall notify the city
by supplementary application of the accurate information as soon as this
information is known.
(Prior Code, § 835.41) (Ord. 2004-04, passed 9-15-2004; Ord. 20171101-01,
passed 11-1-2017)
§ 155.35 REVOCATION OF PERMITS.
   (A)   Substantial breach. The city may revoke any right-of-way permit,
without a fee refund, if there is a substantial breach of the terms and
conditions of any statute, ordinance, rule or regulation, or any material
condition of the permit. A substantial breach by the permittee includes, but is
not limited to, the following:
      (1)   The violation of any material provision of the right-of-way permit;
      (2)   An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the right-
of-way permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit
upon the city or its citizens;
      (3)   Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a
right-of-way permit;
      (4)   The failure to complete the work in a timely manner; unless a
permit extension is obtained or unless the failure to complete work is due to
reasons beyond the permittee’s control; or
      (5)   The failure to correct, in a timely manner, work that does not
conform to a condition indicated on an order issued by the Director.
   (B)   Written notice of breach. If the city determines that the permittee
has committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any statute,
ordinance, rule, regulation or any condition of the permit the city must make a
written demand upon the permittee to remedy the violation. The demand must
state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. A
substantial breach, as stated above, will allow the city to place additional or
revised conditions on the permit to mitigate and remedy the breach.
   (C)   Response to notice of breach. Within a time established by the
Director following the permittee’s receipt of notification of the breach, the
permittee shall provide the city with a plan to cure the breach, acceptable to
the city. The permittee’s failure to submit a timely and acceptable plan, or
the permittee’s failure to timely implement the approved plan is grounds for
immediate revocation of the permit.
   (D)   Reimbursement of city costs. If a permit is revoked, the permittee
must also reimburse the city for the city’s reasonable costs, including
restoration costs and the costs of collection and reasonable attorneys’ fees
incurred in connection with the revocation.
(Prior Code, § 835.43) (Ord. 2004-04, passed 9-15-2004; Ord. 20171101-01,

CONDITIONS, OBLIGATIONS AND REGULATIONS
§ 155.50 COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER LAWS.
   Obtaining a right-of-way permit does not relieve the permittee of its duty
to obtain all other necessary permits, licenses, and authority and to pay all
fees required by the city or other applicable rule, law or regulation. A
permittee shall comply with all requirements of local, state and federal laws,
including M.S. §§ 216D.01 through 216D.09 (Gopher One Call Excavation Notice
System), as they may be amended from time to time. A permittee must perform all
work in conformance with all applicable codes and established rules and
regulations, and is responsible for all work done in the right-of-way pursuant
to its permit, regardless of who does the work.
(Prior Code, § 835.31) (Ord. 2004-04, passed 9-15-2004; Ord. 20171101-01,
passed 11-1-2017)
§ 155.51 PROHIBITED WORK.
   Except in an emergency, or with the approval of the city, no right-of-way
obstruction or excavation may be done when seasonally prohibited or when
conditions are unreasonable for the work.
(Prior Code, § 835.31) (Ord. 2004-04, passed 9-15-2004; Ord. 20171101-01,
passed 11-1-2017)
§ 155.52 INTERFERENCE WITH RIGHT-OF-WAY.
   A permittee may not so obstruct a right-of-way that the natural free and
clear passage of water through the gutters or other waterways will be
interfered with, unless otherwise approved by the Director. Private vehicles of
those doing work in the right-of-way may not be parked within or next to a
permit area, unless parked in conformance with city parking regulations. The
loading or unloading of trucks must be done solely within the defined permit
area unless specifically authorized by the permit.
(Prior Code, § 835.31) (Ord. 2004-04, passed 9-15-2004; Ord. 20171101-01,

§ 155.54 MAPPING DATA.
   Each registrant and permittee shall provide mapping information in a form
required by the city in accordance with Minn. Rules parts 7819.4000 and
7819.4100. Within 90 days following completion of any work pursuant to a
permit, the permittee shall provide the director accurate maps and drawings
certifying the as-built location of all equipment installed, owned and
maintained by the permittee. The maps and drawings shall include the horizontal
location and the approximate vertical location, to the extent known of all
facilities and equipment and shall be provided consistent with the city’s
electronic mapping system. Failure to provide maps and drawings pursuant to
this section is grounds for revoking the permit holder’s registration.
(Prior Code, § 835.45) (Ord. 2004-04, passed 9-15-2004; Ord. 20171101-01,

§ 155.55 UNDERGROUNDING.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   The purpose of this section is to promote the health, safety and
general welfare of the public and is intended to foster:
         (a)   Safe travel over the right-of-way;
         (b)   Non-travel related safety around homes and buildings where
overhead feeds are connected; and
         (c)   Orderly development in the city.
      (2)   Location and relocation, installation and reinstallation of
facilities in the right-of-way or in or on other public ground must be made in
accordance with this section. This section is intended to be enforced
consistently with state and federal law regulating right-of-way users,
specifically including but not limited to M.S. §§ 161.45, 237.162, 237.163,
301B.01, 222.37, 238.084 and 216B.36, as they may be amended from time to time,
and the Telecommunications Act of 1996, 47 U.S.C. § 253.
   (B)   Undergrounding of facilities.
      (1)   If the city finds that one or more of the purposes set forth in
division (A) above would be promoted, the city may require newly installed or
constructed facilities in the public right-of-way or in other public property
held in common for public use to be located and maintained underground pursuant
to the terms and conditions of this chapter and in accordance with applicable
construction standards, subject to the exceptions below.
      (2)   Above-ground installation, construction, modification or
replacement of meters, gauges, transformers, street lighting, pad mount
switches, capacitor banks, re-closers and service connection pedestals are
allowed.
      (3)   The requirements of this division (B) shall apply equally outside
of the corporate limits of the city coincident with city jurisdiction of
platting, subdivision regulation or comprehensive planning as may now or in the
future be allowed by law.
   (C)   Undergrounding of permanent replacement, relocated or reconstructed
facilities. If the city finds that one or more of the purposes set forth in
division (A) above would be promoted, the city may require a permanent
replacement, relocation or reconstruction of a facility of more than 300 feet
to be located, and maintained underground, with due regard for seasonal working
conditions. For purposes of this chapter, RECONSTRUCTION means any substantial
repair of or any improvement to existing facilities. Undergrounding may be
required whether a replacement, relocation or reconstruction is initiated by
the right-of-way user owning or operating the facilities, or by the city in
connection with:
      (1)   The present or future use by the city or other local government
unit of the right-of-way or other public ground for a public project;
      (2)   The public health or safety; or
      (3)   The safety and convenience of travel over the right-of-way.
   (D)   Exceptions to undergrounding. The following exceptions to the strict
application of this section will be allowed upon the conditions stated:
      (1)   Transmission lines. Above-ground installation, construction or
placement of those facilities commonly referred to as “high voltage
transmission lines” shall be allowed unless the council requires undergrounding
of the facilities after providing the right-of-way user notice and an
opportunity to be heard. This provision is not to be construed as waiving the
requirements of any other ordinance or regulation of the city as the same may
apply to any such proposed project.
      (2)   Technical/economic feasibility; promotion of policy. Above-ground
installation, construction or placement of facilities shall be allowed in
residential, commercial and industrial areas where the council, following
consideration and recommendation by the Planning Commission, finds that:
         (a)   Underground placement would place an undue financial burden upon
the landowner, ratepayers or right-of-way user or would deprive the landowner
of the preservation and enjoyment of substantial property rights;
         (b)   Underground placement is impractical or not technically feasible
due to topographical, subsoil or other existing conditions which adversely
affect underground facilities placement; or
         (c)   The right-of-way user clearly and convincingly demonstrates that
none of the purposes under division (A) above would be advanced by underground
placement of facilities on the project in question, or the city determines on
its own review that undergrounding is not warranted based on the circumstances
of the proposed undergrounding.
      (3)   Temporary service. Above-ground installation, construction or
placement of temporary service lines shall only be allowed:
         (a)   During new construction of any project for a period not to
exceed three months;
         (b)   During an emergency in order to safeguard lives or property
within the city; or
         (c)   For a period of not more than seven months when soil conditions
make excavation impractical.
   (E)   Retirement of overhead facilities. The City Council may determine
whether it is in the public interest that all facilities within the city, or
facilities within certain districts designated by the city, be permanently
placed and maintained underground by a date certain or target date,
independently of undergrounding required pursuant to this code (new facilities)
and §
155.55(C) (replacement facilities). The decision to underground must be
preceded by a public hearing, after published notice and written notice to the
utilities affected (two weeks’ published; 30 days’ written.) At the hearing,
the Council must consider§
155.55(G)(1) through (G)(4) and make findings. Undergrounding may not take
place until City Council has, after hearing and notice, adopted a plan as
provided in division (H) below.
   (F)   Public hearings. A hearing must be open to the public and may be
continued from time to time. At each hearing, any person interested must be
given an opportunity to be heard. The subject of the public hearings will be
the issue of whether facilities in the right-of-way in the city, or located
within a certain district, are to be located underground by a date certain.
Hearings are not necessary for the undergrounding required under this section.
   (G)   Public hearing issues. The issues to be addressed at the public
hearings include, but are not limited to:
      (1)   The costs and benefits to the public of requiring the
undergrounding of all facilities in the right-of-way;
      (2)   The feasibility and cost of undergrounding all facilities by a date
certain as determined by the city and the affected utilities;
      (3)   The tariff requirements, procedure and rate design for recovery or
intended recovery of incremental costs for undergrounding by the utilities from
ratepayers with the city; and
      (4)   Alternative financing options available if the city deems it in the
public interest to require undergrounding by a date certain and deems it
appropriate to participate in the cost otherwise borne by the rate payers.
   (H)   Undergrounding plan. If the Council finds that it is in the public
interest to underground all or substantially all facilities in the public
right-of-way or in non-right-of-way public ground, the Council must establish a
plan for such undergrounding. The plan for undergrounding must include at least
the following elements:
      (1)   Timetable for the undergrounding;
      (2)   Designation of districts for the undergrounding unless the
undergrounding plan is citywide;
      (3)   Exceptions to the undergrounding requirement and procedure for
establishing such exceptions;
      (4)   Procedures for the undergrounding process, including, but not
limited to, coordination with city projects and provisions to ensure compliance
with non-discrimination requirements under the law;
      (5)   A financing plan for funding of the incremental costs, if the city
determines that it will finance some of the undergrounding costs, and a
determination and verification of the claimed additional costs to underground
incurred by the utility; and
      (6)   Penalties or other remedies for failure to comply with the
undergrounding.
   (I)   Developer responsibility. Owners, platters or developers are
responsible for complying with the requirements of this section, and prior to
final approval of any plat or development plan, must submit to the Director
written instruments from the appropriate right-of-way users showing that all
necessary arrangements with those users for installation of the facilities have
been made.
(Prior Code, § 835.47) (Ord. 2004-04, passed 9-15-2004; Ord. 20171101-01,
passed 11-1-2017)
§ 155.56 LOCATION AND RELOCATION OF FACILITIES.
   (A)   Rule. Placement, location and relocation of facilities must comply
with the Act, with other applicable law, and with Minn. Rules parts 7819.3100,
7819.5000 and 7819.5100, to the extent the rules do not limit authority
otherwise available to cities.
   (B)   Relocation schedule notification procedure. The Director shall notify
the utility owner at least three months in advance of the need to relocate
existing facilities so the owner can determine if relocation or replacement is
required and plan any required work. The Director shall provide a second
notification to the owner one month before the owner needs to begin the
relocation and the date by which the relocation must be completed. To the
extent technically feasible, all utilities shall be relocated within one month
or in a time frame determined by the Director. The Director may allow a
different schedule if it does not interfere with the city’s project. The
utility owner shall diligently work to relocate the facilities within the above
schedule.
   (C)   Delay to city project. If the owner fails to meet the relocation
schedule due to circumstances within the utility’s control, the city may charge
the utility owner for all costs incurred by the city because the relocation is
not completed in the scheduled time frame.
   (D)   Joint Trenching. All facilities must be placed in appropriate portions
of right-of-way so as to cause minimum conflict with other underground
facilities. When technically appropriate and no safety hazards are created, all
utilities must be installed, constructed or placed within the same trench.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, gas and electric lines shall be placed in
conformance with Minn. Rules part 7819.5100, subpart 2, governing safety
standards.
   (E)   Corridors. The city may assign a specific area within the right-of-
way, or any particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of
facilities that are or, pursuant to current technology, the city expects will
be located within the right-of-way. All excavation, obstruction or other
permits issued by the city involving the installation or replacement of
facilities shall designate the proper corridor for the facilities at issue. A
typical crossing-section of the location for utilities may be on file at the
Director’s office. This division (E) is not intended to establish “high density
corridors”.
   (F)   Prior location of facilities. A registrant who has facilities in the
right-of-way in a position at variance with the corridors established by the
city may remain at that location until the city requires facilities relocation
to the corridor pursuant to relocation authority granted under Minn. Rules part
7819.3100 or other applicable law.
   (G)   Limitation of space.
      (1)   To protect the public health, safety and welfare or when necessary
to protect the right-of-way and its current use, the city may prohibit or limit
the placement of new or additional facilities within the right-of-way.
      (2)   In making such decisions, the city will strive to the extent
possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the right-of-way,
but will be guided primarily by considerations of the public interest, the
public’s needs for the particular utility service, the condition of the right-
of-way, the time of year with respect to essential utilities, the protection of
existing facilities in the right-of-way and future city plans for public
improvements and development projects that have been determined to be in the
public interest.

passed 11-1-2017)
§ 155.57 PRE-EXCAVATION FACILITIES LOCATION.
   (A)   In addition to complying with the requirements of M.S. §§ 216D.01
through 216D.09 (“One Call Excavation Notice System”), as they may be amended
from time to time, before the start date of any right-of-way excavation, each
registrant who has facilities or equipment in the area to be excavated is
responsible to mark the horizontal placement of the facilities, to the extent
technically feasible.
   (B)   To the extent its records contain the information, each registrant
must provide information regarding the approximate vertical location of their
facilities to excavators upon request. Nothing in this section is meant to
limit the rights, duties and obligations of the facility owners or excavators
as set forth in M.S. §§ 216D.01 through 216D.09, as they may be amended from
time to time.
(Prior Code, § 835.51) (Ord. 2004-04, passed 9-15-2004; Ord. 20171101-01,
passed 11-1-2017)
§ 155.58 INTERFERENCE BY OTHER FACILITIES.
   (A)   When the city does work in the right-of-way in its governmental right-
of-way management function and finds it necessary to maintain, support or move
a registrant’s facilities to carry out the work without damaging registrant’s
facilities, the city must notify the local representative as early as is
reasonably possible.
   (B)   The city costs associated therewith will be billed to that registrant
and must be paid within 30 days from the date of billing.
   (C)   Each registrant shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any
facilities in the right-of-way which it or its facilities damages.
(Prior Code, § 835.53) (Ord. 2004-04, passed 9-15-2004; Ord. 20171101-01,
passed 11-1-2017)
§ 155.59 RIGHT-OF-WAY VACATION; RESERVATION OF RIGHT.
   (A)   Reservation of right. If the city vacates a right-of-way that contains
the equipment of a registrant, and if the vacation does not require the
relocation of registrant facilities and equipment, the city will reserve, to
and for itself and all registrants having facilities and equipment in the
vacated right-of-way, the right to install, maintain and operate any facilities
and equipment in the vacated right-of-way and to enter upon such right-of-way
at any time for the purpose of reconstruction, inspecting, maintaining or
repairing the same.
   (B)   Relocation of equipment. If the vacation requires the relocation of
registrant facilities and equipment, and:
      (1)   If the vacation proceedings are initiated by the registrant, the
registrant must pay the relocation costs;
      (2)   If the vacation proceedings are initiated by the city, the
registrant must pay the relocation costs unless otherwise agreed to by the city
and the registrant; or
      (3)   If the vacation proceedings are initiated by a person or persons
other than the registrant or permit holder, such other person or persons must
pay the relocation costs.

passed 11-1-2017)
§ 155.60 INDEMNIFICATION AND LIABILITY.
   By registering with the city, or by accepting a permit under this chapter, a
registrant or permittee agrees to defend and indemnify the city in accordance
with the provisions of Minn. Rules part 7819.1250.

§ 155.61 ABANDONED FACILITIES.
   (A)   Discontinued operations. A registrant who has decided to discontinue
all or a portion of its operations in the city must provide information
satisfactory to the city that the registrant’s obligations for its facilities
in the right-of-way under this chapter have been lawfully assumed by another
registrant.
   (B)   Removal. Any registrant who has abandoned facilities in any right-of-
way shall remove them from that right-of-way pursuant to Minn. Rules part
7819.3300, unless the requirement is waived by the Director.

SHADE TREE DISEASE CONTROL
§ 156.20 DECLARATION OF POLICY.
   The City Council has determined that the health of the shade trees within
the city limits is threatened by shade tree diseases. It has further determined
that the loss of shade trees growing upon public and private property would
substantially depreciate the value of property within the city and impair the
safety, good order, general welfare and convenience of the public. It is the
intention of the Council to control and prevent the spread of these diseases,
and this subchapter is enacted for that purpose, and to conform to the policies
and procedures embodied in M.S. §§ 89.51 through 89.66, as they may be amended
from time to time, and rules promulgated thereunder.

each day during which a violation occurs or continues.
      (4) The failure of any officer or employee of the city to perform any
official duty imposed by this code shall not subject the officer or employee to
the penalty imposed for a violation.
      (5)   In addition to any penalties provided for in this section, if any
person, firm or corporation fails to comply with any provision of this code,
the City Council or any city official designated by it may institute
appropriate proceedings at law or at equity to restrain, correct or abate the
violation.

   An application for a permit required under this chapter must be reviewed by
the City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer before the permit is granted. The City
Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer may review procedures to determine if they are in
accordance with general public welfare and safety through regular on-site
inspections. The Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer, upon determining the
permittee’s operation creates a serious and immediate safety hazard, may order
the operation ceased for a period of 72 hours. Upon so ordering, a special
meeting of the Council must be called. The permittee’s attendance at this
meeting will be requested. If the Council determines that an immediate safety
hazard exists, the permit may be withdrawn until the permittee complies with
Council directives to eliminate the hazard.
(Prior Code, § 420.15) (Ord. 172, passed 3-16-1994; Ord. 04-1, passed 3-3-2004;
Ord. 2008-05, passed 5-21-2008)
§ 157.10 MAJOR LAND DISTURBANCE PERMIT OPERATIONS; MINING OPERATIONS.
   (A)   Policy: findings.
      (1)   If it is found and determined that:
         (a)   Certain major land disturbance operations involve mining
activities (herein referred to as “mining operations”) that may pose
substantial threats to the public health, welfare and safety;
         (b)   It is necessary to insure the safe operation of mining
operations in a manner that is consistent with the efficient and economical
conduct of these operations; and
         (c)   Because of the unique nature of each mining operation it is not
feasible to set out precise regulations for such operations dealing with such
matters as slope, angle of repose and set back and each operation must be
viewed individually.
      (2)   Because of these factors, certain mining operations require an
engineering analysis and the development of regulations based on that analysis
and its recommendations. It is the purpose of this chapter to provide for such
analyses and to establish procedures for the implementation of the engineering
analysis and recommendations.
   (B)   Procedures; report to Council. When, in the judgment of the City
Administrator/Clerk- Treasurer, a mining operation presents or will present an
imminent threat to the public health, safety and welfare and that remedial
action may be necessary, the Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer must report that
fact to the City Council together with a preliminary analysis of that threat
and a recommendation that an engineering analysis of the mining operation be
conducted by an engineering firm with special expertise in the matter.
   (C)   Council action. If the Council determines on the basis of the
engineering analysis that remedial action is or may be necessary, the Council
may authorize the Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer to retain a competent
engineering firm to conduct the analysis and to submit the firm’s analysis and
its recommendations to the Council within a reasonable time. The cost of the
engineering analysis is to be borne by the City Council and the operator of the
mining operation in a proportion as the Council deems reasonable. The Council
may, by written order, direct the Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer and the
operator to implement the engineering recommendations with whatever
modifications the Council deems necessary within a time specified in the order.
The cost of the implementation of the recommendations is to be borne by the
operator.
   (D)   Effect; continuing operation. Active permitted mining operation on the
effective date of this chapter may continue. When the Council has ordered an
engineering analysis for a specific mining operation, that operation may
continue until completion of the analysis. If the Council finds and specifies
in its order that the public health and safety is or will be endangered by
continued operation of a specific operation, the operation must cease until
completion of the required remedial action if so specified in the order.
   (E)   Cessation; non-compliance. If a mining operation that has been ordered
to implement an order for remedial action does not complete that action within
the time specified in the order or any extension of that order the
Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer is authorized and directed to order the operation
to cease operation immediately. Failure to comply with an order under this
chapter operates as a revocation of the permit for the operation and is grounds
for denying an application for a permit.

STORM WATER DRAINAGE UTILITY
§ 158.01 ESTABLISHMENT.
   Pursuant to M.S. § 444.075, as it may be amended from time to time, the city
establishes a Storm Water Drainage Utility and authorizes the imposition of
just and reasonable charges for the use of, connection to and availability of
storm drainage facilities. The Storm Water Drainage Utility operation is a part
of the Public Works Department.
(Prior Code, § 720.01) (Ord. 2004-07, passed 10-6-2004; Ord. 2008-12, passed 8-
6-2008)
§ 158.02 FINDINGS AND DETERMINATIONS.
   In the exercise of its government authority and in order to promote the
public health, safety, convenience and general welfare, the city has
constructed, operated and maintained a storm water drainage system. This
subchapter is adopted in the further exercise of such authority and for the
same purposes. The system, as constructed heretofore, has been financed and
paid for through the imposition of special assessments and ad valorem taxes. It
is necessary and desirable to provide an additional method of recovering some
or all of the future costs of improving, establishing, enlarging, replacing,
repairing, maintaining and operating the system through the imposition of
charges as provided in this subchapter. In imposing charges, it is necessary to
establish a methodology that undertakes to make charges just and equitable.
Taking into account the status of completion of the system, past methods of
recovering system costs, the topography of the city and other relevant factors,
it is determined to be just and equitable to assign responsibility for some or
all of the future costs of improving, establishing, enlarging, replacing,
repairing, maintaining and operating the system on the basis of the expected
storm water run-off from the various parcels of land within the city during a
standard rainfall event.
(Prior Code, § 720.03) (Ord. 2004-07, passed 10-6-2004)
§ 158.03 STORM DRAINAGE UTILITY FUND.
   (A)   There is created a Storm Water Drainage Utility Fund into which all
charges, when collected, and all monies received from the sale of any related
facilities or equipment or any byproducts shall be placed. Such monies shall be
used first to pay the normal, reasonable and current costs of operating and
maintaining the facilities.
   (B)   (1)   There is a separate fund created for Storm Water Utility user
fees and storm sewer connection charges collected for properties that utilize
the regional storm water pond located on Outlot A of Thorvigs Addition.
      (2)   A percentage of this fund will be used to reimburse the developer
of Thorvigs Addition for its costs incurred in oversizing the regional storm
water pond on behalf of the city.
(Prior Code, § 720.05) (Ord. 2004-07, passed 10-6-2004; Ord. 2008-12, passed 8-
6-2008)
§ 158.04 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   MONTHLY UTILITY REVENUE. The estimated monthly expenditures for planning and
inventories, capital expenditures, personnel and equipment and operation of the
Storm Water Utility, in accordance with the established city policy.
   STORM SEWER CONNECTION FEE. The fee charged for the connection and
availability of city storm sewer facilities.
   STORM WATER UTILITY USER FEE. The annual user charge developed for each
parcel of land for use of storm sewer facilities. This fee shall be determined
by the City Council, as adjusted from time to time.
   UTILITY FACTOR. The ratio of run-off volume, in inches, for a particular
land use, to the run-off volume, in inches for an average single-family
residential property, assuming a two-inch rainfall and natural resources
conservation services (NRCS) “Type B” soil conditions.
(Prior Code, § 720.07) (Ord. 2004-07, passed 10-6-2004; Ord. 2008-12, passed 8-
6-2008)
§ 158.05 USER FEE FACTORS.
   (A)   The Storm Water Utility user fee is determined by first determining
the percentage of total run- off in the city which is attributed to single-
family residential property. The fee per acre for single-family residential is
computed by computing the product for the run-off percentage and the Storm
Water Utility user fee revenue, divided by the estimated total acres of single-
family residential land use in the city. The per acre fee for all other
individual parcels shall be defined as the product of the single-family
residential per-acre fee, the appropriate utility factor and the total acreage
of the parcel. Single-family residential parcels shall be assessed on a per
household basis.
   (B)   The utility factors for various land uses are shown in the following
table:
Land Use Utility Factor
Land Use                      Utility Factor
Agricultural/cemeteries       Exempt
Commercial                    4.23

§ 158.06 OTHER LAND USES.
   Other land uses not listed in the foregoing table are to be classified by
the City Administrator/Clerk- Treasurer by assigning them to classes most
nearly like the listed uses, from the standpoint of run-off volume for the
standard rainfall event. An appeal of such classifications from the
determination of the City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer may be made to the City
Council.
(Prior Code, § 720.11) (Ord. 2004-07, passed 10-6-2004)
§ 158.07 ADJUSTMENT OF CHARGES.
   The City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer may negotiate the Storm Water Utility
user fee for parcels based upon land use data supplied by affected property
owners which demonstrates a run-off volume for a standard rainfall event or
other circumstances substantially different from factors being used for such
parcels. Adjustments for Storm Water Utility user fees will not be made
retroactively.
(Prior Code, § 720.13) (Ord. 2004-07, passed 10-6-2004; Ord. 2008-12, passed -
-2008)
§ 158.08 STORM SEWER CONNECTION FEE.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   The city may impose a storm sewer connection fee based on:
         (a)   The square footage of the property to be charged, adjusted for a
reasonable calculation of storm water run-off;
         (b)   A reasonable classification of the types of premises to which
service is furnished;
         (c)   By reference to the quantity, pollution qualities and difficulty
of disposal of storm water run-off produced; or
         (d)   Any other equitable basis, including any combination of the
basis described in this subchapter, but excluding any reference to the amount
of water consumed.
      (2)   The storm sewer connection fee must be a fair and equitable share
of the amount reasonably calculated to pay total projected capital costs of the
storm water system within the area, including the cost of debt service and
related financing costs in connection with obligations issued by the city to
finance such improvements, depreciation, a reasonable reserve for capital
replacement and the costs of obtaining and complying with permits required by
law. In determining the storm sewer connection fee, the city may give
consideration to all costs of establishing the system, and of improvements,
enlargements and extensions necessary to adequately serve the area.
   (B)   Supplying information. The owner, occupant or person in charge of any
premises must supply the city with such information as the city may reasonably
request related to the use, development and area of the premises and the
imposition of any storm sewer connection fee. If the owner, occupant or person
in charge of the premises fails to or refuses to provide the information
requested, the storm sewer connection fee for the premises will be estimated
and billed in accordance with such estimate based upon the information then
available to the city.

STORM WATER MANAGEMENT
§ 158.25 FINDINGS.
   The city hereby finds that uncontrolled and inadequately planned use of
wetlands, woodlands, natural habitat areas, areas subject to soil erosion and
areas containing restrictive soils adversely affects the public health, safety
and general welfare by impacting water quality and contributing to other
environmental problems, creating nuisances, impairing other beneficial uses of
environmental resources and hindering the ability of the city to provide
adequate water, sewer, flood control and other community services.
(Prior Code, § 430.01) (Ord. 2008-05, passed 5-21-2008)
§ 158.26 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to promote, preserve and enhance the
natural resources within the city and protect these resources from adverse
effects occasioned by poorly sited development that would have an adverse and
potentially irreversible impact on water quality and unique and fragile
environmentally sensitive land; by minimizing conflicts and encouraging
compatibility between land disturbing and development activities and water
quality and environmentally sensitive lands; and by requiring detailed review
standards and procedures for land disturbing or development activities proposed
for the areas, thereby achieving a balance between urban growth and development
and the protection of water quality and natural areas.
(Prior Code, § 430.03) (Ord. 2008-05, passed 5-21-2008)
§ 158.27 SCOPE AND EFFECT.
   (A)   Applicability. Every applicant for a subdivision, PUD or major land
disturbance permit must submit a Storm Water Management Plan to the city for
review and approval. No land use approval or major land disturbance permit will
be issued by the city until approval of the storm water management plan has
been obtained.
   (B)   Exemptions. The provisions of this subchapter do not apply to:
      (1)   Any part of a subdivision or PUD if the preliminary plat has been
approved by the City Council on or before the effective date of this
subchapter;
      (2)   Any major land disturbing activity for which plans have been
approved by the controlling watershed management organization within six months
prior to the effective date of this subchapter;
      (3)   Installation of fences, signs, telephone or electrical poles and
other kinds of posts or poles;
and
      (4)   Emergency work to protect life, limb or property.
   (C)   Waiver.
      (1)   The City Council, upon recommendation by the Planning Commission,
may waive any requirement of this subchapter upon making a finding that
compliance with the requirement will involve an unnecessary hardship due to
limitations of the site conditions, and the waiver of such requirement will not
adversely affect the standards and requirements set forth in this subchapter.
      (2)   The City Council may require as a condition of the waiver, such
dedication or construction, or agreement to dedicate or construct physical
improvements, facilities, property or easements as may be necessary to
adequately meet this subchapter’s standards and requirements.
(Prior Code, § 430.05) (Ord. 2008-05, passed 5-21-2008)

(Prior Code, § 430.09) (Ord. 2008-05, passed 5-21-2008)
§ 158.30 STORM WATER MANAGEMENT PLAN APPLICATION REVIEW PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Process. A complete Storm Water Management Plan application shall be
forwarded by the City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer to the City Engineer for
review in accordance with this subchapter. The Planning Commission must also
review the Storm Water Management Plan application and recommend approval,
approval with conditions or denial to the City Council. Following Planning
Commission review, the application must be reviewed by the City Council. The
application may be approved by the City Council subject to compliance with
conditions that are reasonable and necessary to ensure that the requirements of
this subchapter are met. Such conditions may include, among others, the
construction of structures, drainage facilities, storage basins and other
facilities; replacement of certain vegetation on the site; the establishment of
monitoring procedures; the staging of the work over time; the alteration of the
site’s design to ensure buffering; or requiring conveyance of certain lands or
interests therein to the city or other public entity. City Council action on
the application must be accomplished within 60 days following the date the
complete application was filed with the City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer.
   (B)   Duration. City Council approval of a Storm Water Management Plan
application will expire one year after the date of approval unless construction
has commenced in accordance with the Storm Water Management Plan. However, the
applicant may make a written request to the City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer
for an extension, so long as the request is received by the city prior to the
application’s expiration date. Upon receiving a request for an extension, the
City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer should consult with the City Engineer on the
request and make a decision on the request within 30 days of receipt.
   (C)   Amendments and revisions. Any changes, revisions or amendments to an
approved Storm Water Management Plan must be reviewed and approved by the
Planning Commission and the City Council.
(Prior Code, § 430.11) (Ord. 2008-05, passed 5-21-2008)
§ 158.31 GENERAL PLAN STANDARDS.
   (A)   The following storm water management practices must be considered and
investigated by the applicant in developing a Storm Water Management Plan:
      (1)   Natural infiltration of precipitation on-site, if the property is
located outside of an area that is considered to be sensitive to ground water
contamination. The city encourages the infiltration of the first one-half inch
of run-off in permeable soils (NRCS hydrologic group A and B soils);
      (2)   Flow rate reduction by the use of open vegetated swales and natural
depressions;
      (3)   Storm water retention facilities;
      (4)   Storm water detention facilities. Detention facilities must be
designed and constructed according to specifications approved by the City
Engineer; and
      (5)   A combination of practices may be used in order to achieve the
minimum control requirements of this subchapter. The applicant must provide
justification for the method(s) selected.
   (B)   When possible, existing natural drainage ways, wetlands and vegetated
soil surfaces must be used in a Storm Water Management Plan to convey, store,
filter and retain storm water run-off before it is discharged to public waters.
   (C)   Development must be planned and conducted in a manner that will
minimize the extent of disturbed areas, run-off velocities, erosion potential
and reduce and delay run-off volumes. Disturbed areas must be stabilized and
protected as soon as possible and facilities or methods must be used to retain
sediment on the site.
   (D)   When development density, topographic features and soil and vegetation
conditions are not sufficient to adequately handle storm water run-off using
natural features and vegetation, various types of constructed facilities, such
as diversions, settling basins, skimming devices, dikes, waterways and ponds
may be used. The city encourages the use of best management practices, such as
using surface drainage, vegetation and infiltration rather than buried pipes
and human-made materials and facilities.
   (E)   When constructed facilities are to be used for storm water management,
documentation must be provided by an engineer or an individual qualified to
design and review the particular facility, that the facilities are designed and
constructed in accordance with all applicable local, state and federal laws and
regulations.
   (F)   Newly constructed storm water outfalls where the discharge eventually
flows to public waters must provide for filtering or settling of suspended
soils and skimming of surface debris before discharge.
   (G)   Storm Water Management Plans must be consistent with adopted watershed
management plans and ground water management plans prepared in accordance with
M.S. Chapter 103B, as it may be amended from time to time, and must be reviewed
and approved by the local watershed authority, if required.
   (H)   Hydrologic models and design methodologies in a Storm Water Management
Plan to be used for the determination of run-off and the analysis of storm
water management facilities must be reviewed and approved by the City Engineer.
Plans, specifications and computations for storm water management facilities
must be signed by a licensed professional engineer. All computations must
appear on the plans submitted for review, unless otherwise required by the City
Engineer.
(Prior Code, § 430.13) (Ord. 2008-05, passed 5-21-2008)
§ 158.32 PLAN CRITERIA FOR TEMPORARY EROSION CONTROL MEASURES AND FACILITIES.
   The following criteria apply to Storm Water Management Plans and for land
disturbing or development activities that result in run-off leaving the site or
run-off remaining on the site.
   (A)   Channeled run-off from adjacent areas that passes through the site
must be diverted around disturbed areas, if practical. If diversion is not
practical, the channel must be protected. Sheetflow run- off from adjacent
areas greater than 10,000 square feet must also be diverted around disturbed
areas, if practical. Diverted run-off must be conveyed in a manner that will
not erode the conveyance and receiving channels.
   (B)   All activities on the site must be conducted in a logical sequence to
minimize the area of bare soil that is exposed at any one time.
   (C)   Run-off from the entire disturbed area on the site must be controlled
by meeting either divisions (C)(1) and (C)(2) or divisions (C)(1) and (C)(3)
below.
      (1)   All disturbed ground that is left inactive for 14 or more days must
be stabilized by seeding or installing sod. If the date is after September 15,
the ground must be covered by mulch or other equivalent erosion control
material.
      (2)   For sites that have more than ten acres that will be disturbed at
one time, or if a channel originates in the disturbed area, one or more
temporary or permanent sedimentation basins must be constructed. Each
sedimentation basin must have a volume below the normal water level of at least
1,800 cubic feet per acre of the area draining to the basin, be at least three
feet deep and must be constructed in accordance with accepted design
specifications. Sediment must be removed on a regular basis so that a depth of
at least three feet can be maintained. The sedimentation basin’s discharge rate
must also be sufficiently low enough so that it does not cause erosion along
the discharge channel or the receiving water.
      (3)   For all sites subject to this subchapter, silt fences, straw bales
or equivalent erosion control measures must be placed along all side and down
slopes of the site. If a channel or area of concentrated run-off passes through
the site, silt fences must be placed along the channel’s edges to reduce the
likelihood of sediment reaching the channel. A maintenance and inspection
schedule must be provided when using silt fences, straw bales or equivalent
erosion control measures.
   (D)   Any soil or dirt storage piles containing more than 20 cubic yards of
material must not be located with a down slope drainage length of less than 25
feet from the toe of the pile to a street or drainage channel. If the pile is
to remain for less than 14 days, erosion must be controlled by placing straw
bales or silt fence barriers around the pile. If the pile is to remain for more
than 14 days, it must be stabilized by adding mulch, vegetative cover, tarps or
other means. In-street utility repair or construction soil or dirt storage
piles located closer than 225 feet of a street or drainage channel must be
covered with tarps or suitable alternative control, if exposed for more than
seven days. Storm drain inlets must also be protected with straw bales or other
appropriate filtering barriers.
(Prior Code, § 430.15) (Ord. 2008-05, passed 5-21-2008)
§ 158.33 CRITERIA FOR PERMANENT STORM WATER FACILITIES.
   The following criteria apply to permanent storm water facilities on a site.
   (A)   An applicant must install or construct on, or for the proposed land
disturbing or development activity, all storm water management facilities
deemed necessary by the city engineer to manage the increased run-off so that
the two-year, ten-year and 100-year storm peak discharge rates existing before
the proposed development or land disturbing activity does not increase and
accelerated channel erosion does not occur as a result of the project. In
certain instances, the City Council may permit an applicant to make an in-kind
or monetary contribution to be used towards the development and maintenance of
community storm water management facilities designed to serve multiple land
disturbing and development activities that are being undertaken by more than
one party.
   (B)   The applicant should attempt to reduce the need to construct storm
water management facilities by incorporating the use of the site’s natural
topography and land covered such as wetlands, ponds, natural swales and
depressions as they exist before development to the degree that they can
accommodate the additional flow of water without compromising the integrity or
quality of the wetland or pond.
   (C)   If the Storm Water Management Plan involves the direction of some or
all of the run-off off of the site, the applicant must obtain any necessary
easements from the adjacent property owners concerning the flowage of the
water.
(Prior Code, § 430.17) (Ord. 2008-05, passed 5-21-2008)
§ 158.34 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Site dewatering. Water pumped from the site must be treated by
temporary sedimentation basins, grit chambers, sand filters, upflow chambers,
hydro-cyclones, swirly concentrators or other appropriate controls as
necessary. Water must not be discharged in a manner that causes erosion or
flooding of the site or the receiving channels or a wetland.
   (B)   Waste and material disposal. All waste and unused building materials,
including, but not limited to, garbage, cleaning wastes, debris, wastewater,
toxic or hazardous materials must be properly discharged off-site and not
permitted to be carried away by run-off into a receiving channel or storm sewer
system.
   (C)   Tracking. The site must have graveled roads, access drives and parking
areas of sufficient width and length to prevent sediment from being tracked
onto public or private roads. Any sediment reaching a private or public road
must be removed by street cleaning before the end of each work day. No flushing
is permitted.
   (D)   Drain inlet protection. All storm drain inlets must be protected with
straw bales, silt fence or equivalent barrier meeting requirements set forth in
the State Pollution Control Agency’s publication entitled Protecting Water
Quality in Urban Areas during construction until control measures are in place.
(Prior Code, § 430.19) (Ord. 2008-05, passed 5-21-2008) Penalty, see §
158.99
§ 158.35 NON-COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Notice of non-compliance. If the city finds that the work on the site
is not being performed in conformance with this subchapter and the submitted
Storm Water Management Plan, it shall issue a written notice of non-compliance
to the applicant that states the corrective measures to be taken.
   (B)   Stop work order. If the corrective measures identified in the notice
of non-compliance are not completed by the time period set forth in the notice,
the City Engineer or Engineer’s designee may issue an order for the city to
stop all inspections required for land use or building permit approvals for the
site until all corrective actions identified in the notice are completed. The
applicant must notify the City Engineer upon completion of all corrective
actions. Once the City Engineer has verified that all corrective actions
required have been taken, the Engineer shall inform the city and the city may
resume inspections on the site.
   (C)   Action against the financial security. If the corrective action
identified in the notice of non- compliance is not completed within the time
specified, the city may act against the financial security. The city may use
the funds from the financial security to reimburse itself for any costs
incurred in taking corrective action or performing remedial work to bring the
site into compliance.
   (D)   Emergency action. If circumstances exist such that noncompliance with
this subchapter poses an immediate danger to the public health, safety or
welfare, as determined by the city, the city may take emergency preventative
action on the site. Prior to taking emergency preventative action, the city
will make a reasonable attempt to contact and direct the applicant to take the
necessary action.
   (E)   Suspension or revocation of a major land disturbance permit. The city
may revoke or suspend a major land disturbance permit issued under the
provisions of Chapter 157 of this code of ordinances whenever the actions
contained in the notice of non-compliance are not taken within the time
specified. The city must notify the applicant of the suspension or revocation
in writing. The applicant may appeal the permit suspension or revocation to the
City Council within ten days of the date of the suspension or revocation
notice.

§ 159.16 CO-LOCATION REQUIREMENTS.
   Towers erected, constructed or located within the city must comply with the
following requirements.
   (A)   No new tower shall be permitted as a conditional use unless the city
finds that the antenna planned for the proposed tower cannot be accommodated on
an existing or approved tower within a one mile search radius of the proposed
tower due to one or more of the following reasons:
      (1)   The planned antenna would exceed the structural capacity of the
existing or approved tower as certified by a qualified and licensed
professional engineer, and the existing or approved tower cannot be reinforced,
modified or replaced to accommodate the planned antenna at a reasonable cost;
      (2)   Existing or approved towers within the search radius cannot
accommodate the planned antenna at a height necessary to function reasonably as
certified by a qualified and licensed professional engineer; and/or
      (3)   The applicant certifies and documents that it is infeasible to
locate the planned antenna upon an existing or approved tower for another
reason found to be legitimate by the City Council.
   (B)   Approval to develop, build, construct or erect a tower will not be
granted to a person on the basis that it is economically infeasible for the
person to co-locate or install an antenna on a tower or antenna support
structure owned by another person.
   (C)   A new tower must be designed structurally, electrically and in all
other respects, to accommodate both the applicants’ antennas and comparable
antennas for at least two additional users if the tower is over 100 feet in
height, or for at least one additional user if the tower is over 60 feet in
height. Towers must be designed to allow for future rearrangement of antennas
upon the tower and to accept antennas mounted at varying heights.

§ 159.20 SEPARATION OR BUFFER REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Towers must be separated from residentially zoned lands by a minimum
of 90 feet or 150% of the height of the proposed tower whichever is greater.
The minimum tower separation distance is calculated and applied irrespective of
the city jurisdictional boundaries. Measurement of tower separation distances
for the purpose of compliance with this chapter is measured from the base of a
tower to the closest point of the proposed site, which abuts residentially
zoned lands.
   (B)   Towers must be separated by at least 1,500 feet from existing towers
or towers approved but not yet constructed at the time a permit is granted.
Separation distances are measured by drawing or following a straight line

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 160.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The legislature of the state has, in M.S. Chapters 103F and 462, as they may
be amended from time to time, delegated the responsibility to local government
units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses.
(Prior Code, § 530.01) (Ord. 2012-05, passed 3-7-2012)
§ 160.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   General. The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic
inundation, which results in potential loss of life, loss of property, health
and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures or flood protection and relief and impairment
of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and
general welfare.
   (B)   Methods used to analyze flood hazards. This chapter is based upon a
reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which is consistent with the
standards established by the state’s Department of Natural Resources.
   (C)   National Flood Insurance Program compliance. This chapter is adopted
to comply with the rules and regulations of the National Flood Insurance
Program codified as 44 C.F.R. parts 59 through 78, as amended, so as to
maintain the city’s eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program.
(Prior Code, § 530.01) (Ord. 2012-05, passed 3-7-2012)
§ 160.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize those losses described above in §
160.02(A) of this chapter by provisions contained in this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 530.01) (Ord. 2012-05, passed 3-7-2012)
§ 160.04 LANDS TO WHICH CHAPTER APPLIES.
   This chapter shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city
shown on the official zoning map or the attachments thereto as being located
within the boundaries of the Floodway, Flood Fringe or General Floodplain
Districts.
(Prior Code, § 530.03) (Ord. 2012-05, passed 3-7-2012)
§ 160.05 ZONING MAP ESTABLISHMENT.
   The official zoning map together with all materials attached thereto is
hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. The
attached material shall include the Flood Insurance Study, Pine County,
Minnesota and Incorporated Areas and Flood Insurance Rate Map, panels therein
numbered 27115C0400C, 27115C0411C, 27115C0413C, 27115C0557C and 27115C0576C,
all documents being dated 4-3-2012 and prepared by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency. The official zoning map shall be on file in the office of
the City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer and the Zoning Administrator.
(Prior Code, § 530.03) (Ord. 2012-05, passed 3-7-2012)
§ 160.06 REGULATORY FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION.
   The regulatory flood protection elevation shall be an elevation no lower
than one foot above the elevation of the regional flood, plus any increases in
flood elevation caused by encroachments on the floodplain that result from
designation of a floodway.
(Prior Code, § 530.03) (Ord. 2012-05, passed 3-7-2012)
§ 160.07 INTERPRETATION.
   (A)   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this
chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the city and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal
of any other powers granted by state law.
   (B)   The boundaries of the flood overlay zoning districts shall be
determined by scaling distances on the official zoning map. Where
interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the
district as shown on the official zoning map, such as when there appears to be
a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions, the decision
of the Zoning Administrator may be formally appealed to the Board of Adjustment
and Appeals. All decisions will be based on elevations on the regional (100-
year) flood profile, the ground elevations that existed on the site at the time
the city adopted these regulations or on the date of the first National Flood
Insurance Program map showing the area within the 100-year floodplain if
earlier and other available technical data. Persons contesting the location of
the district boundaries shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present
their case to the Board of Adjustment and Appeals and to submit technical
evidence.
(Prior Code, § 530.03) (Ord. 2012-05, passed 3-7-2012)
§ 160.08 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   It is not intended by this chapter to repeal, abrogate or impair any
existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter
imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail. The
regulations in this chapter are in addition to rather than in substitution of
regulations imposed by any other underlying zoning classification for
designated floodplains. In the event of any inconsistency between the
provisions of this chapter and other city code provisions, the more restrictive
provision shall prevail.
(Prior Code, § 530.03) (Ord. 2012-05, passed 3-7-2012)
§ 160.09 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   This chapter does not imply that areas outside the floodplain districts or
land uses permitted within the districts will be free from flooding or flood
damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city or any
officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on
this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Prior Code, § 530.03) (Ord. 2012-05, passed 3-7-2012)
§ 160.10 SEVERABILITY.
   If any paragraph, clause, provision or portion of this chapter is adjudged
unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder
of this chapter shall not be affected thereby.
(Prior Code, § 530.03) (Ord. 2012-05, passed 3-7-2012)

or base subgrade (below ground level) on all four sides, regardless of the
depth of excavation below ground level.
   CONDITIONAL USE. A specific type of structure or land use listed in the city
code that may be allowed, but only after an in-depth review procedure and with
appropriate conditions or restrictions as provided in the city’s Zoning Code or
Building Code and upon a finding that:
      (1)   Certain conditions as detailed in the city zoning ordinance exist;
and
      (2)   The structure or land use conforms to the comprehensive land use
plan and are compatible with the existing neighborhood.
   EQUAL DEGREE OF ENCROACHMENT. A method of determining the location of
floodway boundaries so that floodplain lands on both sides of a stream are
capable of conveying a proportionate share of flood flows.
   FLOOD. A temporary increase in the flow or stage of a stream or in the stage
of a wetland or lake that results in the inundation of normally dry areas.
   FLOOD FREQUENCY. The frequency for which it is expected that a specific
flood stage or discharge may be equaled or exceeded.
   FLOOD FRINGE. The portion of the floodplain outside of the floodway. FLOOD
FRINGE is synonymous with the term FLOODWAY FRINGE that is used in the Flood
Insurance Study for Pine County, Minnesota and Incorporated Areas.

those portions of the adjoining floodplain which are reasonably required to
carry or store the regional flood discharge.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including the
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking
of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area,
is not considered a building’s LOWEST FLOOR.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include the term “recreational vehicle”.

square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, is
designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and
is designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling, but as temporary
living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use. For the
purposes of this chapter, the term RECREATIONAL VEHICLE shall be synonymous
with the term TRAVEL TRAILER or TRAVEL VEHICLE.
   REGIONAL FLOOD. A flood which is representative of large floods known to
have occurred generally in Minnesota and reasonably characteristic of what can
be expected to occur on an average frequency in the magnitude of the 100-year
recurrence interval. REGIONAL FLOOD is synonymous with the term BASE FLOOD used
in the flood insurance study.
   REGULATORY FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION. An elevation no lower than one foot
above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation
caused by encroachments on the floodplain that result from designation of a
floodway.
   STRUCTURE. Any thing constructed or erected on the ground or attached to the
ground or on-site utilities, including, but not limited to, buildings,
factories, sheds, detached garages, cabins, manufactured homes, recreational
vehicles not meeting the exemption criteria specified in §
160.42(C)(1) of this chapter and other similar items.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure where the
cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or
exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Within any consecutive 365-day period, any
reconstruction, rehabilitation (including normal maintenance and repair),
repair after damage, addition or other improvement of a structure, the cost of
which equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the
“start of construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures that
have incurred “substantial damage”, regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include either:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or city health, sanitary or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the city code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of an “historic structure”; provided that, the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an
“historic structure”. For the purpose of this chapter, “historic structure”
shall be as defined in 44 C.F.R. § 59.1.
   VARIANCE. A modification of a specific permitted development standard
required by the city code including this chapter to allow an alternative
development standard not stated as acceptable in the city code, but only as
applied to a particular property for the purpose of alleviating a hardship,
practical difficulty or unique circumstance as defined and elaborated upon in
the city code.

(Prior Code, § 530.05) (Ord. 2012-05, passed 3-7-2012)
§ 160.26 FLOODWAY DISTRICT (FW).
   (A)   Permitted uses. The following uses are permitted uses in the Floodway
District; provided that, the use is also listed in the city code as a permitted
or conditional use in the underlying zoning district. In the event that the use
is permitted in the Floodway District, but is listed as a conditional use in
the underlying zoning district, a conditional use permit is still required:
      (1)   General farming, pasture, grazing, outdoor plant nurseries,
horticulture, truck farming, forestry, sod farming and wild crop harvesting;
      (2)   Industrial-commercial loading areas, parking areas and airport
landing strips;
      (3)   Private and public golf courses, tennis courts, driving ranges,
archery ranges, picnic grounds, boat launching ramps, swimming areas, parks,
wildlife and nature preserves, game farms, fish hatcheries, shooting preserves,
target ranges, trap and skeet ranges, hunting and fishing areas, and single or
multiple purpose recreational trails; and
      (4)   Residential lawns, gardens, parking areas and play areas.
   (B)   Standards for floodway permitted uses.
      (1)   The use shall have a low flood damage potential.
      (2)   The use shall be permissible in the underlying zoning district.
      (3)   The use shall not obstruct flood flows or increase flood elevations
and shall not involve structures, fill, obstructions, excavations or storage of
materials or equipment.
   (C)   Conditional Uses. The following uses are conditional uses in the
Floodway District; provided that, the use is also listed in the city code as a
permitted or conditional use in the underlying zoning district. In the event
that the use is conditional in the Floodway District, but is a permitted use in
the underlying zoning district, a conditional use permit is still required:
      (1)   Structures accessory to the uses listed in division (A) above and
the uses listed below;
      (2)   Extraction and storage of sand, gravel and other materials;
      (3)   Marinas, boat rentals, docks, piers, wharves and water control
structures;
      (4)   Railroads, streets, bridges, utility transmission lines and
pipelines;
      (5)   Storage yards for equipment, machinery or materials;
      (6)   Placement of fill or construction offenses;
      (7)   Recreational vehicles either on individual lots of record or in
existing or new subdivisions or commercial or condominium type campgrounds,
subject to the exemptions and provisions of §
160.42(C) of this chapter; and
      (8)   Structural works for flood control such as levees, dikes and
floodwalls constructed to any height where the intent is to protect individual
structures and levees or dikes where the intent is to protect agricultural
crops for a frequency flood event equal to or less than the ten-year frequency
flood event.
   (D)   Standards for floodway conditional uses.
      (1)   No structure (temporary or permanent), fill (including fill for
roads and levees), deposit, obstruction, storage of materials or equipment, or
other uses may be allowed as a conditional use that will cause any increase in
the stage of the 100-year or regional flood or cause an increase in flood
damages in the reach or reaches affected.
      (2)   All floodway conditional uses are subject to the procedures and
standards contained in §
160.58 of this chapter.
      (3)   The conditional use shall be permissible in the underlying zoning
district.
      (4)   (a)   Fill, dredge spoil and all other similar materials deposited
or stored in the floodplain shall be protected from erosion by vegetative
cover, mulching, riprap or other acceptable method.
         (b)   Dredge spoil sites and sand and gravel operations shall not be
allowed in the floodway unless a long-term site development plan is submitted
which includes an erosion/sedimentation prevention element to the plan.
         (c)   As an alternative, and consistent with division (D)(4)(b) above,
dredge spoil disposal and sand and gravel operations may allow temporary on-
site storage of fill or other materials which would have caused an increase to
the stage of the 100-year or regional flood but only after the city has
received an appropriate plan which assures the removal of the materials from
the floodway based upon the flood warning time available. The conditional use
permit must be recorded with the property in the office of the County Recorder
or County Registrar of Titles, as appropriate.
      (5)   (a)   Accessory structures shall not be designed for human
habitation.
         (b)   Accessory structures shall be permissible in the underlying
zoning district.
         (c)   Accessory structures, if permitted, shall be constructed and
placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the flow
of flood waters.
            1.   Whenever possible, structures shall be constructed with the
longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow; and
            2.   So far as practicable, structures shall be placed
approximately on the same flood flow lines as those of adjoining structures.
         (d)   Accessory structures shall be elevated on fill or structurally
dry flood-proofed in accordance with the FP-1 or FP-2 flood-proofing
classifications in the State Building Code. As an alternative, an accessory
structure may be flood-proofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 flood-proofing
classification in the State Building Code; provided, the accessory structure
constitutes a minimal investment, does not exceed 500 square feet in size at
its largest projection, and for a detached garage, if permitted in the
underlying zoning district, the detached garage is used solely for parking of
vehicles and limited storage. All flood-proofed accessory structures must meet
the following additional standards.
            1.   The structure must be adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure and shall be designed
to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
            2.   Any mechanical and utility equipment in a structure must be
elevated to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or properly
flood-proofed.
            3.   To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there
must be a minimum of two “automatic” openings in the outside walls of the
structure having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every
square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. There must be openings on at
least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings must be no
higher than one foot above the lowest adjacent grade to the structure. Using
human intervention to open a garage door prior to flooding will not satisfy
this requirement for automatic openings.
      (6)   (a)   The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of
flooding, flammable, explosive or potentially injurious to human, animal or
plant life is prohibited.
         (b)   Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if
readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning
and in accordance with a plan approved by the city.
      (7)   Structural works for flood control that will change the course,
current or cross section of protected wetlands or public waters shall be
subject to the provisions of M.S. Chapter 103G, as it may be amended from time
to time. City-wide structural works for flood control intended to remove areas
from the regulatory floodplain shall not be allowed in the floodway.
      (8)   A levee, dike or floodwall constructed in the floodway shall not
cause an increase to the 100-year or regional flood and the technical analysis
must assume equal conveyance or storage loss on both sides of a stream.
(Prior Code, § 530.07) (Ord. 2012-05, passed 3-7-2012)
§ 160.27 FLOOD FRINGE DISTRICT (FF).
   (A)   Permitted uses. Permitted uses shall be those uses of land or
structures listed as permitted or conditional uses in the underlying zoning
district(s) that comply with the standards for Flood Fringe District “permitted
uses” listed in division (B) below and the “standards for all flood fringe
uses” listed in division (E) below. If a use or structure could have been a
permitted use in the Flood Fringe District but is a conditional use in the
underlying zoning district, it shall be processed as a conditional use permit
and subject to the standards of divisions (B) and (E) below.
   (B)   Standards for flood fringe permitted uses.
      (1)   All structures, including accessory structures must be elevated on
fill so that the lowest floor, including basement floor is at or above the
regulatory flood protection elevation. The finished fill elevation for
structures shall be no lower than one foot below the regulatory flood
protection elevation and the fill shall extend at an elevation at least 15 feet
beyond the outside limits of the structure erected thereon.
      (2)   As an alternative to elevation on fill, accessory structures, if
permitted in the underlying zoning district, constitute a minimal investment
and do not exceed 500 square feet at their largest projection may be internally
flood-proofed in accordance with §
160.26(D)(5)(d) of this chapter.
      (3)   The cumulative placement of fill where at any one time in excess of
1,000 cubic yards of fill is located on the parcel shall be allowable only as a
conditional use, unless the fill is specifically intended to elevate a
structure in accordance with division (B)(1) above.
      (4)   The storage of any materials or equipment shall be elevated on fill
to the regulatory flood protection elevation.
      (5)   The provisions of division (E) below shall apply.
   (C)   Conditional uses. Conditional uses shall be those uses of land or
structures listed as permitted or conditional uses in the underlying zoning
district(s) that are not elevated on fill or flood-proofed in accordance with
divisions (A) and (B) above. Any use of land that does not comply with the
standards in divisions (B)(3) and (B)(4) above shall only be allowable as a
conditional use. An application for a conditional use shall be subject to the
standards and criteria and evaluation procedures specified in divisions (D) and
(E) below and §
160.58 of this chapter.
   (D)   Standards for flood fringe conditional uses.
      (1)   (a)   Alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill may
be utilized to elevate a structure’s lowest floor above the regulatory flood
protection elevation. These alternative methods may include the use of stilts,
pilings, parallel walls or above-grade, enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or
tuck under garages. The base or floor of an enclosed area shall be considered
above-grade and not a structure’s basement or lowest floor if:
            1.   The enclosed area is above-grade on at least one side of the
structure;
            2.   It is designed to internally flood and is constructed with
flood resistant materials; and
            3.   It is used solely for parking of vehicles, building access or
storage.
         (b)   The above-noted alternative elevation methods are subject to the
following additional standards.
            1.   Design and certification. The structure’s design and as-built
condition must be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect
as being in compliance with the general design standards of the state’s
Building Code and, specifically, that all electrical, heating, ventilation,
plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities must be at
or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or be designed to prevent
flood water from entering or accumulating within these components during times
of flooding.
            2.   Specific standards for above-grade, enclosed areas. Above-
grade, fully enclosed areas, such as crawl spaces or tuck-under garages, must
be designed to internally flood and the design plans must stipulate:
               a.   A minimum area of openings in the walls where internal
flooding is to be used as a flood-proofing technique. There shall be a minimum
of two openings on at least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all
openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. The automatic openings
shall have a minimum net area of not less than one square inch for every square
foot of enclosed area subject to flooding unless a registered professional
engineer or architect certifies that a smaller net area would suffice. The
automatic openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices; provided that, they permit the automatic entry and exit
of flood waters without any form of human intervention; and
               b.   That the enclosed area will be designed of flood resistant
materials in accordance with the FP-3 or FP-4 classifications in the State
Building Code and shall be used solely for building access, parking of vehicles
or storage.
      (2)   Basements, as defined by §
160.11 of this chapter, shall be subject to the following.
         (a)   Residential basement construction shall not be allowed below the
regulatory flood protection elevation.
         (b)   Non-residential basements may be allowed below the regulatory
flood protection elevation; provided, the basement is structurally dry flood-
proofed in accordance with division (D)(3) below.
      (3)   All areas of non-residential structures including basements to be
placed below the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be flood-proofed
in accordance with the structurally dry flood- proofing classifications in the
State Building Code. Structurally dry flood-proofing must meet the FP-1 or FP-
2 flood-proofing classification in the State Building Code and this shall
require making the structure water-tight with the walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of
buoyancy. Structures flood-proofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 classification shall not
be permitted.
      (4)   When at any one time more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill or other
similar material is located on a parcel for such activities as on-site storage,
landscaping, sand and gravel operations, landfills, roads, dredge spoil
disposal or construction of flood control works, an erosion/sedimentation
control plan must be submitted unless the city is enforcing a state approved
shoreland management ordinance. In the absence of a state approved shoreland
ordinance, the plan must clearly specify methods to be used to stabilize the
fill on site for a flood event at a minimum of the 100-year or regional flood
event. The plan must be prepared and certified by a registered professional
engineer or other qualified individual acceptable to the city. The plan may
incorporate alternative procedures for removal of the material from the
floodplain if adequate flood warning time exists.
      (5)   The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of
flooding, flammable, explosive or potentially injurious to human, animal or
plant life is prohibited. Storage of other materials or equipment may be
allowed if readily removable from the area within the time available after a
flood warning and in accordance with a plan approved by the City Council. The
provisions of division (E) below shall also apply.
   (E)   Standards for all flood fringe uses.
      (1)   Vehicular access. All new principal structures must have vehicular
access at or above an elevation not more than two feet below the regulatory
flood protection elevation. If a variance to this requirement is granted, the
Board of Adjustment and Appeals must specify limitations on the period of use
or occupancy of the structure for times of flooding and only after determining
that adequate flood warning time and local flood emergency response procedures
exist.
      (2)   Commercial uses. Where the use is permitted in the underlying
zoning district, accessory commercial land uses, such as yards, railroad tracks
and parking lots may be located at elevations lower than the regulatory flood
protection elevation. However, the applicable permit shall not be granted by
the city in the absence of a flood warning system that provides adequate time
for evacuation if the area would be inundated to a depth and velocity such that
when multiplying the depth (in feet) times velocity (in feet per second) the
product number exceeds four upon occurrence of the regional flood.
      (3)   Manufacturing and industrial uses. Where the use is permitted in
the underlying zoning district, measures shall be taken to minimize
interference with normal plant operations especially along streams having
protracted flood durations. Certain accessory land uses such as yards and
parking lots may be located at lower elevations subject to requirements set out
in division (E)(2) above. In considering permit applications, due consideration
shall be given by the city if the proposed industry’s business requires that it
be located in a floodplain area.
      (4)   Fill. Fill shall be properly compacted and the slopes shall be
properly protected by the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable
method. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”) has established
criteria for removing the special flood hazard area designation for certain
structures properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation. FEMA’s
requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection
standards for multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should
be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of
special flood hazard area designation will be requested.
      (5)   Affect. Floodplain developments shall not adversely affect the
hydraulic capacity of the channel and adjoining floodplain of any tributary
watercourse or drainage system where a floodway or other encroachment limit has
not been specified on the city’s official zoning map.
      (6)   Recreational vehicles. Standards for recreational vehicles are
contained in §
160.42(C) of this chapter.
      (7)   Anchoring. All manufactured homes, if permitted in the underlying
zoning district must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system that resists flotation, collapse and lateral movement. Methods of
anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or
frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable
state or city anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
(Prior Code, § 530.09) (Ord. 2012-05, passed 3-7-2012)
§ 160.28 GENERAL FLOODPLAIN DISTRICT.
   (A)   Permissible uses.
      (1)   Permitted uses shall be those uses of land or structures listed as
permitted uses in §
160.26(A) of this chapter.
      (2)   All other permissible uses shall be subject to the floodway/flood
fringe evaluation criteria pursuant to division (B) below. The provisions of §
160.26 of this chapter shall apply if the proposed use is in the Floodway
District, and §
160.27 of this chapter shall apply if the proposed use is in the Flood Fringe
District.
   (B)   Procedures for floodway and flood fringe determinations within the
General Floodplain District.
      (1)   Upon receipt of an application for a building permit or other
approval within the General Floodplain District, the applicant shall be
required to furnish such of the following information as is deemed necessary by
the Zoning Administrator for the determination of the regulatory flood
protection elevation and whether the proposed use is within the Floodway or
Flood Fringe District:
         (a)   A typical valley cross-section(s) showing the channel of the
stream, elevation of land areas adjoining each side of the channel, cross-
sectional areas to be occupied by the proposed development and high water
information;
         (b)   Plan (surface view) showing elevations or contours of the
ground, pertinent structure, fill or storage elevations, the size, location and
spatial arrangement of all proposed and existing structures on the site, and
the location and elevations of streets;
         (c)   Photographs showing existing land uses, vegetation upstream and
downstream and soil types; and
         (d)   Profile showing the slope of the bottom of the channel or flow
line of the stream for at least 500 feet in either direction from the proposed
development.
      (2)   The applicant shall be responsible to submit one copy of the above
information to a designated engineer or other expert person or agency for
technical assistance in determining whether the proposed use is in the Floodway
or Flood Fringe District and to determine the regulatory flood protection
elevation. Procedures consistent with Minn. Rules parts 6120.5000 through
6120.6200 and 44 C.F.R. part 65 shall be followed in this expert evaluation.
The designated engineer or expert is strongly encouraged to discuss the
proposed technical evaluation methodology with the respective Department of
Natural Resources’ Area Hydrologist prior to commencing the analysis. The
designated engineer or expert shall:
         (a)   Estimate the peak discharge of the regional flood;
         (b)   Calculate the water surface profile of the regional flood based
upon a hydraulic analysis of the stream channel and overbank areas; and
         (c)   Compute the floodway necessary to convey or store the regional
flood without increasing flood stages more than one-half foot. A lesser stage
increase than one-half foot shall be required if, as a result of the additional
stage increase, increased flood damages would result. An equal degree of
encroachment on both sides of the stream within the reach shall be assumed in
computing floodway boundaries.
      (3)   The Zoning Administrator shall present the technical evaluation and
findings of the designated engineer or expert to the City Council. The City
Council must formally accept the technical evaluation and the recommended
Floodway or Flood Fringe District boundary or deny the permit application. The
City Council, prior to official action, may submit the application and all
supporting data and analyses to FEMA, the Department of Natural Resources or
the city’s Planning Commission for review and comment. Once the Floodway and
Flood Fringe District boundaries have been determined, the City Council shall
refer the matter back to the Zoning Administrator who shall process the permit
application consistent with the applicable provisions of §§
160.26 and
160.27 of this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 530.11) (Ord. 2012-05, passed 3-7-2012)
CRITERIA AND OTHER CONDITIONS
§ 160.40 SUBDIVISIONS.
   (A)   Review criteria. No land shall be subdivided which is unsuitable for
the reason of flooding, inadequate drainage, water supply or sewage treatment
facilities. All lots within the floodplain districts shall be able to contain a
building site outside of the Floodway District at or above the regulatory flood
protection elevation. All subdivisions shall have water and sewage treatment
facilities that comply with the provisions of this chapter and have road access
both to the subdivision and to the individual building sites no lower than two
feet below the regulatory flood protection elevation. For all subdivisions in
the floodplain, the Floodway and Flood Fringe District boundaries, the
regulatory flood protection elevation and the required elevation of all access
roads shall be clearly labeled on all required subdivision drawings and
platting documents.
   (B)   Floodway/flood fringe determinations in the General Floodplain
District. In the General Floodplain District, applicants shall provide the
information required in §
160.28(B) of this chapter to determine the l 00-year flood elevation, the
Floodway and Flood Fringe District boundaries and the regulatory flood
protection elevation for the subdivision site.
   (C)   Removal of special flood hazard area designation. FEMA has established
criteria for removing the special flood hazard area designation for certain
structures properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation. FEMA’s
requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection
standards for multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should
be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of
special flood hazard area designation will be requested.
(Prior Code, § 530.13) (Ord. 2012-05, passed 3-7-2012)
§ 160.41 PUBLIC UTILITIES, RAILROADS, ROADS AND BRIDGES.
   (A)   Public utilities. All public utilities and facilities such as gas,
electrical, sewer and water supply systems to be located in the floodplain

to above the regulatory flood protection elevation.
   (B)   Public transportation facilities. Railroad tracks, roads and bridges
to be located within the floodplain shall comply with §§
160.26 and
160.27 of this chapter. Elevation to the regulatory flood protection elevation
shall be provided where failure or interruption of these transportation
facilities would result in danger to the public health or safety or where the
facilities are essential to the orderly functioning of the area. Minor or
auxiliary roads or railroads may be constructed at a lower elevation where
failure or interruption of transportation services would not endanger the
public health or safety.
   (C)   On-site sewage treatment and water supply systems.
      (1)   Where public utilities are not provided:
         (a)   On-site water supply systems must be designed to minimize or
eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system; and
         (b)   New or replacement on-site sewage treatment systems must be
designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system
and discharges from the systems into flood waters and they shall not be subject
to impairment or contamination during times of flooding.
      (2)   Any sewage treatment system designed in accordance with the state’s
current statewide standards for on-site sewage treatment systems shall be
determined to be in compliance with this division (C).
(Prior Code, § 530.15) (Ord. 2012-05, passed 3-7-2012)
§ 160.42 MANUFACTURED HOMES AND HOME PARKS; RECREATIONAL VEHICLES.
   (A)   New manufactured home parks and expansions to existing manufactured
home parks shall be subject to the provisions placed on subdivisions by §
160.40 of this chapter.
   (B)   (1)   The placement of new or replacement manufactured homes in
existing manufactured home parks or on individual lots of record that are
located in floodplain districts will be treated as a new structure and may be
placed only if elevated in compliance with §
160.27 of this chapter. If vehicular road access for pre-existing manufactured
home parks is not provided in accordance with §
160.27(E)(1) of this chapter, then replacement manufactured homes will not be
allowed until the property owner(s) develops a flood warning emergency plan
acceptable to the City Council.
      (2)   All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system that resists flotation, collapse and lateral
movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use
of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in
addition to applicable state or city anchoring requirements for resisting wind
forces.
   (C)   Recreational vehicles that do not meet the exemption criteria
specified in division (C)(1) below shall be subject to the provisions of this
chapter and as specifically required by divisions (C)(3) and (C)(4) below.
      (1)   Exemption. A recreational vehicle is exempt from the provisions of
this chapter if it is placed in any of the areas listed in division (C)(2)
below and meets the following criteria:
         (a)   Has current licenses required for highway use;
         (b)   Is “highway ready” meaning it is on wheels or has an internal
jacking system, and is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type
utilities commonly used in campgrounds and recreational vehicle parks, and has
no permanent structural type additions attached to it; and
         (c)   The vehicle and associated use must be permissible in any
underlying zoning district.
      (2)   Areas exempted for placement of recreational vehicles. A
recreational vehicle that meets the criteria in division (C)(1) above is exempt
from the provisions of this chapter only if it is placed in one of the
following locations:
         (a)   Individual lot or parcel of record;
         (b)   Existing commercial recreational vehicle park or campground; or
         (c)   Existing condominium type association.
      (3)   Attached parcel. A recreational vehicle exempted in division (C)(1)
above, loses the exemption when development occurs on the parcel exceeding $500
for a structural addition to the recreational vehicle or exceeding $500 for an
accessory structure such as a garage or storage building. The recreational
vehicle and all additions and accessory structures will then be treated as a
new structure and shall be subject to the elevation/flood-proofing requirements
and the use of land restrictions specified in §§
160.26 and
160.27 of this chapter. There shall be no development or improvement on the
parcel or attachment to the recreational vehicle that hinders the removal of
the recreational vehicle to a flood-free location should flooding occur.
      (4)   New parks and campgrounds. New commercial recreational vehicle
parks or campgrounds and new residential type subdivisions and condominium
associations and the expansion of any existing similar use exceeding five units
or dwelling sites shall be subject to the following.
         (a)   Any new or replacement recreational vehicle will be allowed in
the Floodway or Flood Fringe Districts if permitted in the underlying zoning
district; and, provided that, the recreational vehicle and its contents are
placed on fill above the regulatory flood protection elevation and proper
elevated road access to the site exists in accordance with §
160.27(E)(1) of this chapter. No fill placed in the floodway to meet the
requirements of this section shall increase flood stages of the 100-year or
regional flood.
         (b)   All new or replacement recreational vehicles not meeting the
criteria of division (C)(4)(a) above may, as an alternative, be allowed as a
conditional use if permitted in the underlying zoning district and if they are
in accordance with the following provisions and the provisions of division (D)
below. The applicant must submit an emergency plan for the safe evacuation of
all vehicles and people during the 100-year flood to the city Zoning
Administrator for review and approval. The plan shall be prepared by a
registered engineer or other qualified individual, shall demonstrate that
adequate time and personnel exist to carry out the evacuation, and shall
demonstrate the provisions of divisions (C)(1)(a) and (C)(1)(b) above will be
met. All attendant sewage and water facilities for new or replacement
recreational vehicles must be protected or constructed so as to not be impaired
or contaminated during times of flooding in accordance with §
160.41(C) of this chapter.

and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order,
requirement, decision or determination made by an administrative official in
the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
   (C)   Variances. The Board of Adjustment and Appeals may authorize, upon
appeal in specific cases, the relief or variance from the terms of this chapter
as will not be contrary to the public interest and only for those circumstances
such as hardship, practical difficulties or circumstances unique to the
property under consideration. In the granting of the variance, the Board of
Adjustment and Appeals shall clearly identify in writing the specific
conditions that existed consistent with the criteria specified in this chapter,
any other zoning regulations in the city and applicable state law that
justified the granting of the variance. No variance shall have the effect of
allowing in any district uses prohibited in that district, permit a lower
degree of flood protection than the regulatory flood protection elevation for
the particular area or permit standards lower than those required by state law.
The following additional variance criteria of the Federal Emergency Management
Agency must be satisfied.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued by the city within any designated
regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood
discharge would result.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued by the city upon a showing of good
and sufficient cause, a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant and a determination that the
granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional
threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
   (D)   Hearings. Upon filing with the Board of Adjustment and Appeals of an
appeal from a decision of the Zoning Administrator, or an application for a
variance, the Board of Adjustment and Appeals shall fix a reasonable time for a
hearing and give due notice to the parties in interest as specified by law. The
Board of Adjustment and Appeals shall submit by mail to the Commissioner of
Natural Resources a copy of the application for proposed variances sufficiently
in advance so that the Commissioner will receive at least ten days’ notice of
the hearing.
   (E)   Decisions. The Board of Adjustment and Appeals shall arrive at a
decision on the appeal or variance within the time required by law.
      (1)   In passing upon an appeal, the Board of Adjustment and Appeals may,
so long as such action is in conformity with the provisions of this chapter,
reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or modify the order, requirement,
decision or determination of the Zoning Administrator or other public official.
It shall make its decision in writing setting forth the findings of fact and
the reasons for its decisions.
      (2)   In granting a variance, the Board of Adjustment and Appeals may
prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards such as those specified in §
160.58(F) of this chapter, which are in conformity with the purposes of this
chapter.
      (3)   Violations of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of
the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of
this chapter punishable under §
160.99 of this chapter. A copy of all decisions granting variances shall be
forwarded by mail to the Commissioner of the Department of Natural Resources
within ten days of such action.
   (F)   Appeals. Appeals from any decision of the Board of Adjustment and
Appeals may be made, and as specified in the city’s Zoning Code.
   (G)   Flood insurance notice and record keeping.
      (1)   The Zoning Administrator shall notify the applicant for a variance
that:
         (a)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the
base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage, or another such
amount as shall be set by the City Council from time to time; and
         (b)   Such construction below the 100-year or regional flood level
increases risks to life and property.
      (2)   Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance
actions. The city shall maintain a record of all variance actions, including
justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its
annual or biennial report submitted to the administrator of the National Flood
Insurance Program.

floodplain management program for the area;
      (10)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
      (11)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and
      (12)   Such other factors which are relevant to the purposes of this
chapter.
   (E)   Time for acting on application. The City Council shall act on an
application in the manner described above within the time required by law. The
City Council shall render a written decision on the application.
   (F)   Conditions. Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the
purpose of this chapter, the City Council shall attach conditions to the
granting of a conditional use permit as it deems necessary to fulfill the

consideration are regulated by this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 530.19) (Ord. 2012-05, passed 3-7-2012)
§ 160.59 NON-CONFORMING USES.
   (A)   A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful
before the passage or amendment of this chapter, but which is not in conformity
with the provisions of this chapter may be continued subject to the following
conditions.
   (B)   Historic structures, as defined in §
160.11 of this chapter, shall be subject to the provisions of divisions (B)(1)
through (B)(5) below.
      (1)   No such use shall be expanded, changed, enlarged or altered in a
way that increases its non- conformity.
      (2)   Any structural alteration or addition to a non-conforming structure
or non-conforming use that would result in increasing the flood damage
potential of that structure or use shall be protected to the regulatory flood
protection elevation in accordance with any of the elevation on fill or flood-
proofing techniques (i.e., FP-1 through FP-4 flood-proofing classifications)
allowable in the state’s Building Code, except as further restricted in
divisions (B)(3) and (B)(6) below.
      (3)   The cost of all structural alterations or additions to any non-

satisfied. The cost of all structural alterations and additions must include
all costs such as construction materials and a reasonable cost placed on all
manpower or labor. If the cost of all previous and proposed alterations and
additions exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure, then the structure
must meet the standards of §§
160.26 or
160.27 of this chapter for new structures depending upon whether the structure
is in the Floodway or Flood Fringe Districts, respectively.
      (4)   If any non-conforming use is discontinued for 12 consecutive
months, any future use of the building premises shall conform to this chapter.
The Assessor shall notify the Zoning Administrator in writing of instances of
non-conforming uses that have been discontinued for a period of 12 months.
      (5)   If any non-conforming use or structure is substantially damaged, as

160.26,
160.27 or
160.28 of this chapter apply based on whether the use or structure is in the
Floodway, Flood Fringe or General Floodplain Districts, respectively.
      (6)   If a substantial improvement occurs, as defined in §
160.11 of this chapter, from any combination of a building addition to the
outside dimensions of the existing building or a rehabilitation,
reconstruction, alteration or other improvement to the inside dimensions of an
existing non-conforming building, then the building addition and the existing
non-conforming building must meet the requirements of §§
160.26 or
160.27 of this chapter for new structures, depending upon whether the structure
is in the Floodway or Flood Fringe Districts, respectively. A non-conforming
structure shall not be substantially improved if the structure is located in

      (4) The failure of any officer or employee of the city to perform any
official duty imposed by this code shall not subject the officer or employee to
the penalty imposed for a violation.
      (5)   In addition to any penalties provided for in this section, if any
person, firm or corporation fails to comply with any provision of this code,
the City Council or any city official designated by it may institute
appropriate proceedings at law or at equity to restrain, correct or abate the

public health, safety and welfare.
(Ord. 2007-01, passed 2-7-2007) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 161.05 PROCEDURES; PROCEDURAL EXCEPTIONS.
   (A)   Procedures.
      (1)   Except as provided in division (B) below, when land in the city is
proposed to be subdivided, the owner of the land or the owner’s authorized
representative must apply for and secure approval of the proposed subdivision
in accordance with the following procedure:
         (a)   Sketch plat (optional);
         (b)   Preliminary plat; and
         (c)   Final plat.
      (2)   Subdivision review will be carried out simultaneously and
coordinated with applicable flexible zoning regulations and floodplain
regulations contained in Chapter 163.
   (B)   Procedural exceptions.
      (1)   (a)   Combinations of adjacent complete parcels of record may be
approved administratively by the director. When a combination is requested for
the purpose of obtaining a building permit, or for the purpose of meeting
minimum development standards imposed by this section or any other provision of
this code, the city must be provided with:
            1.   Satisfactory evidence that the combination has been recorded
with the appropriate county officer;
            2.   A signed, notarized affidavit stating the purpose for which
the combination is requested; and
            3.   A certified survey of the lots to be combined as deemed
necessary by the Director.
         (b)   When a combination is requested solely for the purpose of
receiving a single tax statement for adjacent parcels, the applicant must
present satisfactory evidence that the parcels involved are complete parcels of
record. There is no fee for a parcel combination.
      (2)   (a)   The division of a parcel of record that was combined for the
sole purpose of receiving a single tax statement may be approved
administratively by the Director. The applicant must submit:
            1.   Satisfactory evidence that the previous combination was made
solely for the purpose of receiving a single tax statement;
            2.   Satisfactory evidence that the proposed manner of division
corresponds to the legal descriptions of the parcels which existed prior to the
combination; and
            3.   A certified survey of the parcels being divided as deemed
necessary by the Director to show the lots in the division meet all current
code requirements.
         (b)   The Director may require that a proposed division of tax
combined real estate follow the procedures for either a lot split or a normal
subdivision plat. There is no fee for a parcel division.
      (3)   Lot splits may be approved by submission of a certified survey and
legal description indicating the proposed manner of division, provided that the
division can be described in fractional or proportional parts by reference to
the legal descriptions existing of record on the date of the request. A lot
split will not be approved for a parcel described by metes and bounds. Lot
splits require City Council approval, following review and recommendation by
the Planning Commission. Pursuant to M.S. § 462.358, as it may be amended from
time to time, approval of a lot split by the City Council is deemed to include
waiver of the prohibitions against conveyance of property as contained in this
chapter. Lot splits are approved by the City Council following the same hearing
procedures required for a normal subdivision. The Director may waive the
technical information requirements of a normal subdivision determined to be
unnecessary. The normal preliminary plat and final plat procedures will be
waived. The Director may require that a proposed lot split be processed by
means of the normal subdivision plat procedure. Submission of a lot split for
approval must be accompanied by the same fee required for a plat.
      (4)   Minor subdivision of platted lots or unplatted property may be
approved by means of a certificate of survey, registered land survey or final
plat, in lieu of the standard platting procedure. Some of the following
provisions of this chapter may be exempted if all of the following conditions
exist:
         (a)   The subdivision will result in no more than three lots;
         (b)   Conditions on and around the tract to be subdivided are well-
defined;
         (c)   No future streets are needed or proposed to provide access to
the newly created lots or to existing lots;
         (d)   The subdivision will not obstruct planned future streets;
         (e)   The subdivision will not obstruct future subdivisions on
adjoining unplatted lands;
         (f)   The subdivision meets all lot area and lot dimension
requirements and building setback requirements;
         (g)   No further subdivision is expected. Further subdivision of the
tract from which lots were created under this minor subdivision procedure will
require following the platting procedures in this chapter; and
         (h)   Required easements are conveyed to the city in a appropriate
manner.
   (3)   Minor subdivisions require City Council approval, following
recommendation by the Planning Commission. Pursuant to M.S. § 462.358, as it
may be amended from time to time, approval of a minor subdivision by the City
Council is deemed to include waiver of the prohibitions against conveyance of
property.

§ 161.06 SKETCH PLATS.
   (A)   Submission. When a subdivision of property is proposed, a sketch plat
may, in the Director’s judgment, be prepared and submitted for review.
Submission of a sketch plat is not normally required, but is encouraged. The
Director may require a sketch plat if the proposed subdivision presents
substantial problems or difficulties on its face.
   (B)   Initiation. Submission of a sketch plat is the initiation of the plat
approval process.
   (C)   Content. The sketch plat must be a conceptual plan of the proposed
subdivision.
   (D)   Review and approval. Sketch plats are reviewed by the Director and,
upon the request or approval of the applicant, by the Planning Commission.
Sketch plat review is for the purpose of identifying potential problems,
suggesting design considerations and otherwise discussing the requirements of
this chapter, other ordinances and the comprehensive plan and their objectives
as they apply to the parcel of land contained in the application. The review of
a submitted sketch plat is for purposes of discussion and comment only. The
applicant may not infer any future approval of a preliminary or final plat
based upon the sketch plan plat review. Vested rights to a particular
subdivision plan do not accrue because of favorable comments made by either the
director or the Planning Commission.

city.
   (F)   Preliminary plats; road review.
      (1)   Any proposed preliminary plat which includes lands abutting upon
state rail bank property or upon any existing or established trunk highway or

preliminary plat.
   (J)   Procedure. Unless postponed or tabled the recommendation of the
planning commission with findings of fact is forwarded to the council for its
consideration. If the Planning Commission postpones consideration of the
proposed subdivision, the applicant must be provided with a written statement
of the reasons for such action and the facts on which the action is based.
      (1)   A preliminary plat may not be postponed more than once without the
consent of the applicant, and may only be postponed to the next regular meeting
of the Planning Commission or to a later date agreed to by the applicant.
Following initial postponement or failure of the applicant and commission to
agree to a satisfactory later date, the applicant may request the Planning
Commission to forward the preliminary plat with or without recommendation to
the City Council for consideration. A decision to forward the preliminary plat
without recommendation is at the discretion of the Planning Commission.
      (2)   The Planning Commission may table the preliminary plat only with
the consent of the applicant. Thereafter, the Planning Commission will consider
the proposed subdivision at a regular meeting requested by one of its members
or by the applicant.

plat by the City Council must be scheduled not more than 30 days following the
date the plat was forwarded by the Planning Commission, unless otherwise agreed
to by the applicant.
      (2)   The City Council may hold a public hearing as part of its
deliberations on the proposed subdivision. If the City Council determines to
hold a public hearing, the procedures of §
161.07 must be complied with. The City Council may question the applicant
regarding the proposal, to request additional information of the applicant, or
retain expert testimony at the expense of the applicant.
   (L)   City Council action. The City Council acts on the proposed subdivision
in one of the following ways:
      (1)   Approves the preliminary plat as submitted;
      (2)   Approves the preliminary plat with modifications or conditions;
      (3)   Disapproves the preliminary plat;
      (4)   Postpones action on the preliminary plat to the next regular
meeting of the City Council or to such later date agreed to by the applicant;
or
      (5)   With the consent of the applicant, tables action on the preliminary
plat.
   (M)   Findings. Action by the City Council approving, approving with
modifications or disapproving a preliminary plat must be accompanied by
findings of fact. The applicant must be provided with written documentation of
the City Council’s action stating the reasons for the City Council’s decision.
If the City Council postpones consideration of the proposed subdivision, the
applicant must be provided with a written statement of the reasons for that
action. A preliminary plat may not be postponed more than once without the
consent of the applicant, and must be postponed to the next regular meeting of
the City Council, or a later date agreed to by the applicant. Following initial

date, the applicant may request that the City Council act to approve, approve
with modifications or disapprove the preliminary plat, unless the preliminary
plat is postponed or tabled. The City Council, with the consent of the
applicant, may table the preliminary plat and thereafter the City Council will
consider the proposed subdivision at a regular council meeting as requested by
a City Council member or by the applicant.
   (N)   Time limit. Approval of a preliminary plat is valid for one year from
the date of the approval, unless prior to or within that one year period an
extension is granted by the City Council. If after the one year period or
extension thereof a final plat has not been submitted for review and approval,
the approval of the preliminary plat is void.

Treasurer must affix their signatures and the official seal of the city to the
final plat. The City Council must accept by separate resolution the lands and
improvements offered for public dedication. The applicant must file approved

required improvements. Prior to approval of the final plat by the City Council
the City Attorney must review the submitted bond, or other security, as to its
conformance with statutory provisions, form, sufficiency and manner of
execution. The required bond must be furnished in addition to a standard form
development contract.
      (2)   Waiver. The City Council may waive the requirement that the
subdivider provide a bond or other security. In such case, the City Council
must be provided with a signed, legally enforceable development contract
specifying the required improvements and the subdivider’s responsibility to
complete them. The development contract must also specify that the city may
undertake completion of the required improvements and assess the cost of same
against the land contained in the subdivision upon failure of the applicant to
satisfactorily complete the improvements. The contract must stipulate an agreed
upon date for completion of the required improvements not later than two years
from the date of approval of the development contract. The contract must be
submitted at the time of final plat consideration by the City Council. The City
Council may either waive the required bond submission and subsequently approve
the development contract or require that a bond be submitted prior to approval
of the final plat. If the development contract is accepted by the City Council,
the approval of the final plat is conditional pending satisfactory completion
of the required improvements. If the security is waived and a development
contract is submitted the final plat may not be signed or recorded until the
required improvements have been completed to the satisfaction of the director.
      (3)   Governmental units. Governmental units to which these bond and
contract requirements apply may file in lieu of the bond or contract a
certified resolution, from the officers or agencies empowered to act on their
behalf, agreeing to comply with the provisions of this subsection.
   (C)   Improvements; completion.
      (1)   Time. Required improvements must be completed within a time period
specified by the council. At the request of the subdivider and on the
recommendation of the Planning Commission, the City Council may extend the
completion deadline for a period of one year provided the term of the required
security is extended.
      (2)   Quality. The subdivider must request inspection of completed
improvements by the Director. The Director will inspect improvements for
compliance with the approved final plat, the submitted plans, profiles and
specifications for the improvements and the quality of their construction. Upon
a finding that the improvements have been satisfactorily completed, the
Director must certify their completion by letter to the subdivider and the City
Council. Upon a finding that improvements have not been satisfactorily
completed, the Director must certify the deficiencies by letter to the
subdivider and the City Council.
      (3)   Remedies. If the required improvements have not been satisfactorily
completed by the completion deadline, the City Council may:
         (a)   Extend the deadline for completion of the improvements for a
period of not to exceed one year;
         (b)   Declare any submitted bonds or other securities in default and
apply funds obtained from such to complete the required improvements;
         (c)   Declare the development contract, if such has been entered into,
to be violated and thereupon undertake to complete the required improvements,
assessing the cost of same against the land contained in the subdivision; or
         (d)   When no improvements have been commenced, rescind its previous
approval of the final plat and, if the plat has been recorded, undertake
necessary action to vacate the plat or the public rights-of-way contained
therein.
      (4)   Bond waiver. If the bond requirement has been waived and a
development contract entered into, the director must certify satisfactory
completion of the required improvements prior to the execution of the final
plat by the Mayor and City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer.
      (5)   Building permits. A building permit for private construction may
not be issued for land in a subdivision for which the final plat has not been
recorded with the appropriate county officer. A building permit for private
construction may not be issued for more than 60% of the lots or dwelling units
contained in a subdivision for which all required improvements have not been
completed. When the subdivision is to be accomplished in stages this
requirement applies to each phase.
      (6)   Release. Bonds or other security held by the city to secure
required improvements will be released one year following the date of
certification of satisfactory completion of the improvements by the Director.

§ 161.10 LAND DEDICATION, EASEMENTS AND COVENANTS.
   (A)   Dedications. The City Council may require dedication of public
improvements and lands designated on the plat or intended for public use. The
city may require reservations and dedications for improvements that are not to
be undertaken or completed immediately or as part of an approved subdivision.
These requirements include, but are not limited to, lands for public utilities,
streets and park and recreation facilities. The city may approve or disapprove
the locations of lands proposed for dedication pursuant to this subsection. The

154.026, park dedications, apply to these dedications.
   (B)   Streets. The final plat must indicate the location and reservation of
rights-of-way, public and private, in the proposed subdivision.
   (C)   Utilities.
      (1)   The city requires that easements be provided for the location of

provided prior to the approval of final plat. The final plat must show the
location of the easements.
      (2)   The city may require the dedication of certain lands in fee simple
for public utility use where deemed necessary or desirable in the public
interest. In such case the dedication will be accomplished by submission of a
warranty deed and a written irrevocable offer of dedication prior to approval
of the final plat.
      (3)   Unless authorized by the City Council, private water, sanitary or
storm sewer facilities may not be constructed within a proposed subdivision to
meet the requirements of this section.

§ 161.12 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Authority. The city may consider and grant variances to the provisions
of this section when it finds that this section imposes unusual hardship to the
subdivider in the use of his or her land. Unusual hardship includes, but is not
limited to, inadequate access to direct sunlight for solar energy systems.
   (B)   Procedure. Variances will be processed and granted in accordance with
§
163.326.
   (C)   Criteria. A variance may be granted only if the City Council finds
that all of the following circumstances exist:
      (1)   The variance is in harmony with the general purposes and intent of
the code;
      (2)   The variance is consistent with the comprehensive plan;
      (3)   The subdivider proposes to use the property in a reasonable manner
not permitted by this
code;
      (4)   Unique circumstances apply to the property which do not apply
generally to other properties in the same zone or vicinity and result from lot
size or shape, topography or other circumstances over which the owner of the
property has had no control. That the unique circumstances do not result from
the actions of the subdivider;
      (5)   The variance does not alter the essential character of the
neighborhood; and
      (6)   Economic conditions alone do not constitute unusual hardship.
   (D)   Conditions. The city may impose such conditions upon the premises
benefitted by the variance as may be necessary to comply with the standards
established by this chapter or to reduce or minimize the effect of such
variance upon other properties in the neighborhood, and to better carry out the
intent of the variance. The condition must be directly related to and must bear
a rough proportionality to the impact created by the variance.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 162.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose and intent of this chapter is to maintain, enhance and improve
the aesthetic environment of the city by preventing visual clutter that is
harmful to the appearance of the community; improve the visual appearance of
the city while providing for effective means of communication, consistent with
constitutional guarantees and the city’s goals of public safety and aesthetics;
and to provide for the safety of the traveling public by limiting distractions,
hazards and obstructions. This will be accomplished by regulation of the
display, erection, use and maintenance of signs. The use of signs is regulated
according to land use zoning districts, as defined in the Zoning Code. The
placement and scale of signs are regulated primarily by type and length of
street frontage, though lot size, investment and surrounding conditions must
also be considered. A sign is not permitted as a main or accessory use, except
in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. This chapter is not intended
to, and does not restrict speech on the basis of its content, viewpoint or
message. No part of this chapter shall be constructed to favor commercial
speech over non-commercial speech. To the extent that any provision of this
chapter is ambiguous, the provision shall be interpreted not to regulate on the
basis of speech content and the interpretation resulting in the least
restriction on the content of the sign’s message shall prevail.
(Prior Code, § 415.01) (Ord. 2007-08, passed 5-16-2007; Ord. 20210421-01,
passed 4-21-2021)
§ 162.02 SCOPE.
   This chapter does not relate to building design. This chapter does not
regulate official traffic or government signs; the copy and message of signs;
signs not intended to be viewed from a public right-of-way; window displays;
product dispensers and point of purchase displays; scoreboards on athletic
fields; gravestones; barber poles; commemorative plaques; the display of street
numbers; or any display or construction not defined herein as a sign. Thus, the
primary intent of this chapter is to regulate signs intended to be viewed from
any vehicular or pedestrian public right-of-way.

Penalty, see §
162.99
§ 162.07 NON-CONFORMING SIGNS.
   (A)   Determination of legal non-conformity. Any sign legally existing at
the time of passage of this chapter that does not conform to the provisions of
this chapter shall be considered a legal non- conforming sign and may be
continued through repair, replacement, restoration, maintenance or improvement,
but not including, expansion. EXPANSION shall be defined as any structural
alteration, change or addition that is made outside of the original sign
structure, sign area or design.
   (B)   Unsafe signs. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the return of a
sign structure that has been declared unsafe by the Code Administrator to a
safe condition.
   (C)   Discontinuance or change. When any legal non-conforming sign is
discontinued for a period of time of more than one year, or is changed to a
conforming sign, any future sign shall be in conformity with the provisions of
this chapter.
   (D)   Removal. Any legal non-conforming sign shall be removed and shall not
be repaired, replaced or rebuilt if it is damaged by fire or similar peril to
the extent of greater than 50% of its market value at the time of destruction
and no sign permit has been applied for within 180 days of the date of
destruction. The Code Administrator shall be responsible for making the
determination of whether a non- conforming sign has been destroyed greater than
50% of its market value at the time of destruction. In making that
determination, the Code Administrator shall consider the market value of the
entire sign at the time prior to the destruction and the replacement value of
the existing sign.
   (E)   Conditions. In the event that a sign permit is applied for within 180
days of the date of destruction and the sign did not withstand damage greater
than 50% of its market value at the time of destruction, the city may impose
reasonable conditions upon the sign permit in order to mitigate any newly
created impact on adjacent properties.
   (F)   Change. A lawful non-conforming sign shall not be changed to a similar
non-conforming sign or to a more restrictive non-conforming sign.
(Prior Code, § 415.09) (Ord. 2007-08, passed 5-16-2007; Ord. 20210421-01,
passed 4-21-2021)
§ 162.08 CONSTRUCTION, LOCATION AND DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS.
   (A)   General requirements. All signs shall conform to the requirements of
this chapter whether or not a sign permit is required. All signs shall be
constructed in a manner and of a material that they shall be safe and
substantial. All signs shall be properly secured, supported and braced and
shall be kept in good repair so that public safety and traffic safety are not
compromised. All signs shall conform to the National Electric Code as adopted
by the state, if applicable.
   (B)   Maintenance.
      (1)   Exposed surfaces on the sign shall be kept clean and painted if
paint is required. Defective parts shall be replaced.
      (2)   The area on the property around the sign on which it is erected
shall be properly maintained and clear of brush, long grass, weeds, debris,
rubbish and other obstacles.
      (3)   All burned-out light bulbs or damaged panels on a sign shall be
immediately replaced.
   (C)   Sign copy. All sign copy shall be fastened securely to the sign face
and maintained on a regular basis. Any missing sign copy shall be replaced
immediately. Any sign copy that is outdated must be removed within 30 days of
becoming outdated.
   (D)   Location. No sign shall be located as to obscure any existing sign. No
sign shall be attached to or placed upon any building in a manner as to
obstruct any window or door or fire escape or be attached to any fire escape.
No sign shall impede pedestrian access to or use of an established sidewalk.
   (E)   Interference with traffic. A sign shall not be located within 50 feet
of any street, traffic sign or signal, intersection, driveway or crosswalk. A
sign may be located closer than 50 feet if it can be shown that the sign will
not interfere with the ability of drivers and pedestrians to see the traffic
sign or signal, intersection, driveway or crosswalk and the sign will not
distract drivers, nor cause any interference with the traffic sign or signal.
   (F)   Banners. Banners shall be strongly constructed and be securely
attached to their supports. They shall be repaired or removed as soon as they
are damaged or torn.

162.99
§ 162.09 CONFLICT, SEVERABILITY AND EFFECTIVE DATE.
   (A)   This chapter and its parts are declared to be severable. If any
section, division, clause, sentence, word, provision or portion of this chapter
is declared to be invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent
jurisdiction, that declaration shall not affect the validity of this chapter as
a whole. All parts of this chapter not declared invalid or unconstitutional
shall remain in full force and effect as if the portion so declared or adjudged
unconstitutional or invalid was not originally part of this chapter, even if
the surviving parts of this chapter result in greater restrictions after any
unconstitutional or invalid provisions are stricken.
   (B)   The City Council declares that it would have enacted the remaining
parts of this chapter even if it had known that such portion thereof would be
declared or adjudged unconstitutional or invalid. If any part of this chapter
is found to be in conflict with any other code provision or with any part of
this chapter, the most restrictive or highest standard shall prevail. If any
part of this chapter is explicitly prohibited by federal or state statutes,
that part shall not be enforced.

ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT
§ 162.20 CODE ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)   The Code Administrator is appointed by the City Council and is
authorized to process applications for permits and variances, schedule public
hearings as required and enforce and carry out all provisions of this code. The
Code Administrator may promulgate regulations and procedures consistent with
this function.
   (B)   The Code Administrator may, upon presentation of proper credentials,
enter or inspect any building, structure or premises in the city for the
purpose of inspection of a sign and its structural and electrical connections
to ensure compliance with all applicable codes and ordinances. The inspections
must be carried out during business hours unless an emergency exists.
(Prior Code, § 415.13) (Ord. 2007-08, passed 5-16-2007; Ord. 20210421-01,
passed 4-21-2021)

or multi-faced.
(Prior Code, § 415.13) (Ord. 2007-08, passed 5-16-2007; Ord. 20210421-01,
passed 4-21-2021)
§ 162.22 PERMIT FEES.
   Applications for permits filed with the Code Administrator must be
accompanied by a payment of the initial permit fee for each sign as required by
§
36.02 of this code of ordinances.
(Prior Code, § 415.13) (Ord. 2007-08, passed 5-16-2007; Ord. 20210421-01,
passed 4-21-2021)
§ 162.23 PERMIT ISSUANCE AND DENIAL.
   (A)   The Code Administrator will issue a permit for the erection,
structural alteration or relocation of a sign within five days of receipt of a
valid application, provided that the sign complies with all applicable laws and
regulations of the city. The permit shall be valid for a period of one year (or
unlimited duration).
   (B)   In all applications, where a matter of interpretation arises, the more
specific definition or higher standard shall prevail. When a permit is denied,
the Code Administrator must within five days, give a written notice to the
applicant along with a brief statement of the reasons for denial, citing code
sections and interpretation of possible non-conformity. The Code Administrator
may suspend or revoke an issued permit for any false statement or
misrepresentation of fact in the application.
(Prior Code, § 415.13) (Ord. 2007-08, passed 5-16-2007; Ord. 20210421-01,
passed 4-21-2021)
§ 162.24 PERMIT CONDITIONS, REFUNDS AND PENALTIES.
   If a permit is denied, the permit fee will be refunded to the applicant. If
no inspections have been made and no work authorized by the permit has been
performed, the permit fee, except for $15, may be refunded to the applicant
upon request, provided that the permit is returned to the Code Administrator
within ten days of issuance. If any sign is installed or placed on any property
prior to receipt of a permit, the specified permit fee shall be doubled.
However, payment of the doubled fee shall not relieve any person of any other
requirements or penalties prescribed in this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 415.13) (Ord. 2007-08, passed 5-16-2007; Ord. 20210421-01,
passed 4-21-2021)
§ 162.25 INSPECTION UPON COMPLETION.
   A person installing, structurally altering or relocating a sign for which a
permit has been issued must notify the Code Administrator upon completion of
the work. The Code Administrator may require a final inspection, including an
electrical inspection and inspection of footings on freestanding signs. The
Code Administrator may require at the time of issuance of a permit that written
notification for an inspection be submitted prior to the installation of
certain signs.
(Prior Code, § 415.13) (Ord. 2007-08, passed 5-16-2007; Ord. 20210421-01,
passed 4-21-2021)
§ 162.26 VARIANCES.
   (A)   When requesting a permit, the applicant may apply to the Code
Administrator for a variance from the requirements of this code. A variance may
be granted by the Council where the literal application of the code would
create practical difficulties for the sign user and all of the following
criteria are met:
      (1)   The applicant proposes to use the property in a reasonable manner
not permitted by this code;
      (2)   The variance does not alter the essential character of the
neighborhood;
      (3)   Unique circumstances apply to the property which do not apply to
other properties in the same zone or vicinity and result from lot size or
shape, topography or other circumstances over which the owner of the property
has had no control. The unique circumstances do not result from the actions of
the applicant;
      (4)   The granting of the variance is in harmony with the general
purposes and intent of this code;
      (5)   The variance is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan; and
      (6)   Economic conditions alone do not constitute practical difficulties.
   (B)   In granting a variance, the Council may attach additional conditions
necessary to carry out the spirit and purpose of this chapter in the public
interest. The conditions must be directly related to and must bear a rough
proportionality to the impact created by the variance.
   (C)   Refer to §
163.326 for the process and procedure to follow for obtaining a variance.
(Prior Code, § 415.13) (Ord. 2007-08, passed 5-16-2007; Ord. 2011-09, passed 8-
17-2011; Ord. 20210421-01, passed 4-21-2021)
§ 162.27 VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   When, in the opinion of the Code Administrator, a violation of the
code exists, the Code Administrator may issue a written order to the alleged
violator. The order must specify those sections of the code which the
individual may be in violation of and state that the individual has 15 days
from the date of the order in which to correct the alleged violation or to
appeal to the Council.
   (B)   If, upon inspection, the Code Administrator finds that a sign is
abandoned or structurally, materially or electrically defective, or in any way
endangers the public, the Code Administrator must issue a written order to the
owner of the sign and occupant of the premises stating the nature of the
violation and requiring them to repair or remove the sign within 15 days of the
date of the order.
   (C)   In cases of emergency, the Code Administrator may cause the immediate
removal of a dangerous or defective sign without notice. Signs removed in this
manner must present a hazard to the public safety as defined in the local
building or traffic codes.
(Prior Code, § 415.13) (Ord. 2007-08, passed 5-16-2007; Ord. 20210421-01,
passed 4-21-2021)
§ 162.28 REMOVAL OF SIGNS BY CODE ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)   (1)   The Code Administrator may cause the removal of an illegal sign
in cases of emergency, or for failure to comply with the written orders of
removal or repair.
      (2)   After removal or demolition of the sign, a notice must be mailed to
the sign owner stating the nature of the work and the date on which it was
performed and demanding payment of the costs as certified by the Code
Administrator.
   (B)   If the amount specified in the notice is not paid within 30 days of
the notice, it shall become an assessment upon a lien against the property of
the sign owner, and will be certified as an assessment against the property
together with a 5% penalty for collection in the same manner as the real estate
taxes in accordance with M.S. § 429.101, as it may be amended from time to
time.
   (C)   The owner of the property upon which the sign is located is presumed
to be the owner of all signs thereon unless facts to the contrary are brought
to the attention of the Code Administrator, as in the case of a leased sign.
   (D)   For purposes of removal, the definition of sign includes all sign
embellishments and structures designed specifically to support the sign.

or in alleging a violation of this chapter may be appealed to the Council or
Board within 60 days of the Code Administrator’s receipt of application.
   (B)   The action being appealed will be held in abeyance pending the
decision of the Council.

§ 162.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   (1)   Any person, firm or corporation who violates any provision of
this chapter for which another penalty is not specifically provided, shall,
upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor. The penalty which may be imposed

      (2)   Any person, firm or corporation who violates any provision of this
code, including Minnesota Statutes specifically adopted by reference, which is
designated to be a petty misdemeanor shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a
petty misdemeanor. The penalty which may be imposed for any petty offense which
is a petty misdemeanor shall be a sentence of a fine of not more than $300.
      (3)   Pursuant to M.S. § 631.48, as it may be amended from time to time,
in either the case of a misdemeanor or a petty misdemeanor, the costs of
prosecution may be added. A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon
each day during which a violation occurs or continues.
      (4) The failure of any officer or employee of the city to perform any
official duty imposed by this code shall not subject the officer or employee to
the penalty imposed for a violation.
      (5)   In addition to any penalties provided for in this section, if any
person, firm or corporation fails to comply with any provision of this code,

occupancy of a building or buildings, including additions thereto, requiring
more parking area is not permitted until there is furnished additional parking
spaces required by this section.
      (6)   Computation of spaces required. In computing the number of parking
or loading spaces required, the following rules apply:
         (a)   Floor space means the gross floor area of the specific use;
         (b)   Where fractional spaces result, the parking spaces required will
be construed to be the nearest whole number; and
         (c)   The parking space requirement for a use not specifically
mentioned herein is the same as required for a similar use as determined by the
Zoning Administrator.
      (7)   Maintenance. The lessee and the owner of the principal use, uses or
buildings must maintain in a neat and adequate manner, the parking space,
accessways, striping, landscaping and required screening.
   (B)   Design of off-street parking and loading space. Off-street parking and
loading spaces must be designed as follows.
      (1)   Generally. Off-street parking areas must be so designed that
vehicles are parked in an orderly fashion. Site plans must show proposed
parking spaces, driveways, loading areas, landscaping and screening, and the
parking area must conform to such site plans. Aisle entrances must be kept
clear by appropriate design.
      (2)   Size. A parking space may not be less than nine feet wide and 20
feet in length and will in no case be less than 180 square feet in area. Access
aisles must serve each space adequately.
      (3)   Surfacing.
         (a)   Areas intended to be utilized for parking space and driveways
must be surfaced with materials suitable to control dust and drainage.
         (b)   Off-street parking areas, except for single-family residences,
must be paved with concrete or plant mixed bituminous surface.
         (c)   In addition to the minimum number of required parking spaces, 3%
of the gross parking area lying more than 20 feet from the street right-of-way
must be improved and maintained with landscaping of grass and evergreens or
other approved plants or ornamental materials.
      (4)   Striping. Except for single-, two-family and townhouses, parking
stalls must be marked with white painted lines not less four inches wide.
      (5)   Lighting. Lighting used to illuminate an off-street parking area
must be arranged to reflect the light away from adjoining property, abutting
the residential uses and public rights-of-way.
      (6)   Curbing and landscaping. Except for single-, two-family and
townhouses, open off-street parking must have a perimeter curb barrier around
the entire parking lot, and the curb barrier may not be closer than five feet
to any lot line. Grass, plantings or surfacing material must be provided in
areas bordering the parking area.
      (7)   Location. Required parking spaces must be off-street and located on
the same lot as the building or use to be served. Required off-street parking
spaces may be provided within the principal building for which they are
required. Except in the case of single-, two-family and townhouses, parking
areas requiring backing into a public street are prohibited.
      (8)   Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). ADA standards must be
followed where required.
   (C)   Schedule of off-street parking requirements.

§ 163.006 FENCES.
   (A)   General. It is unlawful for any person to erect, place or relocate a
fence in the city except in accordance with the provisions of this section.
   (B)   Permit required. All fences require a fence permit and payment of fees
as described in §
36.02 of this code of ordinances. A permit is not required for the maintenance
of a fence.
   (C)   Safety hazards. Fences shall not be erected where they create a visual
safety hazard in the opinion of the Zoning Administrator.
   (D)   Location and orientation.
      (1)   Fences shall sit on the property of the property owner installing
the fence; fences may abut, but not sit directly on side lot lines of adjacent
parcels.
      (2)   The “good side” of the fence shall face abutting properties,
meaning that the posts shall face in toward the property on which the fence
sits and the finished face of the fence shall face abutting properties. If the
fence is within two feet of a property line, the adjoining property owner
abutting the fence is allowed to finish the side of the fence facing his or her
property.
   (E)   Maintenance. Fences shall be maintained to retain their aesthetic
quality, screening abilities and function. Missing boards, rusting wire and
posts and peeling paint shall be taken care of at the owner’s expense as they
occur.

163.999
§ 163.008 GENERAL DISTRICT PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Establishment of districts. The following zoning districts are
established and continued:
      (1)   Traditional Residential;
      (2)   Suburban Residential;
      (3)   Historic Downtown;
      (4)   Highway Mixed Use;
      (5)   Prospective Interchange Development;
      (6)   Professional/Light Industrial;
      (7)   Business Park;
      (8)   Industrial;
      (9)   Public Recreation/Open Space;
      (10)   Kettle River Wild and Scenic Floodplain;
      (11)   General Shoreland;
      (12)   Commercial Planned Unit Development;
      (13)   Residential Planned Unit Development;
      (14)   Recreational Vehicle Park;
      (15)   Manufactured Home Park; and
      (16)   Heliport.
   (B)   Map.
      (1)   The location and boundaries of the districts established by this
section are set forth on the zoning map entitled “Zoning Map of Sandstone”. The
zoning map is on file with the Zoning Administrator. The zoning map and the
notations, references and other information shown on the map have the same
force and effect as if fully set forth herein and are made a part of this
section by reference.
      (2)   If a use is not specifically permitted in a zoning district, the
use is prohibited. The City Council or the Planning Commission, as the case may
be, on its own initiative or upon request of the property owner, may conduct a
study to determine if the proposed use is acceptable and if so what zoning
district would be most appropriate and to determine conditions and standards
relating to development of the use.
      (3)   The City Council, Planning Commission or property owner, upon
completion of the study, may, if appropriate, initiate an amendment to this
section to provide for the use under consideration.
   (C)   Annexation; detachment. If changes in the city limits remove land from
the city, district boundaries are construed as moving with the city limits. If
land is annexed to the city, the land is designated by the comprehensive plan
of the city.
   (D)   Zoning district boundaries.
      (1)   Boundaries indicated approximately following the center lines of
streets, highways, alleys or railroad lines are to be construed as following
those center lines.
      (2)   Boundaries indicated approximately following platted lot lines are
to be construed as following those lot lines.
      (3)   Boundaries indicated as following shorelines are to be construed
following those shorelines, and if the shoreline is changed, are to be
construed as moving with the actual shoreline; boundaries indicated
approximately following the center lines of streams, rivers, lakes or other
bodies of water are to be constructed as following those center lines.
      (4)   Boundaries indicated approximately following the city limits are to
be construed as following the city limits.
      (5)   Where a district boundary line divides a lot that was in a single
ownership on the effective date of this section, the extension of the
regulations for either portion of the lot beyond the district line into the
remaining portion of the lot may be interpreted by the Planning Commission upon
request of the owner.
   (E)   District regulations. Except as otherwise provided, the regulations of
this section within each district are minimum regulations and apply uniformly
to each class or kind of structure or land.
      (1)   Buildings, structures or land may not be used or occupied, and a
building structure or part thereof may not be erected, constructed,
reconstructed, moved or structurally altered, except in conformity with the
regulations for the district in which it is located.
      (2)   A building or other structure may not be erected or altered to
exceed the height or bulk, to accommodate or house a greater number of
families, to occupy a greater percentage of lot area, to have narrower or
smaller rear yard, front yard, side yard or other open spaces than herein
required; or in any other manner contrary to the provision of this section.
      (3)   A yard or lot existing on the effective date of this section may
not be reduced in dimension or area below the minimum requirements of this
section.
(Ord. passed - -2007)
§ 163.009 NON-CONFORMING BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES AND USES.
   (A)   (1)   The purpose of this section is to provide for the regulation of
non-conforming buildings, structures and uses and to specify those
requirements, circumstances and conditions under which non-conforming
buildings, structures and uses will be operated and maintained. This section
establishes separate districts, each of which is an appropriate area for the
location of uses that are permitted in that district.
      (2)   It is necessary and consistent with the establishment of these
districts that non-conforming buildings, structures and uses not be permitted
to continue without restriction. It is the intent of this section that all non-
conforming uses are eventually brought into conformity.
   (B)   A non-conforming structure or use lawfully existing on the effective
date of this section may not be enlarged, but may be continued at the size and
in the manner of operation existing on that date, except as otherwise specified
in this section.
   (C)   Nothing in this section prevents the placing of a structure in safe
condition when the structure is declared unsafe by the Building Official
providing the necessary repairs may not constitute more than 50% of fair market
value of the structure. The City Assessor determines the value.
   (D)   A non-conforming building, structure or use may not be moved to
another lot or to any other part of the parcel of land upon which the same was
constructed or was conducted on the effective date of this section unless the
movement brings the non-conformance into compliance with the requirements of
this section.
   (E)   If a lawful non-conforming use of any structure or land in any
district has been changed to a conforming use, it may not thereafter be changed
to any non-conforming use.
   (F)   Lawful non-conforming use of a structure or parcel of land may be
changed to lessen the non-conformity of use. Once a non-conforming structure or
parcel of land has been changed, it may not thereafter be so altered to
increase the non-conformity.
   (G)   If a non-conforming building, structure or use is destroyed to the
extent of more than 50% of its fair market value, as determined by the City
Assessor, then without further action by the City Council, the building and the
land on which the building was located or maintained is, from and after the
date of the destruction, subject to all the regulations specified by this
section for the district in which such land the buildings are located. A
building that is damaged to an extent of less than 50% of its value may be
restored to its former condition. The Building Official makes the estimate of
the extent of damage or destruction.
   (H)   If a lawful non-conforming use of a structure or land is discontinued
for a period of six months, future use of the structure or lands must conform
to the provisions of this section.
   (I)   Normal maintenance of a building or other structure containing or
related to a lawful non-conforming use is permitted, including necessary non-
structural repairs and incidental alterations that do not physically extend or
intensify the non-conforming use.
   (J)   Alterations may be made to a building containing lawful non-conforming
residential units when the alterations will improve the livability thereof;
provided they will not increase the number of dwelling units or size or volume
of the building.
   (K)   A proposed structure that will, under this section, become non-
conforming, but for which a building permit has been lawfully granted prior to
the effective date of this section, may be completed in accordance with the
approved plans; provided construction is started within 60 days of the
effective date of this code, is not abandoned for a period of more than 120
days and continues to completion within two years. The structure and use will
thereafter be a legally nonconforming structure and use.

TRADITIONAL RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT
§ 163.020 PURPOSE.
   This designation strongly reflects the current pattern of residential use in
the city. The district primarily includes single-family detached units, but
also allows for single-family attached dwellings and multiple-family housing.
This core residential area also supports institutional and public uses.
Densities of four to six dwelling units per acre are common and anticipated to
continue into future development of these lands. In some areas, it may be
appropriate to develop multi-family housing at densities greater than six units
per acre. Some portions of this district may be appropriate for lot splits,
subdivision redevelopment or infill development. There are some areas of the
residential district where limited commercial uses such as small retail
(“corner stores”) or offices are appropriate with special use permits.

SUBURBAN RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT
§ 163.040 PURPOSE.

HELIPORT OVERLAY DISTRICT
§ 163.180 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The legislature of the state has, in M.S. § 360.063, as it may be amended
from time to time, delegated the responsibility to local government units to
adopt zoning regulations for airport hazard areas within their territorial
limits, which include heliports. The provisions of this subchapter regulate
only the real property located within the city’s territorial limits.
(Prior Code, § 515.33) (Ord. 20181107-02, passed 11-7-2018; Ord. 20210217-09,
passed 2-17-2021)
§ 163.181 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   Airport hazards, as defined in M.S. § 360.013, subd. 40, as it may be
amended from time to time, endanger the lives and property of users of the Pine
Medical Center Heliport and property or occupants of land in its vicinity; and
also if of the obstructive type, have the effect of reducing the size of the
area available for the landing, takeoff and maneuvering of aircraft, thus
tending to destroy or impair the utility and safety of the heliport.
   (B)   The creation or establishment of an airport hazard is a public
nuisance and an injury to the region served by the Pine Medical Center
Heliport.
   (C)   For the protection of the public health, safety, order, convenience,
prosperity and general welfare, and for the promotion of the most appropriate
use of land, it is necessary to prevent the creation or establishment of
airport hazards.
   (D)   The prevention of these airport hazards should be accomplished, to the
extent legally possible, by the exercise of the police power without
compensation. The prevention of the creation or establishment of airport
hazards, and the elimination, removal, alteration, mitigation or marking and
lighting of existing airport hazards are public purposes for which political
subdivisions may raise and expend public funds.
   (E)   The Pine Medical Center Heliport is an essential facility that serves
an important public transportation role and provides a public good.

§ 163.184 AIR SPACE OBSTRUCTION ZONING.
   (A)   Air space zones. In order to carry out the purpose of this subchapter,
as set forth above, the following air space zones are hereby established and
defined as follows:
      (1)   Primary zone. All that land which lies directly under an imaginary
primary surface that coincides in size and shape with the designated FATO. The
elevation of any point on the primary surface is the same as the elevation of
the lowest point on the TLOF;
      (2)   Approach zone.

surface. The approach surface may be defined by a single magnetic direction
from the center of the heliport or as an arc from the center of the heliport.
         (b)   The inner edge of the approach surface starts at the elevation
of the primary surface, at the end of the primary surface and extends a
distance equal to half of the FATO width on either side of the defining
direction or arc.
         (c)   The approach surface inclines upward at a slope of 8:1 and
expands uniformly to a width of 250 feet either side of the defining direction
or arc at a distance 4,000 feet from the primary surface.
         (d)   The approach surface may be curved and if curved the curve may
not start until 300 feet from the primary surface and the minimum turning
radius must be at least 886 feet; and
      (3)   Transitional zone. All that land which lies directly under an
imaginary surface extending upward and outward at right angles to the approach
zone direction or arc centerline and centerline extended at a slope of 2:1 from
the sides of the primary surfaces and from the sides of the approach surfaces

§ 163.185 LAND USE SAFETY ZONING.
   (A)   Safety zone boundaries. In order to carry out the purpose of this
subchapter, to restrict those uses which may be hazardous to the operational
safety of aircraft operating to and from the Pine Medical Center Heliport,
there are hereby created and established the following land use safety zones:
      (1)   Ground impact area. All land within an area that extends 280 feet
from the center of the heliport in all directions;
      (2)   Inner approach area. All land in that portion of the approach zone
and transitional zone, where they are utilized, between 280 feet from the
center of the heliport to 1,000 feet from the center of the heliport; and
      (3)   Outer area. All land within 4,100 feet of the center of the
heliport that is not included in the other two areas.
   (B)   Use restrictions.
      (1)   General. Subject at all times to the height restrictions set forth
in §
163.184(B) of this chapter, no use shall be made of any land in any of the
safety zones defined by this section which creates or causes interference with
the operations of radio or electronic facilities on the heliport or with radio
or electronic communications between the heliport and aircraft, make it
difficult for pilots to distinguish between heliport lights and other lights,
results in glare in the eyes of pilots using the heliport, impairs visibility
in the vicinity of the heliport, or otherwise endangers the landing, taking off
or maneuvering of aircraft.
      (2)   Ground impact area. Subject at all times to the height restrictions
set forth in §
163.184(B) of this chapter and to the general restrictions contained in
division (B)(1) above, areas designated as ground impact areas shall be able to
be cleared of vehicle and pedestrian traffic. No construction or planting may

§ 163.187 NON-CONFORMING USES.
   The regulations prescribed by this subchapter shall not be construed to
require the removal, lowering or other changes or alteration of any structure
or tree not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date of the
ordinance establishing this subchapter, or otherwise interfere with the
continuance of any non- conforming use. Nothing herein contained shall require
any change in the construction, alteration or intended use of any structure,
the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date
of the ordinance establishing this subchapter, and is diligently prosecuted and
completed within two years thereof.

§ 163.188 PERMITS.
   (A)   Future uses. No material change shall be made in the use of land and
no structure shall be erected, altered or otherwise established in any zone
created by this chapter without obtaining a permit from the Zoning
Administrator. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for
which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to
conform to the regulations of this subchapter. If the determination is in the
affirmative, the permit shall be granted.
   (B)   Exception. A permit shall not be required under division (A) above for
a tree or structure of less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground in
the outer area, except when the tree or structure, because of terrain, land
contour or topographic features, would extend the height or land use limit
prescribed for the respective zone. Nothing contained in this exception shall
be construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, alteration
or growth of any structure or tree in excess of any of the height limitations
or land use limitations established by this subchapter.
   (C)   Existing uses. No existing use or structure shall be replaced,
substantially altered or repaired, or rebuilt within any zone established by
this subchapter without a permit authorizing the replacement, change or repair.
No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an
airport hazard or permit a non-conforming use, structure or tree to become a
greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of the
ordinance establishing this subchapter or any amendments thereto, or than it is
when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all
applications for such a permit shall be granted.
   (D)   Non-conforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the Zoning
Administrator determines that a non-conforming structure or tree has been
abandoned or is more than 80% destroyed, no permit shall be granted that would
allow the structure or tree to exceed the limitations imposed by this
subchapter. Whether application is made for a permit under this section or not,
the Zoning Administrator may order the owner of the abandoned or partially
destroyed non-conforming structure, at the owner’s sole expense, to lower,
remove, reconstruct or equip the same in the manner necessary to conform to the
provisions of this chapter. In the event the owner of the non-conforming
structure shall neglect or refuse to comply with the order for ten days after
receipt of written notice of the order, the Zoning Administrator may, by
appropriate legal action, proceed to have the abandoned or partially destroyed
non-conforming structure lowered, removed, reconstructed or equipped and assess
the cost and expense thereof against the land on which the structure is or was
located. Unless such an assessment is paid within 90 days from the service of
notice thereof on the owner of the land, the sum shall bear interest at the
rate of 8% per annum from the date the cost and expense is incurred until paid,
and shall be collected in the same manner as are general taxes.

preservation of the Kettle River within the city as required by M.S. §§
103F.301 through 103F.345, as it may be amended from time to time, and
applicable state rules and to provide for the protection and preservation of
portions of adjoining floodplains that are reasonably required to carry and
discharge a regional flood and are subject to inundations by regional floods.
(Ord. 20210818-01, passed 8-18-2021)
§ 163.266 INTENT.
   (A)   It is the intent of this overlay district to be applied to those areas
which, if left unrestricted, could result in loss of life and property, health
and safety hazards, disruptions of commerce, utilities and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for floodplain protection and
relief and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   This overlay district is created and applied in compliance with
requirements of M.S. §§ 103F.301 through 103F.345, as they may be amended from
time to time.
(Ord. 20210818-01, passed 8-18-2021)
§ 163.267 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   (A)   This subchapter does not imply that areas outside the KR Overlay

§ 163.268 DISTRICT APPLICATION.
   The KR Overlay District is applied to and superimposed upon all other zoning
districts as existing or amended by text and map of this subchapter. The
regulations and requirements imposed by this district are in addition to those
established by the zoning districts of this subchapter. Underlying zoning in
these sections is a Public Recreation/Open Space District. (See §§
163.160 through
163.165 of this chapter.) Where provisions of any statue or regulation impose
greater restrictions than those required in this district, such statue or
regulation will control. Where definition of any of the terms of this district
is in dispute, the definitions of Minn. Rules parts 6120.2500 and 6105.0040
will control.
(Ord. 20210818-01, passed 8-18-2021)
§ 163.269 ESTABLISHMENT OF DISTRICT.
   (A)   The boundaries of this district have been established in accordance
with Minn. Rules parts 6105.0600 and 6105.0760. Where interpretation is needed
as to the exact location of the boundaries of this district, the Board of
Adjustment and Appeal will make the necessary interpretations. When boundaries
are in dispute, the burden of proof lies with the applicant.
   (B)   Those boundaries must be amended upon the completion of, in accordance
with data completed, and prepared by the Department of Natural Resources (DNR)
or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), as the case may
be. The floodway and flood fringe boundaries and all applicable regulations
will then be established.
(Ord. 20210818-01, passed 8-18-2021)
§ 163.270 VARIANCES.
   Variances in the KR District may be granted based upon the following
findings.
   (A)   Conditions.
      (1)   The strict enforcement of the land use controls will result in
unnecessary hardship. HARDSHIP, as used, means the property in question cannot
be put to a reasonable use under the conditions allowed by the zoning
regulations. Economic considerations alone do not constitute a hardship if any
reasonable use for the property exists under the terms of this subchapter.
      (2)   Granting of a variance is not contrary to the purpose and intent of
this subchapter and is consistent with the Kettle River Management Plan and the
Municipal Comprehensive Plan.
      (3)   There are exceptional circumstances unique to the property, which
were not created by the landowner.
      (4)   Granting of a variance will not allow any use, which is neither
permitted, or a conditional use in the land use district in which the property
is located.
      (5)   Granting of the variance will not alter the essential character of
the locality as established by the management plan.
   (B)   Exceptions. Where a setback pattern from the ordinary high water mark
has already been established on both sides of the proposed building site the
setback of the proposed structure may be allowed to conform to that pattern.
(Ord. 20210818-01, passed 8-18-2021)
§ 163.271 NOTIFICATION PROCEDURES.
   (A)   (1)   The Zoning Administrator must send copies of all notices of

or screened from adjacent residentially zoned or used land so that existing
homes will not depreciate in value and there will be no deterrence to
development of vacant land;
         (c)   The structure and site will have an appearance that will not
have an adverse effect upon adjacent residential properties;
         (d)   The use, in the opinion of the City Council, is reasonably
related to the overall needs of the city and to the existing land use;
         (e)   The use is consistent with the purposes of the zoning ordinance

locate the proposed use;
         (f)   The use in not in conflict with the comprehensive plan;
         (g)   The use will not cause traffic hazards or congestion; and
         (h)   Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and necessary
facilities have been or will be provided.
      (2)   The City Council may impose, in addition to the standards and
requirements expressly specified by this section, additional conditions which
the City Council considers necessary to protect the best interest of the
surrounding area or the community as a whole. These conditions may include, but
are not limited to the following:
         (a)   Increasing the required lot size or yard dimension;
         (b)   Limiting the height, size or location of buildings;
         (c)   Controlling the location and number of vehicle access points;
         (d)   Increasing the street width;
         (e)   Increasing the number of required off-street parking spaces;

imposed by the City Council, time limits, and such other information as may be
appropriate.
      (4)   The procedure for obtaining a conditional use permit is as follows:
         (a)   The property owner or the owner’s agent meets with the Zoning
Administrator to explain the proposal, learn the procedures, and obtain an
application form;
         (b)   The applicant files the completed application form together with
the required exhibits and fee as required by §
36.02 of this code of ordinances with the Zoning Administrator. Required
exhibits may include, but are not limited to, a preliminary building and site
plan, evidence of ownership or purchase contract or enforceable option on the
property involved and a boundary survey of the property;
         (c)   The Zoning Administrator transmits the application to the
Planning Commission and notifies property owners within 350 feet of the outer
boundaries of the property in question; however, failure of property owner to
receive such notification does not invalidate the proceedings;
         (d)   The Zoning Administrator sets the date for a public hearing and
publishes notice of the hearing at least once in the official newspaper, not
less than ten days and not more than 30 days prior to the hearing;
         (e)   The Planning Commission holds the public hearing and studies the
application to determine possible adverse effects of the proposed conditional

after holding the public hearing, approval, denial or conditional approval;
         (f)   The City Council takes appropriate action on the request for a
conditional use permit after receiving the recommendation by the Planning
Commission. If the City Council grants the conditional use permit, the City
Council may impose conditions it considers necessary to protect the public
health, safety and welfare;
         (g)   A conditional use permit is void without further action by the
Planning Commission or the City Council if work thereon does not commence
within one year of the date granting such conditional use;
         (h)   In the event that the applicant violates any of the conditions
set forth in the permit, the Zoning Administrator notifies the City Council. If
the City Council finds a violation has occurred the applicant must be notified
in writing of the possible violation. Before corrective action is taken, the
City Council must hold a public hearing on the status of the permit. After the
public hearing is held, the City Council may recommend either that no action be
taken or order the applicant to take collective action to bring the permit into
compliance; and
         (i)   An application for the same conditional use permit may not be
considered by the Planning Commission within a one year period following denial
of an application for that permit.
   (F)   Interim use permits.
      (1)   The purpose of this section is to allow the establishment or
continuation of interim uses under specific and regulated conditions. Interim
uses may be allowed by interim use permit if the following conditions are met;
         (a)   The use conforms to the city’s zoning regulations;
         (b)   The date or event that will terminate the use can be identified

36.02 of this code of ordinances.
      (3)   Upon receipt of an application for an interim use permit, the City
Administrator shall review the material submitted and determine whether the
application is complete. If the application is not complete, the City
Administrator shall notify the applicant in writing and shall specify the
additional documentation or information that the applicant will be required to
submit before the application will be considered complete. When the application
is complete, the City Administrator shall refer the matter to the Planning
Commission for review and public hearing.
      (4)   (a)   The Planning Commission shall review the interim use permit
application on the basis of the information and documentation submitted by the
applicant and any other information available to it. The Planning Commission
shall hold a public hearing on the proposed interim use permit. Notice of the
time, place and purpose of the hearing shall be published in the city’s
official newspaper at least ten days prior to the date of the hearing. Notice
must also be mailed at least ten days prior to the hearing to each owner of
property situated wholly or partly within 350 feet of the property to which the
interim use permit relates.
         (b)   The Planning Commission shall review the proposed interim use to
determine whether it is consistent with the requirements of the city planning
and land use regulations. Following the public hearing, the Planning Commission
shall recommend that the interim use be approved with conditions or denied. The
Planning Commission shall forward its recommendation to the City Council along
with a list of suggested conditions if it recommends approval of the permit.
      (5)   (a)   The City Council shall consider the recommendation of the
Planning Commission after receipt of its report and may consider any additional
information or conduct such additional review, if any, as it determines would
serve the public interest. The City Council shall approve with conditions or
deny the interim use permit The City Council shall condition its approval in
any manner it deems reasonably necessary in order to promote public health,
safety or welfare and to achieve compliance with the city code. The City
Council may require the applicant to enter into an agreement including such
provisions as it deems reasonably required to ensure compliance with the city
code and the terms and conditions of the city’s approval.
         (b)   An application to amend an approved site plan shall be reviewed
under this section in the same manner as an initial application for an interim
use permit.
      (6)   An interim use shall terminate upon the date or the occurrence of
the event established in the permit or upon such other condition specified by
the city. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, an interim use may
be terminated by a change in zoning regulations applicable to the use or land
upon which it is located.
   (G)   Variances.
      (1)   A variance from the literal provisions of this code may be granted
by the council: in instances where it is determined that, by reason of
circumstances unique to the individual property not created by the landowner,
the strict enforcement would cause practical difficulties, and where it is
demonstrated that granting the variance is in harmony with the general purpose
and intent of the code and consistent with the comprehensive plan. Practical
difficulties include, but are not limited to, inadequate access to direct
sunlight for solar energy systems.
         (a)   PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES, as used in connection with the granting
of a variance, means:
            1.   The property owner proposes to use the property in a
reasonable manner not permitted by the code;
            2.   Unique circumstances apply to the property which do not apply
generally to other properties in the same zone or vicinity and result from lot
size or shape, topography or other circumstances over which the owner of the
property has had no control. That the unique circumstances do not result from
the actions of the landowner; and
            3.   The variance, if granted, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood.
         (b)   Economic conditions alone do not constitute practical
difficulties.
         (c)   No variance may be granted that would allow any use that is
prohibited in the zoning district in which the subject property is located.
         (d)   The City Council may impose such conditions upon the premises
benefitted by the variance as may be necessary to comply with the standards
established by this code or to reduce or minimize the effect of such variance
upon others the neighborhood, and to better carry out the intent of the
variance. The condition must be directly related to and must bear a rough
proportionality to the impact created by the variance. A variance may not
permit a lower degree of flood protection than the regulatory flood protection
elevation for the particular area nor permit standards lower than those
required by federal, state or local law.
      (2)   The procedure for obtaining a variance is as follows.
         (a)   The property owner or the owner’s agent must meet with the
Zoning Administrator to explain the proposal, be informed of the application
procedures, and obtain an application form.
         (b)   The applicant must file the completed application form together
with the required exhibits with the Zoning Administrator and must pay an
application fee as required by §
36.02 of this code of ordinances. Required exhibits may include, but are not
limited to, a preliminary building and site plan, evidence of ownership or
purchase contract or enforceable option on the property involved and a boundary
survey of the property.
         (c)   The Zoning Administrator transmits the application to the
Planning Commission and notifies property owners within 30 feet of the outer
boundaries of the property in question; however, failure of property owner to
receive such notification does not invalidate the proceedings.
         (d)   The Zoning Administrator sets the date for a public hearing and
publishes notice of the hearing at least once in the official newspaper, not
less than ten days and not more than 30 days prior to the hearing.
         (e)   The Planning Commission will review the application and make its
recommendation on the variance application to the City Council. The City
Council must take one of three actions: approval; denial; or approval with
conditions. The City Council shall make written findings of fact on the
application and shall state therein the reasons for such decision. A copy of
the findings shall be mailed to the applicant.
         (f)   An application by a property owner for a variance may not be
submitted to the city within a six-month period following a denial of such a
request, except the Zoning Administrator may permit a new application if, in
the opinion of the Zoning Administrator, new evidence or change in
circumstances warrant it.
   (H)   Ordinance amendments.
      (1)   An amendment to this section may not be adopted until a public
hearing has been held thereon by the Planning Commission. A notice of the time,
place and purpose of the hearing must be published in the official newspaper at
least ten days prior to the day of the hearing. When an amendment involves
changes in district boundaries, affecting an area of five acres or less, a
similar notice must be mailed at least ten days before the day of the hearing
to each owner of affected property and property situated wholly or partially
within 350 feet of the property to which amendment relates. For the purpose of
giving mailed notice, the person responsible for mailing the notice may use any
appropriate records to determine names and addresses of owners. A copy of the
notice and a list of owners and addresses to which the notice is sent must be
attested to by the responsible person and be made a part of the record of the
proceedings. The failure to give mailed notice to individual property owners or
defects in the notice do not invalidate the proceedings, providing a bona fide
attempt to comply with this section has been made by the responsible person.
      (2)   An amendment to this section may be initiated by the City Council,
the City Planning Commission or by petition of affected property owners.
      (3)   An amendment not initiated by the Planning Commission must be
referred to the Planning Commission for review and recommendations, and may not
be acted on by the City Council until the City Council has received the
recommendations of the Planning Commission on the proposed amendment or until
60 days have elapsed from the date of reference of the amendment without a
report by the Planning Commission.
      (4)   Any amendment or changes in zoning district boundaries of parcels
of land lying wholly or partially in the General Shoreland District or Kettle
River Wild and Scenic River and Floodplain Districts requires notification of
the appropriate DNR office of such meetings or hearings at least ten days prior
to such meetings and hearings.
      (5) Copies of final decisions involving amendments to this section or
changes of district boundaries lying wholly or partially in the General
Shoreland District or Kettle River Wild and Scenic River and Floodplain
Districts must be sent to the appropriate DNR office within ten days of the
final decision. The amendment does not become effective until approval is
received from the DNR.
   (I)   Review and recommendation.
      (1)   The Zoning Administrator must review all applications under this
section.
      (2)   The Planning Commission must review proposed ordinance amendments,
conditional use permits, interim use permits and variance applications.
      (3)   The City Council hears appeals of determinations by the Zoning
Administrator and variance, interim use permit and conditional use permit
applications.
      (4)   Preliminary plats must be reviewed by the Planning Commission to
determine conformity to this section and all other ordinances in force which
affect zoning. Copies of such preliminary plats will be transmitted by the
Zoning Administrator to the City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer, other
officials, and agencies as the Planning Commission deems necessary for its
recommendations concerning matters within its jurisdiction.
      (5)   Recommendations on plats must be transmitted to the Planning
Commission at least three days prior to its regularly scheduled meeting.
      (6)   Applications pertaining to land lying in the General Shoreland
District or Kettle River Wild and Scenic River and Floodplain Districts must be
