   (A)   It is the intention of the City Council that, when adopting this
Minnesota Livable City Code of Ordinances, all future amendments to any state
or federal rules and statutes adopted by reference in this code or referenced
in this code are hereby adopted by reference or referenced as if they had been
in existence at the time this code was adopted, unless there is clear intention
expressed in the code to the contrary.
   (B)   It is the intention of the City Council that, when adopting the
Minnesota Livable City Code of Ordinances, all future supplements are hereby
adopted as if they had been in existence at the time this code was enacted,
unless there is clear intention expressed in the code to the contrary.
§ 10.20 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Any licensed peace officer of the city’s Police Department, or the
County Sheriff, or any Deputy Sheriff shall have the authority to enforce any
provision of this code.
   (B)   As permitted by M.S. § 626.862, as it may be amended from time to
time, the City Clerk/Treasurer shall have the authority to administer and
enforce this code. In addition, under that statutory authority, certain
individuals designated within the code or by the Clerk/Treasurer or City
Council shall have the authority to administer and enforce the provisions
specified. All and any person or persons designated may issue a citation in
lieu of arrest or continued detention to enforce any provision of the code.
   (C)   The City Clerk/Treasurer and any city official or employee designated
by this code who has the responsibility to perform a duty under this code may,
with the permission of a licensee of a business or owner of any property or
resident of a dwelling, or other person in control of any premises, inspect or
otherwise enter any property to enforce compliance with this code.
   (D)   If the licensee, owner, resident, or other person in control of a
premises objects to the inspection of or entrance to the property, the City
Clerk/Treasurer, peace officer, or any employee or official charged with the
duty of enforcing the provisions of this code may, upon a showing that probable
cause exists for the issuance of a valid search warrant from a court of
competent jurisdiction, petition and obtain a search warrant before conducting
the inspection or otherwise entering the property. This warrant shall be only
to determine whether the provisions of this code enacted to protect the health,
safety, and welfare of the people are being complied with and to enforce these
provisions only, and no criminal charges shall be made as a result of the
warrant. No warrant shall be issued unless there be probable cause to issue the
warrant. Probable cause occurs if the search is reasonable. Probable cause does
not depend on specific knowledge of the condition of a particular property.
   (E)   Every licensee, owner, resident, or other person in control of
property within the city shall permit at reasonable times inspections of or
entrance to the property by the City Clerk/Treasurer or any other authorized
city officer or employee only to determine whether the provisions of this code
enacted to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the people are being
complied with and to enforce these provisions. Unreasonable refusal to permit
the inspection of or entrance to the property shall be grounds for termination
of any and all permits, licenses or city service to the property. Mailed notice
shall be given to the licensee, owner, resident, or other person in control of
the property, stating the grounds for the termination, and the licensee, owner,
resident, or other person in control of the property shall be given an
opportunity to appear before the City Clerk/Treasurer to object to the
termination before it occurs, subject to appeal of the Clerk/Treasurer’s
decision to the City Council at a regularly scheduled or special meeting.
   (F)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of
the city to enter private property in urgent emergency situations where there
is an imminent danger in order to protect the public health, safety, and
welfare.
ADMINISTRATIVE OFFENSES
§ 10.35 PURPOSE.
   Administrative offense procedures established pursuant to this subchapter
are intended to provide the public and the city with an informal, cost-
effective, and expeditious alternative to traditional criminal charges for
violations of certain ordinance provisions. The procedures are intended to be
voluntary on the part of those who have been charged with administrative
offenses. At any time prior to the payment of the administrative penalty as is
provided for hereafter, the individual may withdraw from participation in the
procedures, in which event the city may bring criminal charges in accordance
with law. Likewise, the city, in its discretion, may choose not to initiate an
administrative offense and may bring criminal charges in the first instance. In
the event a party participates in the administrative offense procedure but does
not pay the monetary penalty which may be imposed, the city will ask to collect
the costs of the administrative offense procedures as part of a subsequent
criminal sentence in the event the party is charged and is adjudicated guilty
of the criminal violations.
(Ord. passed 12-27-2016)
§ 10.36 ADMINISTRATIVE OFFENSE DEFINED.
   An ADMINISTRATIVE OFFENSE is a violation of a provision of the code and is
subject to the administrative penalties set forth in the schedule of offenses
and penalties referred to in §
10.43.
(Ord. passed 12-27-2016)
§ 10.37 NOTICE.
   Any officer of the City Police Department or any other person employed by
the city, authorized in writing by the city and having authority to enforce
this code, shall, upon determining that there has been a violation, notify the
violator, or in the case of a vehicular violation, attach to the vehicle a
notice of the violation. Said notice shall set forth the nature, date, and time
of violations, the name of the official issuing the notice, and the amount of
the scheduled penalty.
(Ord. passed 12-27-2016)
§ 10.38 PAYMENT.
   Once such notice is given, the alleged violator may, within seven days of
the time of the issuance of the notice, pay the amount set forth on the
schedule of penalties for the violations, or may request a hearing in writing,
as is provided for hereafter. The penalty may be paid in person or by mail, and
payment shall be deemed to be an admission of the violation.
(Ord. passed 12-27-2016)
§ 10.39 HEARING.
   Any person contesting an administrative offense pursuant to this subchapter
may, within seven days of the time of issuance of the notice, request a hearing
by a Hearing Board who shall forthwith conduct an informal hearing to determine
if a violation has occurred. The Hearing Board shall have authority to dismiss
the violation or reduce or waive the penalty. If the violation is sustained by
the Hearing Board, the violator shall pay the penalty imposed.
(Ord. passed 12-27-2016)
§ 10.40 HEARING BOARD.
   Two City Council members designated in writing by the city and one member of
the city staff, appointed at the time the hearing is requested, by the
appointed City Council members shall be the Hearing Board. The Hearing Board is
authorized to hear and determine any controversy relating to administrative
offenses provided for in this subchapter.
(Ord. passed 12-27-2016)
§ 10.41 FAILURE TO PAY.
   In the event a party charged with an administrative offense fails to pay the
penalty, a misdemeanor or petty misdemeanor charge may be brought against the
alleged violator in accordance with applicable statutes. If the penalty is paid
or if an individual is found not to have committed this administrative offense
by the Hearing Board, no such charge may be brought by the city for the same
violation.
(Ord. passed 12-27-2016)
§ 10.42 DISPOSITION OF PENALTIES.
   All penalties collected pursuant to this subchapter shall be paid to the
Clerk/Treasurer and may be deposited in the city’s General Fund.
(Ord. passed 12-27-2016)
§ 10.43 OFFENSES AND PENALTIES.
   Offenses which may be charged as administrative offenses and the penalties
for such offenses may be established by resolution of the City Council from
time to time. Copies of such resolutions shall be maintained in the office of
the Clerk/Treasurer.
(Ord. passed 12-27-2016)
§ 10.44 SUBSEQUENT OFFENSES.
   In the event a party is charged with a subsequent administrative offense
within a 12-month period of paying an administrative penalty for the same or
substantially similar offense, the subsequent administrative penalty shall be
increased by 25% above the previous administrative penalty.
(Ord. passed 12-27-2016)
§ 10.45 SUPPLEMENTAL ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES.
   (A)   In addition to those administrative penalties established in this code
and the enforcement powers granted in §
10.20, the City Council is authorized to create by resolution, adopted by a
majority of the members of the City Council, supplemental administrative
penalties. The resolution may be in the form established in Appendix VI of the
User’s Guide to the MBC. Such resolution may not proscribe administrative
penalties for traffic offenses designated by M.S. § 169.999.
   (B)   These administrative penalty procedures in this section are intended
to provide the public and the city with an informal, cost effective, and
expeditious alternative to traditional criminal charges for violations of
certain provisions of this code. The procedures are intended to be voluntary on
the part of those who have been charged with those offenses.
   (C)   Administrative penalties for violations of various provisions of the
code, other than those penalties established in the code or in statutes that
are adopted by reference, may be established from time to time by resolution of
a majority of the members of the City Council. In order to be effective, an
administrative penalty for a particular violation must be established before
the violation occurred.
   (D)   In the discretion of the peace officer, City Clerk, or other person
giving notice of an alleged violation of a provision of this code, a written
notice must be provided of an alleged violation, sent by first class mail to
the person who is alleged to have violated the code. The person giving notice
may request the payment of a voluntary administrative penalty for the violation
directly to the City Treasurer within 14 days of the notice of the violation. A
sample notice is contained in the appendix to this chapter. In the sole
discretion of the person giving the notice of the alleged violation, the time
for payment may be extended an additional 14 days, whether or not requested by
the person to whom the notice has been given. In addition to the administrative
penalty, the person giving notice may request in the notice to the alleged
violator to adopt a compliance plan to correct the situation resulting in the
alleged violation and may provide that if the alleged violator corrects the
situation resulting in the alleged violation within the time specified in the
notice, the payment of the administrative penalty will be waived.
   (E)   At any time before the payment of the administrative penalty is due,
the person who has been given notice of an alleged violation may request to
appear before the City Council to contest the request for payment of the
penalty. After a hearing before the City Council, the City Council may
determine to withdraw the request for payment or to renew the request for
payment. Because the payment of the administrative penalty is voluntary, there
shall be no appeal from the decision of the City Council.
   (F)   At any time after the date the payment of the administrative penalty
is due, if the administrative penalty remains unpaid or the situation creating
the alleged violation remains uncorrected, the city, through its attorney, may
bring criminal charges in accordance with state law and this code. Likewise,
the city, in its discretion, may bring criminal charges in the first instance,
rather than requesting the payment of an administrative penalty, even if a
penalty for the particular violation has been established by City Council
resolution. If the administrative penalty is paid, or if any requested
correction of the situation resulting in the violation is completed, no
criminal charges shall be initiated by the city for the alleged violation.
§ 10.99 GENERAL PENALTY AND ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Any person, firm, or corporation who violates any provision of this
code for which another penalty is not specifically provided, shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a petty misdemeanor. The penalty which may be imposed
for any violation which is a petty misdemeanor under this code, including
Minnesota Statutes specifically adopted by reference.
   (B)   Any person, firm, or corporation who violates any provision of this
code, including state statutes specifically adopted by reference, which is
designated to be a petty misdemeanor shall, upon conviction be guilty of a
petty misdemeanor. The penalty which may be imposed for any petty offense which
is a petty misdemeanor shall be a sentence of a fine of not more than $300.
   (C)   Pursuant to M.S. § 631.48, as it may be amended from time to time, in
either the case of a misdemeanor or a petty misdemeanor, the costs of
prosecution may be added. A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon
each day during which a violation occurs or continues.
   (D)   The failure of any officer or employee of the city to perform any
official duty imposed by this code shall not subject the officer or employee to
the penalty imposed for a violation.
   (E)   In addition to any penalties provided for in this section or in §§
10.35 through
10.44, if any person, firm, or corporation fails to comply with any provision
of this code, the City Council or any city official designated by it, may
institute appropriate proceedings with a hearing before City Council, at law or
at equity to restrain, correct, or abate the violation.
   (F)   Issuance of citation for violation is as follows.
      (1)   Upon probable cause to believe that a violation has been committed
and that the violator has committed the violation or is legally responsible for
the commission of the violation or for allowing the condition constituting the
violation to exist, an issuer is authorized to issue a citation, complying with
the standards set forth below, to the violator.
      (2)   In the case of a violation which constitutes a property violation,
the citation may, in addition, include a directive to eliminate the condition
giving rise to the property violation.
      (3)   If reasonably practical, the issuer shall deliver the citation to
the violator in person. If the violator is not present at the time that the
citation is issued, cannot be reasonably contacted for the purpose of delivery
of the citation or refused to accept delivery of the citation, the issuer may
deliver the citation to the violator by depositing it in the U.S. mail
addressed to the violator at an address of public record for the violator,
which may include but need not be limited to an address taken from area
telephone directories, from records of the city assessor, from records of city-
owned utilities or from other public sources. Delivery by such alternative
means shall be deemed to be valid delivery and shall be deemed to be effective
three days after the deposit of the citation in the U.S. mail.

penalty is voluntary, there shall be no appeal from the decision of the City
Council.

statutory provision to the contrary, empowered through its City Council, acting
within or without the corporate limits of the city, to enter into contracts and
incur obligations necessary to combat the disaster by protecting the health and
safety of persons and property and providing emergency assistance to the
victims of a disaster. The city may exercise these powers in the light of the

the quantities of the subject wastes in relation to flows and velocities in the
sewers, materials, or construction of the sewers, nature of the wastewater
treatment proves, capacity of the wastewater treatment plant, the city’s NPDES
permit, and other pertinent factors. The city may make such determinations

treatment required to meet the requirements of the state or federal government,
or any other public agency with proper authority to regulate the discharge from
the wastewater treatment plant;
      (6)   Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or
concentration that they are not in compliance with regulations issued by the
appropriate authority having control over their use or may cause damage or
hazards to the treatment works or personnel operating it;
      (7)   Any water or wastes having a pH in excess of nine and one-half; and

§ 53.01 SEPARATE SERVICE CONNECTION.
   No more than one house or other building shall be supplied from one service
connection. The City Council, or the Public Works Coordinator when authorized
to do so by the City Council, may waive this requirement upon finding that a
separate service connection is impractical. Whenever two or more houses or
other buildings are supplied from one pipe connecting with a service main, each
house, other building, or part thereof separately supplied shall have a
separate stopbox and a separate meter.
(Prior Code, § 53.01)
§ 53.02 REPAIR OF LEAKS.
   The owner, and also the customer, the occupant, and the lessee, shall be
responsible for repair of any leaks in the water service line serving the
property. If any leak is not repaired within the time allowed in the notice
after notice to any of them to repair the leak, including notice left at the
premises, the Public Works Coordinator may turn off the water. When the waste
of water is great or damage is likely to occur from the leak, the Coordinator
may turn off the water and thereafter give notice to repair. The Coordinator
may cause any necessary repairs to be made.
(Prior Code, § 53.02)
§ 53.03 COST OF INSTALLATION OR REPAIR BY THE CITY.
   Whenever the city installs any water service lines for the benefit of any
property, or makes any necessary repairs to any water service line, and the
cost of doing so is not paid by the owner, by the customer, by the occupant, or
by the lessee within 30 days after billing for payment, any costs may be
collected as provided in §
50.042.
(Prior Code, § 53.03)
§ 53.04 CONNECTIONS WITH PRIVATE WATER SUPPLY.
   No person shall connect any water pipe of the city water supply system with
any pump, well, or tank that is connected to any other source of water supply.
Nor shall any person allow any such connection to continue on property which
the person owns, leases, or occupies. If any such connection exists, it shall
be severed forthwith. When any such connection is found, the Public Works
Coordinator may notify the customer, the owner, the lessee, or the occupant to
sever the connection. If this is not done immediately, the Coordinator may turn
off the water supply. All cross-connections shall be eliminated before water
service is restored to the premises.
(Prior Code, § 53.04) Penalty, see §
50.999
§ 53.05 RESTRICTED USE.
   Whenever the City Council determines that a shortage of water threatens the
city water supply, it may, by resolution, limit the times and hours during
which city water may be used for sprinkling, air conditioning, irrigation, car
washing, and other specified uses. After the first day of publication of the
resolution, or after delivery of the resolution to the affected premises, or
three days after mailing the resolution to each affected customer, no person
shall use or permit water to be used in violation of the restrictions imposed
in the resolution. Any person who does so may be charged an excess use charge,
as the City Council may specify in the resolution. Violation of the
restrictions imposed in the resolution shall also be cause for discontinuance
of water service in accordance with the procedures for discontinuance of
service for a leak.
(Prior Code, § 53.05) Penalty, see §
50.999
§ 53.06 INTERRUPTION OF SERVICE.
   The city may interrupt water service to any customer without notice, or with
such notice as the Public Works Coordinator determines to be appropriate, for
necessary repairs or when any fire or other emergency reasonably requires that
service to any customer be interrupted.
(Prior Code, § 53.06)
§ 53.07 WATER METERS.
   (A)   Meter required. Except for the extinguishment of fires and for such
other uses as may be provided in this code or authorized by the City Council,
no person other than an authorized city employee shall use water from the city
water supply system or permit water to be drawn from it unless the water passes
through a meter supplied or approved by the city.
   (B)   Ownership and installation. Water meters for normal use shall be
furnished by and shall remain property of the city. If a customer requires a
meter of unusual design or capacity, the customer shall purchase and maintain
the meter at the customer’s own expense. Meters shall be installed,
disconnected, taken apart, or in any other manner changed only by authorized
city employees, or by a plumber if expressly so authorized by the Public Works
Coordinator or by regulations established by the City Council.
   (C)   Maintenance. The city shall maintain and repair at its expense any
meter furnished by it that has become unserviceable or inaccurate through
ordinary use and shall replace the meter if necessary. Water meters may be
removed or replaced by the city at any time. If city repair or replacement of a
meter, whether owned by the city or by the customer, is made necessary by any
act or neglect of the owner, of the lessee, or of the occupant of the premises
served, or of any other person, the city may add any expense occasioned thereby
to the customer’s water bill. The Public Works Coordinator may also discontinue
water service until the cause is corrected.
   (D)   Re-reading of meter. When a customer complains that any bill is
excessive and requests that the meter be re-read, the Public Works Coordinator
shall have the meter re-read.
   (E)   Testing. The city may test a meter for accuracy at any time. When a
customer feels that any bill is excessive, the customer may demand in writing
that the meter be tested. If the test shows the meter to be inaccurate, it
shall be repaired or replaced.
   (F)   Adjustment of bill. If a test shows a meter to be inaccurate by more
than 5%, the bill for the immediate past service period and for the elapsed
portion of the current service period shall be adjusted accordingly. If, by
reason of stoppage of the meter or any other reason, it is not possible to
determine with reasonable accuracy the amount of water actually used, the
Public Works Coordinator may estimate by any reasonable method the amount of
water which was used. In no event shall any adjustment be made for any service
period prior to the immediate past service period.
(Prior Code, § 53.07) Penalty, see §
50.999
§ 53.08 SERVICE REQUIREMENTS.
   The Public Works Coordinator shall establish such service requirements
regarding the size, nature, and laying of water service pipes and making
connection with the public water system as may be reasonable or necessary for
the safe, efficient, and healthful provision of water service.

ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT
§ 54.50 ESTABLISHMENT OF A SERVICE CHARGE SYSTEM.
   The city hereby establishes a natural gas service charge system whereby:
   (A)   All revenue collected from consumers of the natural gas utility will
be used to defray all expenditures incurred for purchase and transportation of
natural gas, annual system operation, maintenance, and replacement and for debt
service on capital expenditure incurred in constructing natural gas facilities;
   (B)   Each consumer and/or property owner, where a meter has been installed,
shall pay his or her proportionate share of operation, maintenance, and
replacement costs of the natural gas utility based and total annual costs of
operating and maintaining the utility;
   (C)   Each consumer shall pay debt service charges to retire capital costs
for initial construction of the utility;
   (D)   Service rates and charges to consumers of the natural gas utility
shall be determined using a budget-based formula found in the appendix to the
ordinance establishing natural gas service rates. Subsequent changes in natural
gas service rates shall be adopted in an annual ordinance establishing rates
and fees and published in the local newspaper; and
   (E)   Natural gas service charges will be administered in accordance with
the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. passed 12-13-2016)
§ 54.51 NATURAL GAS SERVICE FUND.
   (A)   The city hereby establishes a Natural Gas Service Fund.
   (B)   This will be an income fund to receive all revenues generated by the
natural gas service charge system and all other income dedicated to the
operation, maintenance, replacement, and construction of the natural gas
utility including taxes, special charges, fees, and assessments intended to
retire construction debt.
   (C)   The city also establishes the following income and expenditure
accounts relative to the Natural Gas Service Fund:
      (1)   Operation and Maintenance Account;
      (2)   Equipment Replacement Account; and
      (3)   Debt Service Fund.
   (D)   All revenues generated by the natural gas service charge system, and
all other income pertinent to the system including taxes and special
assessments dedicated to retire construction debt, shall be held by the Clerk/
Treasurer separate and apart from other funds of the city.
   (E)   Revenues generated by the natural gas service charge system sufficient
to ensure adequate replacement of system components, shall be held separate and
apart in a Capital Equipment Replacement Account.
   (F)   Revenue generated by the natural gas service charge system sufficient
for operation and maintenance shall be held separate and apart in the Operation
and Maintenance Account.
(Ord. passed 12-13-2016)
§ 54.52 ADMINISTRATION.
   The natural gas service charge system shall be administered according to the
following provisions.
   (A)   (1)   The Clerk/Treasurer shall maintain a proper system of accounts
suitable for determining the operation and maintenance, equipment replacement,
and debt retirement costs of the natural gas facility and shall furnish the
City Council with a report of such costs annually in the city’s financial
report.
      (2)   The City Council shall annually determine whether or not sufficient
revenue is generated for the effective operation, maintenance, replacement, and
management of the natural gas facility and whether sufficient revenue is being
generated for debt retirement.
      (3)   The city shall reassess and, as necessary, revise the natural gas
service charge system to ensure the proportionality of the consumer charge and
to ensure the sufficiency of the funds to maintain the capacity and performance
to which the facility was constructed, and to retire the construction debt.
   (B)   The Clerk/Treasurer shall be responsible for maintaining all records
necessary to document compliance with the natural gas service charge system.
   (C)   Bills for natural gas service shall be issued on a monthly basis
succeeding the period for which service was rendered. The Clerk/Treasurer shall
compute the amount due to the city from each consumer of the natural gas
service and shall mail the consumer a statement of charges as soon as
practicable after the end of each period of service. The Clerk/Treasurer shall
establish such monthly or other service periods for a consumer as the Clerk/
Treasurer deems best. The Clerk/Treasurer shall establish and shall specify in
the statement a due date to be uniform as to time allowed for payments for all
consumers and to be not less than 15 days after mailing of the statement, upon
which all charges then due for municipal natural gas service are to be paid.
Amounts owed for municipal gas service shall be due and payable to the Clerk/
Treasurer on the due date specified in the statement and shall be paid on or
before that date. Any bill not paid in full five days after the due date will
be considered delinquent. The penalty shall be computed as 10% of the original
bill and shall be increased the same 10% for every month the bill is
outstanding.
   (D)   The owner of the premises shall be liable to pay for the service to
such premises, and the service is furnished to the premises by the city only
upon the condition that the owner of the premises is liable to the city, with
the exception of those services established by renters who have prepaid for
natural gas service until satisfactory credit history has been established.
   (E)   Volumes of gas used shall be determined on the basis of the meter
reading, and billings shall reflect the units of gas utilized. Any error in
reading the meter shall not affect the liability for gas used as determined by
a correct subsequent reading of the meter. When a meter is not able to be read,
the city may estimate the volume of gas used and issue a billing based on such
estimate. A meter registering between 3% fast and 3% slow shall be deemed for
all purposes to be registering correctly. A meter registering incorrectly shall
be replaced by the city at its expense. Periodically, the city may test meters
using standard industry practices to determine accuracy. If a consumer requests
a meter test and the meter is found to be correct as defined above, the
consumer shall pay the applicable meter testing fees.
(Ord. passed 12-13-2016)
§ 54.53 DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICE.
   (A)   The city may discontinue gas service to a consumer as follows.
      (1)   In any case where charges for natural gas service have not been
paid within 30 days after the date due, and where satisfactory arrangements
have not been made, natural gas services to the premises may be discontinued in
accordance with the provisions of this division (A)(1) and of division (A)(2)
below. When service has been discontinued, service shall not be restored until
all delinquent charges, including reconnection charges, are paid, or
arrangements satisfactory to the Clerk/Treasurer are made for their payment.
      (2)   The procedure set forth in this section shall apply to
discontinuance of service for non-payment of amounts owed. This shall also be
subject to such additional requirements, if any, as are provided by law or by
regulation.
      (3)   The Clerk/Treasurer shall cause written notice of intention to
discontinue service for non-payments of amounts owed to be served upon the
consumer. Mailed notice shall also be given to the owner, if the owner is not
the consumer served. The notice shall state that if payment is not received on
or before a date stated in the notice, the natural gas service will be
discontinued. The date shall be not less than three days after the date upon
which the notice is given. The notice shall also state that the person may,
before that date, file with the Clerk/Treasurer a demand for hearing on the
matter, in which case, service shall not be discontinued, pending decision on
the issue at the hearing. If a timely demand is made for a hearing, a hearing
at which the applicant for hearing shall be heard shall be held by the City
Council not sooner than three days after the date upon which the request is
received by the Clerk/Treasurer. If, as a result of the hearing, the City
Council finds that there is an unpaid charge and that there is no legal reason
why service shall not be discontinued, the City Council may order that service
be immediately discontinued.
      (4)   Pursuant to M.S. § 216B.097, as it may be amended from time to
time, no service of a residential consumer shall be discontinued if the
disconnection affects the primary heat source for the residential unit when the
disconnection would occur during the period between October 15 and April 15,
the consumer has declared inability to pay on forms provided by the city, the
household income of the consumer is less than 185% of the federal poverty level
as documented by the consumer to the city, and the consumer’s account is
current to billing period immediately prior to October 15 or the consumer has
entered into a payment schedule and is reasonably current with payments under
the schedule. The Clerk/Treasurer shall, between August 15 and October 15 of
each year, notify all residential consumers of these provisions.
   (B)   The procedure for discontinuance of gas service by a consumer is as
follows.
      (1)   Volume charges, as set forth in the appendix to the ordinance from
which this chapter is derived, may be discontinued by a consumer upon sale or
conveyance of property to a new owner (contract for deed arrangements will not
be recognized as a property transfer unless recorded with the County Recorder).
The new property owner will remain responsible for the base rate.
      (2)   Gas service may be discontinued upon removal of a structure from a
property.
      (3)   Discontinuance of gas service by a consumer in any other case shall
not terminate a property owner’s responsibility for base rate charges as
established in the appendix to the ordinance from which this chapter is
derived.
      (4)   Discontinuance of gas service for any other reason shall be made in
accordance with requirements set forth in other parts of this code pertaining
to discontinuance of service for those reasons.
(Ord. passed 12-13-2016)
§ 54.54 DELINQUENT CHARGES; LIEN, SUIT, INTEREST.
   The City Council has declared the following.
   (A)   Each and every natural gas service charge levied by and pursuant to §
54.52(D) is hereby made a lien upon the land or premises served, and all such
charges which are on December 31 of each year past due and delinquent shall be
certified to the County Auditor as taxes or assessments on the real estate.
Nothing in this subchapter shall be held or construed as in any way stopping or
interfering with the right of the city to levy as taxes or assessments against
any premises affected by any delinquent or past due natural gas service
charges.
   (B)   As an alternative to levying a lien, the city may, at its discretion,
file suit in a civil action to collect such amounts as are delinquent and due
against the occupant, owner, or user of the real estate, and shall collect as
well all attorney’s fees incurred by the city in filing the civil action. Such
attorney’s fees shall be fixed by order of the court.
   (C)   In addition to all penalties and costs attributable and chargeable to
recording notices of the lien or filing a civil action, the owner or user of
the real estate being serviced by the gas utility shall be liable for interest
upon all unpaid balances at the rate of 18% per annum.

property is a “tow away” area.
   (B)   No vehicle may be towed from public property unless a peace officer or
a duly delegated parking enforcement officer has prepared, in addition to the
appropriate citation, a written towing report describing the motor vehicle and
the reason for towing. The report required by this division (B) must be signed
by the officer and the tow driver.

this section, should be deemed a waiver by them of all right, title, and
interest in the vehicle and contents and a consent to the transfer of title to
and disposal or sale of the vehicle and contents pursuant to this section.

USE OF TRAILS
§ 73.15 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   BICYCLE. Any land-based vehicle powered by human muscle.
   CLASS 1 E-BIKE. The CLASS 1 E-BIKE is a pedal assisted bike. The bike’s
motor will support till 20 mph. Then, the motor will automatically cut its
power. A pedal-assisted e-bike means the bike has to be pedaled to activate the
motor. The throttle won’t work separately.
   CLASS 2 E-BIKE. A CLASS 2 E-BIKE is a throttle assisted bike. But, the
throttle will support only 20 mph top speed. A CLASS 2 E BIKE has a separate
throttle control. So, the bike does not have to be pedaled to activate the
motor. Just twist the throttle and the e-bike will run fully on the motor.
   CLASS 3 E-BIKE. CLASS 3 E-BIKES can be called really speedy. These bikes can
reach 28 mph speed. But, it’s a pedal assisted bike. Therefore, to activate the
throttle, the bike has to be pedaled.
   HORSEBACK RIDING. Includes all modes of human travel produced in part by
non-human muscle.
   MOTOR VEHICLE. Any self-propelled vehicle or gas powered and any vehicle
propelled or drawn by a self-propelled vehicle including, but not limited to,
automobiles, trucks, dune buggies, mini bikes, motorcycles, golf carts, mopeds,
motor scooters, motorized bicycles, and ATVs.
   PERSON. Any individual, partnership, corporation, or association.
   SNOWMOBILE. Any self-propelled vehicle designed for travel on snow or ice
and steered by skis or runners.
   TRAILS. All of the land contained within the area, designated by the city as
part of its recreational trail system.
(Ord. passed 10-8-2024)

REFUSE, JUNK, AND NUISANCE REGULATION
§ 92.01 FINDINGS.
   The City Council finds that unregulated deposit and storage of junk and
unregulated storage and non-mandatory collection of refuse are not only
potential, but immediate habitat for rodents, the spread of noxious weeds and
other hazardous conditions of decay which are unsanitary, unhealthy, and an
ecological blight. The City Council further finds that such hazardous
conditions must not only be halted in the future, but also corrected for the
present. The City Council recognizes that the regulations, prohibitions, and
remedies provided for herein are bold steps, but absolutely essential to the
health of the residents and ecology of the community.

decayed and deemed of being an imminent danger to public health, safety, and
well-being, the owner will be responsible for appropriate trimming or removal
of his, her, or their tree.
                  iv.   If a private hazard tree is not removed or treated as
ordered or if the owner does not voluntarily pay to the city the cost of
removal or treatment by the city, all costs incurred by the city for trimming,
tree removal, treatment, or eradicating or controlling the hazardous condition

§ 92.31 TALL GRASS AND WEEDS
   (A)   General provisions.
      (1)   It is declared to be the purpose and intent of this section to
protect and preserve the city’s neighborhoods and the public health, safety,
and welfare of those who live there. The Common Council determines that keeping
the city free of tall grass and noxious weeds improves the quality of life of
city residents by improving the aesthetics of the city, by eliminating harbor
for rodents and insects, and by eliminating fire hazards. At the same time, the
City Council recognizes that requiring the mowing of grasses and noxious weeds
is under certain circumstances impractical and unreasonable. The exemptions
contained within this section are intended to cover these circumstances.
      (2)   The City Council also determines that a variety of properly
maintained landscapes in the city add diversity and a richness to the quality
of life, and does not want to discourage the preservation, restoration, and
maintenance of diverse biologically stable natural plant communities or
environmentally sound practices. The City Council finds that the establishment
of native or naturalistic plant communities is an acceptable landscape
treatment in the city. However, as a protection for the larger community, this
change in vegetation must be properly planned, managed, and maintained, and the
length of transition period must be minimized or the property is likely to
create a public nuisance.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      BOULEVARD. The portion of the street outside the roadway that may contain

not considered a WEED.
      WETLANDS. Lands transitional between terrestrial and aquatic systems
where the water table is near the surface. The boundary of WETLANDS, for
purposes of this section, shall be determined according to the most recently
published U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Wetland Delineation Manual.
   (C)   Nuisance declared. It shall be unlawful and a public nuisance for any
person having control of any property in the city to permit or maintain on such
property any noxious weeds, or growth of grass and weeds in excess of eight
inches in height, if the growth of grass and weeds occupies an area of at least
100 square feet and is located within 100 feet of the property line of a
platted parcel or within any platted property. No owner shall permit such weeds

health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the city that nudity is

public in general, from harm stemming from the physical immediacy and
combination of alcohol, nudity, and sex. The City Council especially intends to
prevent any subliminal endorsement of sexual harassment or activities likely to
lead to the possibility of various criminal conduct, including prostitution,
sexual assault, and disorderly conduct. The City Council also finds that the
prohibition of nudity on the premises of any establishment licensed under this
chapter, as set forth in this section, reflects the prevailing community
standards of the city.

persons on the licensed premises when the person does not have his or her
buttocks, anus, breasts, and genitals covered with a non-transparent material.

licensee. In granting the license, the City Council may authorize sale on
premises other than premises the licensee owns or permanently occupies. The
City Council may provide that the licensee may contract for intoxicating liquor
catering services with an on-sale intoxicating liquor licensee. A temporary on-
sale license shall be subject to any additional terms imposed by the City
Council. A temporary on-sale license shall not be valid until first approved by
the Commissioner of Public Safety.
      (5)   Special Sunday on-sale license.
         (a)   Special on-sale licenses for the sale of intoxicating liquor on

subd. 3, as it may be amended from time to time.
         (b)   The sale hours of on-sale intoxicating liquor on Sundays shall

         (a)   A brewer licensed under M.S. § 340A.301, subd. 6, clause (c),
(i), or (j), as amended from time to time, may be issued a license by a
municipality for off-sale of malt liquor at its licensed premises that has been
produced and packaged by the brewer. The license must be approved by the
Commissioner. A brewer may only have one license under this division (C)(6).
The amount of malt liquor sold at off-sale may not exceed 750 barrels annually.
Off-sale of malt liquor shall be limited to the legal hours for off-sale at
exclusive liquor stores in the jurisdiction in which the brewer is located, and
the malt liquor sold off-sale must be removed from the premises before the
applicable off-sale closing time at exclusive liquor stores, except that malt
liquor in growlers only may be sold at off-sale on Sundays. Sunday sales must
be approved by the licensing jurisdiction and hours may be established by those
jurisdictions.
         (b)   Packaging of malt liquor for off-sale under this division (C)(6)
must comply with M.S. § 340A.285, as amended from time to time, and can only be
packaged in 64-ounce containers commonly known as GROWLERS or 750 milliliter
bottles for off-sale. No other off-sale containers will be allowed.
         (c)   A municipality may not issue a license under this section to a

its own brands of malt liquor annually or a winery that produces more than
250,000 gallons of wine annually.
         (d)   A brew pub or brewer may, but is not required to, refill any

must be sealed and labeled in the manner described in division (C)(6)(a) above.
      (7)   Brewer taproom license.
         (a)   A municipality, including a city with a municipal liquor store,
may issue the holder of a brewer’s license under M.S. § 340A.301, subd. 6,
clause (c), (i), or (j), as amended from time to time, a brewer taproom
license. A brewer taproom license authorizes on-sale of malt liquor produced by
the brewer for consumption on the premises of or adjacent to one brewery
location owned by the brewer. Nothing in this division (C)(7) precludes the
holder of a brewer taproom license from also holding a license to operate a
restaurant at the brewery. M.S. § 340A.409, as it may be amended from time to
time, shall apply to a license issued under this division (C)(7). All
provisions of this chapter that apply to a retail liquor license shall apply to
a license issued under this division (C)(7) unless the provision is explicitly

interest in the brewer seeking the license or exercising control over the
brewer seeking the license, is a brewer that brews more than 250,000 barrels of
malt liquor annually or a winery that produces more than 250,000 gallons of
wine annually.

time. Within any limits established by law, the City Council may, by

to:
   (A)   A person who is not a citizen of the United States or who is not a
resident alien;
   (B)   A person under 21 years of age;

   (D)   A person who has had an intoxicating liquor or 3.2% malt liquor
license revoked within five years of the license application, or to any person
who, at the time of the violation, owns any interest, whether as a holder of
more than 5% of the capital stock of a corporation licensee, as a partner or
otherwise, in the premises or in the business conducted thereon, or to a
corporation, partnership, association, enterprise, business, or firm in which
any such person is in any manner interested; or

(Ord. passed 6-13-2023; Ord. passed 11-14-2023)
§ 110.24 PREMISES OF APPLICANT.
   The licensed premises shall meet all requirements of law and of this
subchapter, including any special requirements for the specific license sought.
In addition to any requirements which appear elsewhere in this subchapter, the
following requirements shall apply.
   (A)   No license shall be granted for any premises restricted against
commercial use through zoning ordinances and other proceedings or legal
processes regularly had for that purpose, except a license may be issued to a
restaurant in an area which was restricted against commercial uses after the
establishment of the restaurant. This restriction shall not apply to a
temporary on-sale 3.2% malt liquor license or to a temporary on-sale
intoxicating liquor license, except to the extent required by law.
   (B)   No license shall be granted for any premises within 1,500 feet of any
public school that is not within the city. This restriction shall not apply to
a temporary on-sale 3.2% malt liquor license or to a temporary on-sale
intoxicating liquor license, except to the extent required by law.
   (C)   No license shall be granted to any person in connection with the
premises of another to whom a license could not by law be issued. This shall
not prevent the granting of a license to a proper lessee because the person has
leased the premises of a minor, a noncitizen who is not a resident alien, or a
person who has been convicted of a crime other than a violation of M.S. Chapter
340A, as it may be amended from time to time.
   (D)   No license shall be granted for any premises within 50 feet of any
public school or church, as measured by the shortest distance between the
nearest point of the licensed premises to the school or church building. This
limitation shall not apply to a temporary on-sale 3.2% malt liquor license or a
temporary on-sale intoxicating liquor license. The City Council may, at its
discretion, waive this requirement and continue to issue any license when the
school or church is established at the location in question after a license has
first been issued, upon finding that the public health, safety, and welfare
will not be harmed by issuance of the license.
   (E)   No license shall be granted for any premises upon which any real
estate taxes or installments of special assessments are delinquent, or upon
which any financial claims of the city are delinquent.

additional information required by the City Council. Every applicant for the
issuance, transfer, or renewal of a license shall include a copy of each
summons received by the applicant under M.S. § 340A.802, as it may be amended

§ 110.26 INVESTIGATION.
   (A)   Upon an initial application for any license, or upon any application
to transfer to a new licensee any existing license, the City Council shall
make, or cause to be made, such background and financial investigation of the
applicant as the City Council deems appropriate. The City Council may also
conduct such investigation regarding the licensee as it deems appropriate upon
an application for renewal of an existing license, or at any other time. The
City Council may, by ordinance, establish an investigation fee required to be
paid by each applicant for a new license or for transfer of a license, and may
require that the fee be paid by the applicant at the time of making application
for a license.
   (B)   If the City Council determines, or if the Bureau of Criminal
Apprehension on its own initiative determines, that a comprehensive background
and financial investigation is necessary upon an initial application for any
on-sale intoxicating liquor license, or upon any application to transfer to a
new licensee any existing on-sale intoxicating liquor license, the City Council
may contract with the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension for the investigation, or
it may otherwise conduct the investigation itself. In addition, a comprehensive
investigation may be required by the City Council prior to the renewal of an
existing on-sale intoxicating liquor license if the City Council deems it in
the public interest. When a comprehensive investigation is conducted, the
applicant shall pay to the city a comprehensive investigation fee not to exceed
the amount provided by law if the investigation is conducted within the state,
or the actual cost not to exceed the amount provided by law if the
investigation is required outside the state. The City Council shall, by
ordinance, fix the in-state comprehensive investigation fee, within the maximum
amount provided by law, and the City Council may, by ordinance, fix a maximum
out-of-state comprehensive investigation fee, below the maximum amount provided
by law.

§ 110.27 ISSUANCE.
   After investigation and opportunity for an applicant to be heard, the City
Council shall grant or deny the application in its discretion. If the
application is approved, the Clerk/Treasurer shall issue the license to the
applicant upon the applicant complying with all requirements of law and of this
subchapter relating to issuance of the license. If any license, bond, or
insurance is required by law to be approved by the Commissioner of Public
Safety, the license shall not become effective until approval of the
Commissioner is granted.

   (B)   Pro rata fees. If a license is issued for less than a full calendar
year, the fee shall be one-twelfth of the annual fee for each month or fraction
of a month for which the license is issued. The City Council may, by ordinance,
fix a minimum pro rata fee.
   (C)   Payment. An applicant shall pay the license fee in full at the time
application is made for a license. If an application is rejected, the Clerk/
Treasurer shall refund the amount paid, unless the City Council, in rejecting
the license, orders that the fee or a portion of it be retained from an
applicant making a false statement in or concerning an application or from an
applicant ineligible to receive a license.
(Ord. passed 6-13-2023; Ord. passed 11-14-2023)
§ 110.30 REFUNDS.
   (A)   No part of the fee for a license which has been issued may be

or to the licensee’s estate if:
      (1)   The business ceases to operate because of destruction or damage;
      (2)   The licensee dies;
      (3)   The business ceases to be lawful for a reason other than a license
revocation; or
      (4)   The licensee ceases to carry on the licensed business under the
license.
   (B)   An application for refund must be made to the Clerk/Treasurer within
30 days after the business ceases to operate. The City Council may grant or
deny the refund in its discretion. If the refund is granted, there shall be
refunded one-twelfth of the annual fee for each full month remaining in the
license year. In no event shall the portion of the annual fee retained be less
than the minimum pro rata fee, if any, established for a license issued during
the license year.
(Ord. passed 6-13-2023; Ord. passed 11-14-2023)
§ 110.31 BOND AND FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY.
   (A)   Bond. Before issuance of a regular on-sale intoxicating liquor
license, the applicant shall file with the Clerk/Treasurer a bond with
corporate surety, or cash or United States government bonds in lieu of bond.
The bond shall be in the amount of $5,000. The bond shall be conditioned upon
the licensee obeying all laws governing the business and paying all taxes,
fees, penalties, and other charges, and shall provide that the bond is
forfeited to the city upon any violation of law. If an insurance policy under
division (B) below is made subject to all the conditions required for a bond,
to the amount required for a bond, no separate bond shall be required. This
requirement for the giving of bond shall apply only to licensees required by
law to give bond. As a condition of the issuance of any license of any kind to
a licensee not otherwise required to give bond, the City Council may require
that the licensee furnish bond or other security of not less than $1,000 nor
more than $3,000 when the City Council determines that to do so would be in the
public interest.
   (B)   Proof of financial responsibility. No license may be issued,
maintained, or renewed unless the applicant demonstrates proof of financial
responsibility with regard to liability imposed under M.S. § 340A.801, as it
may be amended from time to time. The Clerk/Treasurer shall submit to the
Commissioner of Public Safety the applicant’s proof of financial responsibility
for those licensees for which submission of proof to the Commissioner is
required. The requirement for proof of financial responsibility may be met by
filing with the Clerk/Treasurer:
      (1)   A certificate that there is in effect for the license period an
insurance policy or pool providing at least $100,000 of coverage because of
bodily injury to any one person in any one occurrence, $200,000 because of
bodily injury to two or more persons in any one occurrence, $20,000 because of
injury to or destruction of property of others in any one occurrence, $100,000
for loss of means of support of any one person in any one occurrence, and
$200,000 for loss of means of support of two or more persons in any one
occurrence;
      (2)   A bond of a surety company with minimum coverages as provided in
division (B)(1) above; or
      (3)   A certificate of the State Treasurer that the licensee has
deposited with the State Treasurer $200,000 in cash or securities which may
legally be purchased by savings banks or for trust funds having a market value
of $200,000.
   (C)   Insurance coverage. The insurer may provide the coverage required by
this division (C) in combination with other insurance coverage. An annual
aggregate policy limit for dram shop insurance of not less than $300,000 per
policy year may be included in the policy provisions. A liability insurance
policy required by this section must provide that it may not be canceled for
any cause by either the insured or the insurer unless the canceling party has
first given a ten-day notice in writing to the Clerk/Treasurer of intent to
cancel the policy. The proof of financial responsibility given shall also meet
all other requirements of law for proof of financial responsibility.
   (D)   Financial responsibility of certain licensees. The requirements of
divisions (B) and (C) above for demonstration of proof of financial
responsibility shall not apply to licensees who are not required by law to do
so, and who file with the Clerk/Treasurer an affidavit establishing that fact.
As a condition of the issuance of any license of any kind to a licensee not
required by law to demonstrate proof of financial responsibility, the City
Council may require that the licensee demonstrate proof of financial
responsibility in such amount and manner as the City Council deems advisable
when the City Council determines that to do so would be in the public interest.
   (E)   Filing. No licensee who is required to give bond or to demonstrate
proof of financial responsibility shall commence business until the requirement
is met and the bond or proof of financial responsibility, or both if
applicable, are filed with the Clerk/Treasurer. The Clerk/Treasurer shall not
issue the license until the applicant required to do so has done so.

be issued only for the premises specified in the approved application, and may
be transferred to another place only with the approval of the City Council. Any
transfer of shares of a corporate licensee, other than a transfer of shares of
a publicly held corporation, shall constitute a transfer of the license, and
any such transfer of shares, without prior City Council approval, is cause for
revocation of the license.

beverages are kept shall be locked against access by the public during the time
that the premises are open while sale is prohibited. This requirement shall not
apply to any premises which are open no more than a half-hour after sale is
prohibited. Any licensee, regardless of the kind of license held, whose
premises are open to the public when sale is prohibited, shall comply with all
requirements of law, if any, which apply to licensees whose premises are open
to the public when sale is prohibited.

from another retail licensee for the purpose of resale.
   (B)   Lapse or cancellation of any required bond or liability insurance, or

notice or action of the City Council. Notice to the licensee of cancellation or
lapse of a bond or insurance policy, or notice to the licensee of withdrawal of
deposited cash or securities, shall constitute notice to the licensee of the
suspension or impending suspension of the license. A licensee may file with the

   (C)   City staff will review such request for seasonal outdoor sales of
liquors for suitability of the proposed location in light of applicable fire,
building, and life safety codes, zoning ordinances, past performance of the
licensee in maintaining order and obeying applicable laws in the licensed

proposal to provide for the safety of persons on the proposed premises, impact
on the surrounding land, adequacy of lighting, appropriateness of noise level,
suitability of ingress and egress arrangements including control of persons
entering and leaving for purposes of preventing consumption by minors, and
safety arrangements.

occurred in the outdoor area, in the event the City Council determines to
repeal the general authorization for seasonal outdoor sales.

§ 112.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   Because the city recognizes that many persons under the age of 21 years
purchase or otherwise obtain, possess, and use tobacco, tobacco products,
tobacco related devices, electronic delivery devices, and the sales,
possession, and use are violations of both state and federal laws; and because
studies, which the city hereby accepts and adopts, have shown that most smokers
begin smoking before they have reached the age of 21 years and that those
persons who reach the age of 21 years without having started smoking are
significantly less likely to begin smoking; and because smoking has been shown
to be the cause of several serious health problems which subsequently place a
financial burden on all levels of government; this chapter shall be intended to
regulate the sale, possession, and use of tobacco, tobacco products, tobacco
related devices, and electronic delivery devices for the purpose of enforcing
and furthering existing laws, to protect minors against the serious effects
associated with the illegal use of tobacco, tobacco products, tobacco related
devices, and electronic delivery devices, and to further the official public
policy of the state in regard to preventing young people from starting to smoke
as stated in M.S. § 144.391, as it may be amended from time to time.
(Ord. passed 1-8-2019)
§ 112.02 DEFINITIONS.
   Except as may otherwise be provided or clearly implied by context, all terms
shall be given their commonly accepted definitions. For the purpose of this
chapter, the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly
indicates or requires a different meaning.
   AGE VERIFICATION. Before distributing any tobacco product, the distributor
shall verify that the recipient is at least 21 years of age. Each distributor
shall examine the recipient’s government-issued photographic identification. No
such VERIFICATION is required for a person over the age of 30. That a recipient
appeared to be 30 years of age or older shall not constitute a defense to a
violation of this section.
   COMPLIANCE CHECKS. The system the city uses to investigate and ensure that
those authorized to sell tobacco, tobacco products, tobacco related devices,
and electronic delivery devices are following and complying with the
requirements of this chapter. COMPLIANCE CHECKS shall involve the use of minors
as authorized by this chapter. COMPLIANCE CHECKS shall also mean the use of
minors who attempt to purchase tobacco, tobacco products, tobacco related
devices, and electronic delivery devices for educational, research, and
training purposes as authorized by state and federal laws. COMPLIANCE CHECKS
may also be conducted by other units of government for the purpose of enforcing
appropriate federal, state, or local laws and regulations relating to tobacco,
tobacco products, and tobacco related devices.
   ELECTRONIC DELIVERY DEVICE. Means any product containing or delivering
nicotine, lobelia, or any other substance intended for human consumption that
can be used by a person to simulate smoking in the delivery of nicotine or any
other substance through inhalation of vapor from the product. ELECTRONIC
DELIVERY DEVICE includes any component part of a product, whether or not
marketed or sold separately. ELECTRONIC DELIVERY DEVICE does not include any
product that has been approved or certified by the United States Food and Drug
Administration for sale as a tobacco-cessation product, as a tobacco-dependence
product, or for other medical purposes, and is marketed and sold for such an
approved purpose.
   INDIVIDUALLY PACKAGED. The practice of selling any tobacco or tobacco
product wrapped individually for sale. Individually wrapped tobacco and tobacco
products shall include but not be limited to single cigarette packs, single
bags or cans of loose tobacco in any form, and single cans or other packaging
of snuff or chewing tobacco. Cartons or other packaging containing more than a
single pack or other container as described in this definition shall not be
considered INDIVIDUALLY PACKAGED.
   LOOSIES. The common term used to refer to a single or individually packaged
cigarette.
   MINIMUM LEGAL DISTRIBUTION AGE FOR TOBACCO PRODUCTS. The provision of
tobacco, tobacco products, tobacco-related devices, electronic delivery
devices, and nicotine or lobelia delivery devices to a person under the age of
21 is prohibited. This section shall not apply to provisions to any person who
is born on or before December 31, 2000.
   MOVEABLE PLACE OF BUSINESS. Any form of business operated out of a truck,
van, automobile, or other type of vehicle or transportable shelter and not a
fixed address store front or other permanent type of structure authorized for

or intervention of the licensee or the licensee’s employee. The assistance or
intervention shall entail the actual physical exchange of the tobacco, tobacco
product, or tobacco related device between the customer and the licensee or
employee. The phrase shall not include vending machines. SELF-SERVICE SALES are
interpreted as being any sale where there is not an actual physical exchange of
the tobacco between the clerk and the customer.
   SIGNAGE. No person shall distribute or permit the provision of tobacco,
tobacco products, tobacco related devices, electronic delivery devices, or
nicotine or lobelia delivery devices in the county unless a clearly visible
notice of the county minimum legal sales age is posted at the location where
these products are available for purchase.

§ 133.03 SOCIAL HOST.
   (A)   Purpose and findings. The City Council intends to discourage underage
possession and consumption of alcohol, even if done within the confines of a
private residence, and intends to hold persons criminally responsible who host
events or gatherings where persons under 21 years of age possess or consume
alcohol regardless of whether the person hosting the event or gathering
supplied the alcohol. The City Council finds that:
      (1)   Events and gatherings held on private or public property where
alcohol is possessed or consumed by persons under the age of 21 are harmful to
those persons and constitute a potential threat to public health requiring
prevention or abatement;
      (2)   Prohibiting underage consumption acts to protect underage persons,
as well as the general public, from injuries related to alcohol consumption,
such as alcohol overdose or alcohol-related traffic collisions;
      (3)   Alcohol is an addictive drug which, if used irresponsibly, could
have drastic effects on those who use it as well as those who are affected by
the actions of an irresponsible user;
      (4)   Often, events or gatherings involving underage possession and
consumption occur outside the presence of parents. However, there are times
when the parent(s) is/are present and condone the activity, and in some
circumstances, provide the alcohol;
      (5)   Even though giving or furnishing alcohol to an underage person is a
crime, it is difficult to prove, and an ordinance is necessary to help further
combat underage consumption; and
      (6)   A deterrent effect will be created by holding a person criminally
responsible for hosting an event or gathering where underage possession or
consumption occurs.
   (B)   Authority. This section is enacted pursuant to M.S. § 145A.05, as
amended from time to time.
   (C)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning.

whiskey, rum, brandy, gin, or any other distilled spirits, including dilutions
and mixtures thereof from whatever source or by whatever process produced.

liquid or solid containing alcohol, spirits, wine, or beer, and which contains

court.

association of one or more individuals.

room, park, or any other place of assembly, public or private, whether occupied
on a temporary or permanent basis, whether occupied as a dwelling or
specifically for a party or other social function, and whether owned, leased,
rented, or used with or without permission or compensation.
      UNDERAGE PERSON. Any individual under 21 years of age.
   (D)   Prohibited acts.
      (1)   It is unlawful for any person(s) to host or allow an event or
gathering at any residence, premises, or on any other private or public
property where alcohol or alcoholic beverages are present and the person fails
to take reasonable steps to prevent possession or consumption by the underage
person(s) when the person knows or reasonably should know that an underage
person will or does:
         (a)   Consume any alcohol or alcoholic beverage; or
         (b)   Possess any alcohol or alcoholic beverage with the intent to
consume it.
      (2)   A person is criminally responsible for violating division (D)(1)
above if the person intentionally aids, advises, hires, counsels, or conspires
with or otherwise procures another to commit the prohibited act.
      (3)   A person who hosts an event or gathering does not have to be
present at the event or gathering to be criminally responsible.
   (E)   Exceptions.
      (1)   This section does not apply to conduct solely between an underage
person and his or her parents while present in the parent’s household.
      (2)   This section does not apply to legally protected religious
observances.
      (3)   This section does not apply to retail intoxicating liquor 3.2% malt
liquor licensees, municipal liquor stores, or bottle club permit holders who
are regulated by M.S. § 340A.414, as it may be amended from time to time.
      (4)   This section does not apply to situations where underage persons
are lawfully in possession of alcohol or alcoholic beverages during the course
and scope of employment.
      (5)   This section does not apply to landlords who are not present during
any activities prohibited under division (D)(1) above.
   (F)   Enforcement. This section can be enforced by any peace officer.

PREDATORY OFFENDERS
§ 133.15 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The city finds and declares that predatory offenders are likely to use
physical violence and to repeat their offenses, and most predatory offenders
commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are
prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of
predatory offender victimization to society at large, while incalculable,
unmistakably steep. It is the intent of this subchapter to serve the city’s
compelling interest to promote, protect, and improve the health, safety, and
welfare of the citizens of the city by imposing residency restrictions upon
predatory offenders and creating safety zones around locations where vulnerable
populations regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain
predatory offenders are prohibited from establishing temporary or permanent
residence and wherein access by predatory offenders shall be restricted and
excluded.

SIGNS AND FENCES
§ 150.35 FINDINGS.
   The City Council hereby finds as follows.
   (A)   Exterior signs have a substantial impact on the character and quality
of the environment.
   (B)   Signs provide an important medium through which individuals and
organizations may convey a variety of messages.
   (C)   Signs can create traffic hazards, aesthetic concerns, and detriments
to property values, thereby threatening the public health, safety, and welfare.
   (D)   The city’s ordinances have included the regulation of signs in an
effort to provide adequate means of expression and to promote the economic
viability of the business community, while protecting the city and its citizens
from a proliferation of signs of a type, size, location, and character that
would adversely impact upon the aesthetics of the community and threaten the
health, safety, and welfare of the community. The regulation of the physical
characteristics of signs within the city has had a positive impact on traffic
safety and the appearance of the community.
(Ord. passed 4-13-2021)
§ 150.36 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)    It is not the purpose or intent of this subchapter to regulate the

subchapter to regulate any building design or any display not defined as a
sign, or any sign which cannot be viewed outside a building.
   (B)   The purpose and intent of this subchapter is to:
      (1)   Regulate the number, location, size, type, illumination, and other

city by preventing visual clutter that is harmful to the appearance of the
community;
      (3)   Improve the visual appearance of the city while providing for
effective means of communication, consistent with constitutional guarantees and
the city’s goals of public safety and aesthetics; and
      (4)   Provide for fair and consistent enforcement of the sign regulations
set for herein under the zoning authority of the city.
(Ord. passed 4-13-2021)
§ 150.37 EFFECT.
   (A)   A sign may be erected, mounted, displayed, or maintained in the city
if it is in conformance with the provisions of these regulations.
   (B)   The effect of this subchapter, as more specifically set forth herein,
is to:
      (1)   Allow a wide variety of signs types in commercial zones, and a more
limited variety of signs in other zones, subject to the standards set forth in
this subchapter;
      (2)   Allow certain small, unobtrusive signs incidental to the principal
use of a site in all zones when in compliance with the requirements of this
subchapter;
      (3)   Prohibit signs whose location, size, type, illumination, or other
physical characteristics negatively affect the environment and where the
communication can be accomplished by means having lessened impact on the
environment and the public health, safety, and welfare; and

§ 151.01 PROGRAM ENACTED.
   The State Department of Public Health, working under the EPA’s Federal Safe
Drinking Water Act, being 42 U.S.C. §§ 300f et seq., has enacted the Wellhead
Protection Program (Minn. Administrative Rules parts 4720.5100 to 4720.5590, as
it may be amended from time to time). This Program requires all public water
suppliers to develop local wellhead protection programs. The city’s Wellhead
Protection Team, with assistance from the State Department of Health, State
Rural Water Association, and Bayerl Water Resources (a private consulting
company), completed its plan in August of 2012.
§ 151.02 PLAN ADOPTED.
   (A)   The city’s Wellhead Protection Plan, hereafter referred to as WHP
Plan, was officially adopted by the City Council on April 10, 2012 and approved
by the State Department of Health on July 12, 2012.
   (B)   The WHP Plan, with its maps, shall be the basis for this chapter. The
Plan and maps shall be displayed and available for viewing at the City Clerk/
Treasurer’s office in the City Hall. The WHP Plan may be amended from time to
time as needed or required by the State Department of Health.
§ 151.03 MANAGER APPOINTED.
   The City Council has appointed a Wellhead Protection Manager or Managers.
They, with the assistance of the Zoning Officer, shall administer the WHP Plan
in the city.
§ 151.04 BUDGET.
   The City Council shall annually in the city’s budget include a line item for
the funding of the WHP Plan and its implementation.
§ 151.05 PROTECTION TECHNIQUES.
   There are two basic techniques that will be used to protect the city’s WHP
area. The first is non-regulatory. The WHP Plan contains a list of objectives
and a timeline that will educate and encourage people in the WHP area to
voluntarily do things to help reduce or eliminate potential contamination of
our drinking water aquifer. The second is regulatory. By the establishment of
this chapter, there will be oversight and control of potential contamination
sources in the “Drinking Water Supply Management Area,” hereafter referred to
as the DWSMA.
§ 151.06 INSTALLATION.
   All wells that are installed within the DWSMA are to be installed by a
licensed well driller. The wells must meet all the construction criteria and
set back requirements that are set out in Minnesota Administrative Rules
Chapter 4725, as it may be amended from time to time. Section 53.04 sites as a
violation, any possible connection between a private well and the city water
supply.
§ 151.07 PERMITS.
   (A)   Any application for a site permit, a conditional use permit, or a
variance request for parcels of land within the DWSMA must be accompanied by a
completed supplementary environmental checklist.
   (B)   The WHP Manager(s) and the Zoning Officer shall review the application
and the environmental checklist. They must determine if the information
presented adequately identifies any federal, state, or county permits that may
be required and any potential sources of contamination have been identified and
mitigated.
   (C)   When the WHP committee formulated the Plan, they identified and
established a list of potential contamination sources in the DWSMA. Most of
them were classed as non-regulatory and will be addressed with education. Some
of them will fall under the regulatory heading and will be classified upon the
passage of this chapter as existing non-conformities. They may be brought into
compliance voluntarily. If not, these non-conformities shall be brought into
compliance at such time a site permit, conditional use permit, or variance is
requested for the parcel.
§ 151.08 JOINT ENFORCEMENT.
   The city realizes that areas of the DWSMA lie outside of its corporate
boundaries. In order for the city and the township to protect the health,
safety, and welfare of all its residents and visitors, they will jointly
enforce the WHP Ordinance to ensure that their drinking water is protected.
§ 151.09 ADMINISTRATION.
   This chapter shall be administered and enforced by the city’s Administrative
Officer, with the assistance of the Wellhead Protection Manager(s) and the
city’s Zoning Officer. Any violation of the terms and provisions of this
chapter shall constitute a misdemeanor and shall be punishable as defined by
law. Violations of this chapter can occur regardless of whether or not a permit
is required for a regulated activity. In the event of a violation or threatened
violation of this chapter, the City Council and/or the city’s Administrative
Officer, in addition to other remedies may institute appropriate actions or
proceedings to prevent, restrain, correct, or abate such violations or
threatened violations, and it shall be the duty of the City Attorney to
institute such action. This will include, but not be limited to, actions for
injunctive relief before a court of competent jurisdiction.

§ 152.002 POLICY.
   (A)   The uncontrolled use of shorelands of the city affects the public
health, safety, and general welfare not only by contributing to pollution of
public waters, but also by impairing the local tax base. Therefore, it is in
the best interests of the public health, safety, and welfare to provide for the
wise subdivision, use, and development of shorelands of public waters.
   (B)   The legislature of the state has delegated responsibility to local
governments of the state to regulate the subdivision, use, and development of
the shorelands of public waters and thus preserve and enhance the quality of
surface waters, conserve the economic and natural environmental values of
shorelands, and provide for the wise use of waters and related land resources.
   (C)   This responsibility is hereby recognized by the city.

   (C)   Use and upgrading of inconsistent land use districts.
      (1)   The land use districts adopted in the Chapter 156 of this code, as
they apply to shoreland areas, and their delineated boundaries on the official
zoning map, may not be consistent with the land use district designation
criteria specified in the table in division (B) above. These inconsistent land
use district designations may continue until revisions are proposed to change
either the land use district designation within an existing land use district
boundary shown on the official zoning map or to modify the boundary of an
existing land use district shown on the official zoning map.
      (2)   When a revision is proposed to an inconsistent land use district
provision, the following additional criteria and procedures shall apply for
lakes: when a revision to a land use district designation on a lake is
considered, the land use district boundaries and use provisions therein for all
the shoreland areas within the jurisdiction of this chapter on the lake must be
revised to make them substantially compatible with the framework in divisions
(A) and (B) above.
      (3)   When an interpretation question arises about whether a specific
land use fits within a given “use” category, the interpretation shall be made
by the Board of Zoning Adjustment. When a question arises as to whether a land
use district’s boundaries are properly delineated on the official zoning map,
this decision shall be made by the City Council.
      (4)   When a revision is proposed to an inconsistent land use district
provision by an individual party or landowner, this individual party or
landowner will only be responsible to provide the supporting and/or
substantiating information for the specific parcel in question. The City
Council will direct the Administrative Officer to provide such additional
information for the waterbody as is necessary to satisfy division (C)(1) and
(2) above.
      (5)   The City Council must make a detailed finding of fact and
conclusion when taking final action that this revision, and the upgrading of
any inconsistent land use district designations on the waterbody, are
consistent with the enumerated criteria, and use provisions of this section.

feet in the rear yard/alley
 
      (3)   Bluff impact zones. Structures and accessory facilities, except
stairways and landings, must not be placed within bluff impact zones.
      (4)   Uses without water-oriented needs. Uses without water-oriented
needs must be located on lots or parcels without public-waters frontage, or, if
located on lots or parcels with public-waters frontage, must either be set back
double the normal ordinary high water level setback or be substantially
screened from view from the water by vegetation or topography, assuming summer,
leaf-on conditions.
      (5)   Use of RCUs. The use of RCUs are allowed with the following
provisions.
         (a)   A lot without a dwelling may contain one RCU, provided:
            1.   The lot meets minimum requirements for size and all
requirements of this chapter for structures are met;
            2.   There are no water or sewer connections to the RCU;
            3.   The RCU cannot be used as a permanent dwelling;
            4.   No RCU may be skirted or permanently placed; and
            5.   An RCU may be allowed in conjunction with a land use permit
for a permanent structure for a maximum of 12 months during the construction
period.
         (b)   A lot containing one dwelling may contain one RCU for use, not
to exceed ten days within any 60-day period, provided that:
            1.   It is not located in the right-of-way and is placed solely on
the owner’s property;
            2.   It will not impede city services or obstruct traffic
visibility; and
            3.   It can only be used for storage and not for use and cannot be
hooked up to city utility services.
   (B)   Design criteria for structures.
      (1)   High water elevations. Structures must be placed in accordance with
any flood plain regulations applicable to the site. Where these controls do not
exist, the elevation to which the lowest floor, including basement, is placed
or flood-proofed must be determined as follows:
         (a)   For lakes, by placing the lowest floor at a level at least three
feet above the highest known water level, or three feet above the ordinary high
water level, whichever is higher; and
         (b)   Water-oriented accessory structures may have the lowest floor
placed lower than the elevation determined in this item if the structure is
constructed of flood-resistant materials to the elevation, electrical and
mechanical equipment is placed above the determined elevation and, if long
duration flooding is anticipated, the structure is built to withstand ice
action and wind-driven waves and debris.
      (2)   Water-oriented accessory structures. Each lot that meets minimum
size requirements may have one water-oriented accessory structure not meeting
the normal structure setback in division (A) above if this water-oriented
accessory structure complies with the following provisions.
         (a)   The structure or facility must not exceed ten feet in height,
exclusive of safety rails, and cannot occupy an area greater than 250 square
feet. Detached decks must not exceed eight feet above grade at any point.
         (b)   The setback of the structure or facility from the ordinary high
water level must be at least ten feet.
         (c)   The structure or facility must be treated to reduce visibility
as viewed from public waters and adjacent shorelands by vegetation, topography,
increased setbacks, or color, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions.
         (d)   The roof may be used as a deck with safety rails, but must not
be enclosed or used as a storage area.
         (e)   The structure or facility must not be designed or used for human
habitation and must not contain water supply or sewage treatment facilities.
         (f)   The structure or facility must be within the center 50% of the
lot width measured at the ordinary high water level.
         (g)   If a lot is physically separated (i.e. public, private road
right-of-way or easement) from itself or another, they will be considered two
separate parcels.
      (3)   Stairways, lifts, and landings. Stairways and lifts are the
preferred alternative to major topographic alterations for achieving access up
and down bluffs and steep slopes to shore areas. Stairways and lifts must meet
the following design requirements.
         (a)   Stairways and lifts must not exceed four feet in width on
residential lots. Wider stairways may be used for commercial properties, public
open-space recreational properties, and planned unit developments.
         (b)   Landings for stairways and lifts on residential lots must not
exceed 32 square feet in area. Landings larger than 32 square feet may be used
for commercial properties, public open-space recreational properties, and
planned unit developments.
         (c)   Canopies or roofs are not allowed on stairways, lifts, or
landings.
         (d)   Stairways, lifts, and landings may be either constructed above
the ground on posts or pilings, or placed into the ground, provided they are
designed and built in a manner that ensures control of soil erosion and the
property owner applies and receives a permit.
         (e)   Stairways, lifts, and landings must be located in the most
visually inconspicuous portions of lots, as viewed from the surface of the
public water assuming summer, leaf-on conditions, whenever practical.
         (f)   Facilities such as ramps, lifts, or mobility paths for
physically handicapped persons are also allowed for achieving access to shore
areas, provided that the dimensional and performance standards of division (B)
(3)(a) through (e) above are complied with in addition to the requirements of
Minn. Regulations Chapter 1341, as it may be amended from time to time.
      (4)   Significant historic sites. No structure may be placed on a
significant historic site in a manner that affects the values of the site
unless adequate information about the site has been removed and documented in a
public repository.
      (5)   Steep slopes. The Administrative Officer (City Zoning Officer) must
evaluate possible soil erosion impacts and development visibility from public
waters before issuing a permit for construction of sewage-treatment systems,
roads, driveways, structures, or other improvements on steep slopes. When
determined necessary, conditions must be attached to issued permits to prevent
erosion and to preserve existing vegetation that screens structures, vehicles,
and other facilities as viewed from the surface of public waters, assuming
summer, leaf-on vegetation.
      (6)   Fences. Fences must follow regulations set forth in §§
150.35 through
150.45.

§ 152.037 SHORELAND ALTERATIONS.
   (A)   Generally. Alterations of vegetation and topography will be regulated
to prevent erosion into public waters, fix nutrients, preserve shoreland
aesthetics, preserve historic values, prevent bank slumping, and protect fish
and wildlife habitat.
   (B)   Vegetation alterations.
      (1)   Vegetation alteration necessary for the construction of structures
and sewage treatment systems and the construction of roads and parking areas
regulated by §
152.038 are exempt from the vegetation alteration standards that follow.
      (2)   Removal or alteration of vegetation is allowed subject to the
following standards.
         (a)   Intensive vegetation clearing within the shore and bluff impact
zones and on steep slopes is not allowed. Intensive vegetation clearing for
forest land conversion to another use outside of these areas is allowable as a
conditional use if an erosion control and sedimentation plan is developed and
approved by the soil and water conservation district in which the property is
located.
         (b)   In shore and bluff impact zones and on steep slopes, limited
clearing of trees and shrubs and cutting, pruning, and trimming of trees is
allowed to provide a view to the water from the principal dwelling site and to
accommodate the placement of stairways and landings, picnic areas, access
paths, beach and watercraft access areas, and permitted water-oriented
accessory structures or facilities, provided that:
            1.   The screening of structures, vehicles, or other facilities as
viewed from the water, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions, is not
substantially reduced; and
            2.   The provisions of this division (A)(2) are not applicable to
the removal of trees, limbs, or branches that are dead, diseased, or pose
safety hazards.
   (B)   Topographic/lot alterations.
      (1)   Lot alteration (grading, filling, or excavating) necessary for the
construction of structures, sewage treatment systems, and driveways require a
lot alteration permit, but this permit can be combined with construction permit
for these facilities. However, the lot alteration standards in this section
must be incorporated into the issuance of permits for construction of
structures, sewage treatment systems, and driveways.
      (2)   Public roads and parking areas are regulated by §
152.038.
      (3)   Notwithstanding divisions (B)(1) and (2) above, a lot alteration
permit will be required for:
         (a)   The movement of more than ten cubic yards of material on steep
slopes or within shore or bluff impact zones; more than 50 cubic yards anywhere
else in the shoreland district;
         (b)   The movement of up to 600 cubic yards of material outside of
steep slopes and shore and bluff impact zones. Property owner must apply and
receive a conditional use permit prior to receiving a permit for the movement
of more than 600 cubic yards of material; and
         (c)   Lot alteration permits are not required for beach sand as long
as the owner follows requirements set by the State Department of Natural
Resources.
      (4)   The following considerations and conditions must be adhered to
during the issuance of site permits, lot alteration permits, conditional or
special use permits, variances, and subdivision approvals.
         (a)   1.   Grading or filling in any type 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8
wetland must be evaluated to determine how extensively the proposed activity
would affect the following functional qualities of the wetland:
               a.   Sediment and pollutant trapping and retention;
               b.   Storage of surface runoff to prevent or reduce flood
damage;
               c.   Fish and wildlife habitat;
               d.   Recreational use;
               e.   Shoreline or bank stabilization; and
               f.   Noteworthiness, including special qualities such as
historic significance, critical habitat for endangered plants and animals, or
others.
            2.   This evaluation must also include a determination of whether
the wetland alteration being proposed requires permits, reviews, or approvals
by other local, state, or federal agencies such as a watershed district, the
State Department of Natural Resources, or the United States Army Corps of
Engineers. The applicant will be so advised.
         (b)   Alterations must be designed and conducted in a manner that
ensures only the smallest amount of bare ground is exposed for the shortest
time possible.
         (c)   Mulches or similar materials must be used, where necessary, for
temporary bare soil coverage, and a permanent vegetation cover must be
established as soon as possible.
         (d)   Methods to minimize soil erosion and to trap sediments before
they reach any surface water feature must be used.
         (e)   Altered areas must be stabilized to acceptable erosion control
standards consistent with the field office technical guides of the local soil
and water conservation districts and the United States Soil Conservation
Service.
         (f)   Fill or excavated material must not be placed in a manner that
creates an unstable slope.
         (g)   Plans to place fill or excavated material on steep slopes must
be reviewed by qualified professionals for continued slope stability and must
not create finished slopes of 30% or greater.
         (h)   Fill or excavated material must not be placed in bluff impact
zones.
         (i)   Any alterations below the ordinary high water level of public
waters must first be authorized by the Commissioner under M.S. § 103G.245, as
it may be amended from time to time.
         (j)   Alterations of topography must only be allowed if they are
accessory to permitted or conditional uses and do not adversely affect adjacent
or nearby properties.
         (k)   Placement of natural rock riprap, including associated grading
of the shoreline and placement of a filter blanket, is permitted if the
finished slope does not exceed three feet horizontal to one foot vertical, the
landward extent of the riprap is within ten feet of the ordinary high water
level, and the height of the riprap above the ordinary high water level does
not exceed three feet.
      (5)   Excavations where the intended purpose is connection to a public
water, such as boat slips, canals, lagoons, and harbors, must be controlled by
local shoreland controls. Permission for excavations may be given only after
the Commissioner has approved the proposed connection to public waters.

§ 152.038 PLACEMENT AND DESIGN OF ROADS, DRIVEWAYS, AND PARKING AREAS.
   (A)   Public and private roads and parking areas must be designed to take
advantage of natural vegetation and topography to achieve maximum screening
from view from public waters. Documentation must be provided by a qualified
individual that all roads and parking areas are designed and constructed to
minimize and control erosion to public waters consistent with the field office
technical guides of the local soil and water conservation district, or other
applicable technical materials.
   (B)   Roads, driveways, and parking areas must meet structure setbacks and
must not be placed within bluff and shore impact zones, when other reasonable
and feasible placement alternatives exist. If no alternatives exist, they may
be placed within these areas, and must be designed to minimize adverse impacts.
   (C)   Public and private watercraft access ramps, approach roads, and
access-related parking areas may be placed within shore impact zones provided
the vegetative screening and erosion control conditions of this section are
met. For private facilities, the lot alteration provisions of §
152.037(B) must be met.

USES.
   (A)   Surface water-oriented commercial uses and industrial, public, or
semipublic uses with similar needs to have access to and use of public waters
may be located on parcels or lots with frontage on public waters. Those uses
with water-oriented needs must meet the following standards.
      (1)   In addition to meeting impervious coverage limits, setbacks, and
other zoning standards in this chapter, the uses must be designed to
incorporate topographic and vegetative screening of parking areas and
structures.
      (2)   Uses that require short-term watercraft mooring for patrons must
centralize these facilities and design them to avoid obstructions of navigation
and to be the minimum size necessary to meet the need; and uses that depend on
patrons arriving by watercraft may use signs and lighting to convey needed
information to the public, subject to the following general standards.
         (a)   No advertising signs or supporting facilities for signs may be
placed in or upon public waters. Signs conveying information or safety messages
may be placed in or on public waters by a public authority or under a permit
issued by the County Sheriff.
         (b)   Signs must follow the requirements set forth in §§ 150.035
through 150.045.
         (c)   Other outside lighting may be located within the shore impact
zone or over public waters if it is used primarily to illuminate potential
safety hazards and is shielded or otherwise directed to prevent direct
illumination out across public waters. This does not preclude use of
navigational lights.
   (B)   Uses without water-oriented needs must be located on lots or parcels
without public waters frontage, or, if located on lots or parcels with public-
waters frontage, must either be set back double the normal ordinary high water
level setback or be substantially screened from view from the water by
vegetation or topography, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions.

§ 152.043 DOCK PLACEMENT AND REGULATIONS.
   The following regulations shall apply in the placing of docks in or near
public waters:
   (A)   All docks, piers, wharves, boat lifts, or other structures placed
within public waters, shall meet a minimum setback of five feet from the area
created when projecting the lot width at the shoreline into the water body,
using the lot line.
   (B)   In unique circumstances where due to the curvature of the shoreline,
such a projection of the lot width would result in an undue burden on the
property owner, the city, or their designated representative, may designate a
different setback. Such a determination shall take into consideration any
agreements between the affected landowners.
   (C)   Docks must be placed so that no portion of the dock, including the “L”
extensions or additions, and no accessory or ancillary structures or equipment
(including mooring buoys, boat lifts, shore trackers or swimming platforms)
extends across the projection of the setback from the lot line into the lake.
Docks must also be placed so as not to block access from adjacent property to
open water. The storage of all docks, and all watercraft or water oriented
items, shall also be subject to this property setback rule.
   (D)   Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, the
five foot setback for docks shall not apply to the extent necessary to allow
ingress to, or egress from, a legal, non-conforming boat house or water-
oriented accessory structure.
   (E)   Docks, or portions of docks, intended as accesses to public waters
shall not be rented, leased or used by persons, or their guests, who do not own
or rent the property on which the dock is located. Renting of multiple docks or
portions of a lot shall not be allowed.
   (F)   This section shall apply to the use, maintenance and installation of
any dock and accessory or ancillary structures or equipment at any time.
   (G)   Dock length and width is subject to permitting requirements and/or
restrictions imposed by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR).

§ 152.056 CONSTRUCTION ON NON-CONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   (A)   Exempted lots. Lots of record in the office of the County Recorder on
the date of enactment of local shoreland controls that do not meet the
requirements of §
152.035 may be allowed as building sites without variances from lot size
requirements provided the use is permitted in the zoning district, the lot has
been in separate ownership from abutting lands at all times since it became
substandard, was created compliant with official controls in effect at the
time, and meets sewage treatment and setback requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   Variance required. A variance from setback requirements must be
obtained before any use, sewage treatment system, or building permit is issued
for a lot. In evaluating the variance, the Board of Zoning Adjustment shall
consider sewage treatment and water supply capabilities or constraints of the
lot and shall deny the variance if adequate facilities cannot be provided.
   (C)   Contiguous lots. If, in a group of two or more contiguous lots under
the same ownership, any individual lot does not meet the requirements of §
152.035, the lot must not be considered as a separate parcel of land for the
purposes of sale or development. The lot must be combined with the one or more
contiguous lots so they equal one or more parcels of land, each meeting the
requirements of §
152.035 as much as possible.

   (A)   Upgrading. A sewage treatment system not meeting the requirements of §
152.041 must be upgraded, at a minimum, any time a permit ordinance of any type
is required for any improvement on, or use of, the property. For the purposes
of this provision, a sewage treatment system shall not be considered non-
conforming if the only deficiency is the sewage treatment system’s improper
setback from the ordinary high water level.
   (B)   Identifying.
      (1)   The City Council has by formal resolution notified the Commissioner
that it has relinquished its oversight of on-site sewage treatment systems to
the county. The city will require upgrading or replacement of any nonconforming
system identified by this program within a reasonable period of time which will
not exceed two years.
      (2)   Sewage systems installed according to all applicable local
shoreland management standards adopted under M.S. § 105.485, as it may be
amended from time to time, in effect at the time of installation may be
considered as conforming unless they are determined to be failing, except that
systems using cesspools, leaching pits, or other deep disposal methods, or
systems with less soil treatment area separation above groundwater than
required by the State Pollution Control Agency’s Chapter 7080, as it may be
amended from time to time, for design on on-site sewage treatment systems,
shall be considered non-conforming.

§ 152.073 SITE “SUITABLE AREA” EVALUATION.
   Proposed new PUDs or expansions to existing PUDs must be evaluated using the
following procedures and standards to determine the suitable area for the
dwelling unit/dwelling site density evaluation in §
152.074.
   (A)   The project parcel must be divided into tiers by locating one or more
lines approximately parallel to a line that identifies the ordinary high water
level at the following intervals, proceeding landward:
 
Shoreland Tier Dimensions
Class of Lake                          Unsewered (feet) Sewered (feet)
General development lakes - first tier 200              200
General development lakes - second and 267              200
additional tiers
Natural environment lakes              400              320
 
   (B)   The suitable area within each tier is next calculated by excluding
from the tier area all wetlands, bluffs, or land below the ordinary high water
level of public waters. This suitable area and the proposed project are then
subjected to either the residential or commercial planned unit development
density evaluation steps to arrive at an allowable number of dwelling units or
sites.

§ 152.074 PUD DENSITY EVALUATION.
   The procedures for determining the “base” density of a PUD and density
increase multipliers are as follows.
   (A)   PUD “base” density evaluation. The suitable area within each tier is
divided by the single residential lot size standard for lakes. Proposed
locations and number of dwelling units or sites for the residential planned
unit development are then compared with the tier, density, and suitability
analyses herein and the design criteria in §
152.075.
   (B)   Density increase multipliers. Increases to the dwelling or dwelling
base densities previously determined are allowable if the dimensional standards
in §§
152.035 through
152.042 are met or exceeded and the design criteria in §
152.075 are satisfied. The allowable density increases in the table below will
only be allowed if structure setbacks from the ordinary high water level are
increased to at least 50% greater than the minimum setback, or the impact on
the waterbody is reduced an equivalent amount through vegetative management,
topography, or additional means acceptable to the local unit of government and
the setback is at least 25% greater than the minimum setback.
   (C)   Allowable dwelling unit or dwelling site density increases for planned
unit developments.
 
Density Evaluation Tiers Maximum Density Increase within Each Tier (%)
First                    50
Second                   100
Third                    200
Fourth                   200
Fifth                    200
 
   (D)   Transfer. Allowable densities may be transferred from any tier to any
other tier farther from the waterbody, but must not be transferred to any other
closer tier.

§ 152.075 MAINTENANCE AND DESIGN CRITERIA.
   (A)   Maintenance and administration requirements.
      (1)   Requirement. Before final approval of a planned unit development,
adequate provisions must be developed for preservation and maintenance in
perpetuity of open spaces and for the continued existence and functioning of
the development.
      (2)   Open space preservation. Deed restrictions, covenants, permanent
easements, public dedication and acceptance, or other equally effective and
permanent means must be provided to ensure long-term preservation and
maintenance of open space. The instruments must include all of the following
protections:
         (a)   Commercial uses prohibited (for residential PUDs);
         (b)   Vegetation and topographic alterations other than routine
maintenance prohibited;
         (c)   Construction of additional buildings or storage of vehicles and
other materials prohibited; and
         (d)   Uncontrolled beaching of watercraft prohibited.
      (3)   Development organization and functioning. Unless an equally
effective alternative community framework is established, when applicable, all
residential planned unit developments must use an owners’ association with the
following features.
         (a)   Membership must be mandatory for each dwelling unit or site
purchaser and any successive purchasers.
         (b)   Each member must pay a pro rata share of the association’s
expenses, and unpaid assessments can become liens on units or sites.
         (c)   Assessments must be adjustable to accommodate changing
conditions.
         (d)   The association must be responsible for insurance, taxes, and
maintenance of all commonly owned property and facilities.
   (B)   Open space requirements. Planned unit developments must contain open
space meeting all of the following criteria.
      (1)   At least 50% of the total project area must be preserved as open
space.
      (2)   Dwelling units or sites, road rights-of-way, or land covered by
road surfaces, parking areas, or structures, except water-oriented accessory
structures or facilities, are developed areas and shall not be included in the
computation of minimum open space.
      (3)   Open space must include areas with physical characteristics
unsuitable for development in their natural state, and areas containing
significant historic sites or unplatted cemeteries.
      (4)   Open space may include outdoor recreational facilities for use by
owners of dwelling units or sites, by guests staying in commercial dwelling
units or sites, and by the general public.
      (5)   Open space may include subsurface sewage treatment systems if the
use of the space is restricted to avoid adverse impacts on the systems.
      (6)   Open space must not include commercial facilities or uses, but may
contain water-oriented accessory structures or facilities.
      (7)   The appearance of open space areas, including topography,
vegetation, and allowable uses, must be preserved by use of restrictive deed
covenants, permanent easements, public dedication and acceptance, or other
equally effective and permanent means.
      (8)   The shore impact zone, based on normal structure setbacks, must be
included as open space. For PUDs at least 50% of the shore impact zone area of
existing developments, or at least 70% of the shore impact zone area of new
developments must be preserved in its natural or existing state.
   (C)   Erosion control and storm water management. Erosion control and storm
water management plans must be developed and the PUD must:
      (1)   Be designed, and the construction managed, to minimize the
likelihood of serious erosion occurring either during or after construction.
This goal must be accomplished by limiting the amount and length of time of
bare ground exposure. Temporary ground covers, sediment entrapment facilities,
vegetated buffer strips, or other appropriate techniques must be used to
minimize erosion impacts on surface water features. Erosion control plans
approved by a soil and water conservation district may be required if project
size and site physical characteristics warrant; and
      (2)   Be designed and constructed to effectively manage reasonably
expected quantities and qualities of storm water runoff. Impervious surface
coverage within any tier must not exceed 25% of the tier area.
   (D)   Centralization and design of facilities. Centralization and design of
facilities and structures must be done according to the following standards.
      (1)   A planned unit development must be connected to publicly owned
water supply and sewer systems, if available. On-site water supply and sewage-
treatment systems must be centralized and designed and installed to meet or
exceed applicable standards or rules of the State Department of Health and §§
152.036 and
152.041. On-site sewage-treatment systems must be located on the most suitable
areas of the development, and sufficient lawn area free of limiting factors
must be provided for a replacement soil treatment system for each sewage
system.
      (2)   Dwelling units or sites must be clustered into one or more groups
and located on suitable areas of the development. They must be designed and
located to meet or exceed the following dimensional standards for the relevant
shoreland classification: setback from the ordinary high water level, elevation
above the surface water features, and maximum height. Setbacks from the
ordinary high water level must be increased in accordance with §
152.074(B) for developments with density increases.
      (3)   Shore recreation facilities, including, but not limited to,
swimming areas, docks, and watercraft mooring areas and launching ramps, must
be centralized and located in suitable areas. Evaluation of suitability must
include consideration of land slope, water depth, vegetation, the soil’s depth
to groundwater and bedrock, or other relevant factors. The number of spaces
provided for continuous beaching, mooring, or docking of watercraft must not
exceed one for each allowable dwelling unit or site in the first tier
(notwithstanding existing mooring sites in an existing commercially used
harbor). Launching-ramp facilities, including a small dock for loading and
unloading equipment, may be provided for use by occupants of dwelling units or
sites located in other tiers.
      (4)   Structures, parking areas, and other facilities must be treated to
reduce visibility as viewed from public waters and adjacent shorelands by
vegetation, topography, increased setbacks, color, or other means acceptable to
the local unit of government, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions. Vegetative
and topographic screening must be preserved, if existing, or may be required to
be provided.
      (5)   Accessory structures and facilities, except water-oriented
accessory structures, must meet the required principal structure setback and
must be centralized.
      (6)   Water-oriented accessory structures and facilities may be allowed
if they meet or exceed design standards contained in §
152.036 and are centralized.

   The following general and specific standards shall apply.
   (A)   General standards.
      (1)   When possible, existing natural drainage ways, wetlands, and
vegetated soil surfaces must be used to convey, store, filter, and retain storm
water runoff before discharge to public ditches.
      (2)   Development must be planned and conducted in a manner that will
minimize the extent of disturbed areas, runoff velocities, erosion potential,
and reduce and delay runoff volumes. Disturbed areas must be stabilized and
protected as soon as possible and facilities or methods used to retain sediment
on the site.
      (3)   When development density, topographic features, and soil and
vegetation conditions are not sufficient to adequately handle storm water
runoff using natural features and vegetation, various types of constructed
facilities such as diversions, settling basins, skimming devices, dikes,
waterways, and ponds may be used. Preference must be given to designs using
surface drainage, vegetation, and infiltration rather than buried pipes and
human-made materials and facilities.
   (B)   Specific standards.
      (1)   Impervious surface coverage of lots must not exceed 40% of the lot
area or 25% of the lot area within the shoreland management area. Impervious
surface is a constructed hard surface that either prevents or retards the entry
of water into the soil and causes water to run off the surface in greater
quantities and at an increased rate of flow than prior to development. Examples
include, but are not limited to, decks, rooftops, sidewalks, patios permeable
pavers, storage areas, and concrete, asphalt, or gravel driveways.
      (2)   When constructed facilities are used for storm water management,
they must be approved by the City Zoning Officer that they are designed and
installed consistent with the field office technical guide of the local soil
and water conservation districts.
      (3)   Minimum floor elevation for building shall be established at
1,339.38 feet.
      (4)   Surface area covered by permeable pavers must be included in the
impervious surface calculation. Half of the area covered by professionally
installed and properly maintained permeable pavers will be counted as
impervious. Professionally installed means installed by an interlocking
concrete pavement institute certified installer, and properly maintained means
following the manufacturer’s suggested maintenance schedule.
      (5)   Surface area of a lot physically separated (i.e., public, private
road right-of-way or easement) from itself or another, cannot be included for
purposes of the impervious surface calculation.
      (6)   Unless otherwise provided by the property owner, a minimum 12-foot
wide driveway, from the nearest road right-of-way to the proposed structure(s),
must be included in the impervious calculation. This includes an accessory
structure that has the ability to house a vehicle and requires a garage door.
   (C)   All land-disturbing activities must comply with these minimum
requirements.
      (1)   Property and streets adjacent to the site of a land disturbance
shall be protected from sediment deposition. This shall be accomplished by
preserving a well-vegetated buffer strip around the lower perimeter of the land
disturbance, by installing perimeter controls such as sediment barriers,
filters, dikes, or sediment basins, by stockpiling soil in appropriate
locations or by a combination of such measures.
      (2)   All storm sewer inlets which are functioning during construction
shall be protected so that sediment-laden water will not enter the conveyance
system without first being filtered or otherwise treated to remove sediment.
      (3)   Property and waterways downstream from development sites shall be
protected from flooding and erosion due to increases in the volume, velocity,
and peak water flow rate of storm water runoff. Concentrated storm runoff water
leaving a development’s site must be discharged directly into a well-defined
natural or human-made off-site receiving channel or pipe.
      (4)   A permanent vegetative cover shall be established in denuded areas
not otherwise permanently stabilized forthwith after the land-disturbing
activity is complete.
      (5)   Whenever construction vehicles access public roads, the provision
shall be made to minimize the transport of sediment by runoff or vehicle
tracking onto the paved surface. Where sediment is transported onto a public
road surface, the roads shall be cleaned thoroughly at the end of each day.
      (6)   All temporary and permanent erosion and sediment control practices
shall be maintained and repaired to assure the continued performance of their
intended function.
      (7)   All temporary erosion and sediment control measures shall be
removed within 30 days after final site stabilization is achieved or after the
temporary measures are no longer needed.

§ 153.04 WATERCOURSE PROTECTION.
   Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person’s lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles
that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so
that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical
integrity of the watercourse.

   The impervious surface standard set forth in §
153.03 shall not apply to all existing impervious surface coverages for any
area contained within the chapter existing as of the date of the initial
passage of this chapter. Impervious surface area in existence at the time of
the initial passage of this chapter shall be allowed to continue and exist

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 154.01 FINDINGS, PURPOSE, AND INTENT.
   (A)   To provide for the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens, and to
ensure the integrity of its streets and the appropriate use of the rights-of-
way, the city strives to keep its rights-of-way in a state of good repair and
free from unnecessary encumbrances.
   (B)   Accordingly, the city hereby enacts this new chapter of this code
relating to right-of-way permits and administration. This chapter clarifies
that no right of way permit shall be issued for the installation of private
irrigation within the right-of-way. This chapter imposes reasonable regulation
on the placement and maintenance of facilities and equipment currently within
its rights-of-way or to be placed therein at some future time. It is intended
to complement the regulatory roles of state and federal agencies. Under this
chapter, persons excavating and obstructing the rights-of-way will bear
financial responsibility for their work. Finally, this chapter provides for
recovery of out-of-pocket and projected costs from persons using the public
rights-of-way.
   (C)   This chapter shall be interpreted consistently with 1997 Session Laws,
Chapter 123, substantially codified in M.S. §§ 237.16, 237.162, 237.163,
237.79, 237.81, and 238.086 (the “Act”) and 2017 Minn. Laws, Chapter 94 Article
9, amending the Act, as they all may be amended from time to time, and the
other laws governing applicable rights of the city and users of the right-of-
way. This chapter shall also be interpreted consistent with Minn. Rules parts
7819.0050 to 7819.9950 and Minn. Rules Chapter 7560, as they all may be amended
from time to time, where possible. To the extent any provision of this chapter
cannot be interpreted consistently with the Minnesota Rules, that
interpretation most consistent with the Act and other applicable statutory and
case law is intended. This chapter shall not be interpreted to limit the
regulatory and police powers of the city to adopt and enforce general
ordinances necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public.

requirements of local, state, and federal laws, including, but not limited to,
M.S. §§ 216D.01 through 216D.09 (Gopher One-Call Excavation Notice System) and
Minn. Rules Chapter 7560, as they all may be amended from time to time.
   (C)   Small wireless facility conditions. In addition to division (B) above,
the erection or installation of a wireless support structure, the collocation
of a small wireless facility, or other installation of a small wireless
facility in the right-of-way, shall be subject to the following conditions.
      (1)   A small wireless facility shall only be collocated on the
particular wireless support structure, under those attachment specifications,
and at the height indicated in the applicable permit application.
      (2)   No new wireless support structure installed within the right-of-way
shall exceed 50 feet in height without the city’s written authorization,
provided that the city may impose a lower height limit in the applicable permit
to protect the public health, safety, and welfare or to protect the right-of-
way and its current use, and further provided that a right-of-way user may
replace an existing wireless support structure exceeding 50 feet in height with
a structure of the same height subject to such conditions or requirements as
may be imposed in the applicable permit.
      (3)   No wireless facility may extend more than ten feet above its
wireless support structure.
      (4)   Where an applicant proposes to install a new wireless support
structure in the right-of-way, the city may impose separation requirements
between such structure and any existing wireless support structure or other
facilities in and around the right-of-way.
      (5)   Where an applicant proposes collocation on a decorative wireless
support structure, sign, or other structure not intended to support small
wireless facilities, the city may impose reasonable requirements to accommodate
the particular design, appearance, or intended purpose of such structure.
      (6)   Where an applicant proposes to replace a wireless support
structure, the city may impose reasonable restocking, replacement, or
relocation requirements on the replacement of such structure.
   (D)   Small wireless facility agreement.
      (1)   A small wireless facility shall only be collocated on a small
wireless support structure owned or controlled by the city, or any other city
asset in the right-of-way, after the applicant has executed a standard small
wireless facility collocation agreement with the city. The standard collocation
agreement may require payment of the following:
         (a)   Up to $150 per year for rent to collocate on the city structure;
         (b)   Twenty-five dollars per year for maintenance associated with the
collocation; and
         (c)   A monthly fee for electrical service as follows:
            1.   Seventy-three dollars per radio node less than or equal to 100
maximum watts;
            2.   One-hundred-eighty-two dollars per radio node over 100 maximum
watts; or
            3.   The actual costs of electricity, if the actual costs exceed
the foregoing.
      (2)   The standard collocation agreement shall be in addition to, and not
in lieu of, the required small wireless facility permit, provided, however,
that the applicant shall not be additionally required to obtain a license or
franchise in order to collocate. Issuance of a small wireless facility permit
does not supersede, alter, or affect any then-existing agreement between the
city and applicant.

§ 154.20 RIGHT-OF-WAY PATCHING AND RESTORATION.
   (A)   Timing. The work to be done under the excavation permit, and the
patching and restoration of the right-of-way as required herein, must be
completed within the dates specified in the permit, increased by as many days
as work could not be done because of circumstances beyond the control of the
permittee or when work was prohibited as unseasonal or unreasonable.
   (B)   Patch and restoration. The permittee shall patch his or her own work.
The city may choose either to have the permittee restore the right-of-way or to
restore the right-of-way itself.
      (1)   City restoration. If the city restores the right-of-way, permittee
shall pay the costs thereof within 30 days of billing. If, following such
restoration, the pavement settles due to permittee’s improper backfilling, the
permittee shall pay to the city, within 30 days of billing, all costs
associated with correcting the defective work.
      (2)   Permittee restoration. If the permittee restores the right-of-way
himself or herself, it shall at the time of application for an excavation
permit post a construction performance bond in accordance with the provisions
of Minn. Rules part 7819.3000, as it may be amended from time to time.
      (3)   Degradation fee in lieu of restoration. In lieu of right-of-way
restoration, a right-of-way user may elect to pay a degradation fee. However,
the right-of-way user shall remain responsible for patching, and the
degradation fee shall not include the cost to accomplish these
responsibilities.
   (C)   Standards. The permittee shall perform excavation, backfilling,
patching, and restoration according to the standards and with the materials
specified by the city and shall comply with Minn. Rules part 7819.1100, as it
may be amended from time to time.
   (D)   Duty to correct defects. The permittee shall correct defects in
patching or restoration performed by permittee or its agents. The permittee,
upon notification from the city, shall correct all restoration work to the
extent necessary, using the method required by the city. Said work shall be
completed within five calendar days of the receipt of the notice from the city,
not including days during which work cannot be done because of circumstances
constituting force majeure or days when work is prohibited as unseasonable or
unreasonable.
   (E)   Failure to restore. If the permittee fails to restore the right-of-way
in the manner and to the condition required by the city, or fails to
satisfactorily and timely complete all restoration required by the city, the
city at its option may do such work. In that event, the permittee shall pay to
the city, within 30 days of billing, the cost of restoring the right-of-way. If
the permittee fails to pay as required, the city may exercise its rights under
the construction performance bond.

§ 154.21 JOINT APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   Joint application. Right-of-way users may jointly apply for permits to
excavate or obstruct the right-of-way at the same place and time.
   (B)   Shared fees. Right-of-way users who apply for permits for the same
obstruction or excavation, which the city does not perform, may share in the
payment of the obstruction or excavation permit fee. In order to obtain a joint
permit, right-of-way users must agree among themselves as to the portion each
will pay and indicate the same on their applications.
   (C)   With city projects. Right-of-way users who join in a scheduled
obstruction or excavation performed by the city, whether or not it is a joint
application by two or more right-of-way users or a single application, are not
required to pay the excavation or obstruction and degradation portions of the
permit fee, but a permit would still be required.
(Ord. passed 9-14-2021; Ord. passed 5-24-2022; Ord. passed 11-14-2023)
§ 154.22 SUPPLEMENTARY APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   Limitation on area. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the area
of the right-of-way specified in the permit. No permittee may do any work
outside the area specified in the permit, except as provided herein. Any
permittee which determines that an area greater than that specified in the
permit must be obstructed or excavated must, before working in that greater
area:
      (1)   Make application for a permit extension and pay any additional fees
required thereby; and
      (2)   Be granted a new permit or permit extension.
   (B)   Limitation on dates. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the dates
specified in the permit. No permittee may begin its work before the permit
start date or, except as provided herein, continue working after the end date.
If a permittee does not finish the work by the permit end date, it must apply
for a new permit for the additional time it needs, and receive the new permit
or an extension of the old permit before working after the end date of the
previous permit. This supplementary application must be submitted before the
permit end date.

§ 154.23 OTHER OBLIGATIONS.
   (A)   Compliance with other laws. Obtaining a right-of-way permit does not
relieve permittee of its duty to obtain all other necessary permits, licenses,
and authority and to pay all fees required by the city or other applicable
rule, law, or regulation. A permittee shall comply with all requirements of
local, state, and federal laws, including, but not limited to, Minn. Rules
Chapter 7560, as it may be amended from time to time. A permittee shall perform
all work in conformance with all applicable codes and established rules and
regulations, and is responsible for all work done in the right-of-way pursuant
to his or her permit, regardless of who does the work.
   (B)   Prohibited work. Except in an emergency, and with the approval of the
city, no right-of-way obstruction or excavation may be done when seasonally
prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable for such work.
   (C)   Interference with right-of-way. A permittee shall not so obstruct a
right-of-way that the natural free and clear passage of water through the
gutters or other waterways shall be interfered with. Private vehicles of those
doing work in the right-of-way may not be parked within or next to a permit
area, unless parked in conformance with city parking regulations. The loading
or unloading of trucks must be done solely within the defined permit area
unless specifically authorized by the permit.
   (D)   Trenchless excavation. As a condition of all applicable permits,
permittees employing trenchless excavation methods, including, but not limited
to, horizontal directional drilling, shall follow all requirements set forth in
M.S. Chapter 216D and Minn. Rules Chapter 7560, as they may be amended from
time to time, and shall require potholing or open cutting over existing
underground utilities before excavating, as determined by the Director.

§ 154.24 DENIAL OR REVOCATION OF PERMIT.
   (A)   Reasons for denial. The city may deny a permit for failure to meet the
requirements and conditions of this chapter or if the city determines that the
denial is necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public or
when necessary to protect the right-of-way and its current use.
   (B)   Procedural requirements. The denial or revocation of a permit must be
made in writing and must document the basis for the denial. The city must
notify the applicant or right-of-way user in writing within three business days
of the decision to deny or revoke a permit. If an application is denied, the
right-of-way user may address the reasons for denial identified by the city and
resubmit its application. If the application is resubmitted within 30 days of
receipt of the notice of denial, no additional application fee shall be
imposed. The city must approve or deny the resubmitted application within 30
days after submission.

§ 154.25 INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS.
   The excavation, backfilling, patching, and restoration, and all other work
performed in the right-of-way shall be done in conformance with Minn. Rules
parts 7819.1100 and 7819.5000, as they may be amended from time to time, and
other applicable local requirements, in so far as they are not inconsistent
with the M.S. §§ 237.162 and 237.163, as they may be amended from time to time.
Installation of service laterals shall be performed in accordance with Minn.
Rules Chapter 7560, as it may be amended from time to time, and these
ordinances. Service lateral installation is further subject to those
requirements and conditions set forth by the city in the applicable permits
and/or agreements.

§ 154.26 INSPECTION.
   (A)   Notice of completion. When the work under any permit hereunder is
completed, the permittee shall furnish a completion certificate in accordance
with Minn. Rules part 7819.1300, as it may be amended from time to time.
   (B)   Site inspection. The permittee shall make the work site available to
the city and to all others as authorized by law for inspection at all
reasonable times, in accordance with §
10.20, during the execution of and upon completion of the work.
   (C)   Authority of city personnel.
      (1)   At the time of inspection, city personnel may order the immediate
cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the life, health, safety,
or well-being of the public.
      (2)   City personnel may issue an order to the permittee for any work
that does not conform to the terms of the permit or other applicable standards,
conditions, or codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the
violation will be cause for revocation of the permit. Within ten days after
issuance of the order, the permittee shall present proof to city personnel that
the violation has been corrected. If such proof has not been presented within
the required time, city personnel may revoke the permit.

§ 154.27 WORK DONE WITHOUT A PERMIT.
   (A)   Emergency situations.
      (1)   Each right-of-way user shall immediately notify the director of any
event regarding its facilities that it considers to be an emergency. The right-
of-way user may proceed to take whatever actions are necessary to respond to
the emergency. Excavators’ notification to Gopher State One-Call regarding an
emergency situation does not fulfill this requirement. Within two business days
after the occurrence of the emergency, the right-of-way user shall apply for
the necessary permits, pay the fees associated therewith, and fulfill the rest
of the requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with this chapter
for the actions it took in response to the emergency.
      (2)   If the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding a right-of-way
user’s facilities, the city will attempt to contact the local representative of
each right-of-way user affected, or potentially affected, by the emergency. In
any event, the city may take whatever action it deems necessary to respond to
the emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the right-of-way user whose
facilities occasioned the emergency.
   (B)   Non-emergency situations. Except in an emergency, any person who,
without first having obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or excavates a
right-of-way must subsequently obtain a permit and, as a penalty, pay double
the normal fee for said permit, pay double all the other fees required by this
code, deposit with the city the fees necessary to correct any damage to the
right-of-way, and comply with all of the requirements of this chapter.
(Ord. passed 9-14-2021; Ord. passed 5-24-2022; Ord. passed 11-14-2023)
§ 154.28 SUPPLEMENTARY NOTIFICATION.
   If the obstruction or excavation of the right-of-way begins later or ends
sooner than the date given on the permit, the permittee shall notify the city
of the accurate information as soon as this information is known.
(Ord. passed 9-14-2021; Ord. passed 5-24-2022; Ord. passed 11-14-2023)
§ 154.29 REVOCATION OF PERMITS.
   (A)   Substantial breach. The city reserves its right, as provided herein,
to revoke any right-of-way permit without a fee refund, if there is a
substantial breach of the terms and conditions of any statute, ordinance, rule,
or regulation, or any material condition of the permit. A substantial breach by
permittee shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following:
      (1)   The violation of any material provision of the right-of-way permit;
      (2)   An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the right-
of-way permit, or the perpetuation or attempt to perpetuate any fraud or deceit
upon the city or its citizens;
      (3)   Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a
right-of-way permit;
      (4)   The failure to complete the work in a timely manner, unless a
permit extension is obtained or unless the failure to complete work is due to
reasons beyond the permittee’s control; or
      (5)   The failure to correct, in a timely manner, work that does not
conform to a condition indicated on an order issued.
   (B)   Written notice of breach. If the city determines that the permittee
has committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any statute,
ordinance, rule, regulation, or any condition of the permit, the city shall
make a written demand upon the permittee to remedy such violation. The demand
shall state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the
permit. A substantial breach, as stated in division (A) above, will allow the
city, at its discretion, to place additional or revised conditions on the
permit to mitigate and remedy the breach.
   (C)   Response to notice of breach. Within 24 hours of receiving
notification of the breach, permittee shall provide the city with a plan,
acceptable to the city, that will cure the breach. Permittee’s failure to so
contact the city, or permittee’s failure to timely submit an acceptable plan,
or permittee’s failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be
cause for immediate revocation of the permit. Further, permittee’s failure to
so contact the city, or permittee’s failure to submit an acceptable plan, or
permittee’s failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall
automatically place the permittee on probation for one full year.
   (D)   Cause for probation. From time to time, the city may establish a list
of conditions of the permit, which if breached, will automatically place the
permittee on probation for one full year, such as, but not limited to, working
out of the allotted time period or working on right-of-way grossly outside of
the permit authorization.
   (E)   Automatic revocation. If a permittee, while on probation, commits a
breach as outlined above, permittee’s permit will automatically be revoked, and
permittee will not be allowed further permits for one full year, except for
emergency repairs.
   (F)   Reimbursement of city costs. If a permit is revoked, the permittee
shall also reimburse the city for the city’s reasonable costs, including
restoration costs and the costs of collection and reasonable attorneys’ fees
incurred in connection with such revocation.

§ 154.30 MAPPING DATA.
   (A)   Information required. Each right-of-way user and permittee shall
provide mapping information required by the city in accordance with Minn. Rules
parts 7819.4000 and 7819.4100, as amended from time to time. Within 90 days
following completion of any work pursuant to a permit, the permittee shall
provide the Director accurate maps and drawings certifying the “as-built”
location of all equipment installed, owned, and maintained by the permittee.
Such maps and drawings shall include the horizontal and vertical location of
all facilities and equipment and shall be provided consistent with the city’s
electronic mapping system, when practical or as a condition imposed by the
Director. Failure to provide maps and drawings pursuant to this division (A)
shall be grounds for revoking the permit holder’s registration.
   (B)   Service laterals. All permits issued for the installation or repair of
service laterals, other than minor repairs as defined in Minn. Rules part
7560.0150, subp. 2, as it may be amended from time to time, shall require the
permittee’s use of appropriate means of establishing the horizontal locations
of installed service laterals and the service lateral vertical locations in
those cases where the director reasonably requires it. Permittees or their
subcontractors shall submit to the director evidence satisfactory to the
director of the installed service lateral locations. Compliance with this
division (B) and with applicable Gopher State One-Call law and Minn. Rules
governing service laterals installed after Dec. 31, 2005, shall be a condition
of any city approval necessary for:
      (1)   Payments to contractors working on a public improvement project,
including those under M.S. Chapter 429, as it may be amended from time to time;
and
      (2)   City approval under development agreements or other subdivision or
site plan approval under M.S. Chapter 462, as it may be amended from time to
time. The Director shall reasonably determine the appropriate method of
providing such information to the city. Failure to provide prompt and accurate
information on the service laterals installed may result in the revocation of
the permit issued for the work or future permits to the offending permittee or
its subcontractors.

§ 154.31 LOCATION AND RELOCATION OF FACILITIES.
   (A)   Placement, location, and relocation of facilities must comply with the
Act, with other applicable law, and with Minn. Rules parts 7819.3100,
7819.5000, and 7819.5100, as they may be amended from time to time, to the
extent the rules do not limit authority otherwise available to cities.
   (B)   If applicable, unless otherwise agreed in a franchise or other
agreement between the applicable right-of-way user and the city, facilities in
the right-of-way must be located or relocated and maintained underground in
accordance with any relevant section of the City Code.
   (C)   (1)   The city may assign a specific area within the right-of-way, or
any particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of facility
that is or, pursuant to current technology, the city expects will someday be
located within the right-of-way. All excavation, obstruction, or other permits
issued by the city involving the installation or replacement of facilities
shall designate the proper corridor for the facilities at issue.
      (2)   Any right-of-way user who has facilities in the right-of-way in a
position at variance with the corridors established by the city shall, no later
than at the time of the next reconstruction or excavation of the area where the
facilities are located, move the facilities to the assigned position within the
right-of-way, unless this requirement is waived by the city for good cause
shown, upon consideration of such factors as the remaining economic life of the
facilities, public safety, customer service needs, and hardship to the right-
of-way user.
   (D)   To protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public, or when
necessary to protect the right-of-way and its current use, the city shall have
the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional facilities
within the right-of-way. In making such decisions, the city shall strive to the
extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the right-
of-way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the public interest,
the public’s needs for the particular utility service, the condition of the
right-of-way, the time of year with respect to essential utilities, the
protection of existing facilities in the right-of-way, and future city plans
for public improvements and development projects which have been determined to
be in the public interest.

who has facilities or equipment in the area to be excavated shall mark the
horizontal and vertical placement of all said facilities. Any right-of-way user
whose facilities are less than 20 inches below a concrete or asphalt surface
shall notify and work closely with the excavation contractor to establish the
exact location of its facilities and the best procedure for excavation.

§ 154.33 DAMAGE TO OTHER FACILITIES.
   When the city does work in the right-of-way and finds it necessary to
maintain, support, or move a right-of-way user’s facilities to protect it, the
city shall notify the local representative as early as is reasonably possible.
The costs associated therewith will be billed to that right-of-way user and
must be paid within 30 days from the date of billing. Each right-of-way user
shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any facilities in the right-of-
way which it or its facilities damage. Each right-of-way user shall be
responsible for the cost of repairing any damage to the facilities of another
right-of-way user caused during the city’s response to an emergency occasioned
by that right-of-way user’s facilities.

§ 155.09 PLAT DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (A)   Roads. The design of all roads shall be considered in relation to
existing and planned roads, to reasonable circulation of traffic, topographical
conditions, to runoff of storm waters, and to the proposed uses of the areas to
be served.
      (1)   Where adjoining areas are not subdivided, the arrangement of roads
in new subdivisions shall make provisions for the proper projection of roads.
When a new subdivision adjoins unsubdivided land susceptible of being
subdivided, then the new road shall be carried to the boundaries of such
unsubdivided land. Where new roads extend existing adjoining roads, their
projections shall be at the same or greater width, but in no case, less than
the minimum required width.
      (2)   The minimum road design standards of the city, including road width
and grade standards, shall be observed by the subdivider, as set forth in §
155.16.
      (3)   Straight segments of at least 50 feet in length shall be introduced
between reverse curves on city streets and alleys.
      (4)   Insofar as practical, road intersections shall be at right angles
and no intersection shall be at an angle of less than 45 degrees. It must be
evidenced that safe and efficient traffic flow is encouraged.
      (5)   Private roads shall not be approved nor shall public improvements
be approved for any previously existing private road.
      (6)   Where a proposed plat is adjacent to a highway, the City Council
may require the subdivider to provide a service road along the right-of-way.
      (7)   The road arrangements shall not be such as to cause hardship to
owners of adjoining property in platting their own land and providing
convenient access to it.
      (8)   At road intersections, curb lines shall be rounded at a radius of
not less than 15 feet.
   (B)   Easements.
      (1)   Utility easements at least ten feet wide shall be provided for
utilities where necessary. They shall be centered on rear and other lot lines
or within alley rights-of-way. They shall have continuity of alignment from
block to block. At deflection points, easements for pole line anchors shall be
provided where necessary.
      (2)   Where a subdivision is traversed by a water course, drainage way,
channel, or road, there shall be provided a storm water easement or drainage
right-of-way substantially with the lines of such water course, together with
such further width or construction or both as will be adequate for stream
channel, but also adjoining areas that have been subject to flooding in years

§ 156.033 EARTH-SHELTERED BUILDINGS.
   (A)   Purpose. Earth-sheltered buildings located either below the existing
average ground level on a sloping lot or above the existing average ground
level prior to construction and covered over 50% of the building by earth,
create different development opportunities and challenges on a site-by-site
basis. Due to major differences between above-grade housing and earth-sheltered
buildings, the potential for soil erosion and slope failure and increased storm
water runoff from the development site, development of earth-sheltered building
shall be reviewed on a site-by-site basis and be required to comply with the
following standards.
   (B)   Minimum requirements.
      (1)   A landscaping plan shall be required. The purpose of landscaping
shall be to ensure maximum compatibility with adjacent above-ground housing and
to insure that no soil erosion occurs following the completion of the building.
The landscaping plan shall be a part of the zoning permit application. No
zoning permit shall be issued until a landscaping plan is submitted and
approved, or approved with conditions.
      (2)   Following the completion of all construction activities, soil
erosion shall not occur. All soil surface laid bare during construction shall
be promptly seeded and mulched to prevent erosion. Additional methods of
erosion control may be required where it is found that seeding and mulching
will not be sufficient. Where construction is completed at some time other than
during the growing season, the property owner shall protect against soil
erosion by appropriate means and shall seed all unvegetated ground at the
beginning of the next growing season.
      (3)   Where earth-sheltered buildings are developed on a naturally
occurring sloped site, the applicant shall evaluate the potential for slope

§ 156.051 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT.
   (A)   Types of PUDs permissible. Planned unit developments (PUDs) are
allowed for new projects on undeveloped land, redevelopment of previously built
sites, or conversions of existing buildings and land. The land use districts in
which they are an allowable use are identified in the land use district
descriptions in §
156.027 and the official zoning map.
   (B)   Processing of PUDs. Planned unit developments must be processed as a
conditional use. Approval cannot occur until the environmental review process
(EAW/EIS) is considered.
   (C)   Application for PUDs. The applicant for a PUD must submit the
following documents prior to final action being taken on the application
request:
      (1)   A site plan and/or a plat for the project showing locations of
property boundaries, existing and proposed structures and other facilities,

the floor plan for all commercial structures to be occupied; and
      (5)   Those additional documents, as requested by the Planning
Commission, necessary to explain how the PUD will be designed and will
function.
   (D)   Site “suitable area” evaluation. Proposed new PUDs or expansions to
existing PUDs must be evaluated using the following procedures and standards to
determine the suitable area for the dwelling unit/dwelling site density
evaluation. The suitable area is determined by excluding any wetlands, bluff
areas, or any area below the elevation of 1,339.38 feet as identified in
Chapter 153 (Storm Water Management).
   (E)   PUD density evaluation. Density evaluation is determined by the
limiting factors of the required 50% open space, 40% impervious surface
coverage, and the parking requirements found in § 155.031.
   (F)   Maintenance and design criteria.
      (1)   Maintenance and administration requirements. Before final approval
of a planned unit development, adequate provisions must be developed for
preservation and maintenance in perpetuity of open spaces and for the continued
existence and functioning of the development.
      (2)   Open space preservation. Deed restrictions, covenants, permanent
easements, public dedication and acceptance, or other equally effective and
permanent means must be provided to ensure long-term preservation and
maintenance of open space. The instruments must include all of the following
protections:

maintenance of all commonly owned property and facilities.
      (4)   Open space requirements. Planned unit developments must contain
open space meeting all of the following criteria.
         (a)   At least 50% of the total project area must be preserved as open
space.
         (b)   Dwelling units or sites, road rights-of-way, or land covered by
road surfaces, parking areas, or structures are developed areas and shall not
be included in the computation of minimum open space.
         (c)   Open space must include areas with physical characteristics
unsuitable for development in their natural state, and areas containing
significant historic sites or unplatted cemeteries.
         (d)   Open space may include outdoor recreational facilities for use
by owners of dwelling units or sites, by guests staying in commercial dwelling
units or sites, and by the general public.
         (e)   Open space may include subsurface sewage treatment systems if
the use of the space is restricted to avoid adverse impacts on the systems.
         (f)   Open space must not include commercial facilities or uses.
         (g)   The appearance of open space areas, including topography,
vegetation, and allowable uses, must be preserved by use of restrictive deed
covenants, permanent easements, public dedication and acceptance, or other
equally effective and permanent means.
      (5)   Erosion control and storm water management. Erosion control and
storm water management plans must be developed and the PUD must:
         (a)   Be designed, and the construction managed, to minimize the
likelihood of serious erosion occurring either during or after construction.
This goal must be accomplished by limiting the amount and length of time of
bare ground exposure. Erosion control plans approved by a soil and water
conservation district may be required if project size and site physical
characteristics warrant; and
         (b)   Be designed and constructed to effectively manage reasonably
expected quantities and qualities of storm water runoff. Impervious surface
coverage within any tier must not exceed 40% of the tier area.
      (6)   Centralization and design of facilities. Centralization and design
of facilities and structures must be done according to the following standards.
         (a)   A planned unit development must be connected to publicly owned
water supply and sewer systems, if available. On-site water supply and sewage
treatment systems must be centralized and designed and installed to meet or
exceed applicable standards or rules of the county. On-site sewage-treatment
systems must be located on the most suitable areas of the development, and
sufficient lawn area free of limiting factors must be provided for a
replacement soil treatment system for each sewage system.
         (b)   Dwelling units or sites must be clustered into one or more
groups and located on suitable areas of the development. They must be designed
and located to meet or exceed the setbacks in accordance with §
156.030.

§ 156.052 ADULT ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENTS.
   (A)   Purpose and intent.
      (1)   Studies conducted by the State Attorney General, the American
Planning Association, and cities such as St. Paul; Indianapolis; Alexandria,
Minnesota; Rochester, Minnesota; Phoenix, Arizona; Los Angeles, California;
Seattle, Washington; have studied the impacts that adult establishments have in
those communities. These studies have concluded that adult establishments have
an adverse impact on the surrounding neighborhoods. Those impacts include
increased crime rates, lower property values, increased transiency,
neighborhood blight and potential health risks. Based on these studies and
findings, the City Council concludes the following.
         (a)   Adult establishments have adverse secondary impacts of the types
set forth above.
         (b)   The adverse impacts caused by adult establishments tend to
diminish if adult establishments are governed by locational requirements,
licensing requirements, and health requirements.
         (c)   It is not the intent of the City Council to prohibit adult
establishments from having a reasonable opportunity to locate in the city.
         (d)   M.S. § 462.357, as it may be amended from time to time, allows
the city to adopt regulations to promote the public health, safety, morals, and
general welfare.
         (e)   The public health, safety, morals, and general welfare will be
promoted by the city adopting regulations governing adult establishments.
         (f)   Sexually oriented businesses can contribute to an increase in
criminal activity in the area in which such businesses are located, taxing city
crime-prevention programs and law enforcement services.
         (g)   Sexually oriented businesses can be used as fronts for
prostitution and other criminal activity. The experience of other cities
indicates that the proper management and operation of such businesses can,
however, minimize this risk, provided the owners and operators of such
facilities are regulated by licensing or other procedures.
         (h)   Sexually oriented businesses can increase the risk of exposure
to communicable diseases including, but not limited to, Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) for which currently there is no cure. Experiences of
other cities indicate that such businesses can facilitate the spread of
communicable diseases by virtue of the design and use of the premises, thereby
endangering not only the patrons of such establishments but also the general
public.
         (i)   Sexually oriented businesses can cause or contribute to public
health problems by the presence of live adult entertainment in conjunction with
food and/or drink and alcohol use on the same premises.
         (j)   The risk of criminal activity and/or public health problems can
be minimized through a licensing and regulatory scheme as prescribed herein.
      (2)   It is the purpose of this section to regulate adult-oriented
businesses to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the
citizens of the city and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to:
         (a)   Prevent additional criminal activity within the city;
         (b)   Prevent deterioration of neighborhoods and its consequent
adverse effect on real estate values of properties within the neighborhood;
         (c)   To locate adult oriented businesses away from residential areas,
schools, churches, and parks and playgrounds; and
         (d)   Prevent concentration of adult-oriented businesses within
certain areas of the city.
      (3)   The provisions of this section have neither the purpose nor effect
of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative
materials, including adult oriented materials. Similarly, it is neither the
intent nor effect of this section to restrict or deny access by adults to adult
oriented materials protected by the First Amendment or to deny access by
distributors and exhibitors of adult oriented entertainment to their intended
market.

§ 156.055 WIRELESS COMMUNICATION FACILITIES.
   (A)   Purpose. Establish regulations that protect the public health, safety,
and general welfare of the community, for the siting, construction, and
maintenance of wireless communication towers (WCT) and similar facilities
within the city. This does not pertain to amateur radio, or receive only
antennas or structures.
   (B)   Objectives. The regulations of this section are intended to:
      (1)   Maximize the use of existing approved structures for siting new
antennas in order to reduce the number of new towers needed to serve the
community;
      (2)   Provide for the appropriate location and development of antennas
and towers within the city;
      (3)   Minimize adverse visual effects of wireless communication towers
through siting standards; and
      (4)   Utilize standard structural and setback requirements to avoid
potential damage to adjacent properties from antenna and tower failure.
   (C)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning.
      ANTENNA. Any device or equipment used for the transmission or reception
of electromagnetic waves, which may include omni-directional antenna,
directional antenna, or parabolic antenna.
      CO-LOCATION. The location of more than one antenna or set of antennas on
the same wireless communication tower or structure.
      ENGINEER. Any person practicing as a professional engineer shall be duly
licensed and certified under the guidelines stipulated in M.S. Chapter 326, as
it may be amended from time to time, for their particular field.
      FAA. Federal Aviation Administration.
      FCC. Federal Communication Commission.
      HEIGHT. The distance measured from the ground level at the base of the
tower or structure to the highest point on a tower or structure.
      TOWER. Any structure that is designed and constructed primarily for the
purpose of supporting one or more antennas, such as monopoles and similar
structures.
      TOWER ACCESSORY STRUCTURE. Any structure located at the base of a tower
for housing receiving or transmitting equipment.
      WIRELESS COMMUNICATION. Any personal wireless services as defined in the
Federal Communications Act of 1996, being 47 U.S.C. §§ 151 et seq., including
FCC licensed commercial wireless telecommunications services such as cellular,
personal communication services (PCS), paging, and similar services that
currently exist or may be developed.
   (D)   Conditional use. Wireless communication towers and similar facilities
are a conditional use within all zoning districts subject to the following
performance standards.
      (1)   Permit required. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or
corporation to erect, construct, place, replace, or structurally repair any
wireless communication tower or adjoining/accessory buildings without first
making application to the Zoning Administrator and securing appropriate permit
approval. Building permits are not required for adjustment or replacement of
the elements of an antenna array affixed to a tower or antenna. All
applications shall be accompanied by a coverage/interference and capacity
analysis, including a technical evaluation of existing and proposed
transmissions indicating all potential interference problems including, but not
limited to, residential broadcast reception and public safety communications.
All applications must demonstrate compliance with existing FCC, FAA, the State
Building Code, and other pertinent regulations. As regulations change, wireless
communication operators must demonstrate continued compliance at their expense.
All subsequent co-locators must apply for individual building and conditional
use permits in conformance to this chapter.
      (2)   Permitted locations. No wireless communication tower shall be
erected in the city unless the applicant demonstrates that the equipment
planned for the purpose of the proposed wireless communication cannot be
accommodated on the existing or approved tower, building, or structure within a
one-mile search radius of the proposed tower due to one or more of the
following reasons.
         (a)   The planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity of
the existing or approved structure, as documented by a qualified and licensed
professional engineer; and the existing or approved structure cannot be
reinforced, modified, or replaced to accommodate planned or equivalent
equipment at a reasonable cost.
         (b)   The planned equipment would cause interference materially
impacting the usability of other existing or planned equipment at the tower or
building as documented by a qualified and licensed professional engineer, and
the interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost.
         (c)   Existing or approved wireless communication towers and buildings
within the search radius cannot accommodate the planned equipment at a height
necessary to function reasonably as documented by a qualified and licensed
professional engineer.
         (d)   Other unforeseen reasons that make it impossible to locate the
planned equipment upon an existing or approved structure.
   (E)   Design standards. All applications must meet the following minimum
requirements.
      (1)   All towers and antennas shall comply with all FCC and FAA rules and
regulations. Wireless communication towers attached to a building or existing
structure shall comply with the setbacks of the zoning district and shall not
exceed 20 feet in height beyond the top of the primary structure. Free-standing
towers shall be set back one foot from any property line or building for each
one foot of structural height. Free-standing towers shall not be located in a
front yard, nor shall any part of the antenna or tower extend across or over
any part of the public right-of-way, street, highway, or sidewalk. The base of
any free-standing tower or antenna shall occupy not more than 500 square feet
and the top of the tower shall be no larger than the base.
      (2)   Towers and antennae shall be designed to blend into the surrounding
environment through the use of color and camouflaging architectural treatment,
except in instances where the color is dictated by federal or state authorities
such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
      (3)   Towers shall be without the use of wires, cables, beams, or other,
the design shall utilize a monopole configuration that is designed to collapse
in on itself in the event of structural damage. Design and installation of
towers and antennas shall comply with all applicable federal and state
standards, including FCC and FAA standards and the current State Building Code,
and shall be approved and stamped by a licensed professional structural
engineer. The City Council may allow an alternative tower design if it would
better blend into the surrounding neighborhood.
      (4)   Towers shall be designed to allow the future co-location of
equipment at varying heights. Tower operators are required to accept co-
location of communication equipment if reasonable and necessary and shall not
make such co-location economically prohibitive. Towers over 150 feet in height
shall be designed for co-location of at least three additional antennas. Towers
of 125 feet to less than 150 feet shall be designed for co-location of at least
two additional antennas. Towers of 100 feet to less than 125 feet shall be
designed for co-location of at least one additional antenna. Subsequent co-
locators are subject to the same provisions and procedures as the primary
conditional use applicant.
      (5)   Towers shall not be illuminated by artificial means unless such
light is required by federal (FAA) or state regulations; towers may be used to
illuminate ball fields, parking lots, or similar areas and for crime
preventative measures.
      (6)   The use of any portion of a tower for signs other than required
warning or equipment information is prohibited. All mechanical and utility
equipment shall be enclosed in an approved structure or cabinet; all buildings
and structures shall meet the minimum performance standards in that zoning
district.
      (7)   The ground level perimeter may be required to be screened with pre-
approved landscaping and/or fencing at the operator’s expense. The tower shall
be reasonably protected against unauthorized access and vandalism.
      (8)   All construction, installation, wiring, and maintenance of towers
shall not create a safety hazard or damage to the property of others, nor
interfere with public safety communications.
      (9)   Operators shall remove abandoned, unused towers and similar
structures within 12 months of the cessation of operations and restore the area
to its original condition. Failure to abide by this condition will result in
the city removing the structure and assessing costs to the property or
operator.
      (10)   All wireless communication facilities that are in existence as of
the date of this chapter may continue to operate, but may not be replaced or
structurally altered without complying in all respects to this code. This does
not include routine adjustment or replacement of the primary or co-location
antennae.
      (11)   When the property’s use no longer conforms to this chapter, any
existing tower shall be removed prior to preliminary plat approval or building
permit issuance, whichever occurs first.

§ 156.056 SHORT-TERM VACATION HOME RENTALS.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose is to provide rules governing the issuance of
permits and the establishment of operational restrictions for short-term
rentals of dwellings within the city. The intent of this chapter is to ensure
that the operation of short-term rentals is consistent with existing local,
state, or federal laws, statutes, rules, or regulations. For the purposes of
this chapter, SHORT-TERM RENTAL means any single-family dwelling or accessory
dwelling unit located in a residential or commercial zone that is rented in
whole or in part on a short-term basis. A SHORT-TERM BASIS is 30 calendar days
or less to the same person. This term does not include bed and breakfasts,
motels, hotels, or resort rooms.
   (B)   Permit required. It is unlawful for any person to advertise, maintain,
or operate a short-term rental of a dwelling in the city without a permit
required by this chapter. Permits are required for any unit. UNITS are
considered any single-family home, apartment, and/or cabin.
   (C)   Term and scope of permit. A short-term rental permit expires on
December 31 of each year. The permit authorizes the permittee to conduct only
such services as is described in the permit and in accordance with the terms
and conditions of the permit. It is unlawful for a permittee or other
responsible person to violate the terms and conditions of the short-term rental
permit.
   (D)   Application and renewal of short-term rentals.
      (1)   A property owner may apply for a short-term rental permit by filing
an application with the Clerk/Treasurer. Applications are subject to limits
described in division (F) below. Prior to filing an application with the city,
the property owner must first file and receive their license from the county.
The application must be on a form approved by the city and may require any
information or documentation consistent with the provisions of this chapter.
Such application shall include, but not be limited to, the following
information:
         (a)   Name, address, and telephone number of permittee;
         (b)   Name, address, and 24-hour telephone number(s) of permittee and
secondary point of contact, if permittee is not located on-site;
         (c)   Floor plan, parking location(s), copy of county license, and
proof of insurance; and
         (d)   Any supplemental information that the city finds reasonably
necessary to determine whether to approve a short-term rental permit.
      (2)   To renew a short-term rental permit, the permittee shall file an
application with the city that complies with this division (D). The application
must be submitted no later than 30 calendar days prior to the short-term rental
permit expiration date.
      (3)   Knowingly making a false statement of fact or knowingly omitting
any information that is required in an application for a short-term rental
permit shall be grounds for denial of a permit.
   (E)   Permit fee. Every permit application shall be accompanied by a non-
refundable short-term rental permit application fee as established by
resolution of the City Council, as may be amended from time to time. This
application fee shall be in addition to any other license, permit fee, or
penalty fee imposed by local, state, or federal laws, statutes, rules, or
regulations.
   (F)   Limitation of number of short-term rentals per property parcel.
      (1)   While each unit must be permitted, short-term rental limitations
will be determined by property parcels. PROPERTY PARCEL means any contiguous
quantity of land in the possession of, owned by, or recorded as the property of
the same claimant or person.
      (2)   The number of property parcels will be limited to 3% of the city’s
total housing units as recorded by the 2020 census report plus any additional
number of units built since the census report.
      (3)   No more than two property parcels can be owned by one person for
use as a short-term rental. Ownership includes anyone with a financial interest
in the property.
      (4)   Although they would still need a permit, not counted in the total
number of property parcels will be property owners that are primary residents
of the property and it will be rented for less than 30 days in a calendar year.
If there are multi-units on the property, all units are combined for the
determination of days rented. PRIMARY RESIDENT means the dwelling unit within
which a person lives for six months plus a day during a calendar year and the
resident is classified as residential homestead in the county property tax
system.
   (G)   Registry required. Every permittee within the city shall keep a
register containing the following information for each person who stays at the
short-term rental and shall maintain such register for a period of 18 months.
The owner or registered agent shall make the list available to city staff and/
or law enforcement upon request.
      (1)   Name;
      (2)   Address;
      (3)   Vehicle year, make, model, color;
      (4)   License plate;
      (5)   State in which the vehicle is registered;
      (6)   Date of arrival;
      (7)   Date of departure;
      (8)   Number of guests; and
      (9)   Pets must be on a leash unless yard is fenced in.
   (H)   Performance standards.
      (1)   The main rental contact/person renting from the permittee must be a
minimum of 21 years of age.
      (2)   The occupancy limit will be determined through the county
application for short-term vacation rentals, but the maximum allowed on any
property parcel within the city will be 15 overnight guests even if the county
license allows more.
      (3)   Unregistered guests are allowed on a limited basis and must leave
the property by 10:00 p.m. any night of the week.
      (4)   The total number of guests, registered or unregistered, cannot
exceed double the occupancy limit the property is licensed for through the
city.
      (5)   Prior to the issuance of a short-term rental permit, the permittee
shall notify all owners of property within 350 feet of the permitted short-term
rental involved in the application. This notice shall be in writing and contain
the location of the short-term rental the contact information for the permittee
and the permittee’s designated secondary contact.
      (6)   The permittee or designated secondary contact must be able to be
on-site and respond to any complaints within 30 minutes of notification,

   (B)   The Board of Adjustment shall act upon all questions as they may arise
in the administration of this chapter, including the interpretation of zoning
maps, and it shall hear and decide appeals from and review any order,

action is in conformity with the terms of the chapter, reverse or affirm,
wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision, or
determination as in its opinion ought to be made in the premises and to that
end shall have all the powers of the Zoning Officer from whom the appeal was
taken and may issue or direct the issuance of a permit. The concurring vote of
a majority of the members of the Board shall be necessary to reverse any order,
requirement, decision, or determination of the Zoning Officer, or to decide in

this chapter, or to effect any variation in the application of this chapter.
The reason for the Board’s decision shall be stated in written findings. Any
aggrieved person shall have the right to appeal to the District Court for the
county.
   (E)   The Board of Adjustment shall have power to vary or adapt the strict
application of any of the requirements of this chapter in the case of

§ 156.073 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Criteria for granting variances may only be in accordance with M.S.
Chapter 462, as it may be amended from time to time, as applicable. A variance
to the provision of the zoning ordinance may be issued to provide relief to the
landowner in those zones where the chapter imposes. A landowner must meet the

      (1)   The property in question cannot be put to a reasonable use if used
under conditions allowed by the official controls.
      (2)   The plight of the landowner is due to circumstances unique to the
property not created by the landowner.
      (3)   The deviation from this chapter, with any attached conditions, will
still be in keeping with the spirit and intent of the chapter.
      (4)   The variance will not create a land use not permitted in the zone.
      (5)   The variance will not alter the essential character of the city/
locality.
      (6)   The variance is not for economic reasons alone.
   (B)   The person applying for a variance shall fill out and submit to the
Zoning Officer a completed variance application form, any additional
information reasonably requested by the Planning Commission or the Zoning
Officer and a fee to be set by the City Council by ordinance. If the work will
not be completed in one year, the applicant shall submit a time schedule for
completion of the work. The Zoning Officer shall determine if the application
is complete prior to referring the application to the Planning Commission along
with a staff report. The Planning Commission shall review the application; make
findings of fact and recommendations. The Commission’s recommendation shall be
presented to the City Council, acting in its capacity as the Board of
Adjustment.
   (C)   The Board of Adjustment shall hold a public hearing on the proposal
after notification of the date, time, and place of the hearing is published in
the city’s official newspaper at least ten days before the hearing. In
addition, persons who own property situated wholly or partly within 350 feet of
the affected parcel or parcels shall receive similar, individual notifications
by mail. The petitioner or his or her representative shall appear before the
Board of Adjustment in order to answer questions concerning the proposed
variance. The Board of Adjustment shall make findings of fact and approve or
deny a request for a variance within 60 days after receipt of the complete
application. A variance of this chapter shall be made by simple majority vote.
If it grants the variance, the City Council, acting in its capacity as the
Board of Adjustment, may impose conditions (including time limits) it considers
necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare, and such
conditions may include a time limit for the use to exist or operate. No
variance shall be granted which would allow any use that is prohibited in the
zoning district in which the subject property is located.

§ 156.074 CONDITIONAL USES.
   (A)   A CONDITIONAL USE is a use that is permitted within the applicable
zoning district but which may be, or could become, incompatible under certain
conditions with adjacent uses or generally with other uses within the
applicable zoning district. As a result, a public review shall be required
before the land may be used for the specified purpose. Review of the proposed
site design, and conditions on the use of the property or lot under
consideration, may be added before approval is granted.
   (B)   The applicant shall complete and submit to the Zoning Officer a
conditional use permit application form, any additional information reasonably
requested by the Planning Commission or the Zoning Officer, and a fee to be set
by the City Council by ordinance. The Zoning Officer shall determine if the
application is complete prior to setting a hearing date and time and referring
the application to the Planning Commission. The Board of Adjustments shall hold
a public hearing on the proposal after notification of the date, time, and
place of the hearing is published in the city’s official newspaper at least ten
days before the hearing. In addition, persons who own property situated wholly
or partly within 350 feet of the affected parcel or parcels shall receive
similar, individual notifications by mail. The petitioner or his or her
representative shall appear before the Planning Commission in order to answer
questions concerning the proposed conditional use permit. The Commission’s
recommendation shall be presented to the City Council. The City Council shall
make findings of fact and approve or deny a request for a conditional use
permit within 60 days after receipt of the complete application. If it grants
the permit, the City Council impose conditions it considers necessary to
protect the public health, safety, and welfare, and such conditions may include
a time limit for the use to exist or operate.
   (C)   An accurate property description and a site design plan showing
existing or proposed buildings, streets, access parking spaces, signs, and
landscaping screening plans shall be required to be submitted along with the
application form.
   (D)   The Planning Commission shall recommend a conditional use permit and
the City Council order the issuance of such permit only if it finds that such
use at the proposed location:
      (1)   Will be harmonious with the comprehensive plan of the city and this
chapter;
      (2)   Will be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained so as to be
harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the existing or intended
character of the surrounding area and will not change the essential character
of that area;
      (3)   Will not be hazardous, unhealthy, or unsafe to existing or future
neighboring uses;
      (4)   Will be served adequately by essential public facilities and
services, including streets, police and fire protection, drainage structures,
refuse disposal, water and sewer systems, and schools;
      (5)   Will not create excessive additional requirements at public cost
for public facilities and services and will not be detrimental to the economic
welfare of the community;
      (6)   Will not involve uses, activities, processes, materials, equipment,
and conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any persons, property,
or the general welfare because of excessive production of or offensive traffic,
noise, smoke, fumes, dust, glare, vibrations, odors, or other pollutants;
      (7)   Will have vehicular approaches to the property which are so
designed as not to create traffic congestion or an interference with traffic on
surrounding public thoroughfares;
      (8)   Will not result in the destruction, loss, or damage of a natural,
scenic, or historic feature of major importance; and
      (9)   Will be compatible with surrounding buildings, circulation, open
space, landscaping, parking, and compatible with existing natural topography,
natural water courses, vegetation, exposure to sunlight and wind, and views.
   (E)   In recommending or approving any conditional use permit, the Planning
and Zoning Commission and the City Council may impose conditions which it
considers necessary to meet the standards of this chapter and to protect the
best interests of the surrounding area or the city as a whole. Such conditions
as are imposed shall bind any successors and shall not be affected by any
subsequent transfer of ownership. Violation of any such condition is a
violation of this chapter. These conditions may include, but are not limited
to, the following:
      (1)   Ingress and egress modifications to the property and proposed
structures thereon with particular reference to vehicle and pedestrian safety
and convenience, traffic flow and control, and access in case of fire or other
catastrophe;
      (2)   Changes to off-street parking and loading areas where required with
particular attention to the related noise, glare, or odor effects on nearby
property;
      (3)   Changes to refuse and service with particular attention to ingress
and egress;
      (4)   Modification in utility plans with reference to location,
availability, and compatibility;
      (5)   The addition of fencing, screening, landscaping, or other
facilities to protect or buffer abutting or adjacent property;
      (6)   Modification to proposed signs, if any, and proposed exterior
lighting with reference to glare, traffic safety, and compatibility and harmony
with properties in the district;
      (7)   Changes in required yards and other open space; and/or
      (8)   Controls on the hours of operation of all or portions of a
particular use.
   (F)   (1)   Application for changes in the conditions or site design plan of
an approved conditional use permit shall be required. The City Council may
approve, disapprove, or approve with conditions, the application. Approval of
the changes by the City Council shall be granted before on-site changes or
developments are permitted. A public hearing before the City Council shall be
held where a public hearing was required for approval of the original proposal
and application. Changes in the approved site plan, submitted as part of the
conditional use permit application, involving minor changes in the following
may be authorized by the Zoning Officer for good cause shown:
         (a)   The location and alignment of buildings not to exceed ten feet
and that meet all other ordinance requirements;
         (b)   Other minor revisions in the shape of structures and still
meeting all other ordinance requirements; or
         (c)   Adding accessory structures not exceeding 5% of the total floor
area of all structures on the property and meeting all other ordinance
requirements.
      (2)   The Zoning Officer, however, may refer such proposed changes to the
site plan to the Planning Commission for review if the proposed changes do not
appear to fit clearly into one of the above three options, or where proposed
changes appear to change or compromise conditions placed on the applicant at
the time of approval of the conditional use and site plan by the City Council.
   (G)   If the Planning Commission recommends denial of a conditional use
permit, or the City Council orders such denial, it shall include in its
recommendations or determination findings as to the ways in which the proposed
use does not comply with the standards required by this chapter.
