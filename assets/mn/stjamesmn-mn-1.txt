of ordinances, all future amendments to any state, or federal, rules and
statutes adopted by reference in this code, or referenced in this code, are
hereby adopted by reference, or referenced as if they had been in existence at
the time this code was adopted, unless there is clear intention expressed in
the code to the contrary.
   (B)   It is the intention of the City Council that, when adopting the code
of ordinances, all future supplements are hereby adopted as if they had been in
existence at the time this code was enacted, unless there is clear intention
expressed in the code to the contrary.
§ 10.20 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Any licensed peace officer of the city’s Police Department, or the
County Sheriff, or any Deputy Sheriff, shall have the authority to enforce any
provision of this code.
   (B)   As permitted by M.S. § 626.862, as it may be amended from time to
time, the City Clerk-Treasurer shall have the authority to administer, and
enforce, this code. In addition, under that statutory authority, certain
individuals designated within the code, or by the City Clerk-Treasurer or City
Council, shall have the authority to administer, and enforce, the provisions
specified. All, and any, person, or persons, designated may issue a citation in
lieu of arrest, or continued detention, to enforce any provision of the code.
   (C)   The City Clerk-Treasurer, and any city official or employee designated
by this code who has the responsibility to perform a duty under this code, may,
with the permission of a licensee of a business, or owner of any property, or
resident of a dwelling, or other person in control of any premises, inspect, or
otherwise enter, any property to enforce compliance with this code.
   (D)   If the licensee, owner, resident, or other person in control of a
premises objects to the inspection of, or entrance to, the property, the City
Clerk-Treasurer, peace officer, or any employee, or official, charged with the
duty of enforcing the provisions of this code may, upon a showing that probable
cause exists for the issuance of a valid search warrant from a court of
competent jurisdiction, petition, and obtain, a search warrant before
conducting the inspection, or otherwise entering the property. This warrant
shall be only to determine whether the provisions of this code enacted to
protect the health, safety, and welfare of the people are being complied with,
and to enforce these provisions only, and no criminal charges shall be made as
a result of the warrant. No warrant shall be issued unless there be probable
cause to issue the warrant. Probable cause occurs if the search is reasonable.
Probable cause does not depend on specific knowledge of the condition of a
particular property.
   (E)   Every licensee, owner, resident, or other person in control of
property within the city shall permit, at reasonable times, inspections of, or
entrance to, the property by the City Clerk-Treasurer, or any other authorized
city officer or employee, only to determine whether the provisions of this code
enacted to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the people are being
complied with, and to enforce these provisions. Unreasonable refusal to permit
the inspection of, or entrance to, the property shall be grounds for
termination of any, and all, permits, licenses, or city service to the
property. Mailed notice shall be given to the licensee, owner, resident, or
other person in control of the property, stating the grounds for the
termination, and the licensee, owner, resident, or other person in control of
the property shall be given an opportunity to appear before the City Clerk-
Treasurer to object to the termination before it occurs, subject to appeal of
the City Clerk-Treasurer’s decision to the City Council at a regularly
scheduled, or special, meeting.
   (F)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of
the city to enter private property in urgent emergency situations where there
is an imminent danger in order to protect the public health, safety, and
welfare.
§ 10.98 SUPPLEMENT ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES.
   (A)   In addition to those administrative penalties established in this
code, and the enforcement powers granted in §
10.20, the City Council is authorized to create, by resolution, adopted by a
majority of the members of the Council, supplemental administrative penalties.
The resolution may not proscribe administrative penalties for traffic offenses
designated by M.S. § 169.999, as it may be amended from time to time.
   (B)   These administrative penalty procedures in this section are intended
to provide the public, and the city, with an informal, cost effective, and
expeditious alternative to traditional criminal charges for violations of
certain provisions of this code. The procedures are intended to be voluntary on
the part of those who have been charged with those offenses.
   (C)   Administrative penalties for violations of various provisions of the
code, other than those penalties established in the code, or in statutes that
are adopted by reference, may be established from time to time by resolution of
a majority of the members of the City Council. In order to be effective, an
administrative penalty for a particular violation must be established before
the violation occurred.
   (D)   In the discretion of the peace officer, City Clerk-Treasurer, or other
person giving notice of an alleged violation of a provision of this code, in a
written notice of an alleged violation, sent by first class mail to the person
who is alleged to have violated the code, the person giving notice may request
the payment of a voluntary administrative penalty for the violation directly to
the City Clerk-Treasurer within 14 days of the notice of the violation. In the
sole discretion of the person giving the notice of the alleged violation, the
time for payment may be extended an additional 14 days, whether or not
requested by the person to whom the notice has been given. In addition to the
administrative penalty, the person giving notice may request in the notice to
the alleged violator to adopt a compliance plan to correct the situation
resulting in the alleged violation, and may provide that, if the alleged
violator corrects the situation resulting in the alleged violation within the
time specified in the notice, that the payment of the administrative penalty
will be waived.
   (E)   At any time before the payment of the administrative penalty is due,
the person who has been given notice of an alleged violation may request to
appear before the City Council to contest the request for payment of the
penalty. After a hearing before the Council, the Council may determine to
withdraw the request for payment, or to renew the request for payment. Because
the payment of the administrative penalty is voluntary, there shall be no
appeal from the decision of the Council.
   (F)   At any time after the date the payment of the administrative penalty
is due, if the administrative penalty remains unpaid, or the situation creating
the alleged violation remains uncorrected, the city, through its Attorney, may
bring criminal charges in accordance with state law and this code. Likewise,
the city, in its discretion, may bring criminal charges in the first instance,
rather than requesting the payment of an administrative penalty, even if a
penalty for the particular violation has been established by Council
resolution. If the administrative penalty is paid, or if any requested
correction of the situation resulting in the violation is completed, no
criminal charges shall be initiated by the city for the alleged violation.
§ 10.99 GENERAL PENALTY AND ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Any person, firm, or corporation who violates any provision of this
code, for which another penalty is not specifically provided, shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor. The penalty, which may be imposed for
any crime which is a misdemeanor under this code, including state statutes
specifically adopted by reference, shall be a sentence of not more than 90
days, or a fine of not more than $1,000, or both.
   (B)   Any person, firm, or corporation who violates any provision of this
code, including state statutes specifically adopted by reference, which is
designated to be a petty misdemeanor, shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a
petty misdemeanor. The penalty, which may be imposed for any petty offense
which is a petty misdemeanor, shall be a sentence of a fine of not more than
$300.
   (C)   Pursuant to M.S. § 631.48, as it may be amended from time to time, in
either the case of a misdemeanor or a petty misdemeanor, the costs of
prosecution may be added. A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon
each day during which a violation occurs, or continues.
   (D)   The failure of any officer, or employee, of the city to perform any
official duty imposed by this code shall not subject the officer, or employee,
to the penalty imposed for a violation.
   (E)   In addition to any penalties provided for in this section, or in §
10.98, if any person, firm, or corporation fails to comply with any provision
of this code, the Council, or any city official designated by it, may institute
appropriate proceedings at law, or at equity, to restrain, correct, or abate
the violation.

requirement of the city code relative thereto, or any connection therewith;
   (B)   Any charge for a municipal utility service, or any other financial

recordings, or calculations, it shall be reinstalled, and the deposit shall be
retained by the city to defray the cost of the test.

§ 50.26 BILLING ERRORS.
   When a customer has been overcharged, or undercharged, as a result of
incorrect reading of the meter, incorrect application of the rate schedule,
incorrect connection of the meter, application of an incorrect multiplier, or
constant, or similar, reasons, the amount of the overcharge shall be refunded
to the customer, or the amount of the undercharge may be billed to the
customer. The refund, or charge, in no event shall exceed one year, unless the
date the error occurred can be fixed with reasonable certainty, in which case
the refund overcharge shall be computed from that date, but in no event for a
period longer than one year. The refund may be in either cash, or credit on the

§ 51.01 DEFICIENCY OF WATER, AND SHUTTING OFF WATER.
   The city is not liable for any deficiency, or failure, in the supply of
water to customers, whether occasioned by shutting the water off for the
purpose of making repairs or connections, or by any other cause whatever. In
case of fire, or alarm of fire, water may be shut off to ensure a supply for
fire fighting. In making repairs to maintain the service pipe, or construction
of new works, the water supply may be shut off at any time, and kept off so
long as may be necessary.
(Prior Code, § 3.30) (Ord. 192, second series, passed 1-3-2006)
§ 51.02 REPAIR OF LEAKS.
   It is the responsibility of the property owner to repair any leaks, or to
make any other repairs from the curb stop, including the curb stop into the
house, or other building. In case of failure upon the part of any consumer, or
owner, to repair any leak occurring in his or her service pipe within 24 hours
after oral, or written, notice has been given to the owner, or occupant, of the
premises, the water may be shut off, and will not be turned on until a
reconnection charge has been paid, and the water service has been repaired.
When the waste of water is great, or when damage is likely to result from the
leak, the water will be turned off if the repair is not proceeded with
immediately. The city will fix any service line rupture leak of a water service
line from the water main to the curb stop, not to include the curb stop.
(Prior Code, § 3.30) (Ord. 199, second series, passed 8-15-2006)
§ 51.03 ABANDONED SERVICES.
   All service installations connected to the water system that have been
abandoned, or, for any reason, have become useless for further service, shall
be disconnected at the main. The owner of the premises, served by this service,
shall pay the cost of excavation. The city shall perform the actual
disconnection, and all pipe, and appurtenances, removed from the street right-
of-way shall become the property of the city. When new buildings are erected on
the site of old ones, and it is desired to increase the old water service, a
new permit shall be taken out, and the regular tapping charge shall be made as
if this were a new service. It is unlawful for any person to cause, or allow,
any service pipe to be hammered, or squeezed together at the ends, to stop the
flow of water, or to save expense in proper removal of the pipe from the main.
Also, improper disposition thereof shall be corrected by the city, and the cost
incurred shall be borne by the person causing, or allowing, the work to be
performed. If unique circumstances arise, the Council may consider waiving the
requirements of this section.
(Prior Code, § 3.30) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 51.04 SERVICE PIPES.
   Every service pipe must be laid in a manner as to prevent rupture by
settlement. The service pipe shall be placed not less than seven feet below the
surface in all cases, so arranged as to prevent rupture, and stoppage by
freezing. Frozen service pipes between the main and the building shall be the
responsibility of the owner. Service pipes must extend from the curb stops to
the inside of the building. A valve, the same size as the service pipe, shall
be placed close to the inside wall of the building, ahead of the meter and
valve on the outlet side of meter, and also to be well protected from freezing.
Joints on copper tubing shall be flared or compressed, and kept to a minimum.
Not more than one joint shall be used for a service up to 70 feet in length.
All water main taps shall use an approved tapping sleeve when connecting to a
city water main. All water main taps, and service pipe joints, shall be left
uncovered until inspected. A notice requesting inspection shall be given far
enough ahead of time as to allow city staff to schedule a time to view. Minimum
size connection with the water mains shall be one inch in diameter on all new
water services. Type K copper or approved material shall be required from the
main tap to the curb stop. A tracer wire shall be installed along the same
installation route on all new water services that are not copper. The tracer
wire shall be installed to provide the ability to access a connection to the
tracer wire in the manner to allow connecting to a locator device.
(Prior Code, § 3.30)
§ 51.05 PRIVATE WATER SUPPLIES.
   No water pipe of the city water system shall be connected with any pump,
well, pipe, tank, or any device that is connected with any other source of
water supply, and when such are found, the city shall notify the owner, or
occupant, to disconnect the same and, if not immediately done, the city water
shall be turned off. Before any new connections to the city system are
permitted, the city shall ascertain that no cross-connections will exist when
the new connection is made. When a building is connected to city water, the
private water supply may be used only for such purposes as the city may allow.
(Prior Code, § 3.30)
§ 51.06 PRIVATE WATER SUPPLIES AND WELL PROHIBITED.
   (A)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply

supply within the city. Any private water supply system which is in place, and
operational, as of the date of this section, shall be subject to this section
only in the event that his or her current well system shall fail.
   (C)   Any violation of this section shall constitute a misdemeanor.
(Ord. 37, third series, passed 7-5-2016) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 51.07 PRIVATE FIRE HOSE CONNECTIONS.
   Owners of structures with self-contained fire protection systems may apply
for, and obtain, permission to connect the street mains with hydrants, large
pipes, and hose couplings, for use in case of fire only, at their own
installation expense, and at the rates as the Council may adopt by resolution
as herein provided.
(Prior Code, § 3.30)
§ 51.08 OPENING HYDRANTS.
   It is unlawful for any person, other than members of the Fire Department, or
other person duly authorized by the city, in pursuance of lawful purpose, to
open any fire hydrant, or attempt to draw water from the same, or in any manner
interfere therewith. It is also unlawful for any person so authorized to
deliver, or suffer to be delivered, to any other person any hydrant key or
wrench, except for the purposes strictly pertaining to their lawful use.

flows, the design, installation, and maintenance of the facilities, and
equipment, shall be made at the owners’ expense, and shall be subject to the
review, and approval, of the city pursuant to the requirements of the MPCA.
   (G)   It is unlawful for any user to increase the use of process water or,
in any manner, attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial, or complete,
substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations
contained herein, or contained in the National Categorical Pretreatment
Standards, or any state requirements.
   (H)   Where pretreatment, or flow-equalizing, facilities are provided, or
required, for any waters, or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in
satisfactory, and effective, operation at the expense of the owner.
   (I)   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the Wastewater Superintendent, they are necessary for the proper
handling of liquid wastes containing floatable grease in excessive amounts, as
specified herein, any flammable wastes, as specified herein, sand, or other
harmful ingredients; except, that the interceptors shall not be required for
private living quarters, or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of the
type to be readily, and easily, accessible for cleaning and inspection. In the
maintaining of these interceptors, the owner shall be responsible for the
proper removal, and disposal, of the captured materials by appropriate means,
and shall maintain a record of dates, and means of disposal, which are subject
to review by the Wastewater Superintendent. Any removal, and hauling, of the
collected materials not performed by the owner’s personnel must be performed by
a currently licensed waste disposal firm.
   (J)   Where required by the city, the owner of any property serviced by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable structure,
or control manhole, with the necessary meters, and other appurtenances, in the
building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of wastes.
The structure shall be accessible and safely located, and shall be constructed
in accordance with plans approved by the city. The structure shall be installed
by the owner at his or her expense, and shall be maintained by the owner to be
safe, and accessible, at all times.
   (K)   The owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying
industrial wastes may, at the discretion of the city, be required to provide
laboratory measurements, tests, or analyses of waters, or wastes, to illustrate
compliance with this subchapter, and any special condition for discharge
established by the city, or regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over the
discharge. The number, type, and frequency of sampling, and laboratory analyses
to be performed by the owner, shall be as stipulated by the city. The industry
must supply a complete analysis of the constituents of the wastewater discharge
to assure that compliance with federal, state, and local standards are being
met. The owner shall report the results of measurements, and laboratory
analyses, to the city at such times, and in a manner, as prescribed by the
city. The owner shall bear the expense of all measurements, analyses, and
reporting, as required by the city. At such times as deemed necessary, the city
reserves the right to take measurements, and samples for analysis, by an
independent laboratory.
   (L)   All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of
waters, and wastes, to which reference is made in this chapter, shall be
determined in accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the
Examination of Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health
Association. Sampling methods, location, times, duration, and frequencies are
to be determined on an individual basis, subject to approval by the Wastewater
Superintendent.
   (M)   Where required by the city, the owner of any property serviced by a
sanitary sewer shall provide protection from an accidental discharge of
prohibited materials, or other substances regulated by this chapter. Where
necessary, facilities to prevent accidental discharges of prohibited materials
shall be provided, and maintained, at the owner’s expense. Detailed plans
showing facilities, and operating procedures to provide this protection, shall
be submitted to the Wastewater Superintendent for review, and approval, prior
to construction of the facility. Review, and approval, of the plans and
operating procedures shall not relieve any user from the responsibility to
modify the user’s facility, as necessary, to meet the requirements of this
chapter. Users shall notify the Wastewater Superintendent immediately upon
having a slug, or accidental discharge, of substances of wastewater in
violation of this chapter to enable countermeasures to be taken by the
Wastewater Superintendent to minimize damage to the wastewater treatment works.
The notification will not relieve any user of any liability for any expense,
loss, or damage to the wastewater treatment system or treatment process, or for
any fines imposed on the city on account thereof under any state and federal
law. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause, or discover, a
discharge are advised of the emergency notification procedure.
   (N)   It is unlawful for any person having charge of any building, or other
premises, which drains into the public sewer, to permit any substance, or
matter which may form a deposit or obstruction, to flow, or pass, into the
public sewer. Within 30 days after receipt of written notice from the city, the
owner shall install a suitable, and sufficient, catch basin or waste trap, or
if one already exists, shall clean out, repair, or alter the same, and perform
the other work as the Wastewater Superintendent may deem necessary. Upon the
owner’s refusal, or neglect, to install a catch basin or waste trap, or to
clean out, repair, or alter the same after the period of 60 days, the
Wastewater Superintendent may cause the work to be completed at the expense of
the owner, or representative thereof.
   (O)   Whenever any service connection becomes clogged, obstructed, broken,
or out of order, or detrimental to the use of the public sewer, or unfit for
the purpose of drainage, the owner shall repair, or cause the work to be done,
as the Wastewater Superintendent may direct. Each day after three days that a
person neglects, or fails, to so act shall constitute a separate violation of
this chapter, and the Wastewater Superintendent may then cause the work to be
done, and recover from the owner, or agent, the expense thereof by an action in
the name of the city.
   (P)   The owner, or operator, of any motor vehicle washing, or servicing,
facility shall provide, and maintain, in serviceable condition, at all times, a
catch basin or waste trap in the building drain system to prevent grease, oil,
dirt, or any mineral deposit from entering the public sewer system.
   (Q)   In addition to any penalties that may be imposed for violation of any
provision of this chapter, the city may assess against any person the cost of
repairing, or restoring, sewers or associated facilities damaged as a result of
the discharge of prohibited wastes by the person, and may collect the
assessment as an additional charge for the use of the public sewer system, or
in any other manner deemed appropriate by the city.
   (R)   National Categorical Pretreatment Standards promulgated by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), pursuant to the Act, shall be met by all
users which are subject to the standards in any instance where they are more
stringent than the limitations in this chapter, unless the city has applied
for, and obtained, from the state approval to modify the specific limits in the
National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. When requested, an application for
modification of the National Categorical Pretreatment Standards will be
considered for submittal by the city when the wastewater treatment system
achieves consistent removal of the pollutants. CONSISTENT REMOVAL shall be
defined as in 40 C.F.R. part 403 of the General Pretreatment Regulations for
Existing and New Sources of Pollution. Conditional revisions of the National
Categorical Pretreatment Standards may be made by the city in accordance with
40 C.F.R. part 403 of the General Pretreatment Regulations for Existing and New
Sources of Pollution if requested by an industry, in accordance with the
requirements of 40 C.F.R. part 403.
   (S)   State requirements and limitations on discharges shall be met by all
users which are subject to the standards in any instance in which they are more
stringent than federal requirements and limitations, or those in this chapter,
or any other applicable city code provision.
   (T)   The city reserves the right to establish, by ordinance, more stringent
limitations, or requirements, on discharges to the wastewater treatment system
if deemed necessary to comply with the objectives presented in this chapter.
   (U)   No statement contained in this section shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement, or arrangement, between the city and
industrial concern, whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength, or
character, may be accepted by the city for treatment, subject to payment
therefor by the industrial concern; provided, that National Categorical
Pretreatment Standards and the city’s NPDES, and/or state disposal system
permit limitations, are not violated.

§ 52.08 ESTABLISHMENT OF A SEWER SERVICE CHARGE SYSTEM.
   (A)   The city hereby establishes a sewer service charge system (SSCS)
whereby all revenue collected from users of the wastewater treatment facilities
will be used to affect all expenditures incurred for annual operation,
maintenance, administration, and replacement, and for debt service on capital
expenditures incurred in constructing the wastewater treatment works.
   (B)   Each user shall pay his or her proportionate share of operation,
maintenance, and replacement costs of the treatment works, based on the user’s
proportionate contribution to the total wastewater loading from all users.
   (C)   Each user shall pay debt service charges to retire local capital
costs, as determined by the Council.
   (D)   Sewer service rates and charges to users of the wastewater treatment
works shall be determined, and fixed, in a sewer service charge system
developed according to the provisions of this chapter. The sewer service charge
system shall be adopted by resolution upon the effective date of this chapter,
shall be published in the local newspaper, and shall be effective upon
publication. Subsequent changes in sewer service rates, and charges, shall be
adopted by Council resolution, and shall be published in the local newspaper.
   (E)   Revenues collected for sewer service shall be deposited in a separate
fund known as the Sewer Service Fund. Income from revenues collected will be
expended to offset the cost of operation, maintenance, and equipment
replacement for the facility, and to retire the debt for capital expenditures.
   (F)   Sewer service charges, and the Sewer Service Fund, will be
administered in accordance with the provisions of §
52.11.
(Prior Code, § 3.40)
§ 52.09 DETERMINATION OF SEWER SERVICE CHARGES.

         (b)   Commercial;
         (c)   Industrial;
         (d)   Institutional; and
         (e)   Governmental.
      (2)   The allocation of users to these categories for the purpose of
assessing user charges, and debt service charges, shall be the responsibility
of the City Clerk-Treasurer. Allocation of users to user classes shall be based
on the substantive intent of the definitions of these classes contained herein.
   (B)   The user shall pay operation, maintenance, and replacement costs in
proportion to the user’s proportionate contribution of wastewater flows and
loadings to the treatment plant, with the minimum rate for loadings of BOD,
TSS, and phosphorus, being the rate established for concentration of 257 mg/
l BOD, and 311 mg/l TSS.
   (C)   Unit costs for fixed service and treatment of flow, BOD, TSS, and
phosphorus shall be determined, and fixed, annually in the sewer service charge
system according to the following procedure:
      (1)   Determine the annual OM&R budget;
      (2)   Allocate total annual OM&R costs to fixed service, flow, BOD, and
TSS proportionately, according to the costs of administration and collection,
and of the specific treatment processes required to affect, or reduce, flow,
BOD, and TSS;
      (3)   Divide the OM&R costs attributable to fixed service, flow, BOD, and
TSS, respectively, by the total annual billable connections, volume, and
loadings of flow, BOD, and TSS to arrive at unit costs; and
      (4)   Determine the wastewater volume charge in accordance with the
methodology developed in the current sewer charge system report.
         (a)   For purposes of determining user charges, the following
definitions of unit costs shall apply:

            5.   UTSS: Unit cost for treatment of TSS in dollars per pound.
         (b)   Unit costs for 1988 are provided in tables 6 and 7 of the sewer
service charge system. Subsequent calculations of unit costs shall be according
to the substantive intent of this SSCS.
   (D)   The process for user charges for users contributing normal domestic
strength wastewater are as follows:
      (1)   For calculating billable flows and loadings:
         (a)   The billable amount of flow will be calculated from the value of
metered water usage;
         (b)   For users discharging NDSW but not connected to the city water
system, the billable amount of flow will be calculated from the volume of
metered water usage or, at the discretion of the city, from the measurement of
effluent flow at the user’s point of discharge. Measurements shall be according
to a regular program prescribed by the city; and
         (c)   For the determination of loadings from metered water usage, the
billable amounts of BOD, TSS, and phosphorus will be calculated from the volume
of metered water usage, as determined above, where the billable quantities will
be those attributable to a wastewater concentration of 257 mg/l BOD, and 311
mg/l TSS (for example, normal domestic strength wastewater).
      (2)   For calculating user charges, UC(NDS) = UFS + (VUC x F), where:
         (a)   “UC(NDS)” is the user charge for treatment of normal domestic
strength wastewater;
         (b)   “UFS” is the unit cost for fixed service in dollars per billing
period;
         (c)   “VUC” is the volume charge for treatment of 1,000 gallons of
normal domestic strength wastewater in dollars per l,000 gallons; and
         (d)   “F” is the billable flow in 1,000 gallons.
   (E)   The process for user charges for users contributing wastes greater
than normal domestic strength is as follows:
      (1)   For calculating billable flows and loadings:
         (a)   The billable amount of flow will be calculated from the volume
of metered water usage, or at the discretion of the city, from the measurement
of effluent flow at the user’s point of discharge. Measurements shall be
according to a regular program prescribed by the city; and
         (b)   The billable amounts of BOD and TSS will be calculated by the
measurement of these wastes according to a program prescribed by the city in
keeping with the latest edition of the Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, and in accordance with other provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   (a)   For calculating user charges, UC(GNDS) = UFS + (VUC x F) +
(UBOD x QBOD) + (UTSS x QTSS), where:
            1.   “UC(GNDS)” is the user charge for treatment of wastewater that
is greater than normal domestic strength;
            2.   “UFS” is the unit cost for fixed service in dollars per
billing period;
            3.   “VUC” is the unit cost for treatment of flow in dollars per
1,000 gallons;
            4.   “F” is the billable flow in 1,000 gallons;

pound;
            6.   “QBOD” is the quantity of BOD in excess of 257 mg/l in pounds;
            7.   “UTSS” is the unit cost for treatment of TSS in dollars per
pound; and
            8.   “QTSS” is the quantity of TSS in excess of 311 mg/l, in
pounds.
         (b)   QBOD is calculated as follows: QBOD = F x 0.00834 x (CBOD -
257), where “CBOD” is the concentration of BOD in mg/l.
         (c)   QTSS is calculated as follows: QTSS = F x 0.00834 x (CTSS -
311), where “CTSS” is the concentration of TSS in mg/l.
   (F)   The city may, at its discretion, require non-residential users to
install wastewater flow meters, or the additional water meters, as may be
necessary to determine wastewater volume. The city may require residential
connections to install water meters for the purpose of determining wastewater
volume. When so required, the meters shall be of a type approved by the city,
equipped with remote registering recorders, and located at an accessible site
on the owner’s property.
   (G)   Local construction costs for the wastewater treatment works will be
recovered from users in proportion to their contributions of wastewater flow
and loadings, or the plant capacity allocated to each user, whichever is
greater, into the treatment works as follows:
      (1)   Unit costs for debt service of capital expenditures attributable to
fixed service, flow, BOD, and TSS shall be calculated according to the sewer
service charge system, as provided in tables 6 and 7 of the sewer service
charge system;

1,000 gallons.
      (3)   The calculation of flows and loadings for the debt service charge
shall be the same as described in divisions (D) and (E) above.
      (4)   The process for calculating debt service charges is as follows:
         (a)   For normal domestic strength users, the formula shall be DC(NDS)
= DFS + (VDC x F), where “DC(NDS)” is the debt service charge to normal
domestic strength users;
         (b)   For users contributing wastes greater than normal domestic
strength, the formula shall be DC (GNDS) = DFS + (VDC x F) + (DBOD x QBOD) +
(DTSS x QTSS), where:
            1.   “DC(GNDS)” is the debt service charge to users contributing
wastewater that is greater than normal domestic strength;
            2.   “DFS” is the unit cost for fixed service in dollars per
billing period attributable to flow in dollars per 1,000 gallons;

         (c)   QBOD is calculated as follows: QBOD = F x 0.000834 x (CBOD -
257), where “CBOD” is the concentration of BOD in mg/l.
         (d)   QTSS is calculated as follows: QTSS = F x 0.00834 x (CTSS -
311), where “CTSS” is the concentration of TSS in mg/l.
   (H)   The total sewer service charge per billing period shall be calculated
as follows: SSC = UC + DC, where:
      (1)   “SSC” is the sewer service charge;
      (2)   “UC” is the user charge; and
      (3)   “DC” is the debt service charge.
   (I)   The Council shall adopt, by resolution, charges and fees which may
include:
      (1)   Fees for monitoring, inspection, and surveillance procedures;

(Prior Code, § 3.40)
§ 52.11 ADMINISTRATION.
   (A)   Annual assessment. The City Clerk-Treasurer shall maintain a proper
system of accounts suitable for determining the operation, and maintenance,
equipment replacement, and debt retirement costs of the treatment works, and
shall furnish the Council with a report of the costs annually in October. The
Council shall, annually, determine whether or not sufficient revenue is being
generated for the effective operation, maintenance, replacement, and management
of the treatment works, and whether sufficient revenue is being generated for
debt retirement. The Council will also determine whether the user charges are
distributed proportionately to each user in accordance with this chapter and §
204(b)(2)(A) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, being 33
U.S.C. § 1284(b)(2)(A). The city shall, thereafter, but not later than the end
of the year, reassess, and as necessary revise, the sewer service charge system
then in use to ensure the proportionality of the user charges, and to ensure
the sufficiency of funds to maintain the capacity and performance to which the
facilities were constructed, and to retire the construction debt.
   (B)   Notification. In accordance with federal and state requirements, each
user will be notified annually, in conjunction with a regular billing, of the
portion of the sewer service charge attributable to operation, maintenance, and
replacement.
   (C)   Records. In accordance with federal and state requirements, the City
Clerk-Treasurer shall be responsible for maintaining all records necessary to
document compliance with the sewer service charge system adopted.
   (D)   Payment of services. The owner of the premises shall be liable to pay
for the service to the premises, and the service is furnished to the premises
by the city only upon the condition that the owner of the premises is liable
therefor to the city.
   (E)   Additional costs. Any additional costs caused by discharges to the
treatment works of toxic, or other incompatible, pollutants, including the cost
of restoring wastewater treatment services, clean up and restoration of the
receiving waters and environs, and sludge disposal, shall be borne by the
discharger(s) of the wastes at no expense to the city.
   (F)   Discharge report. The city may require that any person discharging
wastewater to the wastewater treatment system file a periodic discharge report.
The discharge report may include, but not be limited to, the nature of the
process, rates of flow, mass discharge rate, raw material and production
quantities, hours of operation, number, and classification, of employees,
compliance status with any state, or federal, pretreatment standards, or other
information which relates to the generation of waste, including wastewater
constituents and concentrations in the wastewater discharge. The reports may
also include sludge disposal practices and the chemical constituents, and
quantity, of liquid, or gaseous, materials stored on site, even though they may
not normally be discharged. At a minimum, a summary of the data, indicating
each industrial user’s compliance with this chapter, shall be prepared
quarterly, and submitted to the Wastewater Superintendent. In addition to
discharge reports, the Wastewater Superintendent may require information in the
form of wastewater discharge permit applications, self-monitoring reports, and
compliance schedules.
   (G)   Wastewater discharge permits.
      (1)   Mandatory permits. All industries proposing to connect, or to
commence, a new discharge to the wastewater treatment system shall obtain a
wastewater discharge permit before connecting to, or discharging into, the
wastewater treatment system if the discharge would result in the industry being
classified as a significant industrial user. All existing significant
industrial users, or industrial users subject to national categorical
pretreatment standards under § 307(b) and (c) of the Act, being 33 U.S.C. §
1317(b) and (c), connected to, or discharging into, the wastewater treatment

      (4)   Permit duration. Permits shall be issued for a specified time
period, not to exceed five years. The user shall apply for permit reissuance a
minimum of 90 days prior to the expiration of the user’s existing permit. The
terms and conditions of the permit may be subject to modification by the city
during the term of the permit as limitations or requirements, as identified
herein, are modified, or other just cause exists. The user shall be informed of
any proposed changes in his or her permit at least 30 days prior to the
effective date of change. Any changes, or new conditions, in the permit shall
include a reasonable time schedule for compliance.
      (5)   Permit modifications. Within nine months of the promulgation of the
National Categorical Pretreatment Standard, the wastewater discharge permit of
users subject to the standard shall be revised to require compliance with the
standard within the timeframe prescribed by the standard. Where a user, subject
to the National Categorical Pretreatment Standard, has not previously submitted
an application for a wastewater discharge permit, the user shall apply for a
wastewater discharge permit within 180 days after the promulgation of the
applicable National Categorical Pretreatment Standard. In addition, the user
with an existing wastewater discharge permit shall submit to the Wastewater
Superintendent, within 180 days after the promulgation of an applicable
National Categorical Pretreatment Standard, the information required by this
section. If the information previously submitted in an application is still
current and adequate, only a letter from the user certifying such is required.
      (6)   Permit transfer. Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a
specific user for a specific operation. A wastewater discharge permit shall not
be reassigned, or transferred or sold, to a new owner, new user, different
premises, or a new, or changed, operation without the approval of the city. Any
succeeding owner, or user, shall also comply with the terms, and conditions, of
the existing permit if the city approves the transfer of the existing permit.
   (H)   Pretreatment.
      (1)   Wastewater treatment. Users shall provide necessary wastewater
treatment, as required, to comply with this chapter, and shall achieve
compliance with all National Categorical Pretreatment Standards within the time
limitations as specified by the federal pretreatment regulations, or within
time limitations, as specified within the wastewater discharge permit,
whichever is sooner.
      (2)   Requirements of pretreatment. Any facilities required to pretreat
wastewater shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user’s expense.
Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities, and operating procedures,
shall be submitted to the Wastewater Superintendent for review, and shall be
acceptable to the Wastewater Superintendent before construction of the
facility. The review of the plans, and operating procedures, will, in no way,
relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary
to produce an effluent acceptable to the city under the provisions of this
chapter. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities, or method of
operation, shall be reported to, and be acceptable to, the city prior to the
user’s initiation of the changes.
      (3)   Records; pretreatment. All records relating to compliance with
pretreatment standards shall be made available by the city to officials of the
EPA or MPCA upon request.
      (4)   Submission of reports. Any user subject to a National Categorical
Pretreatment Standard, after the compliance date of the pretreatment standard,
or in the case of the commencement of a new discharge to the wastewater
treatment system, shall submit to the Wastewater Superintendent, during the
months of June and December, unless required more frequently in the
pretreatment standard, or by the city, a report indicating the nature, and
concentration, of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by the
pretreatment standards. In addition, this report shall include a record of all
daily flows which, during the reporting period, exceeded the average daily flow
report in this section. The Wastewater Superintendent may agree to alter the
months during which the above reports are to be submitted.
   (I)   Enforcement.
      (1) Slug or accidental discharges.
         (a)   The city may suspend the wastewater treatment service of a user,
and/or a wastewater discharge permit (after informal notice to the discharger),
when the suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the Wastewater
Superintendent, in order to stop an actual, or threatened, discharge which
presents, or may present, an imminent, or substantial, endangerment to the
health, or welfare, of persons, to the environment, or to the wastewater
treatment system, or would cause the city to violate any condition of its
NPDES, or state disposal system permit.
         (b)   Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment
service, and/or the wastewater discharge permit, shall immediately stop the
discharge. In the event of a failure of the user to comply voluntarily with the
suspension order, the city shall take the steps as deemed necessary, including
immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent, or minimize, damage to
the wastewater treatment system, or endangerment to any individuals. The city
shall reinstate the wastewater discharge permit, and/or the wastewater
treatment service, upon proof of the elimination of the non-complying
discharge. A detailed written statement submitted by the user describing the
causes of the slug, or accidental, discharge, and the measures taken to prevent
any future occurrence, shall be submitted to the Wastewater Superintendent
within 15 days of the date of occurrence.
      (2)   Revocation of permit. In accordance with the procedures of this
section, the city may revoke the permit of any user which fails to factually
report the wastewater constituents, and characteristics, of its discharge;
which fails to report significant changes in wastewater constituents, or
characteristics; which refuses reasonable access to the user’s premises for the
purpose of inspection or monitoring, or for violation of conditions of its
permit, this chapter, or applicable state and federal regulations.
      (3)   Show cause hearing.
         (a)   If the violation is not corrected by timely compliance, the
Wastewater Superintendent may order any user which causes, or allows, an
unauthorized discharge to show cause before the Council why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. A notice shall be served on the user
specifying the time, and place, of a hearing to be held by the Council
regarding the violation, the reason why the action is to be taken, the proposed
enforcement action, and directing the user to show cause before the Council why
the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing
shall be served personally, or by registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested), at least ten days before the hearing. Service may be made on any
agent or officer of a corporation.
         (b)   The Council may itself conduct the hearing and take evidence, or
may designate any of its members, or any officer or employee, to:
            1.   Issue, in the name of the Council, notices of hearings
requesting the attendance, and testimony, of witnesses, and the protection of
evidence relevant to any matter involved in the hearings;
            2.   Take the evidence; and
            3.   Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including
transcripts and other evidence, together with recommendations to the Council
for action thereon.
         (c)   At any hearing held pursuant to this chapter, testimony taken
must be under oath, and recorded stenographically. The transcript, so recorded,
will be made available to any member of the public, or any party to the
hearing, upon payment of the usual charges therefor.
         (d)   After the Council has reviewed the evidence, it may issue an
order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a
specified time period, the sewer service be discontinued, unless adequate
treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances shall have been
installed, or existing treatment facilities, devices, or other related
appurtenances are properly operated. Further orders, and directives, as are
necessary, and appropriate, may be issued.
      (4)   Legal action. If any person discharges wastewater, industrial
wastes, or other wastes into the wastewater treatment system contrary to the
provisions of this chapter, federal, or state pretreatment requirements, or any
order of the city, the City Attorney may, following the authorization of the
action by the Council, commence an action for appropriate legal, and/or
equitable, relief.
      (5)   Annual publication. A list of the users which were significantly
violating applicable pretreatment requirements, or National Categorical
Pretreatment Standards, during the 12 previous months may be annually published
by the city in the official newspaper of the city. The notification shall also
summarize any enforcement actions taken against the user during the same 12
months. For the purpose of this provision, significant violations would be
those violations which remain uncorrected 45 days after notification of non-
compliance, which are part of a pattern of non-compliance over a 12-month
period, or which involve a failure to accurately report non-compliance.
      (6)   Appeal to the Council.
         (a)   Any interested party shall have the right to request, in
writing, an interpretation, or ruling, on any matter covered by this chapter,
and shall be entitled to a written reply from the city.
         (b)   Any decision of the city in the enforcement of this chapter may
be appealed to the Council by filing a written petition with the City Clerk-
Treasurer within 30 days of the City’s ruling. The petition shall specify, in
detail, the matter, or matters, involved, and every ground, or basis, on which
objections are made. The petition shall show the names, addresses, and
telephone numbers of all objectors and their attorney at law, or spokesperson.
The filing of a petition, in accordance with the requirements herein, shall
stay all proceedings, unless the city shall file, within 72 hours after the
filing of a petition, a certificate stating that a stay would cause peril to
life or property, or specifying other good reason. The Council shall fix a
reasonable time for hearing of the petition or appeal, and give due notice of
the time and place of the hearing to parties named in the petition as attorney
or spokesperson. The hearing shall be open to the public. Petitioners shall be
given full opportunity to present evidence in support of their petition, after
which the city may present evidence in support of its decision.
         (c)   The Council shall decide the appeal within a reasonable time,
and notify the attorney or spokesperson. The minutes of the Council shall
constitute the official record of the petition, hearing, and decision. Any
party desiring a transcript of the proceedings shall furnish a qualified court
reporter at their own expense.

§ 52.12 VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   Notice. Upon discovery of a suspected violation and/or non-compliance,
the alleged violator shall be issued, either personally or by telephone, a
notice of the violation. A written citation shall follow by mail within 48
hours that sets forth the alleged violation, and which shall inform the alleged
violator of his or her right to be heard on the accusation of violation and/or
non-compliance. Each license/permit holder shall designate a person to receive
service of the citation.
   (B)   Scheduled maintenance. Industries shall inform the Wastewater
Superintendent at least 48 hours in advance of any scheduled maintenance that
may result in any technical violation of this chapter. The industries shall
work cooperatively with the Wastewater Superintendent so as to alleviate any
problems, or violations, associated with the maintenance. Notice, and
cooperation, in the scheduled maintenance by the industries shall be taken as
proof that no violation was intended, and they shall not be cited as violating
this chapter.
   (C)   Superintendent and City Manager. The Wastewater Superintendent, the
City Manager, and a representative of the alleged violator, shall meet within
48 hours of issuance of the written citation and discuss appropriate actions,
including whether or not the written citation shall be issued, settled,
dismissed, or should proceed to a full hearing in front of the Council.
   (D)   Hearings. If the person, or permit holder, accused of violating this
chapter so requests, within ten days of service of the citation, a hearing
shall be scheduled, the time and place of which shall be published and provided
to the accused violator. The hearing shall be held before the Council.
   (E)   Decision. If the Council determines that a violation of this chapter
did occur, that decision, along with the reasons for the decisions, shall be
recorded, in writing, a copy of which to be provided to the accused violator.
Likewise, if the Council determines that no violation occurred, or finds
grounds for not imposing the penalty, the findings shall be recorded, and a
copy provided to the acquitted accused violator.
   (F)   Appeals. Appeals of any decision made by the Council regarding
violations of this chapter shall be filed with the County District Court.
   (G)   Continued violations. Each violation, and every day/24-hour period in

Any violator who is found to have violated this chapter seven times, or more,
within a 12-month period may be referred to the City Attorney’s office for
possible criminal prosecution.
(Prior Code, § 3.40) (Ord. 177, second series, passed 1-7-2003) Penalty, see §
52.99
§ 52.13 SYSTEM TO TAKE PRECEDENCE.
   The sewer service charge system shall take precedence over any terms, or
conditions, of agreements or contracts which are inconsistent with the
requirements of § 204(b)(1)(A) of the Act, being 33 U.S.C. § 1284(b)(1) and
federal regulation 40 C.F.R. § 35.2140 of the Environmental Protection Agency’s
grant regulations.
(Prior Code, § 3.40) (Ord. 105, second series, passed 5-15-1990)
§ 52.14 USE OF CERTAIN WATER/SEWER DRAINS.
   (A)   Purpose. The discharge of water from roof, surface, groundwater sump
pump, footing tile, swimming pool, or other natural precipitation into the city
sewerage system results in flooding and overloading of the sewerage system.
When this water is discharged into the sanitary sewer system it is treated at
the sewage treatment plant. This results in very large and needless
expenditures. The City Council, therefore, finds it in the best interest of the
city to prohibit such discharges.
   (B)   Discharge prohibited. Except as otherwise expressly authorized in this
section, no water from any roof, surface, groundwater sump pump, footing tile,
or other natural precipitation shall be discharged into the sanitary sewer
system. Dwellings and other buildings and structures which require, because of
infiltration of water into basements, crawl spaces, and the like, a sump pump
discharge system shall have a discharge line which shall not at any time
discharge water into the sanitary sewer system, except as provided herein. A
permanent installation shall be one which provides for year-round discharge
capability to either the outside of the dwelling, building, or structure, or is
connected to city storm sewer or discharge through the curb and gutter to the
street. It shall consist of a rigid discharge line, without valving or quick
connections for altering the path of discharge, and if connections for altering
the path of discharge, and if connected to the city storm sewer line, include a
check valve and an air gap located in a small diameter structure as shown in
the city’s standard plates.
   (C)   Disconnection. Before October 1, 2010, any person, firm, or
corporation having a roof surface, groundwater sump pump, footing tile, or
swimming pool now connected and/or discharging into the sanitary sewer system
shall disconnect or remove same. Any disconnects or openings in the sanitary
sewer system shall be closed or repaired in an effective, workmanlike manner.
   (D)   Inspection. Every person owning improved real estate that discharges
into the city’s sanitary sewer system shall allow an employee of the city or a
designated representative of the city to inspect the buildings to confirm that
there is no sump pump or other prohibited discharge into the sanitary sewer
system. In lieu of having the city inspect their property, any person may
furnish a certificate from a licensed plumber certifying that their property is
in compliance with this section.
   (E)   Future inspections. Each sump pump connection identified will be
reinspected periodically.
   (F)   New construction. All new dwellings with sumps for which a building
permit is issued after June 1, 2010, shall have a pump and shall be piped to
the outside of the dwelling before a certificate of occupancy is issued.
   (G)   Winter discharge.
      (1)   The City Manager is authorized to issue a permit to allow a
property owner to discharge surface water into the sanitary sewer system. The
permit shall authorize such discharge only from November 1 to April 1 and must
be reinspected or the surcharge fee remains in effect. A property owner is
required to meet at least one of the following criteria in order to obtain the
permit:
         (a)   The freezing of the surface water discharge from the sump pump
or footing drain is causing a dangerous condition, such as ice buildup or
flooding, on either public or private property;
         (b)   The property owner has demonstrated that there is a danger that
the sump pump or footing drain pipes will freeze up and result in either
failure or damage to the sump pump unit or the footing drain and cause basement
flooding; or
         (c)   The water being discharged from the sump pump or footing drain
cannot be readily discharged into a storm drain or other acceptable drainage
system.
      (2)   Following ten days’ written notice and an opportunity to be heard,
the City Clerk-Treasurer may require a property to discharge their sump pump
into the sanitary sewer from November 1 to March 1 if surface water discharge
is causing an icy condition on streets.
   (H)   Exceptions. Specifically excepted from this section are all commercial
buildings in business districts within the city in existence as of the date of
this section. All new construction in business district zones shall be required
to direct all spring, summer and fall flow into a storm drain.

rubbish from the residences and business places in the city, and to prevent the
unregulated, and unrestricted, hauling of garbage and rubbish by other means

Inspector to businesses operating out of a residential unit who have complied
with the applicable zoning ordinances of the city code, and all other
applicable city code provisions, rules, and regulations. Any dumpster approved
by a dumpster permit shall not be stored within the front yard setback. A
dumpster cannot be stored on a grass surface and, in all cases, the dumpster
location shall be determined by mutual agreement between the appropriate city
building official, property owner, and representative of the contract garbage
carrier. If no agreement can be reached, the Building Official’s decision shall
be final. Failure to keep the dumpster lid secured, the area around the
dumpster clean, the dumpster emptied on schedule, and failure to maintain odor
control, will be considered a violation of this section, which may include
revocation of the dumpster permit;

expired, the dumpster must be removed, or the resident must obtain further
permission from the City Building Official. Failure on the part of the owner to
have the dumpster emptied on schedule, the lid secured, the area around the
dumpster kept clean, and maintain odor control, will be considered a violation
of this section, and subject the property owner to the penalties described
herein.
   (B)   Dumpster permit. Dumpsters approved by a dumpster permit must be
located on private property. Under no circumstances can dumpsters be located on
streets, rights-of-way, or alleys.

a petty misdemeanor.

the city shall deem necessary for the preservation of the health, and safety,
of the general public. The fees charged for residential properties service

resolution of the Council, and may be amended from time to time only after the
contractor provides proper financial data showing a need for a fee increase.
   (B)   Fees on commercial property. The city, or its designated contractor,
shall serve all commercial, or industrial, properties within the city on as

parking spaces shall be located closer than five feet from an adjacent lot
zoned, or used, for residential purposes.
   (B)   General provisions.
      (1)   The Council recognizes that the inflexible application of parking
standards set forth in division (D) below may result in a development’s having
an inadequate number of parking spaces, or parking spaces far in excess, of a
development’s needs. Therefore, the city may permit deviations from the
presumptive requirements of the standards table in division (D) below, and may
require more parking spaces, or allow fewer parking spaces, whenever it finds
that such deviations are more likely to satisfy the development’s needs.
      (2)   Access drives shall be located no closer than five feet to any
adjacent lot’s side or rear lot line.
      (3)   When required, accessory off-street parking facilities are provided
elsewhere than on the lot in which the principal use served is located, they
shall be in the same ownership, or control, either by deed or long-term lease,
as the property occupied by the principal use, and the owner of the principal
use shall file a recordable document with the Council requiring the owner, and
his or her heirs and assigns, to maintain the required number of off-street
spaces during the existence of the principal use.
      (4)   Required off-street parking space in any district shall not be
utilized for open storage of goods, or for the storage of vehicles which are
inoperable, for sale, or rent.
      (5)   Parking shall not be allowed in areas not designated for off-street
parking.
   (C)   Design and maintenance of off-street parking areas.
      (1)   Parking areas shall be designed so as to provide adequate means of
access to a public alley or street. The driveway access shall not exceed 30
feet in width, and shall be so located as to cause the least interference with

may be constructed, as approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission, or its
official representative.
      (4)   It shall be the responsibility of the operator and owner of the
principal use, uses, and/or building to maintain, in a neat and adequate
manner, the parking space accessways, landscaping, required screening, and/or
fences.
      (5)   Any lighting proposed to illuminate off-street parking areas shall
be located, and arranged, so that all direct rays of light are directed upon
the parking area only, and not on any adjoining properties.
      (6)   When a building, or structure, accommodates more than one type of
use, the parking space requirement for the whole building shall be the sum of
the requirements for the separate parts of the building occupied by the
separate types of use, unless otherwise specified herein.
      (7)   When a number of parking spaces are specified for off-street
parking, a design standard of 300 square feet of space will be required per
parking space to meet the needs for vehicle standing space and maneuvering
area. For example, if the off-street parking standards for a use are for ten
spaces, the off-street parking area would need to meet a minimum area of 3,000
square feet (ten spaces times 300 square feet).

control, and either may be charged with the violation.
   (B)   For the purposes of this section, every cat at large shall be deemed

CRIME FREE RENTAL HOUSING PROGRAM
§ 92.20 BACKGROUND.
   The Crime Free Rental Housing Program (or “program”) is a certification
program for rental properties of all sizes, including single-family rental
homes, and multi-housing buildings. The program is based on the program

administered by the City Police Department.

   The City Council finds that preventing crime in rental properties requires
additional training, inspections, and enforcement that is unique to rental
properties, and different than crime prevention in commercial, and industrial,
properties. The City Council further finds that crime free housing has been
demonstrated to have been successful in preventing criminal activity in rental
housing.

   (A)   To provide for the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens, and to
ensure the integrity of its streets and the appropriate use of the rights-of-
way, the city strives to keep its rights-of-way in a state of good repair and
free from unnecessary encumbrances.
   (B)   Accordingly, the city hereby enacts this new chapter of this code
relating to right-of-way permits and administration. This chapter imposes
reasonable regulation on the placement and maintenance of facilities and
equipment currently within its rights-of-way or to be placed therein at some
future time. It is intended to complement the regulatory roles of state and
federal agencies. Under this chapter, persons excavating and obstructing the
rights-of-way will bear financial responsibility for their work. Finally, this
chapter provides for recovery of out-of-pocket and projected costs from persons
using the public rights-of-way.
   (C)   This chapter shall be interpreted consistently with 1997 Session Laws,
Chapter 123, substantially codified in M.S. §§ 237.16, 237.162, 237.163,

other laws governing applicable rights of the city and users of the right-of-
way. This chapter shall also be interpreted consistent with Minn. R. 7819.0050
through 7819.9950, as they may be amended from time to time, where possible. To
the extent any provision of this chapter cannot be interpreted consistently
with the Minnesota Rules, that interpretation most consistent with this chapter
and other applicable statutory and case law is intended. This chapter shall not
be interpreted to limit the regulatory and police powers of the city to adopt
and enforce general ordinances necessary to protect the health, safety and
welfare of the public.

the current status of this list.
      (5)   Thereafter, by February 1, each registrant may change any project
in its list of next-year projects, and must notify the city and all other
registrants of all such changes in said list. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a
registrant may at any time join in a next-year project of another registrant
listed by the other registrant.
   (B)   Additional next-year projects. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city
will not deny an application for a right-of-way permit for failure to include a
project in a plan submitted to the city if the registrant has used commercially
reasonable efforts to anticipate and plan for the project.
§ 94.09 PERMIT REQUIREMENT.
   (A)   Permit required. Except as otherwise provided in this code, no person
may obstruct or excavate any right-of-way without first having obtained the
appropriate right-of-way permit from the city to do so.
      (1)   Excavation permit. An excavation permit is required by a registrant
to excavate that part of the right-of-way described in such permit and to
hinder free and open passage over the specified portion of the right-of-way by
placing facilities described therein, to the extent and for the duration
specified therein.
      (2)   Obstruction permit. An obstruction permit is required by a
registrant to hinder free and open passage over the specified portion of right-
of-way by placing equipment described therein on the right-of-way, to the
extent and for the duration specified therein. An obstruction permit is not
required if a person already possesses a valid excavation permit for the same
project.
   (B)   Permit extensions. No person may excavate or obstruct the right-of-way
beyond the date or dates specified in the permit unless such person makes a
supplementary application for another right-of-way permit before the expiration
of the initial permit, and a new permit or permit extension is granted.
   (C)   Delay penalty. In accordance with Minn. R. 7819.1000, subp. 3, as it
may be amended from time to time and notwithstanding division (B) above, the
city shall establish and impose a delay penalty for unreasonable delays in
right-of-way excavation, obstruction, patching, or restoration. The delay
penalty shall be established from time to time by City Council resolution.
   (D)   Permit display. Permits issued under this chapter shall be
conspicuously displayed or otherwise available at all times at the indicated
work site and shall be available for inspection by the city.
Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 94.10 PERMIT APPLICATIONS.

      (4)   Franchise fees or other charges, if applicable.
   (D)   Payment of disputed amounts due the city by posting security or
depositing in an escrow account an amount equal to at least 110% of the amount

   (E)   Posting an additional or larger construction performance bond for
additional facilities when applicant requests an excavation permit to install
additional facilities and the city deems the existing construction performance
bond inadequate under applicable standards.
§ 94.11 ISSUANCE OF PERMIT; CONDITIONS.
   (A)   Permit issuance. If the applicant has satisfied the requirements of
this chapter, the city shall issue a permit.
   (B)   Conditions. The city may impose reasonable conditions upon the
issuance of the permit and the performance of the applicant thereunder to
protect the health, safety, and welfare or when necessary to protect the right-
of-way and its current use.
§ 94.12 PERMIT FEES.
   (A)   Excavation permit fee. The city shall establish an excavation permit
fee in an amount sufficient to recover the following costs:
      (1)   The city management costs; and
      (2)   Degradation costs, if applicable.
   (B)   Obstruction permit fee. The city shall establish the obstruction
permit fee and shall be in an amount sufficient to recover the city management

   (C)   Payment of permit fees. No excavation permit or obstruction permit
shall be issued without payment of excavation or obstruction permit fees. The
city may allow applicant to pay such fees within 30 days of billing.
   (D)   Non-refundable. Permit fees that were paid for a permit that the city
has revoked for a breach as stated in §
94.22 of this chapter are not refundable.
   (E)   Application to franchises. Unless otherwise agreed to in a franchise,
management costs may be charged separately from and in addition to the
franchise fees imposed on a right-of-way user in the franchise.
§ 94.13 RIGHT-OF-WAY PATCHING AND RESTORATION.
   (A)   Timing. The work to be done under the excavation permit, and the
patching and restoration of the right-of-way as required herein, must be
completed within the dates specified in the permit, increased by as many days
as work could not be done because of circumstances beyond the control of the
permittee or when work was prohibited as unseasonal or unreasonable under §
94.16 of this chapter.
   (B)   Patch and restoration. Permittee shall patch its own work. The city
may choose either to have the permittee restore the right-of-way or to restore
the right-of-way itself.
      (1)   City restoration. If the city restores the right-of-way, permittee
shall pay the costs thereof within 30 days of billing. If, following such
restoration, the pavement settles due to permittee’s improper backfilling, the
permittee shall pay to the city, within 30 days of billing, all costs
associated with correcting the defective work.
      (2)   Permittee restoration. If the permittee restores the right-of-way
itself, it shall at the time of application for an excavation permit post a
construction performance bond in accordance with the provisions of Minn. R.
7819.3000, as it may be amended from time to time.
      (3)   Degradation fee in lieu of restoration. In lieu of right-of-way
restoration, a right-of-way user may elect to pay a degradation fee. However,
the right-of-way user shall remain responsible for patching and the degradation
fee shall not include the cost to accomplish these responsibilities.
   (C)   Standards. The permittee shall perform excavation, backfilling,
patching, and restoration according to the standards and with the materials
specified by the city and shall comply with Minn. R. 7819.1100, as it may be
amended from time to time.
   (D)   Duty to correct defects. The permittee shall correct defects in
patching or restoration performed by permittee or its agents. The permittee
upon notification from the city, shall correct all restoration work to the
extent necessary, using the method required by the city. Said work shall be
completed within five calendar days of the receipt of the notice from the city,
not including days during which work cannot be done because of circumstances
constituting force majeure or days when work is prohibited as unseasonable or
unreasonable under §
94.16 of this chapter.
   (E)   Failure to restore. If the permittee fails to restore the right-of-way
in the manner and to the condition required by the city, or fails to
satisfactorily and timely complete all restoration required by the city, the
city at its option may do such work. In that event the permittee shall pay to
the city, within 30 days of billing, the cost of restoring the right-of-way. If
permittee fails to pay as required, the city may exercise its rights under the
construction performance bond.
§ 94.14 JOINT APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   Joint application. Registrants may jointly apply for permits to
excavate or obstruct the right-of-way at the same place and time.
   (B)   Shared fees. Registrants who apply for permits for the same
obstruction or excavation, which the city does not perform, may share in the
payment of the obstruction or excavation permit fee. In order to obtain a joint
permit, registrants must agree among themselves as to the portion each will pay
and indicate the same on their applications.
   (C)   With city projects. Registrants who join in a scheduled obstruction or
excavation performed by the city, whether or not it is a joint application by
two or more registrants or a single application, are not required to pay the
excavation or obstruction and degradation portions of the permit fee, but a
permit would still be required.
§ 94.15 SUPPLEMENTARY APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   Limitation on area. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the area
of the right-of-way specified in the permit. No permittee may do any work
outside the area specified in the permit, except as provided herein. Any
permittee which determines that an area greater than that specified in the
permit must be obstructed or excavated must before working in that greater area
make application for a permit extension and pay any additional fees required
thereby, and be granted a new permit or permit extension.
   (B)   Limitation on dates. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the dates
specified in the permit. No permittee may begin its work before the permit
start date or, except as provided herein, continue working after the end date.
If a permittee does not finish the work by the permit end date, it must apply
for a new permit for the additional time it needs, and receive the new permit
or an extension of the old permit before working after the end date of the
previous permit. This supplementary application must be submitted before the
permit end date.
§ 94.16 OTHER OBLIGATIONS.
   (A)   Compliance with other laws. Obtaining a right-of-way permit does not
relieve permittee of its duty to obtain all other necessary permits, licenses,
and authority and to pay all fees required by the city or other applicable
rule, law, or regulation. A permittee shall comply with all requirements of
local, state, and federal laws, including but not limited to M.S. §§ 216D.01 -
216D.09, as they may be amended from time to time (Gopher One Call Excavation
Notice System) and Minn. R. Chapter 7560, as it may be amended from time to
time. A permittee shall perform all work in conformance with all applicable
codes and established rules and regulations, and is responsible for all work
done in the right-of-way pursuant to its permit, regardless of who does the
work.
   (B)   Prohibited work. Except in an emergency, and with the approval of the
city, no right-of-way obstruction or excavation may be done when seasonally
prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable for such work.
   (C)   Interference with right-of-way. A permittee shall not so obstruct a
right-of-way that the natural free and clear passage of water through the
gutters or other waterways shall be interfered with. Private vehicles of those
doing work in the right-of-way may not be parked within or next to a permit
area, unless parked in conformance with city parking regulations. The loading
or unloading of trucks must be done solely within the defined permit area
unless specifically authorized by the permit.
   (D)   Trenchless excavation. As a condition of all applicable permits,
permittees employing trenchless excavation methods, including but not limited
to horizontal directional drilling, shall follow all requirements set forth in
M.S. Chapter 216D and Minn. R. Chapter 7560, as they may be amended from time
to time, and shall require potholing or open cutting over existing underground
utilities before excavating, as determined by the director.
Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 94.17 DENIAL OF PERMIT.
   The city may deny a permit for failure to meet the requirements and
conditions of this chapter or if the city determines that the denial is
necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare or when necessary to
protect the right-of-way and its current use.
§ 94.18 INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS.
   The excavation, backfilling, patching, and restoration, and all other work
performed in the right-of-way shall be done in conformance with Minn. R.
7819.1100 and 7819.5000, as they may be amended from time to time and other
applicable local requirements, in so far as they are not inconsistent with the
M.S. §§ 237.162 and 237.163, as they may be amended from time to time.
Installation of service laterals shall be performed in accordance with Minn. R.
Chapter 7560, as it may be amended from time to time and these ordinances.
Service lateral installation is further subject to those requirements and
conditions set forth by the city in the applicable permits and/or agreements
referenced in §
94.23(B) of this chapter.
§ 94.19 INSPECTION.
   (A)   Notice of completion. When the work under any permit hereunder is
completed, the permittee shall furnish a completion certificate in accordance
Minn. R. 7819.1300, as it may be amended from time to time.
   (B)   Site inspection. Permittee shall make the work-site available to the
city and to all others as authorized by law for inspection at all reasonable
times during the execution of and upon completion of the work.
   (C)   Authority of director.
      (1)   At the time of inspection, the director may order the immediate
cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the life, health, safety,
or well-being of the public.
      (2)   The director may issue an order to the permittee for any work that
does not conform to the terms of the permit or other applicable standards,
conditions, or codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the
violation will be cause for revocation of the permit. Within ten days after
issuance of the order, the permittee shall present proof to the director that
the violation has been corrected. If such proof has not been presented within
the required time, the director may revoke the permit pursuant to §
94.22 of this chapter.
§ 94.20 WORK DONE WITHOUT A PERMIT.
   (A)   Emergency situations.
      (1)   Each registrant shall immediately notify the director of any event
regarding its facilities that it considers to be an emergency. The registrant
may proceed to take whatever actions are necessary to respond to the emergency.
Excavators’ notification to Gopher State One Call regarding an emergency
situation does not fulfill this requirement. Within two business days after the
occurrence of the emergency, the registrant shall apply for the necessary
permits, pay the fees associated therewith, and fulfill the rest of the
requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with this chapter for
the actions it took in response to the emergency.
      (2)   If the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding a registrant’s
facilities, the city will attempt to contact the local representative of each
registrant affected, or potentially affected, by the emergency. In any event,
the city may take whatever action it deems necessary to respond to the
emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the registrant whose facilities
occasioned the emergency.
   (B)   Non-emergency situations. Except in an emergency, any person who,
without first having obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or excavates a
right-of-way must subsequently obtain a permit and, as a penalty, pay double
the normal fee for said permit, pay double all the other fees required by the
city code, deposit with the city the fees necessary to correct any damage to
the right-of-way, and comply with all of the requirements of this chapter.
§ 94.21 SUPPLEMENTARY NOTIFICATION.
   If the obstruction or excavation of the right-of-way begins later or ends
sooner than the date given on the permit, permittee shall notify the city of
the accurate information as soon as this information is known.
§ 94.22 REVOCATION OF PERMITS.
   (A)   Substantial breach. The city reserves its right, as provided herein,
to revoke any right-of-way permit without a fee refund, if there is a
substantial breach of the terms and conditions of any statute, ordinance, rule,
or regulation, or any material condition of the permit. A substantial breach by
permittee shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following:
      (1)   The violation of any material provision of the right-of-way permit;
      (2)   An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the right-
of-way permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit
upon the city or its citizens;
      (3)   Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a
right-of-way permit;
      (4)   The failure to complete the work in a timely manner, unless a
permit extension is obtained or unless the failure to complete work is due to
reasons beyond the permittee’s control; or
      (5)   The failure to correct, in a timely manner, work that does not
conform to a condition indicated on an order issued pursuant to §
94.19 of this chapter.
   (B)   Written notice of breach. If the city determines that the permittee
has committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any statute,
ordinance, rule, regulation, or any condition of the permit, the city shall
make a written demand upon the permittee to remedy such violation. The demand
shall state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the
permit. A substantial breach, as stated above, will allow the city, at its
discretion, to place additional or revised conditions on the permit to mitigate
and remedy the breach.
   (C)   Response to notice of breach. Within 24 hours of receiving
notification of the breach, permittee shall provide the city with a plan,
acceptable to the city, that will cure the breach. Permittee’s failure to so
contact the city, or permittee’s failure to timely submit an acceptable plan,
or permittee’s failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be
cause for immediate revocation of the permit. Further, permittee’s failure to
so contact the city, or permittee’s failure to submit an acceptable plan, or
permittee’s failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall
automatically place the permittee on probation for one full year.
   (D)   Cause for probation. From time to time, the city may establish a list
of conditions of the permit, which if breached will automatically place the
permittee on probation for one full year, such as, but not limited to, working
out of the allotted time period or working on right-of-way grossly outside of
the permit authorization.
   (E)   Automatic revocation. If a permittee, while on probation, commits a
breach as outlined above, permittee’s permit will automatically be revoked and
permittee will not be allowed further permits for one full year, except for
emergency repairs.
   (F)   Reimbursement of city costs. If a permit is revoked, the permittee
shall also reimburse the city for the city’s reasonable costs, including
restoration costs and the costs of collection and reasonable attorneys’ fees
incurred in connection with such revocation.
§ 94.23 MAPPING DATA.
   (A)   Information required. Each registrant and permittee shall provide
mapping information required by the city in accordance with Minn. R. 7819.4000
and 7819.4100, as they may be amended from time to time. Within 90 days
following completion of any work pursuant to a permit, the permittee shall
provide the director accurate maps and drawings certifying the “as-built”
location of all equipment installed, owed and maintained by the permittee. Such
maps and drawings shall include the horizontal and vertical location of all
facilities and equipment and shall be provided consistent with the city’s
electronic mapping system, when practical or as a condition imposed by the
director. Failure to provide maps and drawings pursuant to this division (A)
shall be grounds for revoking the permit holder’s registration.
   (B)   Service laterals. All permits issued for the installation or repair of
service laterals, other than minor repairs as defined in Minn. R. 7560.0150,
subpart 2, as it may be amended from time to time, shall require the
permittee’s use of appropriate means of establishing the horizontal locations
of installed service laterals, and the service lateral vertical locations in
those cases where the director reasonably requires it. Permittees or their
subcontractors shall submit to the director evidence satisfactory to the
director of the installed service lateral locations. Compliance with this
division (B) and with applicable Gopher State One Call law and Minnesota Rules
governing service laterals installed after December 31, 2005, shall be a
condition of any city approval necessary for payments to contractors working on
a public improvement project including those under M.S. Chapter 429, as it may
be amended from time to time, and city approval of performance under
development agreements, or other subdivision or site plan approval under M.S.
Chapter 462, as it may be amended from time to time. The director shall
reasonably determine the appropriate method of providing such information to
the city. Failure to provide prompt and accurate information on the service
laterals installed may result in the revocation of the permit issued for the
work or for future permits to the offending permittee or its subcontractors.
§ 94.24 LOCATION AND RELOCATION OF FACILITIES.
   (A)   Generally. Placement, location, and relocation of facilities must
comply with this chapter, with other applicable law, and with Minn. R.
7819.3100, 7819.5000, and 7819.5100, as they may be amended from time to time,
to the extent the rules do not limit authority otherwise available to cities.
   (B)   Corridors.
      (1)   The city may assign a specific area within the right-of-way, or any
particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of facilities
that is or, pursuant to current technology, the city expects will someday be
located within the right-of-way. All excavation, obstruction, or other permits
issued by the city involving the installation or replacement of facilities
shall designate the proper corridor for the facilities at issue.
      (2)   Any registrant who has facilities in the right-of-way in a position
at variance with the corridors established by the city shall, no later than at
the time of the next reconstruction or excavation of the area where the
facilities are located, move the facilities to the assigned position within the
right-of-way, unless this requirement is waived by the city for good cause
shown, upon consideration of such factors as the remaining economic life of the
facilities, public safety, customer service needs, and hardship to the
registrant.
   (C)   Nuisance. One year after the passage of this chapter, any facilities
found in a right-of-way that have not been registered shall be deemed to be a
nuisance. The city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in
equity, including, but not limited to, abating the nuisance or talcing
possession of the facilities and restoring the right-of-way to a useable
condition.
   (D)   Limitation of space. To protect health, safety, and welfare, or when
necessary to protect the right-of-way and its current use, the city shall have
the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional facilities
within the right-of-way. In making such decisions, the city shall strive to the
extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the right-
of-way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the public interest,
the public’s needs for the particular utility service, the condition of the
right-of-way, the time of year with respect to essential utilities, the
protection of existing facilities in the right-of-way, and future city plans
for public improvements and development projects which have been determined to
be in the public interest.
§ 94.25 PRE-EXCAVATION FACILITIES LOCATION.
   In addition to complying with the requirements of M.S. §§ 216D.01 through
216D.09 (“One Call Excavation Notice System”) before the start date of any
right-of-way excavation, each registrant who has facilities or equipment in the
area to be excavated shall mark the horizontal and vertical placement of all
said facilities. Any registrant whose facilities are less than 20 inches below
a concrete or asphalt surface shall notify and work closely with the excavation
contractor to establish the exact location of its facilities and the best
procedure for excavation.
§ 94.26 DAMAGE TO OTHER FACILITIES.
   When the city does work in the right-of-way and finds it necessary to
maintain, support, or move a registrant’s facilities to protect it, the city
shall notify the local representative as early as is reasonably possible. The
costs associated therewith will be billed to that registrant and must be paid
within 30 days from the date of billing. Each registrant shall be responsible
for the cost of repairing any facilities in the right-of-way which it or its
facilities damage. Each registrant shall be responsible for the cost of
repairing any damage to the facilities of another registrant caused during the
city's response to an emergency occasioned by that registrant’s facilities.
§ 94.27 RIGHT-OF-WAY VACATION.
   If the city vacates a right-of-way that contains the facilities of a
registrant, the registrant’s rights in the vacated right-of-way are governed by
Minn. R. 7819.3200, as it may be amended from time to time.
§ 94.28 INDEMNIFICATION AND LIABILITY.
   By registering with the city, or by accepting a permit under this chapter, a
registrant or permittee agrees to defend and indemnify the city in accordance
with the provisions of Minn. R. 7819.1250, as it may be amended from time to
time.
§ 94.29 ABANDONED AND UNUSABLE FACILITIES.
   (A)   Discontinued operations. A registrant who has determined to
discontinue all or a portion of its operations in the city must provide
information satisfactory to the city that the registrant’s obligations for its
facilities in the right-of-way under this chapter have been lawfully assumed by
another registrant.
   (B)   Removal. Any registrant who has abandoned facilities in any right-of-
way shall remove it from that right-of-way if required in conjunction with
other right-of-way repair, excavation, or construction, unless this requirement
is waived by the city.
§ 94.30 APPEAL.
   A right-of-way user that: has been denied registration; has been denied a
permit; has had a permit revoked; believes that the fees imposed are not in
conformity with M.S. § 237.163, subd. 6, as it may be amended from time to
time; or disputes a determination of the director regarding §
94.23(B) of this chapter may have the denial, revocation, fee imposition, or
decision reviewed, upon written request, by the City Council. The City Council
shall act on a timely written request at its next regularly scheduled meeting,
provided the right-of-way user has submitted its appeal with sufficient time to
include the appeal as a regular agenda item. A decision by the City Council
affirming the denial, revocation, or fee imposition will be in writing and
supported by written findings establishing the reasonableness of the decision.
§ 94.31 SEVERABILITY.
   If any portion of this chapter is for any reason held invalid by any court
of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct,
and independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the
remaining portions thereof. Nothing in this chapter precludes the city from
requiring a franchise agreement with the applicant, as allowed by law, in
addition to requirements set forth herein.

   ABANDONED MOTOR VEHICLE. A motor vehicle as defined in M.S. Chapter 169,
that has remained for a period of more than 48 hours on public property
illegally or lacking vital component parts, or in an inoperable condition such
that it has no substantial potential further use consistent with its usual
function unless it is kept in an enclosed garage or storage building. It shall
also mean a motor vehicle voluntarily surrendered by its owner to and accepted
by the city. A classic car or pioneer car, as defined in M.S. Chapter 168,
shall not be considered an ABANDONED MOTOR VEHICLE within the meaning of this
section. Vehicles on the premises of junk yards or automobile graveyards, which

considered abandoned motor vehicles within the meaning of this section.
   JUNK VEHICLE. A vehicle that is three years old or older; is extensively
damaged, with the damage including such things as broken or missing wheels,
motor, drive train, or transmission; is apparently inoperable; does not have a
valid, current registration plate; and has an approximate fair market value
equal only to the approximate value of the scrap in it.
   UNAUTHORIZED VEHICLE. A vehicle that is subject to removal and impoundment
pursuant to Minnesota Statutes but is not a junk vehicle or abandoned vehicle.
   VITAL COMPONENT PARTS. Those parts of a motor vehicle that are essential to
the mechanical functioning of the vehicle, including, but not limited to, the
motor, drive train and wheels.
(Ord. 021, fourth series, passed 5-21-2024)
§ 95.02 CUSTODY.
   The city may take into custody and impound any abandoned or junk motor
vehicle, or any unauthorized vehicle as provided by statute. Nothing in this
chapter shall prohibit the owner of any private property upon which an
unauthorized vehicle is parked to have the vehicle towed at the owner's
expense.
(Ord. 021, fourth series, passed 5-21-2024)
§ 95.03 SALE; WAITING PERIODS.
   (A)   An impounded vehicle is eligible for disposal or sale 15 days after
notice to the owner if the vehicle is determined to be a junk vehicle, except
that it may have a valid, current registration plate and still be eligible for
disposal or sale, or an abandoned motor vehicle.
   (B)   An impounded vehicle is eligible for disposal or sale 45 days after
notice to the owner if the vehicle is determined to be an unauthorized vehicle.

lot operator shall give notice of the taking within ten days. The notice shall
set forth the date and place of the taking, the year, make, model and serial
number of the abandoned motor vehicle, if such information can be reasonably
obtained, and the place where the vehicle is being held; shall inform the owner
and any lien holders of their right to reclaim the vehicle under §
95.05; and shall state that failure of the owner or lien holder to exercise
their right to reclaim the vehicle and contents within the appropriate time
allowed under statute shall be deemed a waiver by them of all rights, title and
interest in the vehicle and a consent to the transfer of title to and disposal
or sale of the vehicle and contents pursuant to §
95.06.
   (B)   The notice shall be sent by mail to the registered owner, if any, of

95.05. The purchaser shall be given a receipt in a form prescribed by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles, which shall be sufficient title to dispose of the

ownership. Before such a vehicle is issued a new certificate of title, it must
receive a motor vehicle safety check.

the cost of towing, preserving and storing the vehicle, and all administrative,

§ 111.033 INVESTIGATION FEE.
   (A)   The City Clerk-Treasurer shall, upon receipt of each application

The Council may, at its discretion, upon completion of the investigation,
grant, or refuse, the issuance of the license.

license to determine eligibility, and return written recommendations to the
Council for, or against, the issuance of each license. Every application shall
be referred to the Chief of Police, who shall investigate the facts set forth
in the application, and conduct such additional inquiry as he or she may deem
necessary. He or she shall, in all cases, make a written recommendation to the
Council, consisting of his or her findings, with respect to the applicant, and

Treasurer, the licensee shall pay an additional investigation fee of $50. No
additional fee of any kind shall be required as a result of license transfer
from an existing licensee to a corporation formed by licensee, and having
identical ownership interests. All initial applications for an on-sale beer
license shall be accompanied by an investigation fee in the amount of $25.
(Prior Code, § 5.02)
§ 111.034 ACTION.
   (A)   Granting. The Council may approve any application for the period of
the remainder of the then current calendar year, or for the entire ensuing
license year. All applications, including proposed license periods, must be
consistent with this chapter.
   (B)   Issuing. If an application is approved, the City Clerk-Treasurer shall
forthwith issue a license pursuant thereto in the form prescribed by the city
or the Commissioner, as the case may be, and upon payment of the license fee in
full, except as otherwise specifically permitted to be paid in installments.
All licenses shall be on a calendar year basis, unless otherwise specified
herein. For on-sale liquor licenses issued, and which are to become effective
other than on the first day of the licensed year, the fee to be paid with the
application shall be a pro-rata share of the annual license fee. For beer
licenses issued, and which are to become effective after eight months of the
licensing year have elapsed, the fee shall be reduced to one-half the annual
license fee.
   (C)   Transfer. No license shall be transferable between persons. No license
shall be transferable to a different location without prior consent of the
Council, and upon payment of the fee for a duplicate license. It is unlawful to
make any transfer in violation of this section.
   (D)   Refusal and termination. The Council may, in its sole discretion and
for any reasonable cause, refuse to grant any application. No license shall be
granted to a person of questionable moral character or business reputation.
Licenses shall terminate only by expiration, or revocation.
   (E)   Revocation or suspension. For any license granted under the provisions
of this chapter, the Council may revoke, suspend for a period not to exceed 60
days, impose a civil fine not to exceed $2,000, or any combination of these
sanctions, for each violation on a finding that the licensee has failed to
comply with a statute, regulation, or provision of the city code relating to
alcoholic beverages. The Council shall revoke the license upon conviction of
any licensee, or agent or employee of a licensee, for violating any law
relating to the sale, or possession, of beer, wine, or liquor upon premises of
the licensee, or if the revocation is mandatory by statute. If it shall be made
to appear at the hearing thereon that the violation was not willful, the
Council may order suspension; provided, that revocation shall be ordered upon
the third the violation or offense. No suspension, or revocation, shall take
effect until the licensee has been afforded an opportunity for a hearing before
the Council, a committee of the Council, or a hearing under the Administrative
Procedures Act, being M.S. Chapter 14, as it may be amended by time to time, as
may be determined by the Council in action calling the hearing. The hearing
shall be called by the Council upon written notice to the licensee served, in
person or by certified mail, not less than 15, nor more than 30, days prior to
the hearing date, stating the time, place, and purpose thereof. As additional
restrictions, or regulations, on licensees under this chapter, and in addition
to grounds for revocation, or suspension, stated in the city code or statute,
the following shall also be grounds for the action:
      (1)   The licensee suffered, or permitted, illegal acts upon the licensed
premises unrelated to the sale of beer, wine, or liquor;
      (2)   The licensee had knowledge of the illegal acts upon the licensed
premises, but failed to report the same to police;
      (3)   The licensee failed, or refused, to cooperate fully with police in
investigating the alleged illegal acts upon the licensed premises; or
      (4)   The activities of the licensee created a serious danger to the
public health, safety, or welfare.

§ 111.035 DUPLICATE LICENSES.

coverage for property damage; $50,000 coverage for death or injury to one
person; and $100,000 coverage for death or injury to more than one person, or
such greater or lesser amounts as may, from time to time, be provided by
resolution of the Council, which shall specifically provide for the payment by
the insurance company on behalf of the insured of all sums which the insured
shall become obligated to pay by reason of liability imposed upon him or her by
reason of M.S. § 340A.81 (the State Civil Damages Act, being M.S. § 304A.801,
as it may be amended from time to time), as it may be amended from time to

§ 113.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   Because the city recognizes that the sale of commercial tobacco, tobacco-
related devices, electronic delivery devices, and nicotine, or lobelia,
delivery products to persons under the age of 21 may violate both state and
federal laws; and because studies, which the city accepts and adopts, have
shown that youth use of any commercial tobacco product has increased to 26.4%
in the state; and because nearly 90% of people who smoke begin smoking before
they have reached the age of 21 years, and that almost no one starts smoking
after age 25; and because marketing analysis, public health research, and
commercial tobacco industry documents reveal that tobacco companies have used
menthol, mint, fruit, candy, and alcohol flavors as a way to target youth and
young adults, and that the presence of such flavors can make it more difficult
to quit; and because studies show that youth and young adults are especially
susceptible to commercial tobacco product availability, advertising, and price
promotions at tobacco retail environments; and because commercial tobacco use
has been shown to be the cause of many serious health problems which
subsequently place a financial burden on all levels of government, this chapter
is intended to regulate the sale of commercial tobacco, tobacco-related
devices, electronic delivery devices, and nicotine, or lobelia, delivery
products for the purpose of enforcing, and furthering, existing laws, to
protect youth and young adults against the serious health effects associated
with use and initiation, and to further the official public policy of the state
to prevent young people from starting to smoke, as stated in M.S. § 144.391, as
it may be amended from time to time.
(Ord. 44, third series, passed 10-15-2019)

or their unique proximity to its residents, for purposes of harassment,
nuisance, theft, or other unlawful activities.

§ 119.01 PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually-oriented businesses
in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the
citizens of the city, and to establish reasonable, and uniform, regulations to
prevent the deleterious location, and concentration, of sexually-oriented
businesses within the city. The provisions of this chapter have neither the
purpose, nor effect, of imposing a limitation, or restriction, on the content
of any communicative materials, including sexually-oriented materials.
Similarly, it is not the intent, nor effect, of this chapter to restrict, or
deny, access by adults to sexually-oriented materials protected by the First
Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors, and exhibitors, of sexually-
oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent, nor
effect, of this chapter to condone, or legitimize, the distribution of obscene
material.
(Prior Code, § 11.70)
§ 119.02 FINDINGS.
   Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses in
other communities, including, Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota;
Houston, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Los Angeles,
California; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and
Beaumont, Texas; and also on findings found in the report of the Attorney
General’s Working Group On The Regulation Of Sexually-Oriented Businesses (June
6, 1989, of the state), the Council finds:
   (A)   Sexually-oriented businesses in the city lend themselves to ancillary
unlawful, and unhealthy, activities that are presently uncontrolled by the
operators of the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to
make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that
occur on their premises;
   (B)   Certain employees of sexually-oriented businesses defined in this
chapter as adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher incident of certain
types of sexually-oriented behavior at these businesses than employees of other
establishments;
   (C)   Sexual acts, including masturbation, oral and anal sex, occur at
sexually-oriented businesses, especially those that provide private, or semi-
private, booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows, as
defined under this chapter as adult book stores, adult novelty shops, adult
video stores, adult motion picture theaters, or adult arcades;
   (D)   Offering, and providing, such space encourages such activities, which
create unhealthy conditions;
   (E)   Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other
sexually-oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the
premises of the sexually-oriented businesses;
   (F)   At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities
occurring in sexually-oriented businesses, including, but not limited to
syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (AIDS), genital
herpes, hepatitis B, non A, non B amebiasis, salmonella infections, and
shigella infections;
   (G)   Sanitary conditions in some sexually-oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and,
in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities, and the failure
of the owners, and the operators, of those facilities to self-regulate those
activities, and maintain those facilities;
   (H)   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in
the areas of sexually-oriented businesses where persons view adult-oriented
films;
   (I)   Sexually-oriented businesses have operational characteristics which
should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns;
   (J)   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place
the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners, and the operators, of
the sexually-oriented businesses. Further, a licensing procedure will place a
heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually-
oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety, and
welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the city. It
is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual
operator of the sexually-oriented business, fully in possession, and control,
of the premises and activities occurring therein;
   (K)   Removal of doors on adult booths, and requiring sufficient lighting on
premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in
curbing the illegal, and unsanitary, sexual activity occurring in adult
theaters;
   (L)   Requiring licensees of sexually-oriented businesses to keep
information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help
reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the
identification of potential witnesses or suspects, and by preventing minors
from working in the establishments;
   (M)   The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day to day operation, and maintenance, of the sexually-
oriented business, where the information is substantially related to the
significant governmental interest in the operation of the uses, will aid in
preventing the spread of sexually-transmitted diseases;
   (N)   It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable
diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees
who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent, or who
are likely to be witnesses to, such activity;
   (O)   The fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted
of a sexually-related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant
is likely to engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter;
   (P)   The barring of the individual from the management of adult uses for a
period of five years serves as a deterrent to, and prevents, conduct which
leads to the transmission of sexually-transmitted diseases; and
   (Q)   The general welfare, health, and safety of the citizens of the city
will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.

shall issue a license, unless it is determined by a preponderance of the

necessary for issuance of the license, or has falsely answered a question, or

renewal upon the written application of the applicant, and a finding by the
city that the applicant has not been convicted of any specified criminal
activity, as defined in this chapter, or committed any act during the existence

application. The renewal of the license shall be subject to the payment of the
fee as set forth in §
119.07.
   (C)   Within 30 days after receipt of a completed sexually-oriented business

overdue in payment to the city of taxes, fees, fines, or penalties assessed

shall likewise appoint an expert as its representative, and the two of them
shall appoint a third person, preferably an expert, and the three of them shall
constitute a board of arbitration. The board shall report its findings as soon
as possible, and the rates and charges it shall agree upon by majority vote
shall be legal and binding, subject only to review by a court of competent

or semi-permanent, fixtures whatsoever, shall be subject to the conditions that
the Council shall have the power to require alterations therein, or relocation
or rerouting thereof, as the Council may, at any time, deem necessary for the

(Prior Code, § 2.62)
§ 121.05 FURTHER PROVISIONS OF FRANCHISES.
   The enumeration, and specification, of particular matters which must be

nor shall anything contained in this subchapter limit any right, or power,
possessed by the city over existing franchises.

§ 122.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The purpose of this chapter is to regulate the sale of legalized adult-use
of any product that contains tetrahydrocannabinol and that meets the
requirements to be sold for human or animal consumption under M.S. § 151.72
("THC Products") for the following reasons:
   (A)   By enacting 2022 Session Law Chapter 98, Article 13, the Minnesota
Legislature amended M.S. § 151.72 to allow the sale of certain products
containing tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).
   (B)   The new law does not prohibit municipalities from adopting and
enforcing local ordinances to regulate THC product businesses including, but
not limited to, local zoning and land use requirements and business license
requirements.
   (C)   The National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine note that
the growing acceptance, accessibility, and use of THC products, including for
medical purposes, have raised important public health concerns, while the lack
of aggregated knowledge of cannabis-related health effects has led to
uncertainty about the impact of its use.
   (D)   The city recognizes the danger THC use presents to the health,
welfare, and safety of youth in St. James.
   (E)   The Minnesota Legislature recognized the danger of THC product use
among the public at large by setting potency and serving size requirements.
   (F)   The Minnesota Legislature recognized the danger of THC product use
among youth by prohibiting the sale of any product containing THC to those
under the age of 21, requiring that edible THC products be packaged without
appeal to children and in child-resistant packaging or containers.
   (G)   State law authorizes the Board of Pharmacy to adopt product and
testing standards in part to curb the illegal sale and distribution of THC
products and ensure the safety and compliance of commercially available THC
products in the State of Minnesota.
   (H)   The city has the opportunity to be proactive and make decisions that
will mitigate this threat and reduce exposure of young people to the products
or to the marketing of these products and improve compliance among THC product
retailers with laws prohibiting the sale or marketing of THC products to youth.
   (I)   Laws prohibiting the sale or marketing of THC products to youth are
needed to ensure and improve compliance among THC product retailers.
   (J)   A local regulatory system for THC product retailers is appropriate to
ensure that retailers comply with THC product laws and business standards of
the city to protect the health, safety, and welfare of our youth and most
vulnerable residents.
   (K)   A requirement for a THC product retailer license will not unduly
burden legitimate business activities of retailers who sell or distribute THC
products to adults but will allow the city to regulate the operation of lawful
businesses to discourage violations of state and local THC product related
laws.
   (L)   In making these findings and enacting this chapter, it is the intent
of the city to ensure responsible THC product retailing, allowing legal sale
and access without promoting increases in use, and to discourage violations of
THC product-related laws, especially those which prohibit or discourage the
marketing, sale or distribution of THC products to youth under 21 years of age.
(Ord. 012, fourth series, passed 9-19-2023)

§ 122.03 LICENSE.
   (A)   License required. No natural person, corporation, partnership, limited

   (B)   Application. An application for a license to sell licensed products or

investigation of the applicant(s) on all new applications. The investigation
shall consider all facts and information bearing upon the question of the
applicant's fitness to receive the license and to perform the duties imposed by
this chapter. The city may conduct a background check on an applicant for a
renewal of a license if it is in the public interest to do so. If a license is
mistakenly issued or renewed to a person, it shall be revoked upon the
discovery that the person was ineligible for the license under this chapter and
the city shall provide the person with a notice of revocation, along with

all persons that have an interest of 5% or more in the business. The list shall
name all owners and show the interest held by each, either individually or
beneficially for others. It is the duty of each business licensee to notify the
City Clerk-Treasurer in writing of any change in ownership in the business. Any
change in the ownership or control of the business shall be deemed equivalent
to a transfer of the license; any such license shall be revoked 30 days after
any such change in ownership or control unless the licensee has notified the
Council of the change in ownership by submitting a new license application for
the new owners and the Council has approved the transfer of the license by
appropriate action. Any time an additional investigation is required because of
a change in ownership or control of a business, the licensee shall pay an
additional investigation fee to be determined by the city. The city may at any
reasonable time examine the transfer records and minute books of any business
licensee to verify and identify the owners, and the city may examine the
business records of any other licensee to the extent necessary to disclose the
interest which persons other than the licensee have in the licensed business.
The Council may revoke any license issued upon its determination that a change
of ownership of a licensee has actually resulted in the change of control of
the licensed business so as materially to affect the integrity and character of
its management and its operation, but no such action shall be taken until after
a hearing by the Council on notice to the licensee.
      (7)   Additional information. Any additional information the city deems
necessary.
   (C)   Incomplete application. If the City Clerk-Treasurer determines that
the application is incomplete, he/she shall return the application to the
applicant with notice of the information needed to make the application
complete. The applicant shall be informed of an incomplete application within
ten business days.
   (D)   Investigation.
      (1)   On an initial application for a license and on application for
transfer of an existing license, the applicant shall pay with the application
an investigation fee of $500. The city shall request that its Chief of Police
conduct a preliminary background and financial investigation of the applicant.
The application in such case shall be made on a form prescribed by the State
Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and with such additional information as the
Council may require. If the Council deems it in the public interest to have an
investigation made on a particular application for renewal of a license, it
shall so determine. If the Council determines that a comprehensive background
and financial investigation of the applicant is necessary, it may conduct the
investigation itself or contract with the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension for
the investigation. If an investigation outside the state is required, the
applicant shall be charged the cost not to exceed $10,000, which shall be paid
by the applicant after deducting any initial investigation fee already paid.
The fee shall be payable by the applicant whether or not the license is
granted. Upon completion of the investigation, the Chief of Police shall make a
written report and recommendation to the City Council of his or her findings,
including a specific report on any violation of federal or state law or
municipal regulations.
      (2)   As an alternative to the investigation process set forth in
division (D)(1) above, an applicant may pay an investigation fee of $500 and
submit the results of a comparable background investigation completed by an
agency of the State of Minnesota within the 12 months prior to the application.
To do so, the applicant must authorize the city to obtain any and all related
information from said agency so that the Council may review it to determine if
any additional investigation is necessary. If the Council determines that the
agency's investigation is insufficient for these licensing purposes, then the
Council may require the investigation described in division (D)(1) above.
   (E)   Public hearing. For initial and renewal applications, upon receipt of
the written report and recommendation by the Police Chief of the City of St.
James, and within 21 days thereafter, the City Manager shall cause to be
scheduled a public hearing; with notice thereof to be published in the official
newspaper ten days in advance of the scheduled hearing, setting forth the day,
time and place when the hearing will be held, the name of the applicant, the
premises where the business is to be conducted, the nature of the business, and
such other information as the Council may direct. At the hearing, opportunity
shall be given to any person to be heard for or against the granting of the
license. After such investigation and hearing, the Council shall grant or
refuse the application in its discretion.
   (F)   Action. The City Council may either approve or deny the application
for a license, or it may delay action for a reasonable period of time as
necessary to complete any investigation of the application or the applicant it
deems necessary. A four-fifths vote of the City Council shall be required for
the granting of any license. If the City Council approves the license, the City
Clerk-Treasurer shall issue the license to the applicant. If the City Council
denies the license, notice of the denial shall be given to the applicant along
with notice of the applicant's right to appeal the City Council's decision
pursuant to §
122.06. If a license application is denied, the earliest an applicant may
reapply is 12 months from the date the license is denied.
   (G)   Term. All licenses issued under this chapter shall expire on December
31 of each year. License fees shall be prorated on a monthly basis for the
portion of any year remaining on an initial application and with any portion of
a licensed month counting as a full month.
   (H)   Revocation or suspension. Any license issued under this chapter may be
revoked or suspended whenever the City Council deems there is cause to do so.
Cause exists whenever a licensee violates any provision of this section or no
longer meets the license eligibility requirements of this section.
   (I)   Transfers. All licenses issued under this chapter shall be valid only
on the premises for which the license was issued and only for the person or
business to whom the license was issued. The transfer of any license to another
location, business, or person is prohibited.
   (J)   Display. All licenses shall be posted and displayed in plain view of
the general public on the licensed premises.
   (K)   Renewals. The renewal of a license issued under this section shall be
handled in the same manner as the original application, provided, however that
the City Council may waive the requirement of a background on an application
for a renewal of a license if the City Council deems it is in the public
interest to do so. The request for a renewal shall be made at least 30 days but
no more than 60 days before the expiration of the current license.
   (L)   Issuance as privilege and not a right. The issuance of a license
issued under this chapter is a privilege and does not entitle the applicant to
a license, nor does it entitle a license holder to automatic renewal of the
license.
(Ord. 012, fourth series, passed 9-19-2023)
§ 122.04 FEES.
   No license shall be issued under this chapter until the appropriate license
fee shall be paid in full. The fee for a license under this chapter shall be
established by the City Council and adopted in the city fee schedule, and may
be amended from time to time. Each application for a license shall be
accompanied by a receipt from the City Clerk-Treasurer for payment in full of
the license fee and the fixed investigation fee. All fees shall be paid into
the General Fund. If an application for a license is rejected or denied, the
City Clerk-Treasurer shall refund the amount paid as a license fee, which shall
not include the fixed investigation fee.
(Ord. 012, fourth series, passed 9-19-2023)
§ 122.05 INELIGIBILITY AND BASIS FOR DENIAL OF LICENSE.
   (A)   Ineligibility.
      (1)   Moveable place of business. No license shall be issued to a
moveable place of business. Only fixed location businesses shall be eligible to

be supervised by law enforcement or other designated personnel. Nothing in this
section shall prohibit compliance checks authorized by state or federal laws
for educational, research, or training purposes, or required for the
enforcement of a particular state or federal law.

special event;
      (6)   The special event is of the size or nature that requires the

the affected real property instead of proceeding with cleaning and remediation.
   (D)   The property owner will be given up to ten business days to appeal to
the City Coordinator (or the Coordinator’s formally identified designee), and,
if appealed, will be given the opportunity to show cause as to why the removal

responsibility, and provide acceptable plans, and schedule for effectively
cleaning, remediation, and testing of the structure. If, within ten business
days of the Coordinator’s notice, the owner fails to appropriately appeal, or
assume responsibility, the City Clerk-Treasurer is authorized to arrange
removal, and disposition, of the hazardous structure.

applicable federal, state, county, and city laws, city code provisions, and/or
applicable Council resolution.
   (F)   The cost of testing, cleanup, and remediation shall be certified by
the Public Health Authority, or his or her designee. Notice of cost, and demand
for payment, shall be forwarded to the property owner by certified mail at the

payment in full is not made within 30 days of mailing of notice, the Public
Health Authority may request that all costs be assessed against the property.
   (G)   Payment on the special assessment shall be collected at the time real
estate taxes are due. The amount due, interest rate, and/or payment rate may be
adjusted by action of the Council.
   (H)   The city may also seek recovery of costs through other methods allowed
by federal or state law.

safety, and the general welfare of the people of the city. The general
objectives include, among others, the following:

      (3)   To provide minimum standards for cooking, heating, and sanitary
equipment necessary to the health, and safety, of occupants of buildings;

party, nor to act as an arbiter, nor to be receptive to complaints for tenant

of six inches, it shall be prima facie evidence of a failure to comply with
this division (C). Every owner of property abutting on any street shall,
subject to the provisions herein requiring a permit therefor, trim, cut,
remove, and otherwise maintain all trees and shrubs in unhazardous and healthy
condition from the line of the property nearest to the street to the center
thereof.

performed by the city, the Street/Park Superintendent shall forthwith, upon
completion thereof, ascertain the cost attributable to each lot, piece, or
parcel of abutting land to the City Clerk-Treasurer who shall, at the next
regular meeting thereof, present the certificate to the Council, and obtain its
approval thereof. When the certificate has been approved, it shall be extended
as to the cost therein stated as a special assessment against the abutting
land, and the special assessment shall, at the time of certifying taxes to the
County Auditor, be certified for collection as other special assessments are
certified and collected.

SHADE TREE DISEASE
§ 153.01 POLICY AND PURPOSE.
   The city has determined that the health of oak and elm trees is threatened
by fatal diseases known as oak wilt and Dutch elm disease. It has further
determined that the loss of oak and elm trees located on public, and private,
property would substantially depreciate the value of property and impair the
safety, good order, general welfare, and convenience of the public. It is
declared to be the intention of the Council to control, and prevent, the spread
of these diseases, and provide for the removal of dead, or diseased, trees, as
nuisances.
(Prior Code, § 10.50)
§ 153.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates, or requires, a different meaning.
   NUISANCE.
      (1)   Any living, or standing, tree infected to any degree with a shade
tree disease; or
      (2)   Any logs, branches, stumps, or other parts of any dead, or dying,
tree so infected, unless such parts have been fully burned, or treated, under
the direction of the Tree Inspector.
   SHADE TREE DISEASE. Dutch elm disease, or oak wilt disease.

   M.S. §§ 89.51 et seq., as they may be amended from time to time, are hereby
adopted by reference, together with the Rules and Regulations of the State

the extent of inconsistencies.
(Prior Code, § 10.50)
§ 153.04 UNLAWFUL ACT.
   It is a petty misdemeanor for any person to keep, maintain, or permit upon
premises owned by him or her, or upon public property where he or she has the
duty of tree maintenance, any nuisance as herein defined.
(Prior Code, § 10.50) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 153.05 INSPECTION AND DIAGNOSIS.
   It is the power, and duty, of the Tree Inspector to enter upon public, and

and in performance of his or her duties, the Tree Inspector may remove
specimens, samples, and biopsies as may be necessary, or desirable, for
diagnosis.
(Prior Code, § 10.50)
§ 153.06 ABATEMENT OF NUISANCE.
   Abatement of a nuisance, defined herein, shall be by spraying, removing,
burning, or otherwise effectively treating the infected tree, or wood, to
prevent spread of shade tree disease. The abatement procedures shall be carried
out in accordance with the current technical, and expert, methods and plans as
may be designed by the Commissioner of Agriculture of the state. The city shall
establish specifications for tree removal, and disposal, methods consistent
therewith.
(Prior Code, § 10.50)
§ 153.07 PROCEDURE FOR REMOVAL OF INFECTED TREES AND WOOD.
   (A)   Whenever the Tree Inspector finds, with reasonable certainty, that the
infection, or danger of infection, exists in any tree, or wood, on any public,
or private, property, he or she shall proceed as follows:
      (1)   If the Tree Inspector finds that the danger of infection of other
trees is not imminent because of dormancy of shade tree disease, he or she
shall make a written report of his or her findings to the Council, which shall
proceed by:
         (a)   Abating the nuisance as a public improvement under M.S. Chapter
429, as it may be amended from time to time; or
         (b)   Abating the nuisance as provided in division (B) below.
      (2)   If the Tree Inspector finds that danger of infection of other trees
is imminent, he or she shall notify the owner of the property, or the abutting
property, as the case may be, by certified mail that the nuisance will be
abated within a specified time, not less than five days from the date of
mailing of the notice. The Tree Inspector shall immediately report the action
to the Council, after the expiration of the time limited by the notice he or
she may abate the nuisance; and

action immediately to the Council, and to the abutting property owner, or to
the owner of the property where the nuisance is located.
   (B)   Upon receipt of the Tree Inspector’s report required by division (A)
(1) above, the Council shall, by resolution, order the nuisance abated. Before
action is taken on the resolution, the Council shall publish notice of its
intention to meet to consider taking action to abate the nuisance. This notice
shall be mailed to affected property owners, and published once, no less than
one week prior to the meeting. The notice shall state the time, and place, of
the meeting, the streets affected, action proposed, the estimated cost of the
abatement, and the proposed basis of assessment, if any, of costs. At the
hearing or adjournment thereof, the Council shall hear property owners with
reference to the scope, and desirability, of the proposed project. The Council
shall thereafter adopt a resolution confirming the original resolution with the
modifications as it considers desirable, and provide for the doing of the work
by day labor or by contract.
   (C)   The Tree Inspector shall keep a record of the costs of abatements done
under this section, and shall report monthly to the City Clerk-Treasurer all
work done for which assessments are to be made, stating, and certifying, the
description of the land, lots, parcels involved, and the amount chargeable to
each.
   (D)   On, or before, September 1 of each year the City Clerk-Treasurer shall
list the total unpaid charges for each abatement against each separate lot, or
parcel, to which they are attributable under this section. The Council may then
spread the charges, or any portion thereof, against the property involved as a
special assessment under M.S. § 429.101, as it may be amended from time to
time, and other pertinent statutes for certification to the County Auditor and
collection the following year along with current taxes.

   The city finds it necessary for the purpose of promoting public health,
safety, order, convenience, and general welfare by protecting the lives, and
property, of users of the municipal airport, and of owners and occupants of
land in its vicinity, to adopt airport zoning regulations as authorized by
State Laws, 1945, Chapter 303, and accordingly have submitted the provisions of
this chapter to the Commissioner of Aeronautics, and duly obtained his or her
approval, and held a public hearing on September 21, 1953 pursuant to notice as
required.
(Prior Code, § 13.01)

§ 154.03 ZONES.
   (A)   Approach zones for instrument runways. An airport approach zone is
established at each end of every airport runway designated for use for
instrument landings or take-offs. The zone shall comprise all the land embraced
within the following lines:
      (1)   A line 1,000 feet long running at right angles to the centerline of
the runway 500 feet on either side of the centerline at the end of the paved
portion of the runway;
      (2)   A line 4,000 feet long running at right angles to the projected
centerline of the runway 2,000 feet on either side thereof at a distance two
miles from the first line; and
      (3)   Two lines making the shortest connections between the ends of the
above-described lines.
   (B)   Other approach zone. An airport approach zone is established at each
end of every runway not designated for use for instrument lands or take-offs.
The zone shall be 500 feet wide at the end of the runway, and 2,500 feet wide
at a distance of two miles from the end of the runway. Otherwise, the limits of
the zone shall be measured as in the zone described in division (A) above.
   (C)   Turning zones. An airport turning zone is hereby established embracing
the area between each two airport approach zones. The outer boundary of the
zones shall be a series of intersecting arcs completely around the airport, one
being swung on a two-mile radius from the midway point of the inner boundary of
each airport approach zone. All zones established by this section shall be as
indicated on the map attached hereto, and made a part hereof.

§ 154.05 USE RESTRICTIONS.
   Notwithstanding the provisions of §
154.04, no use may be made of land in an airport approach, or turning zone, in
a manner so as to create electrical interference with radio communication
between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish
between airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of pilots using
the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport, or otherwise
endanger the landing, taking off, or maneuvering of aircraft.
(Prior Code, § 13.01)
§ 154.06 NON-CONFORMING USES.
   The regulations prescribed in §§
154.04 and
154.05 shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other
change, or alteration, of any non-conforming use, or otherwise interfere with
the continuance of any non-conforming use, except as otherwise provided in §
154.08(B).
(Prior Code, § 13.01)
§ 154.07 VARIANCES.
   Any person desiring to erect, or increase, the height of any structure, or
permit the growth of any tree, or otherwise use his or her property not in
accord with the regulations prescribed in this chapter, may apply to the
Airport Zoning Board of Adjustment for a variance from the regulation in
question. The variance shall be allowed where a literal application, or
enforcement, of the regulations would result in practical difficulty, or
unnecessary hardship, and the relief granted would not be contrary to the
public interest, but do substantial justice, and be in accordance with, the
spirit of the regulations; provided, any variance may be allowed, subject to
any reasonable condition that the Board of Adjustment may deem necessary to
effectuate the purposes of this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 13.01)
§ 154.08 PERMITS.
   (A)   Future uses. No material change shall be made in the use of land, no
structure shall be erected, altered, or moved, and no tree shall be planted in
any zone created in §
154.03 herein without a permit therefor. Application for a permit shall be made
to the City Engineer, and shall indicate the use for which the permit is
desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether
the use would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If the
determination is in the affirmative, the City Engineer shall issue the permit
applied for.
   (B)   Non-conforming uses.
      (1)   Before any non-conforming structure, or tree, may be replaced,
substantially altered, or repaired, rebuilt, or replanted, a permit shall be
secured authorizing the replacement, change, or repair. No permit shall be
granted that would allow the structure, or tree, to be made higher, or become a
greater hazard to air navigation, than it was when the applicable regulation
was adopted; and whenever the City Engineer determines that a non-conforming
structure, or tree, has been abandoned, or more than 80% torn down, physically
deteriorated, or decayed:
         (a)   No permit shall be granted that would allow the structure, or
tree, to exceed the applicable height limit, or otherwise deviate from the
zoning regulations; and
         (b)   Whether application is made for a permit under this division (B)
or not, the City Engineer may, by appropriate action, compel the owner of the
non-conforming structure, or tree, at his or her own expense, to lower, remove,
reconstruct, or equip the object as may be necessary to conform to the
regulations or, if the owner of the non-conforming structure, or tree, shall
neglect, or refuse, to comply with such an order after ten days’ notice
thereof, the Engineer may proceed to have the object so lowered, removed,
reconstructed, or equipped, and assess the cost, and expense, thereof upon the
object or the land whereon it is, or was, located. Unless the an assessment is
paid within 90 days from the service of notice thereof on the agent, or owner,
of the object or land, the sum shall bear interest at the rate of 8% per annum
until paid, and shall be collected in the same manner as are general taxes.
      (2)   Except as indicated herein, all applications for permits for
replacement, change, or repair of non-conforming uses shall be granted.
(Prior Code, § 13.01)
§ 154.09 HAZARD MARKING AND LIGHTING.
   Any permit, or variance, granted under §§
154.07 and
154.08 may, if the action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purposes of
this chapter, and reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to
require the owner of the structure, or tree, in question to permit the city, at
its own expense, to install, operate, and maintain thereon markers and lights
as may be necessary to indicate to the flyers the presence of an airport
hazard.
(Prior Code, § 13.01)
§ 154.10 ADMINISTRATION.
   It shall be the duty of the City Engineer to enforce this chapter through
appropriate legal channels. All applications for permits and variances shall be
made to the City Engineer. Those applications which are by this chapter to be
decided by the City Engineer shall be promptly considered, and granted, or
denied, by him or her. Applications for action by the Board of Adjustment shall
be forthwith transmitted by the City Engineer to the Board for hearing and
decision.
(Prior Code, § 13.01)
§ 154.11 APPEALS AND REVIEW.
   Any person aggrieved, or taxpayer affected, by any decision of the City
Engineer made in his or her administration of this chapter, or the Council,
when it is of the opinion that a decision of the City Engineer is an improper
application of airport zoning regulations of concern to the Council, may appeal
to the Board of Adjustment in accordance with State Laws, 1945, Chapter 303, §
31. Any person aggrieved, or taxpayer affected, by any decision of the Board of
Adjustment, or the Council, when it is of the opinion that a decision of the
Board of Adjustment is illegal, may secure judicial review of the decision in
the manner provided by State Laws, 1945, Chapter 303, § 34.
(Prior Code, § 13.01) (Ord. 119, passed 4-20-1993)
§ 154.99 PENALTY.
   Every person that violates a section, division, subchapter, or provision of
this chapter when he or she performs an act thereby prohibited, or declared
unlawful, or fails to act when the failure is thereby prohibited, or declared
unlawful, and upon conviction thereof, shall be punished as for a misdemeanor,
except as otherwise stated in specific provisions hereof.

§ 155.01 PURPOSE.
   In order to safeguard the best interests of the city, and to assist the
subdivider in harmonizing his or her interests with those of the city at large,
this chapter is adopted. Because each new subdivision becomes a permanent unit
in the basic structure of the expanding community, and to which the community
will be forced to adhere, and because piecemeal planning of subdivisions will
bring on undesirable disconnected patchwork of pattern, and poor circulation of
traffic unless its design, and arrangement, is correlated to a comprehensive
plan of the city aiming at a unified scheme of community interests, all
subdivisions of land hereafter submitted for approval to the Planning and
Zoning Commission shall, in all respects, fully comply with the regulations
hereinafter set forth in this chapter. It is the purpose of this chapter to
make certain regulations, and requirements, for the platting of land within the
city pursuant to the authority contained in state statutes annotated, which
regulations the Council deems necessary for health, safety, and the general
welfare.
(Prior Code, § 12.01)
§ 155.02 JURISDICTION.
   The regulations herein governing plats and the subdivision of land shall
apply within the corporate limits of the city, and the unincorporated area
within two miles of its limits; provided, that where a municipality lies less
than four miles from the limits of the city, these regulations shall apply only
to a line equidistant from the city and the municipality; and, provided
further, that the governing body, or bodies, of unincorporated areas adjacent
to the city have not adopted ordinances for the regulation of subdivision of
land, or platting.
(Prior Code, § 12.01)
§ 155.03 APPLICATION.
   Any plat, hereafter made, for each subdivision, or each part thereof, lying
within the jurisdiction of this chapter, shall be prepared, presented for
approval, and recorded as herein prescribed. The regulations contained herein
shall apply to the subdivision of a lot, tract, or parcel of land into two, or
more, lots, tracts, or other division of land for the purpose of sale or
building development, whether immediate or future, including the resubdivision,
or replatting, of land or lots. Division of land into tracts larger than two
and one-half acres in area, and 150 feet in width, shall be exempt from the
requirements of this chapter, where no new street is involved.
(Prior Code, § 12.01)
§ 155.04 APPROVALS NECESSARY FOR ACCEPTANCE OF SUBDIVISION PLATS.

      (1)   Submittal to the Planning and Zoning Commission.
         (a)   A preliminary plat shall be submitted to the City Engineer at
least ten days prior to the Planning and Zoning Commission meeting at which the
same shall be considered. The City Engineer shall prepare a report thereon,
setting out whether or not the plat meets the requirements of state law, city
code, and the comprehensive guide plan. He or she shall present the report,
together with his or her recommendations thereon, to the next meeting of the
Commission following its filing with him or her as hereinabove set out;

the meeting at which it is submitted, and may consider the same at special, or
adjourned, meetings as it shall determine are necessary;
         (c)   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall have the authority to
recommend approval, or disapproval, of the preliminary plat, to approve it with
conditions attached, and to disapprove it until, and unless, certain conditions
are first complied with; and
         (d)   Upon the making of its determination, the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall embrace the same within a motion, which shall include all
conditions it requires for approval, or conditions upon which approval will be
granted, and shall set forth the reasons for the approval given. A copy of the
motion shall be sent forthwith to the subdivider, and a copy thereof to the
Council, together with the plat if it is approved, conditionally or otherwise.

the preliminary plat which he or she proposes to record, and develop, at the
time; provided, that the portion must conform to all requirements of this
chapter. If some portion, or all, of the final plat has not been submitted to
the Planning and Zoning Commission for approval within the time hereinabove
provided, a preliminary plat must again be submitted to the Planning and Zoning
Commission and the Council for approval, unless the Commission and the Council
shall waive this requirement.
   (B)   Final plat. After the preliminary plat has been approved, and the
subdivider determines to proceed to secure approval of all, or a part thereof,
as a final plat, the final plat shall be submitted as follows:
      (1)   Submittal to the Planning and Zoning Commission.
         (a)   The final plat shall be submitted to the City Engineer at least
ten days prior to the Planning and Zoning Commission meeting at which the same

recommend approval, or disapproval, of the final plat. If it shall determine
that it cannot approve it unless certain conditions are attached, it shall, by
motion, set forth the conditions for approval, and forthwith send a copy of the
conditions to the subdivider, and all further action on the plat shall be
suspended until the subdivider shall respond thereto; provided, that if no
further action is taken by the subdivider within a period of three months from
the date of the adoption of the conditions, the plat shall be deemed to be
disapproved;
         (d)   Final action by motion on the final plat shall be communicated

all streets, alleys, easements or other public ways, parks, and other spaces
dedicated to public purposes; and
         (e)   The action of the Council finally determining the matter shall
be communicated by the City Clerk-Treasurer to the subdivider, and if the plat
be disapproved, the City Clerk-Treasurer shall set forth the reasons given by

(Prior Code, § 12.04)
§ 155.09 DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (A)   Blocks.
      (1)   Block length. In general, intersecting streets determining block
lengths shall be provided at such intervals as to serve cross traffic
adequately, and to meet existing streets. Where no existing plats control, the
blocks in residential subdivisions shall normally not exceed 1,000 feet in
length, except where topography, or other conditions, justify a departure from
this maximum. In blocks longer than 800 feet, pedestrian ways, and/or
easements, through the block may be required. The width and location of
pedestrian ways shall be subject to the approval of the City Engineer and the
Planning and Zoning Commission. Blocks for business, or industrial, use should
normally not exceed 600 feet in length.
      (2)   Block width. The width of the block shall normally be sufficient to
allow two tiers of lots of appropriate depth. Blocks intended for business, or
industrial, use shall be of such width as to be considered most suitable for
their respective use, including adequate space for off-street parking and
deliveries.
   (B)   Streets and alleys.
      (1)   Thoroughfares and collector streets. The arrangement of
thoroughfares and collector streets shall conform as nearly as possible to the
comprehensive plan. Except for cul-de-sacs, streets normally shall connect with
streets already dedicated in adjoining, or adjacent, subdivisions, or provide
for future connections to adjoining unsubdivided tracts, or shall be a
reasonable projection of streets in the nearest subdivided tracts. The
arrangement of thoroughfares and collector streets shall be considered in their
relation to the reasonable circulation of traffic, to topographic conditions,
to runoff of stormwater, to public convenience and safety, and in their
appropriate relation to the proposed use of the area to be served.
      (2)   Minor streets. Minor streets should be so planned as to discourage
their use by non-local traffic. Dead end streets are prohibited, but cul-de-
sacs will be permitted where topography, or other conditions, justify their
use. Cul-de-sacs shall normally not be longer than 500 feet, including a
terminal turn around which shall be provided at the closed end, with a right-
of-way radius of not less than 70 feet.
      (3)   Future street system. Where the plat to be submitted includes only
part of the tract owned, or intended, for development by the subdivider, a
tentative plan of a proposed future street system for the unsubdivided portion
shall be prepared, and submitted, by the subdivider.
      (4)   Arrangement of larger parcels. When a tract is subdivided into
larger than normal building lots or parcels, lots or parcels shall be so
arranged as to permit the logical location and openings of future streets and
appropriate resubdivision, with provision for adequate utility connections for
resubdivision.
      (5)   Intersection of streets. Under normal conditions, streets shall be
laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles, except where
topography, or other conditions, justify variations. The minimum angle of
intersection of streets shall be 80 degrees. Street intersection jogs with an
offset of less than 125 feet shall be avoided.
      (6)   U.S. or state highways. Wherever the proposed subdivision contains,
or is adjacent to, the right-of-way of a limited access U.S. or state highway,
or thoroughfare, provisions may be made for a marginal access street
approximately parallel, and adjacent, to the boundary of the right-of-way, or
for a street at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of land between the
street and right-of-way. The distance shall be determined with due
consideration of the minimum distance required for approach connections to
future grade separations, grade crossings, or for lot depths.
      (7)   Alleys. Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial
districts, except that this requirement may be waived where other definite, and
assured, provision is made for service access, such as off-street loading,
unloading, and parking consistent with, and adequate for, the uses proposed.
Except where justified by special conditions, such as the continuation of an
existing alley in the same block, alleys will not be approved in residential
districts. Alleys, where provided, shall not be less than 16 feet wide for
residential alleys, and not less than 25 feet for commercial and industrial
alleys. Dead end alleys shall not be permitted, except that this requirement
may be waived where an adequate turn around is provided.
      (8)   Half street dedications. Dedication of half streets will not be
approved, except where it is essential to the reasonable development of the
subdivision, and in conformity with the other requirements of these
regulations, where it is found that it will be practical to require the
dedication of the other half when the adjoining property is subdivided, or
where it becomes necessary to acquire the remaining half by condemnation so it
may be improved in the public interest.
      (9)   Minimum right-of-way widths.
         (a)   For all public ways hereafter dedicated and accepted, the
minimum right-of-way widths for streets and thoroughfares shall be as shown in
the comprehensive plan, and where not shown therein, the minimum right-of-way
width for streets, thoroughfares, alleys, or pedestrian ways included in any
subdivision shall not be less than the minimum dimensions for each
classification as follows:
Classification Width
Classification              Width
Collector street            75 feet
Industrial commercial alley 25 feet
Marginal access street      50 feet
Minor street                60 feet
Pedestrian way              10 feet
Residential alley           16 feet
Thoroughfare                80 feet
 
         (b)   Where existing, or anticipated, traffic on thoroughfares
warrants greater widths of the right-of-way, the measurements in the table
above shall be required.
      (10)   Street grades.
         (a)   The grades in all streets, thoroughfares, collector streets,
minor streets, and alleys in any subdivision shall not be greater than the
maximum grades for each classification as follows:
 
Classification   Grade Percent
Alley            8%
Collector street 5%
Minor street     8%
Thoroughfare     4%
 
         (b)   In addition, there shall be a minimum grade on all streets and
thoroughfares of not less than five-tenths of 1%.
      (11)   Street alignment.
         (a)   The horizontal and vertical alignment standards on all streets
shall be as follows (there shall be a tangent between all reversed curves of a
length in relation to the radii of the curves so as to provide for a smooth
flow of traffic):
 
Classification   Horizontal Radii of Centerline
Collector street 400 feet minimum
Minor street     150 feet minimum
Thoroughfare     500 feet minimum
 
         (b)   All changes in street grades shall be connected by vertical
parabolic curves of such length as follows:
 
Classification                   Vertical Parabolic Curves
Collector street or minor street 20 times the algebraic difference in the
                                 percent of grade of the two adjacent slopes
Thoroughfare                     30 times the algebraic difference in the
                                 percent of grade of the two adjacent slopes
 
      (12)   Dedication as public streets. All proposed streets shall be
offered for dedication as public streets. No private streets shall be
permitted, except as set forth in other provisions of the city code.
   (C)   Lots.
      (1)   Minimum lot area. The minimum lot area, width, and depth shall not
be less than established by
Chapter 156 of the city code, except that in districts where a minimum area
width, or depth, is not established, the lot area, width, and depth shall be
adequate to serve the purposes for which the lot is to be used.
      (2)   Corner lots. Corner lots for residential use shall have additional
width to permit appropriate building setback from both streets, as defined in
Chapter 156 of the city code.
      (3)   Side lines. Side lines of lots shall be approximately at right
angles to street lines, or radial to curved street lines.
      (4)   Double frontage lots. Double frontage lots shall be avoided, except
where lots back on a thoroughfare, or other arterial street, or where
topographic, or other conditions, render subdividing otherwise unreasonable.
The double frontage lots shall have an additional depth of at least 20 feet in
order to allow space for screen planting along the back lot line.
      (5)   Minimum required frontage. Every lot must have at least the minimum
required frontage on a public-dedicated street other than an alley.
   (D)   Easements.
      (1)   Length and width minimum. An easement for utilities, at least six
feet wide, shall be provided along each side of a side line of lots, and along
any other lot line as may be deemed necessary to form a continuous right-of-
way, at least 12 feet in width. If necessary for the extension of main water or
sewer lines, or similar utilities, easements of greater width may be required
along lot lines, or across lots.
      (2)   Connection with other easements. Utility easements shall connect
with easements established in adjoining properties. These easements, when
approved, shall not thereafter be changed without the approval of the Council,
by resolution, upon the recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Commission.
      (3)   Additional easements. Additional easements for pole guys should be
provided at the outside of turns. Where possible, lot lines shall be arranged
to bisect the exterior angle so that pole guys will fall along side lot lines.
      (4)   Watercourses, drainage ways, channels, or streams. Where a
subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way, channel, or stream, a
stormwater easement, drainage right-of-way, or park dedication, whichever the
Planning and Zoning Commission may deem the most adequate conforming
substantially with the lines of watercourses, shall be provided, together with
further width or construction, or both, as will be adequate for the stormwater
drainage of the area.
   (E)   Public sites and open spaces. In subdividing land or resubdividing an
existing plat, due consideration shall be given by the subdivider to the
dedication, or reservation, of suitable sites for schools, parks, playgrounds,
conservation areas, or other public, or semi-public, recreational areas or open
spaces. Areas so dedicated, or reserved, shall conform as nearly as possible to
the comprehensive plan. All areas to be reserved for, or dedicated to, public
use shall be indicated on the preliminary plat in order that it may be
determined when, and in what manner, such areas will be dedicated to, or
acquired by, the appropriate agency.
(Prior Code, § 12.05)
§ 155.10 BASIC IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   Approval.
         (a)   Before a final plat may be approved by the Council, the owner
shall execute, and submit to the Council, an agreement which shall be binding
on his or her (or their) heirs, personal representatives, and assigns, that he
or she shall cause no private construction on the land, except with approval of
the City Engineer, until all improvements required under this chapter have been
petitioned for, arranged for, or have been constructed.
         (b)   No final plat shall be approved by the Council without first
receiving a report from the City Engineer certifying that the improvements
described herein, together with the agreements and documents required herein,
will meet the minimum requirements of all applicable provisions of the city
code.
         (c)   A certified copy of the plat restrictions shall be filed with
the City Clerk-Treasurer and Register of Deeds (County Recorder), which shall
include a provision that, in all instruments of sale or conveyance given before
all street improvements have been made, the grantee shall agree to, and
approve, the improvements and the assessment of their cost.
      (2)   City financing. Upon recommendation of the City Engineer, and with
the approval of the Council, any, or all, of the required improvements may be
financed, and assessed, by the city pursuant to M.S. Chapter 429, as it may be
amended from time to time. Length of assessment period, and rate of interest,
shall be as determined by the Council.
      (3)   Financing by developer. If deemed advisable, and to be in the best
interests of the city, the Council may require the developer to finance, and
pay for, any, or all, improvements. Prior to the making of required
improvements, the owner, or subdivider, shall deposit with the City Clerk-
Treasurer an amount equal to the City Engineer’s estimated cost of any, or all,
improvements which are to be financed by the developer, either in cash or an
indemnity bond, with sureties to the satisfaction of the city, conditioned upon
the payment of all construction costs incurred by the city in the making of
improvements, and all expenses incurred by the city for engineering, and legal
fees and other expenses in connection with the making of improvements. All
improvements shall be contracted through the city.
   (B)   Improvements. The following improvements shall be constructed as
provided for in this section. Programming of improvements shall be approved by
the City Engineer.
      (1)   City obligation. The city will construct, furnish, and install, at
city expense, the following improvements according to city specifications.
Furnishing of these improvements shall be commensurate with available city
funds for the work, and according to programs and priorities as established by
the Council. If the developer would desire any of these improvements sooner
than the city would be able to furnish them, then the costs of the following
improvements shall be paid for by the developer:
         (a)   Storm sewer mains will be constructed by the city as funds are
available. Connection shall be made at the boundary of the subdivision, if
available, or to some other approved discharge outlet. The developer shall
secure, or provide, the necessary easements or discharge permits. This
requirement shall not prevent the city from acquiring necessary easements by
eminent domain. Any costs for easements shall be borne by the developer;
         (b)   Street lighting shall be constructed by the city, preferably
after curb and gutter have been installed. If additional, or other type, of
lighting is desired by the developer, he or she shall pay the increased cost
thereof; and
         (c)   Street name signs and traffic control signs shall be installed
by the city.
      (2)   Obligation of developer. The developer shall pay the proportionate
amount of the following improvements on, or for, his or her subdivision or
development. Financing shall be according to division (A) above:
         (a)   Necessary site grading shall be accomplished by the subdivider;
         (b)   Street grading for the full width of right-of-way shall be
accomplished by the subdivider. If no site grading is to be accomplished, the
street grading will be included with subsequent street improvements. Street
grading shall precede any underground work. Where street grading is not to be
immediately followed by street paving, the developer may be required to provide
permanent grade markers at the right-of-way line of all streets of a standard
approved by the City Engineer;
         (c)   Street improvements, including base, curb and gutter, boulevard
sodding, inlets and leads, and paving, according to standard city
specifications, or as approved by the City Engineer, shall be constructed. All
required underground work shall have preceded any permanent street
improvements. Any improvements on a county road shall be approved by the County
Engineer. Temporary construction may, at the discretion of the City Engineer,
be required for just cause on any street, streets, or portion thereof.
Reconstruction, or alteration, in any way of existing streets affected by the
plat, or improvements thereupon, shall be subject to the approval of the City
Engineer. All costs therein incurred for either temporary access or
reconstruction shall be borne by the owner or subdivider. Half streets, if
accepted, shall be improved as directed by the City Engineer;
         (d)   Where the city sewer is, or will be, available at the boundary
of the subdivision, it shall be constructed according to city specifications.
The cost of any required pumping stations, deemed necessary by the Engineer,
shall be assessed against the benefitting property. Where it is neither
practical nor economical for the city to extend the city sewer, private sewage
disposal facilities shall be constructed according to city and state
specifications. Consideration shall be given to future availability of the city
sewer in installations. The information shall be recorded on the plat, and in
each deed so affected;
         (e)   Where city water is, or will be, available at the boundary of
the subdivision, it shall be constructed according to city specifications. Main
sizing shall be by the City Engineer. All required hydrants and valves are to
be included in the construction. Where it is neither practical nor economical
for the city to extend city water, private water supplies shall be constructed
according to city and state specifications; and
         (f)    Boulevard trees, if desired, shall be installed by the owner,
or developer, in accordance with Park and Recreation Advisory Board standards.
         (g)   Sidewalks. The subdivider shall provide for the installation of
sidewalks along all newly created lots, including sidewalks on adjacent
existing streets. The sidewalks shall be built according to the standards and
specifications of the city. The subdivider shall indicate in the application
for approval of a preliminary or final plat those sidewalks that will be
constructed at the time of installation of public improvements, and those that
the subdivider would like the Council to defer until a later date. If the
Council agrees to defer construction of the sidewalks, sidewalks shall be
constructed at the time a principal structure is built upon the adjacent lot or
lots or within five years of plat approval, whichever is earlier.
Notwithstanding the above, the Council may require the sidewalk's construction
at the time adjacent roadway construction takes place or at any other time as
noted in the final plat approval. At the time sidewalk construction is required
as provided above, such construction shall be completed at the sole cost and
expense of the person or entity that owns the property or lot at the time of
construction.
(Prior Code, § 12.06) (Ord. 002, fourth series, passed 12-21-2021)
§ 155.11 REGISTERED LAND SURVEYS, AND CONVEYANCE BY METES AND BOUNDS.
   (A)   Registered land surveys. It is the intention of this chapter that all
registered land surveys under the jurisdiction of this chapter should be
presented to the Planning and Zoning Commission in the form of a preliminary
plat, in accordance with the standards set forth in this chapter for
preliminary plats, and that the Planning and Zoning Commission shall first
approve the arrangement, sizes, and relationship of proposed tracts in
registered land surveys, and that tracts to be used as easements, or roads,
should be so dedicated. Unless approvals have been obtained from the Planning
and Zoning Commission and Council in accordance with the standards set forth in
this chapter, building permits will be withheld for buildings on tracts which
have been so subdivided by registered land surveys, and the city may refuse to
take over tracts as streets or roads, or to improve, repair, or maintain any
tracts unless so approved.
   (B)   Conveyance by metes and bounds. No conveyance of one, or more, parcels
in which the land conveyed is described by metes and bounds, shall be made, or
recorded, if the parcels described in the conveyance are less than two and one-
half acres in area, and 150 feet in width, unless the parcel was a separate
parcel of record at the effective date of this chapter. Building permits will
be withheld for buildings on tracts which have been subdivided, and conveyed,
by this method, and the city may refuse to take over tracts as streets or
roads, or to improve, repair, or maintain any such tracts.
(Prior Code, § 12.07)
§ 155.12 VARIANCES.
   (A)   General conditions. The Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend a
variance from the provisions of this chapter when, in its opinion, undue
hardship may result from strict compliance. In granting any variance, the
Commission shall prescribe only conditions that it deems necessary to, or
desirable for, the public interest. In making its findings, as required herein
below, the Commission shall take into account the nature of the proposed use of
land and the existing use of land in the vicinity, the number of persons to
reside, or work, in the proposed subdivision, and the probable effect of the
proposed subdivision upon traffic conditions in the vicinity. No variance shall
be granted unless the Commission finds:
      (1)   There are special circumstances or conditions affecting the
property that the strict application of the provisions of this chapter would
deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of his or her land;
      (2)   The variance is necessary for the preservation, and enjoyment, of a
substantial property right of the petitioner; and
      (3)   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
welfare, or injurious to other property in the territory in which the property
is situated.
   (B)   Applications required. Applications for any variance shall be
submitted, in writing, by the subdivider at the time when the preliminary plat
is filed for consideration by the Commission, stating fully, and clearly, all
facts relied upon by the petitioner, and shall be supplemented with maps,
plans, or other additional data which may aid the Commission in the analysis of
the proposed project. The plans for development shall include covenants,
restrictions, or other legal provisions necessary to guarantee the full
achievement of the plan.
(Prior Code, § 12.08)
§ 155.13 COMPLIANCE.
   No building permit shall be issued by the city with respect to the land, or
to any lot in a subdivision, as defined herein, until the plat thereof shall
have been recorded in the office of the Register of Deeds (County Recorder).
(Prior Code, § 12.09)
§ 155.14 VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   Sale of lots from unrecorded plats. It shall be unlawful to sell,
trade, or otherwise convey, or offer to sell, trade, or otherwise convey any
lot or parcel of land as a part of, or in conformity with, any plan, plat, or
replat of any subdivision under the jurisdiction of this chapter unless the
plan, plat, or replat shall have first been recorded in the office of the
Register of Deeds (County Recorder) of the county.
   (B)   Misrepresentations as to construction. It shall be unlawful for any
person, firm, or corporation owning an addition, or subdivision, of land within
the city to represent that any improvement upon any of the streets, alleys, or
avenues of the addition, or subdivision, or any sewer in the addition, or
subdivision, has been constructed according to the plans, and specifications,
approved by the Council, or has been supervised, or inspected, by the city,
when improvements have not been so constructed, supervised, or inspected.
(Prior Code, § 12.10) (Ord. 180, passed 5-6-2003) Penalty, see §
155.99
§ 155.99 PENALTY.
   Every person that violates a section, division, subchapter, or provision of
this chapter when he or she performs an act thereby prohibited, or declared
unlawful, or fails to act when the failure is thereby prohibited, or declared
unlawful, and upon conviction thereof, shall be punished as for a misdemeanor,
except as otherwise stated in specific provisions hereof.

chapter shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the
public health, safety, morals, and welfare.
      (2)   Where the conditions imposed by any provision of this chapter are

      (1)   Consideration of separate parcels of land. If, in a group of
contiguous platted lots under a single ownership, any individual lot does not
meet the minimum requirements of this chapter, the individual lots cannot be
considered as a separate parcel of land for purposes of sale or development,

full minimum requirements of this chapter.
      (2)   Single-family detached dwelling. If a single lot, or parcel of
land, in a residential district exists, and is recorded as a separate lot, or
parcel, in the County Recorder’s office, or Registrar of Titles, on, or before,

non-conforming use shall be expanded, changed, enlarged, or altered in a way
that increases its non-conformity. A non-conforming use may be changed to a
conforming use, but shall not thereafter be changed back to its non-conforming
use;
      (4)   Abandonment. A non-conforming use of a building that has been
discontinued for a period of 12 months shall not be reestablished, and any
future use shall be in conformity with the regulations of this chapter;

setback of the existing buildings. However, in no instances shall any building
be required to be located more than the minimum setback specified by the zoning
district.
   (D)   Dwelling unit restrictions.
      (1)   Prohibited dwelling units. No cellar, garage, tent, trailer,

use, and enjoyment, of surrounding properties.
   (G)   Uses not provided for within zoning districts (prohibited uses).
Whenever, in any zoning district, a use is neither specifically permitted nor
denied, the use shall be considered prohibited. In such cases, the Council,
Planning and Zoning Commission, or property owner may request a study by the
city to determine if the use is acceptable and, if so, what zoning would be
most appropriate, and the determination as to conditions, and standards,
relating to development of the use. The Planning and Zoning Commission, upon
receipt of the staff study, may initiate an amendment to this chapter to
provide for the particular use under consideration, or may find that the use is
not compatible for development within the district, or the city.

bush, or shrub that hangs over, or encroaches, beyond the property owner’s
property line, or interferes with traffic, or pedestrian, sightlines.
   (E)   Landscaping regulations.
      (1)   Landscaping of yards fronting a state or county road is required.
      (2)   When a development site plan is submitted to the Planning and
Zoning Commission and the Council for review and comment, it must contain
information regarding the type of landscaping treatment the developer intends
for the front yard, and, if required, side yards.
      (3)   The plan shall include the location of all intended fences, tie
walls, retaining walls, berms, landscaped islands, and planting beds with the
plant materials identified.
      (4)   The plan shall include the location, and appropriate detail, of all
required screening showing the relationship of the screening to the development
site and adjacent property.

§ 156.038 TELECOMMUNICATION TOWERS AND ANTENNAE.
   (A)   Purpose. To accommodate the communication needs of residents and
businesses while protecting the public health, safety, and general welfare of
the community, the city finds that these regulations are necessary in order to:
      (1)   Facilitate the provision of wireless telecommunication services to
the residents, and businesses, of the city;
      (2)   Minimize adverse visual effects of towers through careful design
and siting standards;
      (3)   Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure
through structural standards and setback requirements; and
      (4)   Maximize the use of existing, and approved, towers and buildings to
accommodate new wireless telecommunication antennas in order to reduce the
number of towers needed to serve the community.
   (B)   Required permits. Prior to any construction activities, the following
permits must be secured from the city:
      (1)   A building permit; and
      (2)   A special use permit, as required by §
156.054, and as required by the special use permit application.
   (C)   Zoning district use. Telecommunication towers and antennae will be
allowed in any zoning district in the city upon the approval of the two permits
required in division (B) above. The special use permit is required regardless
of the underlying zoning district.
   (D)   Area, setback, and height restrictions.
      (1)   The minimum lot area requirements are determined by the zoning
district in which the tower development site is located, and as determined by
any additional area needed to meet all setback requirements of this chapter.
      (2)   The minimum setback from all property lines and public rights-of-
way for telecommunications towers shall be equal to its height, except for
towers that are designed to collapse in upon themselves. For these latter type
of towers, the minimum setbacks are one-half the tower height for all yard
setbacks.
      (3)   The maximum height for telecommunications towers, including
antennae, is 200 feet.
   (E)   Co-location requirements.
      (1)   A proposal for a new commercial wireless telecommunication service
tower shall not be approved unless it can be documented by the applicant, by a
qualified, and licensed, engineer, that the telecommunication equipment planned
for the proposed tower cannot be accommodated on an existing, or approved,
tower, commercial building, or public structure within a one-mile radius of the
proposed tower site due to one, or more, of the following reasons:
         (a)   The planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity of
the existing, or approved, tower or commercial building, and the existing, or
approved, tower cannot be reinforced, modified, or replaced to accommodate
planned, or equivalent, equipment at a reasonable cost;
         (b)   The planned equipment would cause interference materially
impacting the usability of other existing, or planned, equipment at the tower,
or building, and interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost;
         (c)   Existing, or approved, towers and buildings within the search
radius (one mile) cannot accommodate the planned equipment at a height
necessary to reasonably function; and/or
         (d)   The applicant must demonstrate that a good faith effort to co-
locate equipment on existing towers, or structures, within the one-mile radius,
but an agreement could not be reached.
      (2)   Predominantly economic reasons for not pursuing co-location sites
shall not be accepted, and would generally be grounds for rejection of the
application, and/or denial of the special use permit.
      (3)   Any proposed commercial wireless telecommunication service tower
shall be designed to accommodate both the applicant’s antennae and comparable
antennae for at least two additional users. Towers must be designed to allow
for future rearrangement of antennae upon the tower, and to accept antennae
mounted at varying heights.
   (F)   Tower design requirements. Proposed, or modified, towers and antennae
shall meet the following design requirements:
      (1)   Towers and antennae shall be designed to blend into the surrounding
environment through the use of color and camouflaging architectural treatment,
except in instances where the color is dictated by federal, or state,
authorities; and
      (2)   Commercial wireless telecommunication service towers shall be of a
monopole design, unless the Council determines that an alternative design would
better blend in to the surrounding environment. Towers must be self-supporting
without the use of wires, cables, beams, or other means.

wires, or braces in connection with either shall, at any time, extend across,
or over, any part of the right-of-way, public street, highway, sidewalk, or
property line.
      (4)   Towers and associated antennae shall be designed to conform with
accepted electrical engineering methods and practices, and to comply with the
provisions of the National Electrical Code.
      (5)   All signal and remote control conductors of low energy extending
substantially horizontally above the ground between a tower, or antenna, and a
structure, or between towers, shall be at least eight feet above the ground at
all points, unless buried underground.
      (6)   Every tower affixed to the ground shall be protected by a security
fence to discourage climbing of the tower, unless waived by the city.
      (7)   Tower locations should provide the maximum amount of screening
possible for off-site views of the facility. Existing on-site vegetation shall
be preserved to the maximum extent practicable. The area around the base of the
tower, and any accessory structures, shall be landscaped, and/or screened.
   (H)   Lights and other attachments.
      (1)   No antenna, or tower, shall have affixed, or attached, to it in any
way, except during time of repair or installation, any lights, reflectors,
flashers, or other illuminating device, except as required by the Federal
Aviation Agency (FAA) or the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), nor shall
any tower have constructed on, or attached to, in any way, any platform,
catwalk, crow’s nest, or like structure, except during periods of construction
or repair.
      (2)   The use of any portion of a tower for signs, other than warning or
equipment information signs, is prohibited.

   (A)   Criteria for granting zoning amendments. The Council may adopt
amendments to the this chapter, and the zoning map in relation both to land
uses within a particular district, or to the location of the district line. The
amendments shall not be issued indiscriminately, but shall only be used as a
means to reflect changes in the goals, and policies, of the city as specified
in the comprehensive plan, or due to changed conditions within the city.
   (B)   Kinds of amendments.
      (1)   A change in a district’s boundary (rezoning).
      (2)   A change in the this chapter.
      (3)   A change in any other provision of this chapter.
   (C)   Initiation of proceedings. Proceedings for amending this chapter shall
be initiated by at least one of the following three methods:
      (1)   By petition of any owner, or owners, of property that is proposed
to be rezoned, or for which zoning, or district regulation, changes are
proposed;
      (2)   By recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Commission; or
      (3)   By action of the Council.
   (E)   Required exhibits for rezoning, or district regulation changes,

district regulation change, applying to the property is as follows:
      (1)   The property owner, or his or her agent, shall meet with the Zoning
Administrator to explain his or her situation, learn the procedures, and obtain
an application form;
      (2)   The applicant shall file the completed application form, together
with the required exhibits, with the Zoning Administrator, and shall pay a
filing fee as established by the Council. If the application and submittals are
complete, this date shall be the official submission date. If the application
or submittals are not complete, the Zoning Administrator will notify the
applicant of the deficiencies within ten days. The official submission date
will be the day that the petitioner has submitted a complete application, and
supplied all required exhibits;
      (3)   The Zoning Administrator shall transmit the application, and
required exhibits, to the Planning and Zoning Commission, and shall notify all
property owners within 350 feet of the outer boundaries of the property in
question. However, failure of any property owner to receive the notification
shall not invalidate the proceedings;
      (4)   The Zoning Administrator shall set the date for a public hearing,
and shall have notices of the hearing published in the legal newspaper at least
once, not less than ten days, and not more than 30 days, prior to the hearing.

with special conditions) to the Council within 30 to 40 days of the official
submission date;
      (6)   The Council shall act upon the application within 20 to 30 days of
receiving the recommendations by the Planning and Zoning Commission, or,

applicant shall bear the full cost for the special meeting. The fee for special
meetings shall be set by the Council; and
      (8)   No application of a property owner for an amendment to the text of
this chapter, or the zoning map, shall be considered by the Planning and Zoning
Commission within a one-year period following a denial of the request, except
the Planning and Zoning Commission may permit a new application if, in the
opinion of the Planning and Zoning Commission, new evidence, or a change of
circumstances, warrants it.
(Prior Code, § 11.80)
§ 156.054 SPECIAL USE PERMIT.
   (A)   Criteria for granting special use permits. In granting a special use
permit, the Council shall consider the advice, and recommendations, of the
Planning and Zoning Commission, and the effect of the proposed use on the
comprehensive plan, and upon the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of
occupants of the surrounding area. Among other things, the Council shall make
the following findings, where applicable:
      (1)   The use will not create an excessive burden on existing parks,
schools, streets, and other public facilities and utilities that serve, or are
proposed to serve, the area;
      (2)   The use will be sufficiently compatible, or separated by distance
or screening, from adjacent residentially zoned, or used, land so that existing
homes will not be depreciated in value, nor will the use deter development of
vacant land;
      (3)   The structure and site have an appearance that will not have an
adverse effect upon adjacent residential properties;
      (4)   The use is reasonably related to the overall needs of the city, and
to the existing land use;

purposes of the zoning district in which the applicant intends to locate the
proposed use;

      (7)   The use will not cause traffic hazards or congestion;
      (8)   The use will not cause air, noise, water, or visual pollution; and

facilities have been, or will be, provided.
   (B)   Additional conditions. In addition to the standards and requirements
expressly specified in this chapter, the Council may impose additional
conditions which it considers necessary to protect the surrounding area, and/or
the community as a whole. These conditions may include, but are not limited to,

certified by a registered, professional engineer, or architect, that the flood
proofing measures are consistent with the regulatory flood protection
elevation, and associated flood factors for the particular area.
   (C)   Procedure. The procedure for obtaining a special use permit is as
follows:

Administrator to explain the situation, learn the procedures, and obtain an
application form;
      (2)   The applicant shall file the completed application form, together
with the required exhibits, with the Zoning Administrator, and shall pay a

applicant of the deficiencies within ten days;
      (3)   The Zoning Administrator shall transmit the application to the

Council within 30 to 40 days of the official submission date;
      (6)   The Council shall take appropriate action on the request for a

conditions (including time limits) it considers necessary to protect the public
health, safety, and welfare, and the conditions may include a time limit for
the use to exist, or operate;
      (7)   Where a special use permit has been issued pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter, the permit shall become null and void without
further action by the Planning and Zoning Commission, or the Council, unless
work thereon commences within one year of the date of granting the special use.
The special use permit shall not be assignable. A special use permit shall be
deemed to authorize one particular use, and shall expire if the use is
discontinued for more than six consecutive months;
      (8)   In the event that the applicant violates any of the conditions set
forth in this permit, the Council shall have the authority to revoke the
special use permit;
      (9)   If an applicant requests that a special meeting be scheduled, the
applicant shall bear the full cost for the special meeting. The fee for special
meetings shall be set by the Council; and

considered by the Planning and Zoning Commission within a one-year period
following a denial for such a request, except the Planning and Zoning
Commission may permit a new application if, in its opinion, new evidence, or a

      (2)   A variance may be granted only in the event that the following
circumstances exist:
         (a)   Exceptional, or extraordinary, circumstances apply to the

vicinity, and result from lot size or shape, topography, or other circumstances
over which the owners of property have had no control;

applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same district
under the terms of this chapter;

         (e)   The variance requested is the minimum change needed to alleviate
the hardship;
         (f)   The variance would not be materially detrimental to the purposes
of this chapter, or to property in the same zone; and

notify the applicant of the deficiencies within ten days;

with special conditions;
      (6)   The Board of Adjustment shall take appropriate action on the
variance request within 20 to 30 days of receiving the recommendations by the

public health, safety, and welfare, and the conditions may include a time limit
for the use to exist or operate;

authorization, and policies, contained in M.S. Chapter 103F, as it may be
amended from time to time, Minn. Regs. parts 6120.2500 through 6120.3900, and
the planning and zoning enabling legislation in M.S. Chapter 462, as it may be
amended from time to time.
   (B)   Policy. The uncontrolled use of shorelands of the city affects the
public health, safety, and general welfare not only by contributing to
pollution of public waters, but also by impairing the local tax base.
Therefore, it is in the best interests of the public health, safety, and
welfare to provide for the wise subdivision use, and development, of shorelands
of public waters. The legislature of the state has delegated responsibility to
local governments of the state to regulate the subdivision, use, and
development of shorelands of public waters, and thus preserve and enhance the
quality of surface waters, conserve the economic and natural environmental
values of shorelands, and provide for the wise use of waters and related land
resources. This responsibility is hereby recognized by the city.
(Prior Code, § 11.60)
§ 156.211 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Jurisdiction. The provisions of this section shall apply to the
shorelands of public water bodies, as classified herein. Pursuant to Minn.
Regs. parts 6120.2500 through 6120.3900, no lake, pond, or flowage less than
ten acres in size need be regulated by a municipal government’s shoreland
regulations.
   (B)   Compliance. The use of any shoreland of public waters; the size and
shape of lots; the use, size, type, and location of structures on lots; the
installation, and maintenance, of water supply and waste treatment systems, the
grading and filling of any shoreland area; the cutting of shoreland vegetation;
and the subdivision of land shall be in full compliance with the terms of this
subchapter, and other applicable regulations.
   (C)   Enforcement. The city is responsible for the administration, and
enforcement, of this subchapter. It is unlawful to violate any provision of
this subchapter, or fail to comply with any of its requirements (including
violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants
or variances, or conditional uses). Violations of this subchapter can occur
regardless of whether or not a permit is required for a regulated activity,
pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter.

topographic divides that extend landward from the waters for lesser distances,
and when approved by the Commissioner.
   SIGNIFICANT HISTORIC SITE. Any archaeological site, standing structure, or
other property that meets the criteria for eligibility to the national Register
of Historic Places, or is listed in the State Register of Historic Sites, or is

provisions.
   WATER ORIENTED ACCESSORY STRUCTURE OR FACILITY. A small, above ground
building, or other improvement, except stairways, fences, docks, and retaining
walls, which, because of the relationship of its use to a surface water

decks.
(Prior Code, § 11.60)
§ 156.213 ADMINISTRATION.
   (A)   Permit required.
      (1)   A permit is required for the construction of buildings, or building
additions (and including such related activities as construction of decks and
signs), the installation, and/or alteration, of sewage treatment systems, and
those grading, and filling, activities not exempted by this subchapter.
Application for a permit shall be made to the Zoning Administrator on the forms
provided. The application shall include the necessary information so that the
Zoning Administrator can determine the site’s suitability for the intended use,
and that a compliant sewage treatment system will be provided.
      (2)   A permit authorizing an addition to an existing structure shall
stipulate that an identifying, non-conforming sewage treatment system shall be
reconstructed, or replaced, in accordance with the provisions of this
subchapter.
   (B)   Variances.
      (1)   Variances may only be granted in accordance with M.S. Chapter 462,
as it may be amended from time to time. A variance may not circumvent the
general purposes, and intent, of this subchapter. VARIANCE means a provision
for varying the literal provisions of this subchapter in instances where its
strict enforcement would cause undue hardship because of circumstances unique
to the individual property under consideration, and to grant the VARIANCE only
when it is demonstrated that the actions will be in keeping with the spirit,
and intent, of this subchapter. No VARIANCE may be granted that would allow any
use that is prohibited in the zoning district in which the subject property is
located. Conditions may be imposed in the granting of a VARIANCE to ensure
compliance, and to protect adjacent properties and the public interest. In
considering a VARIANCE request, the Board of Adjustment must also consider
whether the property owner has reasonable use of the land without the variance,
whether the property is used seasonally or year round, or whether the variance
is being requested solely on the basis of economic considerations, and the
characteristics of development on adjacent properties.
      (2)   The Board of Adjustment shall hear, and decide, requests for
variances in accordance with the rules that is has adopted for the conduct of
business. When a variance is approved after the Department of Natural Resources
has formally recommended denial in the hearing record, the notification of the
approved variance required herein shall also include the Board of Adjustment’s
summary of the public record/testimony, and the findings of facts and
conclusions that supported the issuance of variances.
      (3)   For existing developments, the application for variance must
clearly demonstrate whether a conforming sewage treatment system is present for
the intended use of the property. The variance, if issued, must require
reconstruction of a non-conforming sewage treatment system.
   (C)   Notifications to the Department of Natural Resources.
      (1)   Copies of all notices of any public hearings to consider variances,
amendments, or special uses under local shoreland management controls must be
sent to the Commissioner, or the Commissioner’s designated representatives, and
postmarked at least ten days before the hearings. Notices of hearings to
consider proposed subdivisions/plats must include copies of the subdivision/
plat.
      (2)   A copy of approved amendments and subdivisions/plats, and final
decisions granting variances, or special uses, under local shoreland management
controls, must be sent to the Commissioner, or the Commissioner’s designated
representative, and postmarked within ten days of final action.
   (D)   Fee schedule. A copy of the fee schedule shall be available in the
office of the Zoning Administrator.

Duplex            26,000 square feet 135 feet
Single            15,000 square feet 75 feet
Notes to Table:
*   For each additional unit, add the area amount and the width amount found in
the table to the standards for single-family homes or duplexes.
 
   (C)   St. James Creek area lot width standards. There are no minimum lot
size requirements for streams in the shoreland overlay district. Minimum lot
sizes of the underlying zoning districts will apply. The lot width standards
for single-family homes, duplexes, and additional units developed within the
creek area are as follows:
 
Structure Type Sewered
Additional     35 feet
units*
Duplex         115 feet
Single         75 feet
Notes to Table:
*   For each additional unit, add the sewered amount found in the table to the
standards for single-family homes or duplexes.
 
   (D)   Additional special provisions. Lots intended as controlled accesses to
public waters, or as recreation areas for use by owners of non-riparian lots
within subdivisions, are permissible and must meet, or exceed, the following
standards:
      (1)   Size and width. Lots must meet the width and size requirements for
residential lots, and be suitable for the intended uses of controlled access
lots;
      (2)   Docking, mooring, water storage. If docking, mooring, or over water
storage of more than six watercraft is to be allowed at a controlled access
lot, then the width of the lot (keeping the same lot depth) must be increased
by the percent of the requirements for riparian residential lots for each
watercraft beyond six, consistent with the following table for controlled
access lot frontage requirements:
 
Ratio of Lake Size to Shore Length  Required Increase in Frontage (percent)
(acres/mile)
100 to 200                          20%
201 to 300                          15%
301 to 400                          10%
Greater than 400                    0.05%
Less than 100                       25%
 
      (3)   Property ownership. Lots must be jointly owned by all purchasers of
lots in the subdivision, or by all purchasers of non-riparian lots in the
subdivision who are provided riparian access rights on the access lot; and
      (4)   Covenants. Covenants, or other equally effective legal instruments,
must be developed that specify which lot owners have authority to use the
access lot, and what activities are allowed. The activities may include
watercraft launching, loading, storage, beaching, mooring, or docking. They
must also include other outdoor recreational activities that do not
significantly conflict with general public use of the public water, or the
enjoyment of normal property rights by adjacent property owners. Examples of
the non-significant conflict activities include swimming, sunbathing, or
picnicking. The covenants must limit the total number of vehicles allowed to be
parked on the total number of watercraft allowed to be continuously moored,
docked, or stored over water, and must require centralization of all common
facilities and activities in the most suitable locations on the lot to minimize
topographic and vegetation alterations. They must also require all parking
areas, storage buildings, and other facilities to be screened by vegetation or
topography as much as practical from view from the public water, assuming
summer leaf-on conditions.
   (E)   Placement, design, and height of structures.
      (1)   Placement of structures on lots. When more than one setback applies
to a site, structures and facilities must be located to meet all setbacks.
Where structures exist on the adjoining lots on both sides of a proposed
building site, structure setbacks may be altered without a variance to conform
to the adjoining setbacks from the ordinary high water level; provided, the
proposed building site is not located in a shore impact zone. Structures shall
be located as follows:
         (a)   Structure and on-site sewage system setback (in feet) from
ordinary high water level requirements are listed below:
 
Class of Public Waters Unsewered   Sewered Sewage Treatment System
St. James Creek        Not allowed 50      Not allowed
St. James Lake         Not allowed 75      Not allowed
Notes to Table:
One water-oriented accessory structure designed, in accordance with division
(E)(1)(b) below, may be set back a minimum distance of ten feet from the
ordinary high water level.
 
         (b)   The following additional structure setbacks apply, regardless of
the classification of the waterbody:
 
Setback From                                                  Setback (in feet)

or streets not classified
Right-of-way line of federal, state, or county highway        50 feet
Unplatted cemetery                                            50 feet
 
            1.   The structure, or facility, must not exceed ten feet in
height, exclusive of safety rails, and cannot occupy an area greater than 250
square feet. Detached decks must not exceed eight feet above grade at any
point;
            2.   The setback of the structure, or facility, from the ordinary
high water level must be at lest ten feet;
            3.   The structure, or facility, must be treated to reduce
visibility as viewed from public waters and adjacent shorelands by vegetation,
topography, increased setbacks, or color, assuming summer leaf-on conditions;
            4.   The roof may be used as a deck with safety rails, but must not
be enclosed, or used as a storage area;
            5.   The structure, or facility, must not be designed, or used, for
human habitation, and must not contain water supply, or sewage, treatment
facilities; and
            6.   Water-oriented accessory structures used solely for watercraft
storage, including storage of related boating and water oriented sporting
equipment, may occupy an area up to 400 square feet; provided, the maximum
width of the structure is 20 feet, as measured parallel to the configuration of
the shoreline.
         (c)   Stairways and lifts are the preferred alternative to major
topographic alterations for achieving access up, and down, steep slopes to
shore areas. Stairways and lifts must meet the following design requirements:
            1.   Stairways and lifts must not exceed four feet in width on
residential lots. Wider stairways may be used for commercial properties, or
public open space recreational properties;
            2.   Landings for stairways and lifts on residential lots must not
exceed 32 square feet in area. Landings larger than 32 square feet may be used
for commercial properties, or public open space recreational properties;
            3.   Canopies or roofs are not allowed on stairways, lifts, or
landings;
            4.   Stairways, lifts, and landings may be either constructed above
the ground on posts or pilings, or placed into the ground; provided, they are
designed, and built, in a manner that ensures control of soil erosion;
            5.   Stairways, lifts, and landings must be located in the most
visually inconspicuous portions of lots, as viewed from the surface of the
public water, assuming summer leaf-on conditions, whenever practical; and
            6.   Facilities, such as ramps, lifts, or mobility paths for
physically challenged persons are also allowed for achieving access to shore
areas; provided, that the dimensional, and performance, standards, provided for
herein, are complied with, in addition to the requirements of Minn. Regs.
Chapter 1340.
         (d)   No structure may be placed on a significant historic site in a
manner that affects the values of the site, unless adequate information about
the site has been removed, and documented, in a public repository; and
         (e)   The Zoning Administrator must evaluate possible soil erosion
impacts, and development visibility, from public waters before issuing a permit
for construction of sewage treatment systems, roads, driveways, structures, or
other improvements on steep slopes. When determined necessary, conditions must
be attached to issued permits to prevent erosion, and to preserve existing
vegetation screening of structures, vehicles, and other facilities as viewed
from the surface of public waters, assuming summer leaf-on vegetation.
      (2)   Height of structures. All structures in residential districts,
except churches and nonresidential agricultural structures, must not exceed 25
feet in height.
   (F)   Shoreland alterations. Alterations of vegetation and topography will
be regulated to prevent erosion into public waters, fix nutrients, preserve
shoreland aesthetics, preserve historic values, prevent bank slumping, and
protect fish and wildlife habitat.
      (1)   Vegetation alterations.
         (a)   Vegetation alteration necessary for the construction of
structures and sewage treatment systems, and the construction of roads and
parking areas regulated by this subchapter, are exempt from the vegetation
standards that follow.
         (b)   Removal, or alteration, of vegetation, except for agricultural
uses as regulated herein, is allowed, subject to the following standards:
            1.   Intensive vegetation clearing within the Shore Impact Zone,
and on steep slopes, is not allowed; and
            2.   In the Shore Impact Zone, and on steep slopes, limited
clearing of trees is allowed to provide a view to the water from the principal
dwelling site, and to accommodate the placement of stairways and landings,
picnic areas, access paths, livestock watering areas, beach and watercraft
access areas, and permitted water-oriented accessory structures or facilities;
provided, that:
               a.   The screening of structures, vehicles, or other facilities,
as viewed from the water, assuming summer leaf-on conditions, is not
substantially reduced;
               b.   Along rivers, existing shading of water surfaces is
preserved; and
               c.   The above provisions are not applicable to the removal of
trees, limbs, or branches that are dead, diseased, or pose safety hazards.
      (2)   Topographic alterations/grading and filling.
         (a)   Grading and filling, and excavations necessary for the
construction of structures, sewage treatment systems, and driveways, under
validly issued construction permits for these facilities, do not require the
issuance of a separate grading and filling permit. However, the grading and
filling standards in this division (F)(2) must be incorporated into the
issuance of permits for construction of structures, sewage treatment systems,
and driveways.
         (b)   Notwithstanding division (F)(2)(a) above, a grading and filling
permit will be required for:
            1.   The movement of more than ten cubic yards of material on steep
slopes, or within the Shore Impact Zone; and
            2.   The movement of more than 50 cubic yards of material outside
of steep slopes and the Shore Impact Zone.
         (c)   The following considerations and conditions must be adhered to
during the issuance of construction permits, grading and filling permits,
special use permits, variances, and subdivision approvals:
            1.   Grading, or filling, in any type 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8
wetland must be evaluated to determine how extensively the proposed activity
would affect the following functional qualities of the wetland (this evaluation
must also include a determination of whether the wetland alteration being
proposed requires permits, reviews, or approvals by other local, state, or
federal agencies, such as a watershed district, the State Department of Natural
Resources, or the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The applicant will be
so advised):
               a.   Sediment and pollutant trapping and retention;
               b.   Storage of surface runoff to prevent, or reduce, flood
damage;
               c.   Fish and wildlife habitat;
               d.   Recreational use;
               e.   Shoreline, or bank, stabilization; and
               f.   Noteworthiness, including special qualities, such as
historic significance, critical habitat for endangered plants and animals, or
others.
            2.   Alterations must be designed, and conducted, in a manner that
ensures only the smallest amount of bare ground is exposed for the shortest
time possible;
            3.   Mulches, or similar materials, must be used where necessary
for temporary bare soil coverage, and a permanent vegetation cover must be
established as soon as possible;
            4.   Methods to minimize soil erosion, and to trap sediments before
they reach any surface water feature, must be used;
            5.   Altered areas must be stabilized to acceptable erosion control
standards consistent with the field office technical guides of the local soil
and water conservation districts, and the United States Soil Conservation
Service;
            6.   Fill, or excavated material, must not be placed in a manner
that creates an unstable slope;
            7.   Plans to place fill, or excavated material, on steep slopes
must be reviewed by qualified professionals for continued slope stability, and
must not create finished slopes of 30% or greater;
            8.   Any alterations below the ordinary high water level of public
waters must first be authorized by the Commissioner under M.S. § 103G.245, as
it may be amended from time to time;
            9.   Alterations of topography must only be allowed if they are
accessory, or special, uses, and do not adversely affect adjacent, or nearby,
properties; and
            10.   Placement of natural rock riprap, including associated
grading of the shoreline and placement of a filter blanket, is permitted if the
finished slope does not exceed three feet horizontal to the one-foot vertical;
the landward extent of the riprap is within ten feet of the ordinary high water
level; and the height of the riprap above the ordinary high water level does
not exceed three feet.
         (d)   Excavations, where the intended purpose is connection to a
public water, such as boat slips, canals, lagoons, and harbors, must be
controlled by local shoreland controls. Permission for excavations may be given
only after the Commissioner has approved the proposed connection to public
waters.
   (G)   Placement and design of roads, driveways, and parking areas.
      (1)   Public and private roads, parking areas design. Public and private
roads, and parking areas, must be designed to take advantage of natural
vegetation and topography to achieve maximum screening from view from public
waters. Documentation must be provided by a qualified individual that all
roads, and parking areas, are designed, and constructed, to minimize, and
control, erosion to public waters consistent with the field office technical
guides of the local soil and water conservation district, or other applicable
technical materials.
      (2)   Structure setbacks. Roads, driveways, and parking areas must meet
structure setbacks, and must not be placed within the Shore Impact Zone when
other reasonable, and feasible, placement alternatives exist. If no
alternatives exist, they may be placed within these areas, and must be designed
to minimize adverse impacts.
      (3)   Public, and private, watercraft access. Public, and private,
watercraft access ramps, approach roads, and access-related parking areas may
be placed within shore impact zones; provided, the vegetative screening and
erosion control conditions of this provision are met. For private facilities,
the grading and filling provisions provided for herein must be met.
   (H)   Stormwater management. The following general, and specific, standards
shall apply:
      (1)   General standards.
         (a)   When possible, existing natural drainage ways, wetlands, and
vegetated soil surfaces must be used to convey, store, filter, and retain
stormwater runoff before discharge to public waters;
         (b)   Development must be planned, and conducted, in a manner that
will minimize the extent of disturbed areas, runoff velocities, erosion
potential, and reduce, and delay, runoff volumes. Disturbed areas must be
stabilized, and protected, as soon as possible, and facilities, or methods
used, to retain sediment on the site; and
         (c)   When development density, topographic features, and soil, and
vegetation, conditions are not sufficient to adequately handle stormwater
runoff using natural features and vegetation, various types of constructed
facilities, such as diversions, settling basins, skimming devices, dikes,
waterways, and ponds may be used. Preference must be given to designs using
surface drainage, vegetation, and infiltration rather than buried pipes, and
human-made materials and facilities.
      (2)   Specific standards.
         (a)   Impervious surface coverage of lots must not exceed 25% of the
lot area;
         (b)   When constructed facilities are used for stormwater management,
documentation must be provided by a qualified individual that they are
designed, and installed, consistent with the field office technical guide of
the local soil and water conservation districts; and
         (c)   New constructed stormwater outfalls to public waters must
provide for filtering, or settling, of suspended solids, and skimming of
surface debris before discharge.
   (I)   Specific provisions for commercial, industrial, public/semi-public,
agricultural, forestry, and extractive uses, and mining of metallic minerals
and peat.
      (1)   Standards for commercial, industrial, public, and semi-public uses
         (a)   Surface water-oriented commercial uses and industrial, public,
or semi-public uses with similar needs to have access to, and use of, public
waters may be located on parcels, or lots, with frontage on public waters.
Those uses with water-oriented needs must meet the following standards:
            1.   In addition to meeting impervious coverage limits, setbacks,
and other zoning standards in this section, the uses must be designed to
incorporate topographic, and vegetative, screening of parking areas and
structures;
            2.   Uses that require short-term watercraft mooring for patrons
must centralize these facilities and design them to avoid obstructions of
navigation, and to be the minimum size necessary to meet the need; and
            3.   Uses that depend on patrons arriving by watercraft may use
signs and lighting to convey needed information to the public, subject to the
following general standards:
               a.   No advertising signs, or supporting facilities for signs,
may be placed in, or upon, public waters. Signs conveying information, or
safety messages, may be placed in, or on, public waters by a public authority,
or under a permit issued by the County Sheriff;
               b.   Signs may be placed, when necessary, within the Shore
Impact Zone if they are designed, and sized, to be the minimum necessary to
convey needed information. They must only convey the location, and name, of the
establishment, and the general types of goods or services available;
               c.   Signs must not contain other detailed information, such as
product brands and prices, must not be located higher than ten feet above the
ground, and must not exceed 32 square feet in size. If illuminated by
artificial lights, the lights must be shielded, or directed, to prevent
illumination out across public waters; and
               d.   Other outside lighting may be located within the Shore
Impact Zone, or over public waters, if it is used primarily to illuminate
potential safety hazards, and is shielded, or otherwise directed, to prevent
direct illumination out across public waters. This does not preclude use of
navigational lights.
         (b)   Uses without water-oriented needs must be located on lots, or
parcels, without public waters frontage, or, if located on lots, or parcels,
with public waters frontage, must either be set back double the normal ordinary
high water level setback, or be substantially screened from view from the water
by vegetation or topography, assuming summer leaf-on conditions.
      (2)   Agriculture use standards.
         (a)   General cultivation, farming, grazing, nurseries, horticulture,
truck farming, sod farming, and wild crop harvesting are permitted uses of
steep slopes and shores, and impact zones are maintained in permanent
vegetation, or operated under an approved conservation plan (resource
management systems) consistent with the field office technical guides of the
local soil and water conservation districts, or the United States Soil
Conservation Service, as provided by a qualified individual or agency. The
Shore Impact Zone for parcels with permitted agricultural land uses is equal to
a line parallel to, and 50 feet from, the ordinary high water level.
         (b)   Use of fertilizer, pesticides, or animal wastes within
shorelands must be done in such a way as to minimize any impact upon the Shore
Impact Zone, or public waters, by proper application, as per provisions in the
Water Quality in Agriculture “Best Management Practices in Minnesota”, or by
the use of earth or vegetation.
         (c)   Animal feedlots must meet the following standards:
            1.   New feedlots must not be located in the shoreland of
watercourses, and must meet a minimum setback of 300 feet from the ordinary
high water level of all public water basins;
            2.   Modifications, or expansions, to existing feedlots that are
located within 300 feet of the ordinary high water level are allowed if they do
not further encroach into the existing ordinary high water level setback; and
            3.   A certificate of compliance, interim permit, or animal feedlot
permit, when required, must be obtained by the owner, or operator, of an animal
feedlot.
      (3)   Extractive use standards.
         (a)   An extractive use site development, and restoration, plan must
be developed, approved, and followed over the course of operation of the site.
The plan must address dust, noise, possible pollutant discharges, hours and
duration of operation, and anticipated vegetation and topographic alterations.
It must also identify actions to be taken during operation to mitigate adverse
environmental impacts, particularly erosion, and must clearly explain how the
site will be rehabilitated after extractive activities end.
         (b)   Processing machinery must be located consistent with setback
standards for structures from ordinary high water levels of public waters.
   (J)   Special uses. Special uses allowable within shoreland areas shall be
subject to the review and approval procedures, and criteria and conditions for
review of special uses established in this chapter. The following additional
evaluation criteria and special conditions apply within shoreland areas:
      (1)   Evaluation criteria. A thorough evaluation of the waterbody and the
topographic, vegetation, and soils conditions on the site must be made to
ensure:
         (a)   The prevention of soil erosion, or other possible pollution of
public waters, both during, and after, construction;
         (b)   The visibility of structures, and other facilities, as viewed
from public waters is limited;
         (c)   The site is adequate for water supply and on-site sewage
treatment; and
         (d)   The types, uses, and numbers of watercraft that the project will
generate are compatible in relation to the suitability of public waters to
safety accommodate these watercraft.
      (2)   Conditions attached to special use permits. The Planning and Zoning
Commission, or Council, upon consideration of the criteria listed above, and
the purposes of this section, shall attach the conditions to the issuance of
the special use permits as it deems necessary to fulfill the purposes of this
subchapter. The conditions may include, but are not limited to, the following:
         (a)   Increased setbacks from the ordinary high water level;
         (b)   Limitations on the natural vegetation to be removed, or the
requirement that additional vegetation be planted; and
         (c)   Special provisions for the location, design, and use of
structures, sewage treatment systems, watercraft launching and docking areas,
and vehicle parking areas.
   (K)   Water supply and sewage treatment.
      (1)   Water supply. Any use proposed within the shoreland area must be
served by a public water supply for domestic purposes meeting, or exceeding,
standards for water quality of the State Department of Health and the State
Pollution Control Agency.
      (2)   Sewage treatment. Any premises used for human occupancy must be
provided with an adequate method of sewage treatment, as follows:
         (a)   Publicly-owned sewer systems must be used where available; and
         (b)   Existing, and non-conforming, sewage treatment systems shall be
eliminated from use within two years of the effective date of this subchapter,
and the use will be connected to city sewer services.
(Prior Code, § 11.60)
§ 156.216 NON-CONFORMITIES.
   (A)   All legally established non-conformities on the effective date of this
subchapter may continue, but they will be managed according to the applicable
state statutes, and other regulations of the city for the subjects of
alterations and additions, repair after damage, discontinuance of use, and
intensification of use.
   (B)   The following standards will also apply in shoreland areas:
      (1)   Construction on non-conforming lots of record.
         (a)   Lots of record in the office of the County Recorder on the
effective date of local shoreland controls that do not meet the requirements of
this subchapter may be allowed as building sites without variances from lot
size requirements; provided, the use is permitted in the zoning district, the
lot has been in separate ownership from abutting lands at all times since it
became substandard, was created compliant with official controls in effect at
the time, and sewage treatment and setback requirements of this subchapter are
met;
         (b)   A variance from setback requirements must be obtained before any
use, sewage treatment system, or building permit is issued for a lot. In
evaluating the variance, the Board of Adjustment shall consider sewage
treatment and water supply capabilities, or constraints, of the lot, and shall
deny the variance if adequate facilities cannot be provided; and
         (c)   If, in a group of two, or more, contiguous lots under the same
ownership, any individual lot does not meet the requirements of this
subchapter, the lot must not be considered as a separate parcel of land for the
purposes of sale or development. The lot must be combined with the one, or
more, contiguous lots so they equal one, or more, parcels of land, each meeting
the requirements of this subchapter as much as possible.
      (2)   Additions/expansions to non-conforming structures.
         (a)   All additions, or expansions, to the outside dimensions of an
existing, non-conforming structure must meet the setback, height, and other
requirements of this subchapter. Any deviation from these requirements must be
authorized by a variance, as provided for herein;
         (b)   Deck additions may be allowed without a variance to a structure
not meeting the required setback from the ordinary high water level if all of
the following criteria and standards are met:
            1.   The structure existed on the date the structure setbacks were
established;
            2.   A thorough evaluation of the property and structure reveals no
reasonable location for a deck meeting, or exceeding, the existing ordinary
high water level setback of the structure;
            3.   The deck encroachment toward the ordinary high water level
does not exceed 15% of the existing setback of the structure from the ordinary
high water level, or does not encroach closer than 30 feet, whichever is more
restrictive; and
            4.   The deck is constructed primarily of wood, and is not roofed
or screened.
      (3)   Non-conforming sewage treatment systems.
         (a)   A sewage treatment system not meeting the requirements of this
subchapter must be upgraded, at a minimum, at any time a permit, or variance,
of any type is required for any improvement on, or use of, the property. For
the purposes of this provision, a sewage treatment system shall not be
considered non-conforming if the only deficiency is the sewage treatment
system’s improper setback from the ordinary high water level; and
         (b)   The Council has, by formal resolution, notified the Commissioner
of its program to identify non-conforming sewage treatment systems. Upon
adoption of this subchapter, the Building Official will conduct a systematic
on-site inspection program to identify current septic systems located within
the shoreland area. Once identified, a determination will be made as to whether
the septic system conforms to Minn. Rules Chapter 7080. Following the initial
inspection, the Building Official will conduct yearly inspections of all septic
systems to determine whether the systems conform to the rules established. The
city will require upgrading, or replacement, of any non-conforming system
identified by this program within a reasonable period of time, which will not
exceed two years, or preferably, connection to city sewer services. If the non-
conforming system is located within the city, the property owner will be
required to hook up to the city sewage system. Sewage systems installed
according to all applicable local shoreland management standards adopted under
M.S. § 103F.211, as it may be amended from time to time, in effect at the time
of installation may be considered as conforming, unless they are determined to
be failing, except that systems using cesspools, leaching pits, seepage pits,
or other deep disposal methods, or systems, with less soil treatment area
separation above groundwater than required by the State Pollution Agency’s
Chapter 7080 for design of on-site sewage treatment systems, shall be
considered non-conforming.
(Prior Code, § 11.60)
§ 156.217 SUBDIVISION, PLATTING PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Land suitability. Each lot created through subdivision must be
suitable in its natural state for the proposed use with minimal alteration.
Suitability analysis by the city shall consider susceptibility to flooding,
existence of wetlands, soil and rock formations with severe limitations for
development, severe erosion potential, steep topography, inadequate water
supply, or sewage treatment capabilities, near shore aquatic conditions
unsuitable for water-based recreation, important fish and wildlife habitat,
presence of significant historic sites, or any other feature of the natural
land likely to be harmful to the health, safety, or welfare of future residents
of the proposed subdivision, or of the city.
   (B)   Consistency with other controls. Subdivisions must conform to all
official controls of the city. A subdivision will not be approved where a later
variance from one, or more, standards in official controls would be needed to
use the lots for their intended purpose. In areas not served by publicly-owned
sewer and water systems, a subdivision will not be approved unless domestic
water supply is available, and a sewage treatment system consistent with the
provisions of this subchapter can be provided for every lot. Each lot shall
meet the minimum lot size and dimensional requirements herein, including at
least a minimum contiguous lawn area that is free of limiting factors
sufficient for the construction of two standard soil treatment systems. Lots
that would require use of holding tanks must not be approved.
   (C)   Information requirements. Sufficient information must be submitted by
the applicant for the city to make a determination of land suitability. The
information shall include at least the following:
      (1)   Topographic contours at ten-foot intervals, or less, from the

to become a separately described tract which does not meet the minimum
standards of the zoning district in which it is located or which does not have
street frontage and access to municipal services;
      (5)   The division does not result in a split zoning classification on a
single lot; and

this chapter, or the zoning map, shall be considered by the Planning and Zoning
Commission within a one-year period following a denial of the request, except
the Planning and Zoning Commission may permit a new application if, in the
