§ 10.20 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Any licensed peace officer of the city’s Police Department, or the
County Sheriff, or any Deputy Sheriff shall have the authority to enforce any
provision of this code.
   (B)   As permitted by M.S. § 626.862, as it may be amended from time to
time, the City Clerk- Treasurer shall have the authority to administer and
enforce this code. In addition, under that statutory authority, certain
individuals designated within the code or by the Clerk-Treasurer or City
Council shall have the authority to administer and enforce the provisions
specified. All and any person or persons designated may issue a citation in
lieu of arrest or continued detention to enforce any provision of the code.
   (C)   The City Clerk-Treasurer and any city official or employee designated
by this code who has the responsibility to perform a duty under this code may
with the permission of a licensee of a business or owner of any property or
resident of a dwelling, or other person in control of any premises, inspect or
otherwise enter any property to enforce compliance with this code.
   (D)   If the licensee, owner, resident or other person in control of a
premises objects to the inspection of or entrance to the property, the City
Clerk-Treasurer, peace officer or any employee or official charged with the
duty of enforcing the provisions of this code may, upon a showing that probable
cause exists for the issuance of a valid search warrant from a court of
competent jurisdiction, petition and obtain a search warrant before conducting
the inspection or otherwise entering the property. This warrant shall be only
to determine whether the provisions of this code enacted to protect the health,
safety and welfare of the people are being complied with and to enforce these
provisions only, and no criminal charges shall be made as a result of the
warrant. No warrant shall be issued unless there be probable cause to issue the
warrant. Probable cause occurs if the search is reasonable. Probable cause does
not depend on specific knowledge of the condition of a particular property.
   (E)   Every licensee, owner, resident or other person in control of property
within the city shall permit at reasonable times inspections of or entrance to
the property by the City Clerk-Treasurer or any other authorized city officer
or employee only to determine whether the provisions of this code enacted to
protect the health, safety and welfare of the people are being complied with
and to enforce these provisions. Unreasonable refusal to permit the inspection
of or entrance to the property shall be grounds for termination of any and all
permits, licenses or city service to the property. Mailed notice shall be given
to the licensee, owner, resident or other person in control of the property,
stating the grounds for the termination, and the licensee, owner, resident or
other person in control of the property shall be given an opportunity to appear
before the City Clerk-Treasurer to object to the termination before it occurs,
subject to appeal of the Clerk-Treasurer’s decision to the City Council at a
regularly scheduled or special meeting.
   (F)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of
the city to enter private property in urgent emergency situations where there
is an imminent danger in order to protect the public health, safety and
welfare.
§ 10.98 SUPPLEMENTAL ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES.
   (A)   In addition to those administrative penalties established in this code
and the enforcement powers granted in §
10.20, the City Council is authorized to create by resolution, adopted by a
majority of the members of the Council, supplemental administrative penalties.
The resolution may not proscribe administrative penalties for traffic offenses
designated by M.S. § 169.999, as it may be amended from time to time.
   (B)   These administrative penalty procedures in this section are intended
to provide the public and the city with an informal, cost effective and
expeditious alternative to traditional criminal charges for violations of
certain provisions of this code. The procedures are intended to be voluntary on
the part of those who have been charged with those offenses.
   (C)   Administrative penalties for violations of various provisions of the
code, other than those penalties established in the code or in statutes that
are adopted by reference, may be established from time to time by resolution of
a majority of the members of the City Council. In order to be effective, an
administrative penalty for a particular violation must be established before
the violation occurred.
   (D)   In the discretion of the peace officer, City Clerk-Treasurer or other
person giving notice of an alleged violation of a provision of this code, in a
written notice of an alleged violation, sent by first class mail to the person
who is alleged to have violated the code, the person giving notice may request
the payment of a voluntary administrative penalty for the violation directly to
the City Clerk-Treasurer within 14 days of the notice of the violation. A
sample notice is contained in the Appendix to this chapter. In the sole
discretion of the person giving the notice of the alleged violation, the time
for payment may be extended an additional 14 days, whether or not requested by
the person to whom the notice has been given. In addition to the administrative
penalty, the person giving notice may request in the notice to the alleged
violator to adopt a compliance plan to correct the situation resulting in the
alleged violation and may provide that if the alleged violator corrects the
situation resulting in the alleged violation within the time specified in the
notice, that the payment of the administrative penalty will be waived.
   (E)   At any time before the payment of the administrative penalty is due,
the person who has been given notice of an alleged violation may request to
appear before the City Council to contest the request for payment of the
penalty. After a hearing before the Council, the Council may determine to
withdraw the request for payment or to renew the request for payment. Because
the payment of the administrative penalty is voluntary, there shall be no
appeal from the decision of the Council.
   (F)   At any time after the date the payment of the administrative penalty
is due, if the administrative penalty remains unpaid or the situation creating
the alleged violation remains uncorrected, the city, through its Attorney, may
bring criminal charges in accordance with state law and this code. Likewise,
the city, in its discretion, may bring criminal charges in the first instance,
rather than requesting the payment of an administrative penalty, even if a
penalty for the particular violation has been established by Council
resolution. If the administrative penalty is paid, or if any requested
correction of the situation resulting in the violation is completed, no
criminal charges shall be initiated by the city for the alleged violation.
§ 10.99 GENERAL PENALTY AND ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Any person, firm or corporation who violates any provision of this
code for which another penalty is not specifically provided, shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor. The penalty which may be imposed for
any crime which is a misdemeanor under this code, including Minnesota Statutes
specifically adopted by reference, shall be a sentence of not more than 90 days
or a fine of not more than $1,000, or both.
   (B)   Any person, firm or corporation who violates any provision of this
code, including Minnesota Statutes specifically adopted by reference, which is
designated to be a petty misdemeanor shall, upon conviction be guilty of a
petty misdemeanor. The penalty which may be imposed for any petty offense which
is a petty misdemeanor shall be a sentence of a fine of not more than $300.
   (C)   Pursuant to M.S. § 631.48, as it may be amended from time to time, in
either the case of a misdemeanor or a petty misdemeanor, the costs of
prosecution may be added. A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon
each day during which a violation occurs or continues.
   (D)   The failure of any officer or employee of the city to perform any
official duty imposed by this code shall not subject the officer or employee to
the penalty imposed for a violation.
   (E)   In addition to any penalties provided for in this section or in §
10.98, if any person, firm or corporation fails to comply with any provision of
this code, the Council or any city official designated by it, may institute
appropriate proceedings at law or at equity to restrain, correct or abate the
violation.

penalty is voluntary, there shall be no appeal from the decision of the
Council.
    If you pay the administrative penalty, the city will not initiate criminal
proceedings for this alleged violation. However, the Council, or any city
official designated by it, may institute appropriate proceedings at law or at
equity to restrain, correct or abate the violation.

§ 34.08 EXAMINATION OF RETURN, ADJUSTMENTS, NOTICES AND DEMANDS.
   The Tax Administrator shall, after return is filed, examine the same and
make any investigation or examination of records and accounts of the person
making the return deemed necessary for determining its correctness. The tax

tax due is found to be greater than that paid, the excess shall be paid to the
Tax Administrator ten days after receipt of a notice thereof given either
personally or sent by registered mail to the address shown on the return. If
the tax paid is greater than the tax found to be due, the excess shall be
refunded to the person who paid the tax to the Tax Administrator ten days after

assess a tax on the basis thereof, which tax (less any payments therefore made
on account of the tax for the taxable period covered by the return) shall be

each customer at regular intervals as established by City Council resolution.
The amount listed on the statement shall be due on or before a date prescribed
by City Council resolution, as set forth on the statement. If payment is not
made by that date, there shall be added to the amount due a penalty in an
amount as established by City Council resolution. Further, the City Council may
establish, by resolution, a prepayment discount. All payments for water, sewer
or garbage or refuse shall be applied first to delinquent payments, if any, and
thereafter to current billings. Except where the customer specifically provides
otherwise, all payments shall be applied to that portion of the customer’s
utility charge as determined by the City Clerk-Treasurer or designee.
(Ord. 193, passed 4-26-2011)
§ 50.05 SHUT OFF FOR NON-PAYMENT.
   (A)   Delinquent accounts, generally. The city shall endeavor to collect
delinquent accounts promptly. In any case where satisfactory arrangements for
payment of water and sewer charges have not been made, the City Clerk-Treasurer
or designee may, after the procedural requirements of division (B) below have
been complied with, discontinue service to the delinquent customer by shutting
off the water at the stop box. When water service to any premises has been
discontinued, service shall not be restored except upon the payment of all
delinquent amounts for water and sewer charges due, plus a fee for
disconnection and reconnection as set by City Council resolution.
   (B)   Procedure. Water shall not be shut off under division (A) above until
notice and an opportunity for a hearing have first been given to the owner and
the occupant of the premises involved. The notice shall be mailed by first
class mail to the service address, and if different than the service address,
the last known address of the owner. The notice shall state that if payment is
not made before a date stated in the notice but not less than 15 days after the
date on which the notice is given, the water supply to the premises will be
shut off. The notice shall clearly inform the customer of the available
opportunities to present to the city an objection to the bill, and shall
identify the telephone number, address, and officer or employee who will handle
the customer’s complaint and who has the authority to review the facts and
files and to correct any errors in the billing. The notice shall also state
that the occupant or owner may before the date demand a hearing on the matter,
in which case the supply will not be cut off until after the hearing is held.
If the customer requests a hearing before the date specified, a hearing shall
be held on the matter by the City Council or a panel or commission established
by the City Council at least one week after the date on which the request is
made. If, as a result of the hearing, the City Council, or commission or panel,
finds that the amount claimed to be owing is actually due and unpaid and that
there is no legal reason why the water supply of the delinquent customer may
not be shut off in accordance with this chapter, the city may shut off the
supply.

Water and Waste Water, published by the American Public Health Association and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at the control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb and property, the particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premise is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from
24-hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pHs are determined from periodic
grab samples.
   (K)   No statement contained in this section be construed as preventing any
special agreement or arrangement between the city and any industrial concern
whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by
the city for treatment, subject to payment therefore, in accordance with §
52.20, by the industrial concern, provided the payments are in accordance with
federal and state guidelines for user charge system.
   (L)   Each residential household, commercial complex, commercial business or
industry shall pay to the city the established amount set forth by EPA user
charge system for the proper operation of the sewage treatment plant. Any

WASTE WATER SERVICE CHARGES AND INDUSTRIAL WASTE COST RECOVERY
§ 52.20 WASTE WATER SERVICE CHARGES.
   (A)   The City Council shall, by resolution, determine the waste water
service charges for all users of the facility. The charges shall be determined
and established upon examination of actual and projected expenses in operating
the system, including the debt service, if any, any changes in operations, and
maintenance costs including replacement costs. The charges shall be determined
by the Council’s sole discretion, to ensure that the city will have adequate
funds to operate the system including payment of debt services, if any, changes
in operations, and maintenance costs, including replacement costs, and to
ensure that the users of the system pay directly an appropriate share of the
costs. The waste water service charge for the use of and for service supplied
by the waste water facilities of the city shall consist of a basic user charge
for operation and maintenance plus replacement, a debt service charge, if
applicable, and a surcharge, if applicable.
   (B)   The debt service charge shall be computed by dividing the annual debt
service of all outstanding loans by the number of users. Through further
divisions, the monthly debt service charges can be computed.
   (C)   The basic user charge shall be based on water usage as recorded by
water meters and/or sewage meters for wastes having the following normal
concentrations:
      (1)   A five-day 20°C biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of 200 mg/l; and
      (2)   A suspended solids (SS) content of 250 mg/l.
   (D)   It shall consist of operation and maintenance costs plus replacement
and shall be computed as follows:
      (1)   Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and
maintain the waste water facilities including a replacement fund for the year,
for all works categories;
      (2)   Proportion the estimated costs to waste water facility categories
by volume, suspended solids and BOD, if possible;
      (3)   Estimate waste water volume, pounds of SS and pounds of BOD to be
treated;
      (4)   Proportion the estimated costs to nonindustrial and industrial
users by volume, suspended solids and BOD;
      (5)   Compute costs per 1,000 gallons for normal sewage strength; and
      (6)   Compute surcharge costs per 1,000 gallons per mg/l in excess of
normal sewage strength for BOD and SS.
   (E)   A surcharge will be levied to all users whose waters exceed the normal
concentrations for BOD (200 mg/l) and SS (250 mg/l). The surcharge will be
based on water usage as recorded by water meters and/or sewage meters for all
wastes which exceed the 200 mg/l and 250 mg/l concentration for BOD and SS
respectively. Division (F) below specifies the procedure to compute a
surcharge.
   (F)   The adequacy of the waste water service charge shall be reviewed
periodically, and at least annually by the City Clerk-Treasurer for the city in
its annual audit report. The waste water service charge shall be revised
periodically to reflect a change in debt service or a change in operation and
maintenance costs including replacement costs.

§ 90.03 REQUIREMENTS FOR LICENSE.
   (A)   Owners have the option of two types of licenses - a lifetime license

year. A lifetime license is valid for the lifetime of the animal, no matter the
duration. The annual and lifetime licenses shall be issued only upon payment to
the City Clerk-Treasurer of the fees as determined by City Council resolution.
   (B)   No license shall be issued for an altered (neutered or spayed) dog or

statement or certificate from a qualified veterinarian showing that the cat or
dog to be licensed has been given a vaccination against rabies within the time
hereinafter specified. No license shall be granted for any dog which has not
been vaccinated against rabies within three years prior to the application. No
license shall be granted for any cat which has not been vaccinated against
rabies within two years prior to the application. The owner must file written
proof thereof in the City Clerk-Treasurer's office, or the license shall
automatically be invalidated. Vaccinations shall be performed only by a doctor
qualified to practice veterinarian medicine in the state in which the dog or
cat is vaccinated. If a qualified veterinarian certifies that a rabies shot
will be dangerous to the health of a dog or cat, as a result of that animal's
advanced age or health, the requirement of vaccination shall be waived upon
filing the written certificate.
   (D)   (1)   Each dog and cat shall be licensed within one month after a
valid license is required by this chapter.
      (2)   To specify:
         (a)   Upon expiration of a prior license;

thereafter.
   (E)   Valid license tags shall be securely affixed to animals as required
herein at all times. In the event a tag is lost or destroyed, it shall be the
responsibility of the owner to obtain a duplicate immediately (no one-month
delay). Duplicate tags shall be issued by the city at cost. In the event a
valid license is not obtained within the time period stated herein, a penalty
in the amount determined by City Council resolution shall be assessed to the
owner with this penalty to be in addition to all other license fees,
impoundment fees or fines. Valid licenses are not transferable except when the
specific dog or cat in question is transferred to a different resident within
the city. License fees, and late payment fees, may be amended by resolution of
the City Council at any time.

ABANDONED, JUNKED OR INOPERATIVE MOTOR VEHICLES
§ 91.01 DECLARATION OF PUBLIC NUISANCE.
   The accumulation or storage of abandoned, wrecked, junked, partially
dismantled or inoperative vehicles within the city is hereby found to create an
unsightly condition tending to reduce the value of private property, to invite
plundering, to create fire hazards, to attract vermin and to constitute an
attractive nuisance creating a hazard to the health and safety of the public.
The accumulation and outside storage of the vehicles is determined to be in the
nature of rubbish, litter and unsightly debris, which adversely affect the
health, safety and general welfare of the community. Therefore, the
accumulation and storage of the vehicles on public or private property is
hereby declared to constitute a public nuisance which may be abated as provided
herein or as provided under any other ordinance of the city or by the laws of
the state.
(Ord. 115, passed 9-23-1991)
§ 91.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ABANDONED VEHICLE. Any vehicle to which the last registered owner of record
thereof has relinquished dominion, or that has remained for a period of more
than 48 hours on public property illegally or lacking vital component parts, or
that has remained for a period of more than 48 hours on private property
without the consent of the person in control of the property, or that has been
in an inoperable condition for more than 48 hours, so that it has no
substantial potential for further use consistent with its usual functions,
whether it is located on private or public property unless it is kept in an
enclosed garage or storage building. It shall also mean a motor vehicle
voluntarily surrendered by its owner to and accepted by the city. Appropriately
licensed but inoperative pioneer, classic or collector vehicles as defined by
M.S. § 168.10, as it may be amended from time to time, may be stored on the
owner’s property, provided that the vehicles are screened from public view by
means of a six-foot high opaque fence.
   INOPERATIVE OR INOPERABLE VEHICLES. Any motor vehicle which cannot be driven
or propelled under its own power in its existing condition or which cannot be

SYNTHETIC DETERGENTS
§ 91.40 PREAMBLE.
   (A)   The City Council, in the exercise of its police powers, does hereby
find, based upon substantial scientific evidence produced by the Federal Water
Quality Administration of the United States, that the presence of excessive
phosphorus content in present lakes and streams encourages uncontrolled growth
of algae and other aquatic plants, and that as algae and other aquatic plants
die and decay, they use up the oxygen in the water, thus causing fish to
suffocate, and also, as the growth of algae and other aquatic plants continues,
eventually this decayed vegetation fills in the body of water and ends its
existence.
   (B)   The City Council further finds that in the exercise of its police
power for the benefit of the citizens of the city it is essential to the
welfare of the city that lakes and aquatic fish life be preserved, not only
within Whitewater Lake contained within the corporate limits of the city, but
in the Lake Superior Basin, into which the Whitewater Lake eventually flows;
and to that end, that the household consumer of synthetic detergents purchased
within the city should be informed of the phosphorus content of the detergents
at the place of purchase within the city, so as to help the consumer choose
washing products containing the minimum amounts of potentially polluting
ingredients.

   (B)   Accordingly, the city hereby enacts this new chapter of this code
relating to right-of-way permits and administration. This chapter imposes
reasonable regulation on the placement and maintenance of facilities and
equipment currently within its rights-of-way or to be placed therein at some
future time. It is intended to complement the regulatory roles of state and

chapter provides for recovery of out-of-pocket and projected costs from persons
using the public rights-of-way.

chapter shall also be interpreted consistent with Minnesota Rules 7819.0050
through 7819.9950 and Minnesota Rules Chapter 7560, as they be amended from
time to time, where possible. To the extent any provision of this chapter
cannot be interpreted consistently with the Minnesota Rules, that
interpretation most consistent with the Act and other applicable statutory and
case law is intended. This chapter shall not be interpreted to limit the
regulatory and police powers of the city to adopt and enforce general
ordinances necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public.

without first having obtained the appropriate right-of-way permit from the city
to do so.
   (A)   Excavation permit. An excavation permit is required by a registrant to
excavate that part of the right-of-way described in the permit and to hinder
free and open passage over the specified portion of the right-of-way by placing
facilities described therein, to the extent and for the duration specified
therein.
   (B)   Obstruction permit. An obstruction permit is required by a registrant
to hinder free and open passage over the specified portion of right-of-way by
placing equipment described therein on the right-of-way, to the extent and for
the duration specified therein. An obstruction permit is not required if a
person already possesses a valid excavation permit for the same project.
   (C)   Small wireless facility permit. A small wireless facility permit is
required by a registrant to erect or install a wireless support structure, to
collocate a small wireless facility, or to otherwise install a small wireless
facility in the specified portion of the right-of-way, to the extent specified
therein, provided that such permit shall remain in effect for the length of
time the facility is in use, unless lawfully revoked.
§ 95.06 PERMIT FEES.
   (A)   Excavation permit fee. The city shall impose an excavation permit fee
in an amount sufficient to recover:
      (1)   Management costs; and
      (2)   Degradation costs, if applicable.
   (B)   Obstruction permit fee. The city shall impose an obstruction permit
fee in an amount sufficient to recover management costs.

      (2)   City engineering, make-ready and construction costs associated with
collocation of small wireless facilities.
   (D)   Payment of permit fees. No excavation permit or obstruction permit
shall be issued without payment of excavation or obstruction permit fees. The
city may allow the applicant to pay the fees within 30 days of billing.
   (E)   Nonrefundable. Permit fees that were paid for a permit that the city
has revoked for a breach as stated in §
95.16 are not refundable.
   (F)   Application to franchises. Unless otherwise agreed to in a franchise,
management costs may be charged separately from and in addition to the
franchise fees imposed on a right-of-way user in the franchise.
§ 95.07 RIGHT-OF-WAY PATCHING AND RESTORATION.
   (A)   Timing. The work to be done under the excavation permit, and the
patching and restoration of the right-of-way as required herein, must be
completed within the dates specified in the permit, increased by as many days
as work could not be done because of extraordinary circumstances beyond the
control of the permittee or when work was prohibited as unseasonal or
unreasonable under §
95.10.
   (B)   Patch and restoration. The permittee shall patch its own work. The
city may choose either to have the permittee restore the right-of-way or to
restore the right-of-way itself.
      (1)   City restoration. If the city restores the right-of-way, the
permittee shall pay the costs thereof within 30 days of billing. If, during the
36 months following the restoration, the pavement settles due to the
permittee’s improper backfilling, the permittee shall pay to the city, within
30 days of billing, all costs associated with having to correct the defective
work.
      (2)   Permittee restoration. If the permittee restores the right-of-way
itself, it shall at the time of application for an excavation permit post a
construction performance bond in accordance with the provisions of Minnesota
Rule 7819.3000, as it may be amended from time to time.
      (3)   Degradation fee in lieu of restoration. In lieu of right-of-way
restoration, a right-of-way user may elect to pay a degradation fee. However,
the right-of-way user shall remain responsible for patching and the degradation
fee shall not include the cost to accomplish these responsibilities.
   (C)   Standards. The permittee shall perform excavation, backfilling,
patching and restoration according to the standards and with the materials
specified by the city and shall comply with Minnesota Rule 7819.1100, as it may
be amended from time to time.
   (D)   Duty to correct defects. The permittee shall correct defects in
patching or restoration performed by permittee or its agents. The permittee
upon notification from the city, shall correct all restoration work to the
extent necessary, using the method required by the city. The work shall be
completed within five calendar days of the receipt of the notice from the city,
not including days during which work cannot be done because of circumstances
constituting force majeure or days when work is prohibited as unseasonable or
unreasonable under §
95.10.
   (E)   Failure to restore. If the permittee fails to restore the right-of-way
in the manner and to the condition required by the city, or fails to
satisfactorily and timely complete all restoration required by the city, the
city at its option may do the work. In that event the permittee shall pay to
the city, within 30 days of billing, the cost of restoring the right-of-way. If
permittee fails to pay as required, the city may exercise its rights under the
construction performance bond.
§ 95.08 JOINT APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   Joint application. Registrants may jointly apply for permits to
excavate or obstruct the right-of-way at the same place and time.
   (B)   Shared fees. Registrants who apply for permits for the same
obstruction or excavation, which the city does not perform, may share in the
payment of the obstruction or excavation permit fee. In order to obtain a joint
permit, registrants must agree among themselves as to the portion each will pay
and indicate the same on their applications.
   (C)   With city projects. Registrants who join in a scheduled obstruction or
excavation performed by the Director, whether or not it is a joint application
by two or more registrants or a single application, are not required to pay the
obstruction and degradation portions of the permit fee, but a permit would
still be required.
§ 95.09 SUPPLEMENTARY APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   Limitation on area.
      (1)   A right-of-way permit is valid only for the area of the right-of-
way specified in the permit. No permittee may do any work outside the area
specified in the permit, except as provided herein.
      (2)   Any permittee which determines that an area greater than that
specified in the permit must be obstructed or excavated must before working in
that greater area:
         (a)   Make application for a permit extension and pay any additional
fees required thereby; and
         (b)   Be granted a new permit or permit extension.
   (B)   Limitation on dates. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the dates
specified in the permit. No permittee may begin its work before the permit
start date or, except as provided herein, continue working after the end date.
If a permittee does not finish the work by the permit end date, it must apply
for a new permit for the additional time it needs, and receive the new permit
or an extension of the old permit before working after the end date of the
previous permit. This supplementary application must be done before the permit
end date.
§ 95.10 OTHER OBLIGATIONS.
   (A)   Compliance with other laws. Obtaining a right-of-way permit does not
relieve permittee of its duty to obtain all other necessary permits, licenses
and authority and to pay all fees required by the city or other applicable
rule, law or regulation. A permittee shall comply with all requirements of
local, state and federal laws, including M.S. § 216D.01-.09 (“Gopher One-Call
Excavation Notice System”) and Minnesota Rules Chapter 7460, as they may be
amended from time to time. A permittee shall perform all work in conformance
with all applicable codes and established rules and regulations, and is
responsible for all work done in the right-of-way pursuant to its permit,
regardless of who does the work.
   (B)   Prohibited work. Except in an emergency, and with the approval of the
city, no right-of-way obstruction or excavation may be done when seasonally
prohibited, or when conditions are unreasonable for the work.
   (C)   Interference with right-of-way. A permittee shall not so obstruct a
right-of-way that the natural free and clear passage of water through the
gutters or other waterways shall be interfered with. Private vehicles of those
doing work in the right-of-way may not be parked within or next to a permit
area, unless parked in conformance with city parking regulations. The loading
or unloading of trucks must be done solely within the defined permit area
unless specifically authorized by the permit.
   (D)   Trenchless excavation. As a condition of all applicable permits,
permittees employing trenchless excavation methods, including but not limited
to horizontal directional drilling, shall follow all requirements set forth in
M.S. Chapter 216D and Minnesota Rules Chapter 7560, as they may be amended from
time to time, and shall require potholing or open cutting over existing
underground utilities before excavating, as determined by the city.
§ 95.11 DENIAL OR REVOCATION OF PERMIT.
   (A)   Reasons for denial. The city may deny a permit for failure to meet the
requirements and conditions of this chapter or if the city determines that the
denial is necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare or when necessary
to protect the right-of-way and its current use.
   (B)   Procedural requirements. The denial or revocation of a permit must be
made in writing and must document the basis for the denial. The city must
notify the applicant or right-of-way user in writing within three business days
of the decision to deny or revoke a permit. If an application is denied, the
right-of-way user may address the reasons for denial identified by the city and
resubmit its application. If the application is resubmitted within 30 days of
receipt of the notice of denial, no additional application fee shall be
imposed. The city must approve or deny the resubmitted application within 30
days after submission.
§ 95.12 INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS.
   The excavation, backfilling, patching and restoration, and all other work
performed in the right-of-way shall be done in conformance with Minnesota Rules
7819.1100 and 7819.5000, as they may be amended from time to time, and other
applicable local requirements, in so far as they are not inconsistent with the
M.S. §§ 237.162 and 237.163, as they may be amended from time to time.
Installation of service laterals shall be performed in accordance with
Minnesota Rules Chapter 7560, as it may be amended from time to time, and these
ordinances. Service lateral installation is further subject to those
requirements and conditions set forth by the city in the applicable permits
and/or agreements referenced in §
95.17.
§ 95.13 INSPECTION.
   (A)   Notice of completion. When the work under any permit hereunder is
completed, the permittee shall furnish a completion certificate in accordance
with Minnesota Rule 7819.1300, as it may be amended from time to time.
   (B)   Site inspection. The permittee shall make the work-site available to
the city and to all others as authorized by law for inspection at all
reasonable times during the execution of and upon completion of the work.
   (C)   Authority of Director.
      (1)   At the time of inspection, the city may order the immediate
cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the life, health, safety
or well-being of the public.
      (2)   The city may issue an order to the permittee for any work which
does not conform to the terms of the permit or other applicable standards,
conditions or codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the
violation will be cause for revocation of the permit. Within ten days after
issuance of the order, the permittee shall present proof to the city that the
violation has been corrected. If proof has not been presented within the
required time, the city may revoke the permit pursuant to §
95.16.
§ 95.14 WORK DONE WITHOUT A PERMIT.
   (A)   Emergency situations.
      (1)   Each registrant shall immediately notify the city of any event
regarding its facilities which it considers to be an emergency. The registrant
may proceed to take whatever actions are necessary to respond to the emergency.
Excavators’ notification to Gopher State One Call regarding an emergency
situation does not fulfill this requirement. Within two business days after the
occurrence of the emergency, the registrant shall apply for the necessary
permits, pay the fees associated therewith and fulfill the rest of the
requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with the chapter for the
actions it took in response to the emergency.
      (2)   If the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding a registrant’s
facilities, the city will attempt to contact the local representative of each
registrant affected, or potentially affected, by the emergency. In any event,
the city may take whatever action it deems necessary to respond to the
emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the registrant whose facilities
occasioned the emergency.
   (B)   Non-emergency situations. Except in an emergency, any person who,
without first having obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or excavates a
right-of-way must subsequently obtain a permit and, as a penalty, pay double
the normal fee for the permit, pay double all the other fees required by this
chapter, deposit with the city the fees necessary to correct any damage to the
right-of-way and comply with all of the requirements of this chapter.
§ 95.15 SUPPLEMENTARY NOTIFICATION.
   If the obstruction or excavation of the right-of-way begins later or ends
sooner than the date given on the permit, permittee shall notify the city of
the accurate information as soon as this information is known.
§ 95.16 REVOCATION OF PERMITS.
   (A)   Substantial breach.
      (1)    The city reserves its right, as provided herein, to revoke any
right-of-way permit, without a fee refund, if there is a substantial breach of
the terms and conditions of any statute, ordinance, rule or regulation, or any
material condition of the permit.
      (2)   A substantial breach by permittee shall include, but shall not be
limited to, the following:
         (a)   The violation of any material provision of the right-of-way
permit;
         (b)   An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the
right-of-way permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or
deceit upon the city or its citizens;
         (c)   Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a
right-of-way permit;
         (d)   The failure to complete the work in a timely manner, unless a
permit extension is obtained or unless the failure to complete work is due to
reasons beyond the permittee’s control; or
         (e)   The failure to correct, in a timely manner, work that does not
conform to a condition indicated on an order issued pursuant to §
95.13.
   (B)   Written notice of breach. If the city determines that the permittee
has committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any statute,
ordinance, rule, regulation or any condition of the permit, the city shall make
a written demand upon the permittee to remedy the violation. The demand shall
state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. A
substantial breach, as stated above, will allow the city, at his or her
discretion, to place additional or revised conditions on the permit to mitigate
and remedy the breach.
   (C)   Response to notice of breach. Within 24 hours of receiving
notification of the breach, the permittee shall provide the city with a plan,
acceptable to the city, that will cure the breach. The permittee’s failure to
so contact the city, or the permittee’s failure to submit an acceptable plan,
or the permittee’s failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be
cause for immediate revocation of the permit. Further, the permittee’s failure
to so contact the city, or the permittee’s failure to submit an acceptable
plan, or the permittee’s failure to reasonably implement the approved plan,
shall automatically place the permittee on probation for one full year.
   (D)   Cause for probation. From time to time, the city may establish a list
of conditions of the permit, which if breached will automatically place the
permittee on probation for one full year, such as, but not limited to, working
out of the allotted time period or working on right-of-way grossly outside of
the permit authorization.
   (E)   Automatic revocation. If a permittee, while on probation, commits a
breach as outlined above, permittee’s permit will automatically be revoked and
permittee will not be allowed further permits for one full year, except for
emergency repairs.
   (F)   Reimbursement of city costs. If a permit is revoked, the permittee
shall also reimburse the city for the city’s reasonable costs, including
restoration costs and the costs of collection and reasonable attorney’s fees
incurred in connection with the revocation.
§ 95.17 MAPPING DATA.
   (A)   Information required. Each registrant shall provide mapping
information required by the city in accordance with Minnesota Rules 78189.4000
and 7819.4100, as they may be amended from time to time. Within 90 days
following completion of any work pursuant to a permit, the permittee shall
provide the city accurate maps and drawings certifying the “as-built” location
of all equipment installed, owed and maintained by the permittee. The maps and
drawings shall include the horizontal and vertical location of all facilities
and equipment and shall be provided consistent with the city’s electronic
mapping system, when practical or as a condition imposed by the city. Failure
to provide maps and drawings pursuant to this division (A) shall be grounds for
revoking the permit holder’s registration.
   (B)   Service laterals. All permits issued for the installation or repair of
service laterals, other than minor repairs as defined in Minnesota Rules
7560.0150, subpart 2, as it may be amended from time to time, shall require the
permittee’s use of appropriate means of establishing the horizontal locations
of installed service laterals and the service lateral vertical locations in
those cases where the city reasonably requires it. Permittees or their
subcontractors shall submit to the city evidence satisfactory to the city of
the installed service lateral locations. Compliance with this division (B) and
with applicable Gopher State One Call Law and Minnesota Rules governing service
laterals installed after December 31, 2005 shall be a condition of any city
approval necessary for:
      (1)   Payments to contractors working on a public improvement project
including those under M.S. Chapter 429, as it may be amended from time to time;
and
      (2)   City approval under development agreements or other subdivision or
site plan approval under M.S. Chapter 462, as it may be amended from time to
time. The city shall reasonably determine the appropriate method of providing
such information to the city. Failure to provide prompt and accurate
information on the service laterals installed may result in the revocation of
the permit issued for the work or future permits to the offending permittee or
its subcontractors.
§ 95.18 LOCATION AND RELOCATION OF FACILITIES.
   (A)   Generally. Placement, location, and relocation of facilities must
comply with the Act, with other applicable law, and with Minnesota Rules
7819.3100, 7819.5000 and 7819.5100, as they may be amended from time to time,
to the extent the rules do not limit authority otherwise available to cities.
   (B)   Undergrounding. Unless otherwise agreed in a franchise or other
agreement between the applicable right-of-way user and the city, facilities in
the right-of-way must be located or relocated and maintained underground in
accordance city regulations.
   (C)   Corridors.
      (1)   The city may assign a specific area within the right-of-way, or any
particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of facilities
that is or, pursuant to current technology, the city expects will someday be
located within the right-of-way. All excavation, obstruction or other permits
issued by the city involving the installation or replacement of facilities
shall designate the proper corridor for the facilities at issue.
      (2)   Any registrant who has facilities in the right-of-way in a position
at variance with the corridors established by the city shall, no later than at
the time of the next reconstruction or excavation of the area where the
facilities are located, move the facilities to the assigned position within the
right-of-way, unless this requirement is waived by the city for good cause
shown, upon consideration of such factors as the remaining economic life of the
facilities, public safety, customer service needs and hardship to the
registrant.
   (D)   Nuisance. One year after the passage of this chapter, any facilities
found in a right-of-way that have not been registered shall be deemed to be a
nuisance. The city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in
equity, including, but not limited to, abating the nuisance or taking
possession of the facilities and restoring the right-of-way to a useable
condition.
   (E)   Limitation of space. To protect health, safety, and welfare, or when
necessary to protect the right-of-way and its current use, the city shall have
the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional facilities
within the right-of-way. In making such decisions, the city shall strive to the
extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the right-
of-way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the public interest,
the public’s needs for the particular utility service, the condition of the
right-of-way, the time of year with respect to essential utilities, the
protection of existing facilities in the right-of-way, and future city plans
for public improvements and development projects which have been determined to
be in the public interest.
§ 95.19 PRE-EXCAVATION FACILITIES LOCATION.
   In addition to complying with the requirements of M.S. § 216D.01-.09
(“Gopher One-Call Excavation Notice System”), as it may be amended from time to
time, before the start date of any right-of-way excavation, each registrant who
has facilities or equipment in the area to be excavated shall mark the
horizontal and vertical placement of all the facilities. Any registrant whose
facilities is less than 20 inches below a concrete or asphalt surface shall
notify and work closely with the excavation contractor to establish the exact
location of its facilities and the best procedure for excavation.
§ 95.20 DAMAGE TO OTHER FACILITIES.
   (A)   When the city does work in the right-of-way and finds it necessary to
maintain, support or move a registrant’s facilities to protect it, the city
shall notify the local representative as early as is reasonably possible. The
costs associated therewith will be billed to that registrant and must be paid
within 30 days from the date of billing.
   (B)   Each registrant shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any
facilities in the right-of-way which it or its facilities damages. Each
registrant shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any damage to the
facilities of another registrant caused during the city’s response to an
emergency occasioned by that registrant’s facilities.
§ 95.21 RIGHT-OF-WAY VACATION.
   If the city vacates a right-of-way which contains the facilities of a
registrant, the registrant’s rights in the vacated right-of-way are governed by
Minnesota Rules 7819.3200, as it may be amended from time to time.
§ 95.22 INDEMNIFICATION AND LIABILITY.
   By registering with the city, or by accepting a permit under this chapter, a
registrant or permittee agrees to defend and indemnify the city in accordance
with the provisions of Minnesota Rules 7819.1250, as it may be amended from
time to time.
§ 95.23 ABANDONED AND USABLE FACILITIES.
   (A)   Discontinued operations. A registrant who has determined to
discontinue all or a portion of its operations in the city must provide
information satisfactory to the city that the registrant’s obligations for its
facilities in the right-of-way under this chapter have been lawfully assumed by
another registrant.
   (B)   Removal. Any registrant who has abandoned facilities in any right-of-
way shall remove it from that right-of-way if required in conjunction with
other right-of-way repair, excavation, or construction, unless this requirement
is waived by the city.
§ 95.24 APPEAL.
   A right-of-way user that has been denied registration, has been denied a
permit, has had a permit revoked, believes that the fees imposed are not in
conformity with M.S. § 237.163, subd. 6, as it may be amended from time to
time, or disputes a determination of the city regarding §
95.16(B) may have the denial, revocation, fee imposition, or decision reviewed,
upon written request, by the City Council. The City Council shall act on a
timely written request at its next regularly scheduled meeting, provided the
right-of-way user has submitted its appeal with sufficient time to include the
appeal as a regular agenda item. A decision by the City Council affirming the
denial, revocation, or fee imposition will be in writing and supported by
written findings establishing the reasonableness of the decision.
§ 95.25 RESERVATION OF REGULATORY AND POLICE POWERS.
   A permittee’s rights are subject to the regulatory and police powers of the
city to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to protect the health,
safety and welfare of the public.

(Ord. 82, passed 7-24-1979)
§ 96.06 UNIT ASSESSMENT METHOD.
   (A)   Generally. The cost of any improvements authorized by this chapter
shall be assessed upon the real estate benefitting thereby, to be levied by the
unit assessment method as described herein, except where alternate methods are
provided in this chapter.
   (B)   Single-family dwellings, including mobile homes.
      (1)   Each structure shall be treated as one unit if located within one
lot and there is no potential for subdivision of the property. If the Council
determines that the potential exists to divide the property, the average
residential lot size in the assessments project divided by the lot size of that
property will determine the equivalent number of units. If any structure is
located on more than one lot as shown on the plat, the following rules apply:
 
1 to 1-1/2 lots  1-1/2 units
1-1/2 to 2 lots  2 units
More than 2 lots 1 unit for each lot or portion of lot
 
      (2)   Special circumstances may exist with respect to corner lots when
the improvement is of a nature as to abut and benefit both the front and side
of the property, like curbs and gutters, sidewalks and streets. For each
improvement, the Council shall, with respect to corner lots, make an adjustment
when necessary to maintain fairness in the assessment.
   (C)   Multiple-family dwellings. Each parcel containing a structure or
structures designed for multi-family residential dwellings shall be treated as
two units, plus one-half unit for the number of additional dwellings more than
two.
   (D)   Commercial and industrial. For purposes of this division (D), the term
MINIMUM LOT SIZE shall refer to the minimum lot size as required by zoning
regulations in effect within the city at the time of any special assessment.
Each lot used for commercial or industrial purposes, or classified for zoning
for those purposes, shall be treated as one unit, for each lot that is equal to
or less than the minimum lot size. For any lot greater in size than the minimum
lot size, the number of units, including fractions, allocated to the lot shall
be determined by dividing the minimum lot size into the size of that lot. These
regulations shall apply to developed and undeveloped lots.
   (E)   Public, political subdivision, religious and other tax exempt
property. Each lot used for one of the above mentioned purposes shall be
treated as one unit. However, in the event of an improvement that also includes
residential lots, the average residential lot size in the assessments project
divided into that parcel will determine the equivalent number of units.
(Ord. 82, passed 7-24-1979)
§ 96.07 ASSESSMENT REGULATIONS FOR CLASS B IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Trunk water mains and trunk sewer mains. Trunk water mains and trunk
sewer mains are defined as mains having diameters of greater than eight inches,
it being the intent to refer to pipes serving as feeder lines into later as
mains. The cost of constructing new and replacement trunk lines shall be
assessed by the unit method against abutting and non-abutting property which
benefits from the improvement. The cost of repairs, maintenance and the like
shall not be financed by special assessment, and to specify, replacement of
trunk lines of less than one full city block in length shall be deemed repairs
and not financed by special assessment. When a trunk water line or trunk sewer
line is laid across or adjacent to unplatted property, the city shall not defer
the assessment against the unplatted property if the assessment would be made
for an improvement if the unplatted property was platted property. In that
event, the city shall make the assessment at the time the assessment against
other property is made and apportion the assessment against the unplatted
property by the unit method and determine the number of units by dividing the
average residential lot size in the assessment project into that unplatted
parcel. Other property benefitted by the trunk water or trunk sewer main, but
unable to utilize it until a lateral main has been built to serve the property
shall not be assessed for its share of the cost of the trunk water or trunk
sewer main until the lateral main is built. The assessment for the lateral
shall then include the property’s share of the trunk water or sewer main. When
a trunk sewer main or trunk water main is constructed and is to serve also as a
lateral sewer or water main for abutting property, the abutting property shall
be assessed for the cost of a lateral water main or lateral sewer main, with
the size of the majority of the laterals connecting into the trunk. The cost of
the excess capacity, namely the cost between the trunk and of a lateral as
determined above, shall be specially assessed against the abutting and non-
abutting property benefitting, by the unit method.
   (B)   Storm sewers and lift stations. The cost of constructing new storm
sewers shall be assessed by the unit method against that property actually
benefitted by the improvement. Maintenance, repairs and replacements of storm
sewers shall not be financed by special assessment. The cost of constructing
new or replacement lift stations shall be assessed by the unit method against
that property actually benefitted by the improvement. General repairs and
maintenance shall not be financed by special assessment.
   (C)   Collector streets. The following are collector streets: Suffolk Drive;
Dorchester Drive; Hampshire Drive; Kennedy Memorial Drive; and Kennsington
Drive. When a collector street is paved with concrete, bituminous mat or other
permanent surface, or some other improvement is undertaken in the nature of new
construction or replacement, the cost of the improvement shall be assessed by
the unit method against abutting property which benefits from the improvement.
General repairs, maintenance and similar expenditures shall be financed without
special assessment, and to further specify, any improvement to a collector
street involving less than the length of a block or the application of non-
permanent surfacing shall be deemed to constitute maintenance and repair and
shall not be financed by special assessment. The cost to be assessed to
abutting properties shall be 80% of the cost of the improvement, and the
remaining 20% shall be paid by the city from its general funds.
   (D)   Nuisances, swamps and trees. The cost of abating nuisances, draining
of swamps, marshes and ponds on public or private property and filling the
same, and the trimming and care of trees and removal of unsound and diseased
trees on residential streets, roads or drives shall be assessed in a manner
determined by the Council in each case to measure most equitably the benefit
received by property to be assessed. The assessment in any case may be made
against non-abutting property to the extent the property is benefitted by the
improvement.
(Ord. 82, passed 7-24-1979)
§ 96.08 CLASS C IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Sidewalks. The cost of the construction of new sidewalks or the
replacement of sidewalks shall be assessed by the unit method against the
abutting property. Repairs, maintenance and other expenditures in the nature of
repair shall not be financed by special assessment, and to specify, replacement
of a portion of a sidewalk of less than one full block in length shall
constitute repairs and not be financed by special assessment,
   (B)   Lateral water mains and lateral sewer mains. LATERAL WATER MAINS and
LATERAL SEWER MAINS shall be defined as lines having diameters of eight inches
or less, the intent being to describe the lines running from the trunk mains to
the connecting lines. For purposes of this division (B), CONNECTING SEWER LINES
and CONNECTING WATER LINES shall be defined as the lines running from the
lateral mains to the improvements on each lot, the connecting water line being
approximately two inches in diameter and the connecting sewer lines being
approximately four inches in diameter. The cost of constructing new and
replacement lateral mains shall be assessed by the unit method against abutting
and non-abutting property which benefits from the improvement. The cost of
repairs, maintenance and the like shall not be financed by special assessment,
and to specify, replacement of lateral mains of less than one full city block
in length shall be deemed repairs and not financed by special assessment. When
a lateral water line or lateral sewer line is laid across or adjacent to
unplatted property, the city shall not defer the assessment against the
unplatted property if the assessment would be made for an improvement if the
unplatted property was platted property. In such an event, the city shall make
the assessment at the time the assessment against other property is made, and
apportion the assessment against the unplatted property by the unit method and
determine the number of units by dividing the average residential lot size in
the assessment project into that unplatted parcel. Other property benefitted by
the latera1 water or latera1 sewer main, but unable to utilize it until an
additional latera1 line has been built to serve the property shall not be
assessed for its share of the cost of the lateral water or lateral sewer main
until the additional line is built. The assessment for the additional lateral
line shall then include the property’s share of the lateral water or sewer
main. The provisions contained herein for financing of trunk and lateral server
and water mains shall not limit the authority of the city regarding the
construction and financing of connecting lines. The instruction, replacement
and repairs of the connecting lines shall be undertaken by the city and
financed in an equitable and uniform manner.
   (C)   Residential streets. When a non-collector street is paved with
concrete, bituminous mat or other permanent surface, or some other improvement
is undertaken in the nature of new construction or replacement, the cost of the
improvement shall be assessed by the unit method against abutting property
which benefits from the improvement. General repairs, maintenance and similar
expenditures shall be financed without special assessment, and to further
specify, any improvement to a non-collector street involving less than the
length of a block or the application of non-permanent surfacing shall be deemed
to constitute maintenance and repair and shall be financed by special
assessment.
   (D)   Curbs and gutters. The cost of construction of new curbs and gutters
or the replacement of same shall be assessed by the unit method against the
abutting property. Repairs, maintenance and other expenditures in the nature of
repair shall not be financed by special assessment, and to specify replacement
of a portion of a curb or gutter of less than one full block in length shall
constitute repairs and not be financed by special assessment.
(Ord. 82, passed 7-24-1979)
§ 96.09 FEDERAL, STATE AND COUNTY AID.
   If the city receives financial assistance from the federal government, state
or county, to defray a portion of the cost of an improvement project, the aid
shall be used first to reduce the share of the project cost, which would be met
from general city funds. If the aid is more than the amount of the improvement
cost to be borne by the city, the remainder of the aid so received shall be
used to reduce each individual assessment proportionately.
(Ord. 82, passed 7-24-1979)
§ 96.10 PARTIAL PRE-PAYMENT.
   After the adoption by the City Council of the assessment roll in any local
improvement proceeding, the owner of any property specially assessed in the
proceeding, may, prior to the certification of assessment or the first
installment thereof to the County Auditor, pay to the City Clerk-Treasurer the
portion of the assessment, but not less than $100. The remaining unpaid balance
shall be spread over the period of time established by Council for installment
payments of the assessment.
(Ord. 82, passed 7-24-1979)
§ 96.11 CERTIFICATION OF ASSESSMENTS.
   After the adoption of any special assessment by the Council, the Clerk-
Treasurer shall transmit a certified duplicate of the assessment roll with each
installment, including interest, set forth separately to the County Auditor to
be extended on the proper tax lists of the county.
(Ord. 82, passed 7-24-1979)
§ 96.12 ASSESSMENT MANUAL.
   The City Clerk-Treasurer, and other city personnel at the City Clerk-
Treasurer’s direction, shall prepare an administrative manual specifying more
detailed procedures for the conduct of local improvements and the levy of
special assessments in supplementation of this chapter and consistent
therewith. Upon approval of the Council by resolution, the manual shall be used
with this chapter in the conduct of all local improvement proceedings to which
they apply by their terms.
(Ord. 82, passed 7-24-1979)
§ 96.13 MODIFICATIONS AND ALTERATIONS TO ASSESSMENT PROCEEDINGS.
   (A)   Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter, the city shall comply
with all minimum requirements as provided in Minnesota Statutes in determining
and levying assessments. In addition, if any procedure specified herein is
determined to be violative of existing law, the procedures shall be modified in
each case to comply fully with the law.
   (B)   In no event shall the amount of a special assessment levied against
any property exceed the benefit to the property by the improvement, measured by
the increase in market value of the property resulting from the improvement. If
the City Council determines that in a proposed assessment roll that the amount
of the assessment exceeds the benefit to any property, the Council shall reduce
the assessment against the property, and shall either pay the excess from
general city funds or issue an amended assessment roll, as the Council
determines equitable.
   (C)   In order to ensure that the assessment procedure and the assessments
as levied will comply fully with state law and constitutional safeguards in
each proposed project, the Council may require additional procedures,
determinations or hearings. The additional procedures, determinations and
hearings may be specified in the assessment manual or may be determined by
resolution for each proposed project. It is the intent of this division (C) to
authorize the Council to require additional safeguards in the assessment
process in light of constantly changing statutes and constitutional
requirements.
(Ord. 82, passed 7-24-1979)
§ 96.14 SENIOR CITIZEN DEFERMENT FROM ASSESSMENT.
   (A)   The City Council, in its discretion, may defer the payment of a
special assessment against property owned and occupied by a person 65 years of
age or older, when the total amount of the assessment exceeds $300 and the
payment thereof would create a hardship upon the property owner.
   (B)   Application for deferred payment of special assessments shall be made
on the form prescribed by the County Assessor supplemented by the City Clerk-
Treasurer, to establish the qualification of the owner of the deferment. The
application shall be made within 30 days after the adoption of the assessment
roll by the Council, and if granted, shall be automatically renewed each
following year on September 30 of each year, unless the applicant’s situation
changes so that a hardship as defined in division (C) below no longer exists or
the deferment terminates pursuant to the provisions of division (D) below. It
shall be a misdemeanor for any person to file an erroneous application for a
deferral or for any person to fail to notify the City Clerk-Treasurer of a
change in circumstances that would terminate the deferral, which the notice
must be given promptly and no later than September 30, following the change in
circumstances.
   (C)   A hardship shall be deemed to prima facie exist if the applicant’s
total gross income, including public assistance, pension and other tax exempt
income, from the most recent taxable year is less than $6,000. In addition, the
City Council may determine that a hardship exists in the event that the
applicant proves to the Council that as a result of exceptional and unusual
circumstances, a hardship does exist.
   (D)   The deferment of payment of special assessments shall cease and all
amounts accumulated on unpaid installments plus applicable interest shall there
upon become due and payable upon the occurrence of any of the following events:
      (1)   The death of the owner if the spouse is unable to qualify under the
provisions of this chapter;
      (2)   The sale, transfer or subdivision of the property, or any part
thereof;
      (3)   If the property loses its homestead status; and
      (4)   If the circumstances of the applicant change so that the applicant
would no longer qualify for the deferment in accordance with the guidelines
specified above.
   (E)   The deferred special assessments shall accrue interest at the same
rate charged to the non- deferred assessments, and the Council shall by
majority vote determine with each deferment whether interest payments are
deferred or must be paid annually. At the time of the termination of any
deferral, the Council may, at its discretion, and by majority vote, provide for
payment of the deferred sum in equal installments over the time remaining on
the original assessments rather than to require immediate payment of the
deferred amount.
   (F)   If the Council grants a deferment, the Clerk-Treasurer shall notify
the County Auditor and the County Assessor, who shall, in accordance with M.S.
§ 435.194, as it may be amended from time to time, record a notice of the
deferment with the Register of Deeds, setting forth the amount of the
assessment, the interest rate and whether interest payments are required. Upon
termination of any deferment, the Clerk-Treasurer shall notify the County
Auditor and the County Assessor of the termination and the payment terms of the
deferred amount. The City Clerk-Treasurer shall include in the notice of
hearing of proposed assessments, a notice specifying the availability and
procedure for obtaining a deferral.

§ 97.01 FINDINGS.
   (A)   Recreational feeding of deer often causes deer concentrations which
develop into depredation and other public safety problems.
   (B)   Depredation of garden crops and landscaping plants is increasing as
deer habitat decreases and deer populations increase within particular areas
and neighborhoods in the city.
   (C)   High deer populations can result in increased car/deer crashes within
the community, causing public safety concerns and negative economic impacts
such as increased car insurance premium costs.
   (D)   High deer densities also contribute to the possible spread of chronic
diseases among deer populations and chronic wasting disease.
(Ord. 208, passed 12-22-2014)
§ 97.02 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The intent of the City Council is not to unreasonably infringe upon the
recreational enjoyment of city residents who observe wildlife and enhance
wildlife habitat on their property. The purpose of this feeding ban is to
eliminate these deer attractions which, when combined with other management
strategies, should reduce over time the depredation impacts to adjacent
residents, as well as assure the safety of the traveling public on city streets
and thoroughfares.

placed on the ground, or within five feet of the ground surface, either on
property owned or controlled by a person or on property owned by others, any
grain, fodder, fruit, vegetables, nuts, hay or other edible materials, which
may reasonably be expected to intentionally result in deer feeding, unless the
items are screened or protected in a manner that prevents deer from feeding on
them. Also prohibited are salt licks and powder or liquid deer attractants,
unless legally used for deer management control purposes. Living fruit trees
and other live vegetation shall not be considered as deer feeding.
   (B)   The provisions of this section shall apply to the following areas
within the city: Sections Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten, Fifteen, Sixteen, Seventeen
and Eighteen, Township 58, Range 14 West.

   For the purpose of discharging the duties imposed by this subchapter and to
enforce its provisions, any East Range Police Department officer, other law
enforcement service, or agent of the city with prior approval of the City
Council, is empowered to enter upon any premises, in accordance with §
10.20 of this code of ordinances, to investigate or inspect the premises for
prohibited deer feeding activities to eliminate the public nuisance. This
section may be enforced by injunction, action for abatement, or other
appropriate civil remedy to eliminate a public nuisance.
(Ord. 208, passed 12-22-2014)

penalty is provided, shall be subject to the penalty provisions of §
10.99.
   (B)   Any person, firm or corporation violating any of the provisions of §§
97.01 through

§ 113.01 PURPOSE.
   Because the city recognizes that many persons under the age of 21 years
purchase or otherwise obtain, possess and use tobacco, tobacco products,
electronic delivery devices, nicotine or lobelia delivery products and tobacco
related devices and the sales, possession and use are violations of both state
and federal laws; and because studies, which the city hereby accepts and
adopts, have shown that most smokers begin smoking before they have reached the
age of 21 years and that those persons who reach the age of 21 years without
having started smoking are significantly less likely to begin smoking; and
because smoking has been shown to be the cause of several serious health
problems which subsequently place a financial burden on all levels of
government; this chapter shall be intended to regulate the sale, possession and
use of tobacco, tobacco products, electronic delivery devices, nicotine or
lobelia delivery products and tobacco related devices for the purpose of
enforcing and furthering existing laws, to protect minors against the serious
effects associated with the illegal use of tobacco, tobacco products,
electronic delivery devices, nicotine or lobelia delivery products and tobacco
related devices and to further the official public policy of the state in
regard to preventing young people from starting to smoke as stated in M.S. §
144.391, as it may be amended from time to time.
(Ord. 240, passed 1-23-2023)
§ 113.02 DEFINITIONS.

shall be given their commonly accepted definitions. For the purpose of this
chapter, the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly
indicates or requires a different meaning.
   COMPLIANCE CHECKS. The system the city uses to investigate and ensure that
those authorized to sell tobacco, tobacco products, electronic delivery
devices, nicotine or lobelia delivery products and tobacco related devices are
following and complying with the requirements of this chapter. COMPLIANCE
CHECKS shall involve the use of minors as authorized by this chapter.
COMPLIANCE CHECKS shall also mean the use of minors who attempt to purchase
tobacco, tobacco products, electronic delivery devices, nicotine or lobelia
delivery products, or tobacco related devices for educational, research and
training purposes as authorized by state and federal laws. COMPLIANCE CHECKS
may also be conducted by other units of government for the purpose of enforcing
appropriate federal, state or local laws and regulations relating to tobacco,
tobacco products and tobacco related devices.
   ELECTRONIC DELIVERY DEVICE. Any product containing or delivering nicotine,
lobelia, or any other substance intended for human consumption that can be used

separately.
   INDIVIDUALLY PACKAGED. The practice of selling any tobacco or tobacco
product wrapped individually for sale. Individually wrapped tobacco and tobacco
products shall include but not be limited to single cigarette packs, single

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.01 TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known, cited and referred to as the “City of Hoyt
Lakes Subdivision Ordinance”, except as referred to herein, where it shall be
known as “this chapter”.
(Ord. 153, passed 11-8-1999)
§ 151.02 PURPOSE AND JURISDICTION.
   (A)   Purpose. Because each new subdivision accepted by the city becomes a
permanent unit in the basic physical structure of the future community and to
which the future community will of necessity be forced to adhere, and further
because piecemeal planning of subdivisions will bring a disastrous,
disconnected patchwork of pattern and poor circulation of traffic unless its
design and arrangement is correlated to a proposed master plan study aiming at
a unified scheme of community interests; all subdivisions of land lying within
the incorporated limits of the city shall in all respects fully comply with the
regulations set forth in this chapter.
   (B)   Jurisdiction. It is the purpose of this chapter to make certain
regulations and requirements for the platting of land within the city pursuant
to the authority contained in M.S. Chapters 412, 429, 471, 505 and 508, as they
may be amended from time to time, which regulations the City Council deems
necessary for the health, safety, general welfare, convenience and good order
of this community.

any plat or subdivision contains public streets or thoroughfares which are
dedicated as that, whether located within the corporate limits of the city or
outside the corporate limits or contains existing streets outside of the
corporate limits, the approval of the plat by the City Council or the
subsequent annexation of the property to the city shall not constitute an
acceptance by the city of the streets or thoroughfares, nor the improvements
constructed or installed in the subdivision, irrespective of any act or acts by
an officer, agent or employee of the city with respect to the streets or
improvements.
   (B)   Acceptance by resolution of City Council. The acceptance of the

accept the street or thoroughfare for the purpose of maintenance by the city,
and defer the completion of the street or thoroughfare by the developer until
the local improvement has been constructed.
(Ord. 153, passed 11-8-1999)

(Ord. 153, passed 11-8-1999)
§ 151.29 ARRANGEMENTS FOR IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Contract for development. Prior to the acceptance of the final plat,
the owner or subdivider shall enter into a contract for development of new
subdivisions with the city. In conjunction with this contract, the owner or
subdivider shall deposit with the City Clerk-Treasurer either a cash deposit or
a corporate surety performance bond, approved as to form by the City Attorney,
in an amount equal to one and one-half times the Operations Superintendent’s
estimated cost of the improvements or one and one-fourth times the actual bid.
This bond shall also have a clause which guarantees the improvements for a
period of one year after acceptance by the city of the improvements. In lieu of
this clause, a separate one year maintenance bond approved as to form by the
City Attorney, shall be submitted to the Operations Superintendent upon
acceptance of the improvements by the City Council. Upon receipt of this
maintenance bond, the performance bond may be released.
   (B)   Improvements. All improvements shall be made in accordance with the
plans and specifications prepared by a registered professional engineer and
approved by the Operations Superintendent and in accordance with applicable
city standards and requirements. Upon approval, the plans and specifications
become a part of the contract for development. A reproducible set of plans and
specifications plus two copies shall be furnished to the city to be filed as
public record. A copy of all approved pertinent regulatory forms (MPCA sewer
extension, State Department of Health water extension and MPCA storm water and
the like) shall be provided to the city.
   (C)   Bond. The owner or subdivider shall deposit with the City Clerk-
Treasurer cash or an approved indemnity bond to cover all expenses incurred by
the city for engineering, legal fees and other incidental expenses in
connection with the making of the improvements. In the event of a cash deposit,
any balance remaining shall be refunded to the owner or subdivider after
payment of all costs and expenses to the city have been paid.
   (D)   Street access to improved lots required. It is not the intent of this
section to require the owner or subdivider to develop the entire plat at the
same time making all the required improvements, but zoning permits will not be
granted except as to lots having access to streets on which the required
improvements have been made or arranged for by cash deposit or bond as herein
provided.
   (E)   Compliance. Compliance with the terms of this chapter in subdividing
land, and in completing the required improvements, shall be at the sole expense
of the owner and/or subdivider, except as set forth in a development contract
with the city which may provide for assistance from funding sources such as
IRRRB, and for special assessment financing, and for additional assistance from
the city if the City Council finds that the subdivision will not occur without
the additional assistance from the city and that the proposed subdivision is in
the best interests of the city.
   (F)   Waiver.
      (1)   The City Council may, at its discretion, waive the requirement that
the owner/developer complete and dedicate all public improvements, or execute a
development contract requiring completion within one year, prior to acceptance
of the final plat. If the City Council so waives this requirement, the owner or
developer shall submit to the City Clerk-Treasurer financial assurances in an
amount designated by the City Council and in a form acceptable to the City
Council. The financial assurances may include, but are not limited to: a bond
executed by a surety company; an irrevocable letter of credit in favor of the
city issued by a banking institution approved by the City Council; a cash
deposit in an approved financial institution in an account established in the
name of the city. If the improvements have not been installed within the terms
of financial assurances, the City Council may bring actions for recovering or

only when the applicant therefore has demonstrated that the action will be in
keeping with the spirit and intent of this chapter with the zoning district in
which a variance is applied for. The Board of Adjustment may impose any
condition in the granting of the variances in order to ensure compliance with

§ 152.068 HOME OCCUPATION PERMITS.
   (A)   License required. It is unlawful for any person to engage in, or carry
on, a Level 2 home occupation, as that term is defined, without first having
obtained a license therefore from the city. Level 1 home occupations as defined
in the zoning chapter are not required to be licensed as long as all conditions
set forth in the zoning chapter are fully met.
   (B)   Regulation. Licenses will only be issued if the specific use is not
prohibited, and the Planning Commission determines that the home occupation
will be conducted with minimal or no effect on the surrounding neighborhood.
The Planning Commission may impose reasonable conditions in the license to
ensure that the home occupation will be conducted with minimal or no effect on
the surrounding neighborhood.
   (C)   License period. All licenses for Level 2 home occupations shall expire
on September 30 of each year.
   (D)   Public notification and hearing. The Planning Commission shall hold a
public hearing for all home occupations required to be licensed. The owners of
all parcels within 350 feet of the property (or a larger area at the discretion
of the city) shall be notified ten days prior to the public hearing. The
applicant or a representative of the applicant must be present at the public
hearing.
   (E)   Purpose. Home occupation regulations are established to ensure that
home occupations will not adversely affect the character and livability of the
surrounding residential neighborhood. The home occupation shall function as an
accessory and subordinate use to the principal use of the dwelling unit. In
order to protect the public health, safety and welfare within residential
neighborhoods, home occupations shall be divided into two regulatory levels.
      (1)   Level 1 home occupations. Home occupations that comply with all
standards of division (G) below and which have no potential neighborhood
impacts. Level 1 home occupations may be operated without a license or permit.
      (2)   Level 2 home occupations.
         (a)   Home occupations that comply with all standards of division (G)
below but which could have potential neighborhood impacts; and home occupations
that do not comply with all standards of division (G) below and which are not
prohibited home occupations under division (H) below. Level 2 home occupations
are required to be licensed per the provisions of this section. Level 2 home
occupations may include, but are not strictly limited to:
            1.   Those with employed persons other than occupants of the
dwelling;
            2.   Those involving the use or parking of a commercial or non-
passenger vehicle, whether the use or parking is in a building or outside;
            3.   Those which do not meet one or more of the specified
performance standards in division (G) below; and
            4.   Those which generate excessive traffic per the standards of
division (G)(12) below.
         (b)   In cases where it is unclear whether a home occupation should be
classified as Level 1 or Level 2, the Zoning Officer shall make a determination
subject to Planning Commission confirmation if requested by the operator of the
home occupation.
   (F)   License required for Level 2 home occupations. An annual license shall
be obtained by any person operating a Level 2 home occupation.
   (G)   Home occupation regulations. The regulations recognize that many types
of home occupations can be conducted with minimal or no effect on the
surrounding neighborhood. Home occupations that comply with all of the
following standards are Level 1 home occupations and are not required to be
licensed. Home occupations that do not comply with all of the following
standards are Level 2 home occupations and are required to be licensed.
      (1)   The home occupation shall be clearly incidental and secondary to
the residential use of the premises, and shall result in no incompatibility
with or disturbance to the surrounding area.
      (2)   Employed persons: no one other than the occupant(s) of the dwelling
shall be on the property at any given time in relation to the home occupation.
The home occupation may employ additional nonresident employees only if their
work activities are performed off the premises. Domestic employees shall not be
considered employees of the home occupation.
      (3)   Exterior alterations or modifications that change the residential
character or appearance of the dwelling unit or accessory structure to that of
a commercial nature shall be prohibited.
      (4)   Interior alterations or modifications that eliminate the kitchen,
habitable areas for sleeping and bathrooms shall be prohibited.
      (5)   No home occupation shall produce noise, light and glare, odor,
vibration or traffic that will in any way have a perceptible effect upon
adjacent or nearby property.
      (6)   Outdoor storage prohibited: outdoor storage or display of
materials, goods, supplies or equipment related to the conduct of the home
occupation shall be prohibited, except that licensed passenger vehicles used in
the home occupation may be parked outside provided they are in compliance with
all other requirements of this section.
      (7)   Parking: all vehicle parking required for conduct of the home
occupation shall be off-street. The off-street parking area required for the
principal residential use shall be retained exclusively for the principal
residential use and shall not be made unusable by the home occupation.
      (8)   Commercial or non-passenger vehicles: parking/storage of any
commercial or non- passenger vehicles used in the home occupation shall be
within a fully-enclosed building. Noise, odors or vibration from the operation
of vehicles shall not be discernible at the property line.
      (9)   No equipment, machinery or materials other than of a type normally
found in or compatible with a dwelling unit shall be allowed.
      (10)   No home occupation activity of a nonresidential character shall be
discernible from any private or public street. There shall be no exterior
signage or display, or interior signs or display, which are visible from
outside the dwelling.
      (11)   The hours of operation that a home occupation may be accessible to
the public shall be limited to the hours between 8:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m.
      (12)   The home occupation shall not generate excessive traffic that is
detrimental to the residential character of the surrounding properties or the
neighborhood. For the purposes of this division (G)(12), more than five
customers or clients per day, or more than two customers at any given time, may
be determined to be an excessive and detrimental level of traffic. The number
shall apply to each dwelling unit, regardless of the number of home occupations
conducted in the dwelling unit. The criteria used by the Zoning Officer to
determine impact shall include, but not be limited to:
         (a)   The characteristics of the neighborhood, including current land
use, lot sizes, lot widths, parking availability and screening;
         (b)   Type of street, width and traffic volumes; and
         (c)   The availability and location of off-street parking.
      (13)   Shipment and delivery of products, merchandise or supplies shall
be limited to the hours of 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. and shall regularly occur
only in single rear axle straight trucks or smaller vehicles typically used to
serve residential areas.
   (H)   Prohibited home occupations. The following uses, by their nature of
operation, have a pronounced tendency to increase beyond the limits permitted
for home occupations. These uses have objectionable operational characteristics
that adversely impact residential neighborhoods and shall be prohibited as home
occupations:
      (1)   Service, repair or painting of any motorized vehicle, including,
but not limited to, motor vehicles, trailers, boats, personal watercraft,
recreational vehicles and snowmobiles;
      (2)   Hair styling establishments;

by a firearms dealer, except when the dealer is federally licensed to conduct
the activity; and

quantities which are packaged for consumption by individual households for
personal care or household use.
   (I)   Reasonable accommodation for disabled persons. Persons with physical
or other legally recognized disabilities may request reasonable accommodation
by requesting a waiver of one or more of the foregoing requirements. The Zoning
Administrator may only grant waivers on the basis of the applicant’s physical
limitations to function within the requirements.

   (A)   Enter upon the land or within a building during reasonable working
hours as found necessary to fulfill his or her duties of enforcing the

   (B)   Conduct inspections of buildings and use of land to determine
compliance with terms of this chapter;
   (C)   Institute in the name of the city any appropriate actions or
proceedings against a violator as provided by law; and
   (D)   Coordinate ordinance enforcement with the activities of the Zoning

(Ord. 110, passed 4-23-1991)
§ 152.071 BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT/PLANNING COMMISSION.
   (A)   There shall be a Planning Commission/Board of Adjustment consisting of
five members appointed by the City Council for three-year terms. The Board of
Adjustment shall meet at least once each month if there are any petitions then
pending for action before the Board, in accordance with the terms of this
section.
   (B)   Appeals to the Board of Adjustment may be taken by any person
aggrieved. The Board of Adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing
of the appeal, giving public notice thereof, as well as due notice to the
parties in interest, and decide the same within a reasonable time. At the
hearing any party may appear in person, or by agent, or by attorney.
   (C)   The Board of Adjustment shall adopt rules necessary to the conduct of
its affairs and in keeping with the provisions of this chapter. Meetings shall
be held at the call of the Chairperson and at any other times as the Board may
determine. The Chairperson, or in his or her absence the Acting Chairperson,
may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. All meetings shall
be open to the public. The Board of Adjustment shall keep minutes of its
proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each question, or if absent
or failing to vote indicating the fact and shall keep records of its
examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be public record
and be immediately filed in the office of the Board.
   (D)   The Board of Adjustment shall always act with due consideration to
promoting the public health, safety, convenience and welfare, encouraging the
most appropriate use of land and conserving property value, shall permit no
building or use detrimental to a neighborhood, and may prescribe appropriate
conditions and safeguards in each case.
   (E)   The Board of Adjustment shall have the following powers:
      (1)   To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is an error in
any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the Zoning Officer;
and
      (2)   To hear requests for variances from the requirements of the zoning
ordinance including restrictions placed on nonconformities. Variances shall
only be permitted when they are in harmony with the general purposes and intent
of the zoning ordinance and when the variances are consistent with the
comprehensive plan. Variances may be granted when the applicant for the
variance establishes that there are practical difficulties in complying with
this chapter. PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES, as used in connection with the granting
of a variance, means that the property owner proposes to use the property in a
reasonable manner not permitted by the zoning ordinance, the plight of the
property owner is due to circumstances unique to the property not created by
the property owner, and the variance, if granted, will not alter the essential
character of the locality. Economic considerations alone do not constitute
practical difficulties. The Board of Adjustment may not permit as a variance
any use that is not allowed under this chapter for property in the zone where
the affected person’s land is located. The Board of Adjustment may impose
conditions in the granting of variances, which must be directly related to and
must bear a rough proportionality to the impact created by the variance.
   (F)   In exercising the above mentioned powers the Board may reverse or
affirm wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or
determination appealed from and may make the order, requirement, decision or
determination as ought to be made, and to that end, shall have all the powers
of the officer from whom the appeal is taken.
   (G)   The majority vote of the members of the Board shall be sufficient to
reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of the Zoning
Officer, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter which it is
required to pass under this chapter, or to effect any variation in this
chapter.

§ 152.072 ZONING PERMIT.
   No structure shall hereafter be erected, or structurally altered until a
zoning permit shall have been issued indicating that the existing or proposed
structure and the use of the land comply with this chapter. All applications
for zoning permits pertaining to the erection or major alterations which will
affect the outside dimensions of a structure, shall be accompanied by three
copies of a site plan. If the site consists of land not a part of a subdivision
or land composed of partial lots, the site plan shall be attached to a survey
or a registered land surveyor showing the actual dimensions of the lot, lots or
parcel to be built upon. The site plan shall also show dimensions of existing
and/or proposed structures to be erected or structurally altered, their
location on the site in relation to the outside boundary, the required off-
street parking plan and any other information as may be necessary to provide
for the enforcement of these regulations. Site plans submitted for all uses
except one- and two-family dwellings shall contain lighting and landscape
plans. Construction on all structures or alterations for which a zoning permit
has been issued must be commenced within one year of the date of the zoning
permit and must be completed within two years of the date of the zoning permit.

152.999

appeal to the City Council, and the right of later judicial review. Any person
aggrieved by a decision of the Board of Adjustment may appeal the decision to
the City Council as follows. Any aggrieved party, to appeal, must file with the
City Clerk-Treasurer, a written notice of appeal within five days (excluding

written decision. The City Council shall act upon the appeal within 30 days
from receipt of same, and the City Council may limit the appeal to a review of
the records and proceedings held before the Board of Adjustment, or may by
majority vote schedule a public hearing on the appeal, to allow testimony and
providing reasonable notice. The decision of the City Council shall be by
majority vote, and the decision shall be made within 30 days from the City
Council hearing. Any party aggrieved by a decision or order of the Board of
Adjustment or City Council may seek judicial review of the decision, reviewed
by an appropriate remedy in the District Court, only if the party has appealed
the decision to the City Council as provided in this section. The written
decisions of the Board of Adjustment and the City Council shall be mailed to
the applicant and to any other interested parties who have requested written
notice of the decision.

to the authorization and policies contained in M.S. Chapter 103F, as it may be
amended from time to time, Minnesota Regulations parts 6120.2500 to 6120.3900,
and the planning and zoning enabling legislation in M.S. Chapter 394 (for
counties) or Chapter 462 (for municipalities), as they may be amended from time
to time.
      (2)   Policy.
         (a)   The uncontrolled use of shorelands of the city affects the
public health, safety and general welfare not only by contributing to pollution
of public waters, but also by impairing the local tax base. Therefore, it is in
the best interests of the public health, safety and welfare to provide for the
wise subdivision, use and development of shorelands responsibility to local
governments of the state to regulate the subdivision, use and development of
the shorelands of public waters and thus preserve and enhance the quality of
surface waters, conserve the economic and natural environmental values of
shorelands, and provide for the wise use of waters and related land resources.
         (b)   This responsibility is hereby recognized by the city.
   (B)   General provisions and definitions.
      (1)   Jurisdiction. The provisions of this section shall apply to the

6120.3900, no lake, pond or flowage less than ten acres in size in
municipalities or 25 acres in size in unincorporated areas need be regulated in
a local government’s shoreland regulations. A body of water created by a
private user where there was no previous shoreland may, at the discretion of
the governing body, be exempt from this section.   
      (2)   Compliance. The use of any shoreland of public waters; the size and
shape of lots; the use, size, type and location of structures on lots; the
installation and maintenance of water supply and waste treatment systems, the
grading and filling of any shoreland area; the cutting of shoreland vegetation;
and the subdivision of land shall be in full compliance with the terms of this
section and other applicable regulations.
      (3)   Enforcement. The city is responsible for the administration and
enforcement of this section. Any violation of the provisions of this section or
failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of
conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variances or
conditional uses) shall constitute a misdemeanor and shall be punishable as
defined by law. Violations of this section can occur regardless of whether or
not a permit is required for a regulated activity pursuant to division (C)(1)
below.
      (4)   Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the
provisions of this section shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall
be liberally construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a
limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes.
      (5)   Severability. If any section, clause, provision or portion of this
section is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the remainder of this section shall not be affected thereby.
      (6)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. It is not intended by this
section to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed
restrictions. However, where this section imposes greater restrictions, the
provisions of this section shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent
with this section are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.

building additions (and including those related activities such as construction
of decks and signs), the installation and/or alteration of sewage treatment
systems, and those grading and filling activities not exempted by division (E)
(3) below. Application for a permit shall be made to the Zoning Officer on the
forms provided. The application shall include the necessary information so that
the Zoning Officer can determine the site’s suitability for the intended use
and that a complaint sewage treatment system will be provided.
         (b)   A permit authorizing an addition to an existing structure shall
stipulate that an identified nonconforming sewage treatment system, as defined
by division (E)(8) below shall be reconstructed or replaced in accordance with
the provisions of this section.
      (2)   Certificate of zoning compliance. The Zoning Officer shall issue a
certificate of zoning compliance for each activity requiring a permit as
specified in division (C)(1) above. This certificate will specify that the use
of land conforms to the requirements of this chapter. Any use, arrangement or
construction at variance with that authorized by permit shall be deemed a
violation of this section and shall be punishable as provided in division (B)
(3) above and §
152.999.
      (3)   Variances.
         (a)   Variances may only be granted in accordance with M.S. Chapter
394 (for counties), as it may be amended from time to time or M.S. Chapter 462
(for municipalities), as it may be amended from time to time, as applicable. A
variance may not circumvent the general purposes and intent of this section. No
variance may be granted that would allow any use that is prohibited in the
zoning district in which the subject property is located. Conditions may be
imposed in the granting of a variance to ensure compliance and to protect
adjacent properties and the public interest. In considering a variance request,
the Board of Adjustment must also consider whether the property owner has
reasonable use of the land without the variance, whether the property is used
seasonally or year-round, whether the variance is being requested solely on the
basis of economic considerations, and the characteristics of development on
adjacent properties.
         (b)   The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide requests for
variances in accordance with the rules that it has adopted for the conduct of
business. When a variance is approved after the Department of Natural Resources
has formally recommended denial in the hearing record, the notification of the
approved variance required in division (C)(4)(b) below shall also include the
Board of Adjustment’s summary of the public record/testimony and the findings
of facts and conclusions which supported the issuance of the variance.
         (c)   For existing developments, the application for variance must
clearly demonstrate whether a conforming sewage treatment system is present for
the intended use of the property. The variance, is issued, must require
reconstruction of a nonconforming sewage treatment system.
      (4)   Notifications to the Department of Natural Resources.
         (a)   Copies of all notices of any public hearings to consider
variances, amendments or conditional uses under local shoreland management
controls must be sent to the Commissioner or the Commissioner’s designated
representative and postmarked at least ten days before the hearings. Notices of
hearings to consider proposed subdivisions/plats must include copies of the
subdivision/plat.
         (b)   A copy of approved amendments and subdivisions/plats, and final
decisions granting variances or conditional uses under local shoreland
management controls must be sent to the Commissioner or the Commissioner’s
designated representative and postmarked within ten days of final action.

            1.   Residential subdivisions with dwelling unit densities
exceeding those in the tables in divisions (E)(1)(b) and (E)(1)(c) above can
only be allowed if designed and approved as residential planned unit
developments under division (H) below. Only land above the ordinary high water
level of public waters can be used to meet lot area standards, and lot width
standards must be met at both the ordinary high water level and at the building
line. The sewer lot area dimensions in division (E)(1)(b) above can only be
used if publicly owned sewer system service is available to the property.
            2.   Subdivisions of duplexes, triplexes and quads on natural
environment lakes must also meet the following standards:
               a.   Each building must be set back at least 200 feet from the
ordinary high water level;
               b.   Each building must have common sewage treatment and water
systems in one location and serve all dwelling units in the building;
               c.   Watercraft docking facilities for each lot must be
centralized in one location and serve all dwelling units in the building; and
               d.   No more than 25% of a lake’s shoreline can be in duplex,
triplex or quad developments.
            3.   One guest cottage may be allowed on lots meeting or exceeding
the duplex lot area and width dimensions presented in divisions (E)(1)(a), (E)
(1)(b) and (E)(1)(c) above, provided the following standards are met:
               a.   For lots exceeding the minimum lot dimensions of duplex
lots, the guest cottage must be located within the smallest duplex-sized lot
that could be created including the principal dwelling unit;
               b.   A guest cottage must not cover more than 700 square feet of
land surface and must not exceed 15 feet in height; and
               c.   A guest cottage must be located or designed to reduce its
visibility as viewed from public waters and adjacent shorelands by vegetation,
topography, increased setbacks or color, assuming summer leaf-on conditions.
            4.   Lots intended as controlled accesses to public waters or as
recreation areas for use by owners of nonriparian lots within subdivisions are
permissible and must meet or exceed the following standards:
               a.   They must meet the width and size requirements for
residential lots, and be suitable for the intended uses of controlled access
lots; and
               b.   If docking, mooring or over-water storage of more than six
watercraft is to be allowed at a controlled access lot, then the width of the
lot (keeping the same lot depth) must be increased by the percent of the
requirements for riparian residential lots for each watercraft beyond six,
consistent with the following table:
 
Controlled Access Lot Frontage Requirements
Ratio of Lake Size to Shore Length  Required Increase in Frontage (Percent)
(Acres/Mile)
Less than 100                       25
100—200                           20
201—300                           15
301—400                           10
Greater than 400                    5
 
               c.   They must be jointly owned by all purchasers of lots in the
subdivision or by all purchasers of nonriparian lots in the subdivision who are
provided riparian access rights on the access lot; and
               d.   Covenants or other equally effective legal instruments must
be developed that specify which lot owners have authority to use the access lot
and what activities are allowed. The activities may include watercraft
launching, loading, storage, beaching, mooring or docking. They must also
include other outdoor recreational activities that do not significantly
conflict with general public use of the public water or the enjoyment of normal
property rights by adjacent property owners. Examples of the nonsignificant
conflict activities include swimming, sunbathing or picnicking. The covenants
must limit the total number of vehicles allowed to be parked and the total
number of watercraft allowed to be continuously moored, docked or stored over
water, and must require centralization of all common facilities and activities
in the most suitable locations on the lot to minimize topographic and
vegetation alterations. They must also require all parking areas, storage
buildings and other facilities to be screened by vegetation or topography as
much as practical from view from the public water, assuming summer leaf-on
conditions.
      (2)   Placement, design and height of structures.
         (a)   Placement of structures on lots. When more than one setback
applies to a site, structures and facilities must be located to meet all
setbacks. Where structures exist on the adjoining lots on both sides of a
proposed building site, structure setbacks may be altered without a variance to
conform to the adjoining setbacks from the ordinary high water level, provided
the proposed building site is not located in a shore impact zone or in a bluff
impact zone. Structures shall be located as follows.
            1.   Structure and on-site sewage system setbacks (in feet) from
ordinary high water level.*

*   One water-oriented accessory structure designed in accordance with
division (E)(2)(b) below may be set back a minimum distance of ten feet from
the ordinary high water level.
 
            2.   Additional structure setbacks. The following additional
structure setbacks apply, regardless of the classification of the waterbody:
 
Setback From:                                                Setback (in feet)
Right-of-way line of federal, state or county highway        50
Right-of-way line of town road, public street or other roads 20

Unplatted cemetery                                           50
 
            3.   Bluff impact zones. Structures and accessory facilities,
except stairways and landings, must not be placed within bluff impact zones.
            4.   Uses without water-oriented needs. Uses without water-oriented
needs must be located on lots or parcels without public waters frontage, or, if
located on lots or parcels with public waters frontage, must either be set back
double the normal ordinary high water level setback or be substantially
screened from view from the water by vegetation or topography, assuming summer
leaf-on conditions.
         (b)   Design criteria for structures.
            1.   High water elevations. Structures must be placed in accordance
with any floodplain regulations applicable to the site. Where these controls do
not exist, the elevation to which the lowest floor, including basement, is
placed or flood-proofed must be determined as follows:
               a.   For lakes, by placing the lowest floor at a level at least
three feet above the highest known water level, or three feet above the
ordinary high water level, whichever is higher;
               b.   For rivers and streams, by placing the lowest floor at
least three feet above the flood of record, if data is available. If data is
not available, by placing the lowest floor at least three feet above the
ordinary high water level, or by conducting a technical evaluation to determine
effects of proposed construction upon flood stages and flood flows and to
establish a flood protection elevation. Under all three approaches, technical
evaluations must be done by a qualified engineer or hydrologist consistent with
Minnesota Rules parts 6120.5000 to 6120.6200 governing the management of
floodplain areas. If more than one approach is used, the highest flood
protection elevation determined must be used for placing structures and other
facilities; and
               c.   Water-oriented accessory structures may have the lowest
floor placed lower than the elevation determined in this division (E)(2)(b)1.c.
if the structure is constructed of flood-resistant materials to the elevation,
electrical and mechanical equipment is placed above the elevation and, if long
duration flooding is anticipated, the structure is built to withstand ice
action and wind-driven waves and debris.
            2.   Water-oriented accessory structures. Each lot may have one
water-oriented accessory structure not meeting the normal structure setback in
division (E)(2)(a) above if this water-oriented accessory structure complies
with the following provisions:
               a.   The structure or facility must not exceed ten feet in
height, except for boat houses which must not exceed 14 feet in height,
exclusive of safety rails, and cannot occupy an area greater than 250 square
feet. Detached decks must not exceed eight feet above grade at any point;
               b.   The setback of the structure or facility from the ordinary
high water level must be at least ten feet;
               c.   The structure or facility must be treated to reduce
visibility as viewed from public waters and adjacent shorelands by vegetation,
topography, increased setbacks or color, assuming summer leaf-on conditions;
               d.   The roof may be used as a deck with safety rails, but must
not be enclosed or used as a storage area;
               e.   The structure or facility must not be designed or used for
human habitation and must not contain water supply or sewage treatment
facilities; and
               f.   As an alternative for general development and recreational
development water bodies, water-oriented accessory structures used solely for
watercraft storage, and including storage of related boating and water-oriented
sporting equipment, may occupy an area up to 400 square feet provided the
maximum width of the structure is 20 feet as measured parallel to the
configuration of the shoreline.
            3.   Stairways, lifts and landings. Stairways and lifts are the
preferred alternative to major topographic alterations for achieving access up
and down bluffs and steep slopes to shore areas. Stairways and lifts must meet
the following design requirements:
               a.   Stairways and lifts must not exceed four feet in width on
residential lots. Wider stairways may be used for commercial properties, public
open-space recreational properties, and planned unit developments;
               b.   Landings for stairways and lifts on residential lots must
not exceed 32 square feet in area. Landings larger than 32 square feet may be
used for commercial properties, public open-space recreational properties and
planned unit developments;
               c.   Canopies or roofs are not allowed on stairways, lifts or
landings;
               d.   Stairways, lifts and landings may be either constructed
above the ground on posts or pilings, or placed into the ground, provided they
are designed and built in a manner that ensures control of soil erosion;
               e.   Stairways, lifts and landings must be located in the most
visually inconspicuous portions of lots, as viewed from the surface of the
public water assuming summer leaf-on conditions, whenever practical; and
               f.   Facilities such as ramps, lifts or mobility paths for
physically handicapped persons are also allowed for achieving access to shore
areas, provided that the dimensional and performance standards of divisions (E)
(2)(b)3.a. to (E)(2)(b)3.f. are complied with in addition to the requirements
of Minnesota Regulations Chapter 1340.
            4.   Significant historic sites. No structure may be placed on a
significant historic site in a manner that affects the values of the site
unless adequate information about the site has been removed and documented in a
public repository.
            5.   Steep slopes. The Zoning Officer must evaluate possible soil
erosion impacts and development visibility from public waters before issuing a
permit for construction of sewage treatment systems, roads, driveways,
structures or other improvements on steep slopes. When determined necessary,
conditions must be attached to issued permits to prevent erosion and to
preserve existing vegetation screening of structures, vehicles and other
facilities as viewed from the surface of public waters, assuming summer leaf-on
vegetation.
         (c)   Height of structures. All structures in residential districts,
except churches and nonresidential agricultural structures, must not exceed 25
feet in height.
      (3)   Shoreland alterations. Alterations of vegetation and topography
will be regulated to prevent erosion into public waters, fix nutrients,
preserve shoreland aesthetics, preserve historic values, prevent bank slumping
and protect fish and wildlife habitat.
         (a)   Vegetation alterations.
            1.   Vegetation alteration necessary for the construction of
structures and sewage treatment systems and the construction of roads and
parking areas regulated by division (E)(4) below are exempt from the vegetation
alteration standards that follow.
            2.   The removal of natural vegetation (i.e., trees, shrubs and
plants) within the shore and bluff impact zones is restricted and limited to
the following:
               a.   The trimming and pruning of trees, shrubs and plants;
               b.   The random pattern removal of 25% of trees (greater than
two inches in diameter at breast height), shrubs and plants. Note: this means
that no more than 25% of the trees may be removed between the principal
structure and the waterbody within the impact zone, and 25% vegetative removal
standard throughout the shore impact zone. The random pattern removal means
that clear cutting is not permitted with the exception that a clear cut path of
no greater width than ten feet for access to the shoreline is permitted. This
path clearing is to be included in determining the not to exceed total clearing
of 25%;
               c.   Authorized removal of trees, shrubs and plants shall be
accomplished through human means (i.e., hands, ax, chain saw, saw and the
like), and shall not be done by heavy equipment; and
               d.   If for any reason the above 25% maximum is exceeded (such
as the removal of dead, diseased, dangerous and storm or fire damaged trees,
plants or shrubs) then the vegetation must be replaced except under the
following conditions:
                  i.   The vegetation removed is replaced with trees, shrubs
and plants that have similar, or more, beneficial ecological, erosion
preventative and screening values than previously existed;
                  ii.   Forest management activity where the intent is to have
an ongoing timber producing area and not to convert the area to residential,
commercial, recreational or other more intensive use will use best management
practices as developed by the state; and
                  iii.   The removal of more than 25% of trees is permitted
when the trees were planted as part of a plantation and thinning is needed to
ensure continued viability of the plantation.
         (b)   Topographic alterations/grading and filling.
            1.   Grading and filling and excavations necessary for the
construction of structures, sewage treatment systems and driveways under
validly issued construction permits for these facilities do not require the
issuance of a separate grading and filling permit. However, the grading and
filling standards in this section must be incorporated into the issuance of
permits for construction of structures, sewage treatment systems and driveways.
            2.   Public roads and parking areas are regulated by division (E)
(4) below.
            3.   Notwithstanding divisions (E)(3)(b)1. and (E)(3)(b)2. above, a
grading and filling permit will be required for:
               a.   The movement of more than ten cubic yards of material on
steep slopes or within shore or bluff impact zones; and
               b.   The movement of more than 50 cubic yards of material
outside of steep slopes and shore and bluff impact zones.
            4.   The following considerations and conditions must be adhered to
during the issuance of construction permits, grading and filling permits,
conditional use permits, variances and subdivision approvals:
               a.   i.   Grading or filling in any type 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8
wetland must be evaluated to determine how extensively the proposed activity
would affect the following functional qualities of the wetland:*
                     A.   Sediment and pollutant trapping and retention;
                     B.   Storage of surface runoff to prevent or reduce flood
damage;
                     C.   Fish and wildlife habitat;
                     D.   Recreational use;
                     E.   Shoreline or bank stabilization; and
                     F.   Noteworthiness, including special qualities such as
historic significance, critical habitat for endangered plants and animals or
others.
                  ii.   * This evaluation must also include a determination of
whether the wetland alteration being proposed requires permits, reviews or
approvals by other local, state or federal agencies such as a watershed
district, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, or the United States
Army Corps of Engineers. The applicant will be so advised.
               b.   Alterations must be designed and conducted in a manner that
ensures only the smallest amount of bar ground is exposed for the shortest time
possible;
               c.   Mulches or similar materials must be used, where necessary,
for temporary bare soil coverage, and a permanent vegetation cover must be
established as soon as possible;
               d.   Methods to minimize soil erosion and to trap sediments
before they reach any surface water feature must be used;
               e.   Altered areas must be stabilized to acceptable erosion
control standards consistent with the field office technical guides of the
local soil and water conservation districts and the United States Soil
Conservation Service;
               f.   Fill or excavated material must not be placed in a manner
that creates an unstable slope;
               g.   Plans to place fill or excavated material on steep slopes
must be reviewed by qualified professionals for continued slope stability and
must not create finished slopes of 30% or greater;
               h.   Fill or excavated material must not be placed in bluff
impact zones;
               i.   Any alterations below the ordinary high water level of
public waters must first be authorized by the Commissioner under M.S. §
103G.245, as it may be amended from time to time;
               j.   Alterations of topography must only be allowed if they are
accessory to permitted or conditional uses and do not adversely affect adjacent
or nearby properties; and
               k.   Placement of natural rock riprap, including associated
grading of the shoreline and placement of a filter blanket, is permitted if the
finished slope does not exceed three feet horizontal to one foot vertical, the
landward extent of the riprap is within ten feet of the ordinary high water
level, and the height of the riprap above the ordinary high water level does
not exceed three feet.
            5.   Connections to public waters. Excavations where the intended
purpose is connection to a public water, such as boat slips, canals, lagoons
and harbors, must be controlled by local shoreland controls. Permission for
excavations may be given only after the Commissioner has approved the proposed
connection to public waters.
      (4)   Placement and design of roads, driveways and parking areas.
         (a)   Public and private roads and parking areas must be designed to
take advantage of natural vegetation and topography to achieve maximum
screening from view from public waters. Documentation must be provided by a
qualified individual that all roads and parking areas are designed and
constructed to minimize and control erosion to public waters consistent with
the field office technical guides of the local soil and water conservation
district, or other applicable technical materials.
         (b)   Roads, driveways and parking areas must meet structure setbacks
and must not be placed within bluff and shore impact zones, when other
reasonable and feasible placement alternatives exist. If no alternatives exist,
they may be placed within these areas, and must be designed to minimize adverse
impacts.
         (c)   Public and private watercraft access ramps, approach roads and
access-related parking areas may be placed within shore impact zones provided
the vegetative screening and erosion control conditions of this division (E)(4)
(c) above are met. For private facilities, the grading and filling provisions
of division (E)(3)(b) above must be met.
      (5)   Storm water management. The following general and specific
standards shall apply.
         (a)   General standards.
            1.   When possible, existing natural drainageways, wetlands and
vegetated soil surfaces must be used to convey, store, filter and retain storm
water runoff before discharge to public waters.
            2.   Development must be planned and conducted in a manner that
will minimize the extent of disturbed areas, runoff velocities, erosion
potential, and reduce and delay runoff volumes. Disturbed areas must be
stabilized and protected as soon as possible and facilities or methods used to
retain sediment on the site.
            3.   When development density, topographic features and soil and
vegetation conditions are not sufficient to adequately handle storm water
runoff using natural features and vegetation, various types of constructed
facilities such as diversions, settling basins, skimming devices, dikes,
waterways and ponds may be used. Preference must be given to designs using
surface drainage, vegetation and infiltration rather than buried pipes and
human-made materials and facilities.
         (b)   Specific standards.
            1.   Impervious surface coverage of lots must not exceed 25% of the
lot area.
            2.   When constructed facilities are used for storm water
management, documentation must be provided by a qualified individual that they
are designed and installed consistent with the field office technical guide of
the local soil and water conservation districts.
            3.   New constructed storm water outfalls to public waters must
provide for filtering or settling of suspended solids and skimming of surface
debris before discharge.
      (6)   Special provisions for commercial, industrial, public/semipublic,
agricultural, forestry and extractive uses and mining of metallic minerals and
peat.
         (a)   Standards for commercial, industrial, public and semipublic
uses.
            1.   Surface water-oriented commercial uses and industrial, public,
or semipublic uses with similar needs to have access to and use of public
waters may be located on parcels or lots with frontage on public waters. Those
uses with water-oriented needs must meet the following standards:
               a.   In addition to meeting impervious coverage limits, setbacks
and other zoning standards in this section, the uses must be designed to
incorporate topographic and vegetative screening of parking areas and
structures;
               b.   Uses that require short-term watercraft mooring for patrons
must centralize these facilities and design them to avoid obstruction of
navigation and to be the minimum size necessary to meet the need; and
               c.   Uses that depend on patrons arriving by watercraft may use
signs and lighting to convey needed information to the public, subject to the
following general standards:
                  i.   No advertising signs or supporting facilities for signs
may be placed in or upon public waters. Signs conveying information or safety
messages may be placed in or on public waters by a public authority or under a
permit issued by the County Sheriff;
                  ii.   Signs may be placed, when necessary, within the shore
impact zone if they are designed and sized to be the minimum necessary to
convey needed information. They must only convey the location and name of the
establishment and the general types of goods or services available. The signs
must not contain other detailed information such as product brands and prices,
must not be located higher than ten feet above the ground, and must not exceed
32 square feet in size. If illuminated by artificial lights, the lights must be
shielded or directed to prevent illumination out across the public waters; and
                  iii.   Other outside lighting may be located within the shore
impact zone or over public waters if it is used primarily to illuminate
potential safety hazards and is shielded or otherwise directed to prevent
direct illumination out across public waters. This does not preclude use of
navigational lights.
            2.   Uses without water-oriented needs must be located on lots or
parcels without public waters frontage, or, if located on lots or parcels with
public waters frontage, must either be set back double the normal ordinary high
water level setback or be substantially screened from view from the water
vegetation or topography, assuming summer leaf-on conditions.
         (b)   Agriculture use standards.
            1.   General cultivation farming, grazing, nurseries, horticulture,
truck farming, sod farming and wild crop harvesting are permitted uses if steep
slopes and shore and bluff impact zones are maintained in permanent vegetation
or operated under an approved conservation plan (Resource Management Systems)
consistent with the field office technical guides of the local soil and water
conservation districts or the United States Soil Conservation Service, as
provided by a qualified individual or agency. The shore impact zone for parcels
with permitted agricultural land uses is equal to a line parallel to and 50
feet from the ordinary high water level.
            2.   Animal feedlots must meet the following standards:
               a.   New feedlots must not be located in the shoreland of
watercourses or in bluff impact zones and must meet a minimum setback of 300
feet from the ordinary high water level of all public waters basins; and
               b.   Modifications or expansions to existing feedlots that are
located within 300 feet from the ordinary high water level or within a bluff
impact zone are allowed if they do not further encroach into the existing
ordinary high water level setback or encroach on bluff impact zones.
         (c)   Forest management standards. The harvesting of timber and
associated reforestation must be conducted consistent with the provisions of
the Minnesota Nonpoint Source Pollution Assessment-Forestry and the provisions
of Water Quality in Forest Management Best Management Practices Minnesota.
         (d)   Extractive use standards.
            1.   Site development and restoration plan. An extractive use site
development and restoration plan must be developed, approved and followed over
the course of operation of the site. The plan must address dust, noise,
possible pollutant discharges, hours and duration of operation, and anticipated
vegetation and topographic alterations. It must also identify actions to be
taken during operation to mitigate adverse environmental impacts, particularly
erosion, and must clearly explain how the site will be rehabilitated after
extractive activities end.
            2.   Setbacks for processing machinery. Processing machinery must
be located consistent with setback standards for structures from ordinary high
water levels of public waters and from bluffs.
         (e)   Mining of metallic minerals and peat. Mining of metallic
minerals and peat, as defined in M.S. §§ 93.44 to 93.51, as they may be amended
from time to time, shall be a permitted use provided the provisions of M.S. §§
93.44 to 93.51, as they may be amended from time to time, are satisfied.
      (7)   Conditional uses. Conditional uses allowable within shoreland areas
shall be subject to the review and approval procedures, and criteria and
conditions for review of conditional uses established community-wide. The
following additional evaluation criteria and conditions apply within shoreland
areas:
         (a)   Evaluation criteria. A thorough evaluation of the waterbody and
the topographic, vegetation and soils conditions on the site must be made to
ensure:
            1.   The prevention of soil erosion or other possible pollution of
public waters, both during and after construction;
            2.   The visibility of structures and other facilities as viewed
from public waters is limited;
            3.   The site is adequate for water supply and on-site sewage
treatment; and
            4.   The types, uses and numbers of watercraft that the project
will generate are compatible in relation to the suitability of public waters to
safely accommodate these watercraft.
         (b)   Conditions attached to conditional use permits. The city, upon
consideration of the criteria listed above and the purposes of this section,
shall attach conditions to the issuance of the conditional use permits as it
deems necessary to fulfill the purposes of this section. These conditions may
include, but are not limited to, the following:
            1.   Increased setbacks from the ordinary high water level;
            2.   Limitations on the natural vegetation to be removed or the
requirement that additional vegetation be planted; and
            3.   Special provisions for the location, design and use of
structures, sewage treatment systems, watercraft launching and docking areas,
and vehicle parking areas.
      (8)   Water supply and sewage treatment.
         (a)   Water supply. Any public or private supply of water for domestic
purposes must meet or exceed standards for water quality of the Minnesota
Department of Health and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.
         (b)   Sewage treatment. Any premises used for human occupancy must be
provided with an adequate method of sewage treatment, as follows.
            1.   Publicly-owned sewer systems must be used where available.
            2.   All private sewage treatment systems must meet or exceed the
Minnesota Pollution Control Agency’s standards for individual sewage treatment
systems contained in the document titled, Individual Sewage Treatment Systems
Standards, Chapter 7080, a copy of which is hereby adopted by reference and
declared to be a part of this section.
            3.   On-site sewage treatment systems must be set back from the
ordinary high water level in accordance with the setbacks contained in division
(E)(2)(a) above.
            4.   a.   All proposed sites for individual sewage treatment
systems shall be evaluated in accordance with the criteria in divisions (E)(8)
(b)1. through (E)(8)(b)4. If the determination of a site’s suitability cannot
be made with publicly available, existing information, it shall then be the
responsibility of the applicant to provide sufficient soil borings and
percolation tests from on-site field investigations.
               b.   Evaluation criteria:
                  i.   Depth to the highest known or calculated ground water
table or bedrock;
                  ii.   Soil conditions, properties and permeability;
                  iii.   Slope; and
                  iv.   The existence of lowlands, local surface depressions
and rock outcrops.
            5.   Nonconforming sewage treatment systems shall be regulated and
upgraded in accordance with division (F)(3) below.
   (F)   Nonconformities. All legally established nonconformities as of the
date of this section may continue, but they will be managed according to
applicable state statutes and other regulations of this community for the
subjects of alterations and additions, repair after damage, discontinuance of
use, and intensification if use; except that the following standards will also
apply in shoreland areas.
      (1)   Construction on nonconforming lots of record.
         (a)   Lots of record in the office of the County Recorder on the date
enactment of local shoreland controls that do not meet the requirements of
division (E)(1) above may be allowed as building sites without variances from
lot size requirements provided the use is permitted in the zoning district, the
lot has been in separate ownership from abutting lands at all times since it
became substandard, was created compliant with official controls in effect at
the time, and sewage treatment and setback requirements of this section are
met.
         (b)   A variance from setback requirements must be obtained before any
use, sewage treatment system or zoning permit is issued for a lot. In
evaluating the variance, the Board of Adjustment shall consider sewage
treatment and water supply capabilities or constraints of the lot and shall
deny the variance if adequate facilities cannot be provided.
         (c)   If, in a group of two or more contiguous lots under the same
ownership, any individual lot does not meet the requirements of division (E)(1)
above the lot must nor be considered as a separate parcel of land for the
purposes of sale or development. The lot must be combined with the one or more
contiguous lots so they equal one or more parcels of land, each meeting the
requirements of division (E)(1) above as much as possible.
      (2)   Additions/expansions to nonconforming structures.
         (a)   All additions or expansions to the outside dimensions of an
existing nonconforming structure must meet the setback, height and other
requirements of division (E) above. Any deviation from these requirements must
be authorized by a variance pursuant to division (C)(3) above.
         (b)   Deck additions may be allowed without a variance to a structure
not meeting the required setback from the ordinary high water level if all of
the following criteria and standards are met:
            1.   The structure existed on the date the structure setbacks were
established;
            2.   A thorough evaluation of the property and structure reveals no
reasonable location for a deck meeting or exceeding the existing ordinary high
water level setback of the structure;
            3.   The deck encroachment toward the ordinary high water level
does not exceed 15% of the existing setback of the structure from the ordinary
high water level or does not encroach closer than 30 feet, whichever is more
restrictive; and
            4.   The deck is constructed primarily of wood, and is not roofed
or screened.
      (3)   Nonconforming sewage treatment systems.
            1.   A sewage treatment system not meeting the requirements of
division (E)(8) above must be upgraded, at a minimum, at any time a permit or
variance of any type is required for any improvement on, or use of, the
property. For the purposes of this division (F)(3), a sewage treatment system
shall not be considered nonconforming if the only deficiency is the sewage
treatment system’s improper setback from the ordinary high water level.
            2.   The governing body of the city has by formal resolution
notified the Commissioner of its program to identify nonconforming sewage
treatment systems. The city will require upgrading or replacement of any
nonconforming system identified by this program within a reasonable period of
time which will not exceed two years. Sewage systems installed according to all
applicable local shoreland management standards adopted under M.S. § 105.485
(now M.S. §§ 103F.201-.221, as they may be amended from time to time) in effect
at the time of installation may be considered as conforming unless they are
determined to be failing, except that systems using cesspools, leaching pits,
seepage pits or other deep disposal methods, or systems with less soil
treatment area separation above groundwater than required by the Minnesota
Pollution Control Agency’s Chapter 7080 for design of on-site sewage treatment
systems, shall be considered nonconforming.
   (G)   Subdivision/platting provisions.
      (1)   Land suitability. Each lot created through subdivision, including
planned unit developments authorized under division (H) below, must be suitable
in its natural state for the proposed use with minimal alteration. Suitability
analysis by the local unit of government shall consider susceptibility to
flooding existence of wetlands, soil and rock formations with severe
limitations for development, severe erosion potential, steep topography,
inadequate water supply or sewage treatment capabilities, near-shore aquatic
conditions unsuitable for water-based recreation, important fish and wildlife
habitat, presence of significant historic sites, or any other feature of the
natural land likely to be harmful to the health, safety or welfare of future
residents of the proposed subdivision or of the community.
      (2)   Consistency with other controls. Subdivisions must conform to all
official controls of this community. A subdivision will not be approved where a
later variance from one or more standards in official controls would be needed
to use the lots for their intended purpose. In areas not served by publicly
owned sewer and water systems, a subdivision will not be approved unless
domestic water supply is available and a sewage treatment system consistent
with divisions (E)(2) and (E)(8) above can be provided for every lot. Each lot
shall meet the minimum lot size and dimensional requirements of division (E)(1)
above, including at least a minimum contiguous lawn area, that is free of
limiting factors sufficient for the construction of two standard soil treatment
systems. Lots that would require use of holding tanks must not be approved.
      (3)   Information requirements. Sufficient information must be submitted
by the applicant for the community to make a determination of land suitability.
The information shall include at least the following:
         (a)   The surface water features required in M.S. § 505.021, subd. 8,
as it may amended from time to time, to be shown on plats, obtained from United
States Geological Survey quadrangle topographic maps or more accurate sources;
         (b)   Adequate soils information to determine suitability for building
and on-site sewage treatment capabilities for every lot from the most current
existing sources or from field investigations such as soil borings, percolation
tests or other methods;
         (c)   Information regarding adequacy of domestic water supply; extent
of anticipated vegetation and topographic alterations; near-shore aquatic
conditions, including depths, types of bottom sediments and aquatic vegetation;
and proposed methods for controlling storm water runoff and erosion, both
during and after construction activities;
         (d)   Location of 100-year floodplain areas and floodway districts
from existing adopted maps or data; and
         (e)   A line or contour representing the ordinary high water level,
the “toe” and the “top” of bluffs, and the minimum building setback distances
from the top of the bluff and the lake or stream.
      (4)   Dedications. When a land or easement dedication is a condition of
subdivision approval, the approval must provide easements over natural drainage
or ponding areas for management of storm water and significant wetlands.
      (5)   Platting. No permit for construction of buildings or sewage
treatment systems shall be issued for lots created after these official
controls were enacted unless the lot was approved as part of a formal
subdivision.
      (6)   Controlled access or recreational lots. Lots intended as controlled
accesses to public waters or for recreational use areas for use by nonriparian
lots within a subdivision must meet or exceed the sizing criteria in division
(E)(1)(d) above.
   (H)   Planned unit developments (PUDs).
      (1)   Types of PUDs permissible. Planned unit developments (PUDs) are
allowed for new projects on undeveloped land, redeveloped of previously built
sites or conversions of existing buildings and land.
      (2)   Processing of PUDs. Planned unit developments must be processed as
a conditional use, except that an expansion to an existing commercial PUD
involving six or less new dwelling units or sites since the date this section
was adopted is permissible as a permitted use provided the total project
density does not exceed the allowable densities calculated in the project
density evaluation procedures in division (H)(5) below. Approval cannot occur
until the environmental review process (EAW/EIS) is complete.
      (3)   Application for a PUD. The applicant for a PUD must submit the
following documents prior to final action being taken on the application
request:
         (a)   A site plan and/or plat for the project showing locations of
property boundaries, surface water features, existing and proposed structures
and other facilities, land alterations, sewage treatment and water supply
systems (where public systems will not be provided), and topographic contours
at ten-foot intervals or less. When a PUD is a combined commercial and
residential development, the site plan and/or plat must indicate and
distinguish which buildings and portions of the project are residential,
commercial or a combination of the two;
         (b)   A property owners association agreement (for residential PUDs)
with mandatory membership, and all in accordance with the requirements of
division (H)(6) below;
         (c)   Deed restrictions, covenants, permanent easements or other
instruments that:
            1.   Properly address future vegetative and topographic
alterations, construction of additional buildings, beaching of watercraft and
construction of commercial buildings in residential PUDs; and
            2.   Ensure the long-term preservation and maintenance of open
space in accordance with the criteria and analysis specified in division (H)(6)
below.
         (d)   When necessary, a master plan/drawing describing the project and
the floor plan for all commercial structures to be occupied; and
         (e)   Those additional documents as requested by the city that are
necessary to explain how the PUD will be designed and will function.
      (4)   Site “suitable area” evaluation. Proposed new or expansions to
existing planned unit developments must be evaluated using the following
procedures and standards to determine the suitable area for the dwelling unit/
dwelling site density evaluation in division (H)(5) below.
         (a)   The project parcel must be divided into tiers by locating one or
more lines approximately parallel to a line that identifies the ordinary high
water level at the following intervals, proceeding landward:
 
Shoreland Tier Dimensions
                                       Unsewered (feet) Sewered (feet)
All river classes                      300              300
General development lakes - first tier 200              200
General development lakes - second and 267              200
additional tiers
Natural environment lakes              400              320
Recreational development lakes         267              267
 
         (b)   The suitable area within each tier is next calculated by
excluding from the tier area all wetlands, bluffs or land below the ordinary
high water level of public waters. This suitable area and the proposed project
are then subjected to either the residential or commercial planned unit
development density evaluation steps to arrive at an allowable number of
dwelling units or sites.
      (5)   Residential and commercial PUD density evaluation. The procedures
for determining the “base” density of a PUD and density increase multipliers
are as follows. Allowable densities may be transferred from any tier to any
other tier further from the waterbody, but must not be transferred to any other
tier closer.
         (a)   Residential PUD “base” density evaluation.
            1.   The suitable area within each tier is divided by the single
residential lot size standard for lakes or, for rivers, the single residential
lot width standard times the tier depth, unless the local unit of government
has specified an alternative minimum lot size for rivers which shall then be
used to yield a base density of dwelling units or sites for each tier.
            2.   Proposed locations and numbers of dwelling units or sites for
the residential planned unit developments are then compared with the tier,
density and suitability analyses herein and the design criteria in division (H)
(6) below.
         (b)   Commercial PUD “base” density evaluation.
            1.   Determine the average inside living area size of dwelling
units or sites within each tier, including both existing and proposed units and
sites. Computation of inside living area sizes need not include decks, patios,
stoops, steps, garages or porches and basements, unless they are habitable
space.
            2.   Select the appropriate floor area ration from the following
table:

*   For average unit floor areas less than shown, use the floor area ratios
listed for 200 square feet. For areas greater than shown, use the ratios
listed for 1,500 square feet. For recreational camping areas, use the ratios
listed at 400 square feet. Manufactured home sites in recreational camping
areas shall use a ratio equal to the size of the manufactured home, or if
unknown, the ratio listed for 1,000 square feet.
 
            3.   Multiply the suitable area within each tier by the floor area
ration to yield total floor area for each tier allowed to be used for dwelling
units or sites.
            4.   Divide the total floor area by tier computed in division (H)
(5)(b)3. above by the average inside living area size determined in division
(H)(5)(b)1. above. This yields a base number of dwelling units and sites for
each tier.
            5.   Proposed locations and numbers of dwelling units or sites for
the commercial planned unit development are then compared with the tier,
density and suitability analyses herein and the design criteria in division (H)
(6) below.
            6.   Density increase multipliers.
               a.   Increases to the dwelling unit or dwelling site base
densities previously determined are allowable if the dimensional standards in
division (E) above are met or exceeded and the design criteria in division (H)
(6) below are satisfied. The allowable density increases in division (H)(5)
(b)6.b. below will only be allowed if structure setbacks from the ordinary high
water level are increased to at least 50% greater than the minimum setback, or
the impact on the waterbody is reduced an equivalent amount through vegetative
management, topography or additional means acceptable to the local unit of
government and the setback is at least 25% greater than the minimum setback.
               b.   Allowable dwelling unit or dwelling site density increases
for residential or commercial planned unit developments:
 
Density Evaluation Tiers Maximum Density Increase Within Each Tier (Percent)
First                    50
Second                   100
Third                    200
Fourth                   200
Fifth                    200
 
      (6)   Maintenance and design criteria.
         (a)   Maintenance and administration requirements.
            1.   Before final approval of a planned unit development, adequate
provisions must be developed for preservation and maintenance in perpetuity of
open spaces and for the continued existence and functioning of the development.
            2.   Open space preservation: deed restrictions, covenants,
permanent easements, public dedication and acceptance, or other equally
effective and permanent means must be provided to ensure long-term preservation
and maintenance of open space. The instruments must include all of the
following protections:
               a.   Commercial uses prohibited (for residential PUDs);
               b.   Vegetation and topographic alterations other than routing
maintenance prohibited;
               c.   Construction of additional buildings or storage of vehicles
and other materials prohibited; and
               d.   Uncontrolled beaching of watercraft prohibited.
            3.   Development organization and functioning: unless an equally
effective alternative community framework is established, when applicable, all
residential planned unit developments must use an owners association with the
following features:
               a.   Membership must be mandatory for each dwelling unit or site
purchaser and any successive purchasers;
               b.   Each member must pay a pro rata share of the association’s
expenses, and unpaid assessments can become liens on units or sites;
               c.   Assessments must be adjustable to accommodate changing
conditions: and
               d.   The association must be responsible for insurance, taxes
and maintenance of all commonly owned property and facilities.
         (b)   Open space requirements. Planned unit developments must contain
open space meeting all of the following criteria:
            1.   At least 50% of the total project area must be preserved as
open space;
            2.   Dwelling units or sites, road rights-of-way or land covered by
road surfaces, parking areas or structures, except water-oriented accessory
structures or facilities, are developed areas and shall not be included in the
computation of minimum open space;
            3.   Open space must include areas with physical characteristics
unsuitable for development in their natural state, and areas containing
significant historic sites or unplatted cemeteries;
            4.   Open space may include outdoor recreational facilities for use
by owners of dwelling units or sites, by guests staying in commercial dwelling
units or sites, and by the general public;
            5.   Open space may include subsurface sewage treatment systems if
the use of the space is restricted to avoid adverse impacts on the systems;
            6.   Open space must not include commercial facilities or uses, but
may contain water-oriented accessory structures or facilities;
            7.   The appearance of open space areas, including topography,
vegetation and allowable uses, must be preserved by use of restrictive deed
covenants, permanent easements, public dedication and acceptance or other
equally effective and permanent means; and
            8.   The shore impact zone, based on normal structure setbacks,
must be included as open space. For residential PUDs, at least 50% of the shore
impact zone area of existing developments or at least 70% of the shore impact
zone area of new developments must be preserved in its natural or existing
state. For commercial PUDs, at least 50% of the shore impact zone must be
preserved in its natural state.
         (c)   Erosion control and storm water management. Erosion control and
storm water management plans must be developed and the PUD must:
            1.   Be designed, and the construction managed, to minimize the
likelihood of serious erosion occurring either during or after construction.
This must be accomplished by limiting the amount and length of time of bare
ground exposure. Temporary ground covers, sediment entrapment facilities,
vegetated buffer strips or other appropriate techniques must be used to
minimize erosion impacts on surface water features. Erosion control plans
approved by a soil and water conservation district may be required if project
size and site physical characteristics warrant; and
            2.   Be designed and constructed to effectively manage reasonably
expected quantities and qualities of storm water runoff. Impervious surface
coverage within any tier must not exceed 25% of the tier area, except that for
commercial PUDs 35% impervious surface coverage may be allowed in the first
tier of general development lakes with an approved storm water management plan
and consistency with division (E)(3) above.
         (d)   Centralization and design of facilities. Centralization and
design of facilities and structures must be done according to the following
standards:
            1.   Planned unit developments must be connected to publicly owned
water supply and sewer systems, if available. On-site water supply and sewage
treatment systems must be centralized and designed and installed to meet or
exceed applicable standards or rules of the Minnesota Department of Health and
divisions (E)(2) and (E)(8) above. On-site sewage treatment systems must be
located on the most suitable areas of the development, and sufficient lawn area
free of limiting factors must be provided for a replacement soil treatment
system for each sewage system;
            2.   Dwelling units or sites must be clustered into one or more
groups and located on suitable areas of the development. They must be designed
and located to meet or exceed the following dimensional standards for the
relevant shoreland classification: setback from the ordinary high water level;
elevation above the surface water features; and maximum height. Setbacks from
the ordinary high water level must be increased in accordance with division (H)
(5)(c) above for developments with density increases;
            3.   Shore recreation facilities, including, but not limited to,
swimming areas, docks and watercraft mooring areas and launching ramps, must be
centralized and located in areas suitable for them. Evaluation of suitability
must include consideration of land slope, water depth, vegetation, soils, depth
to groundwater and bedrock, or other relevant factors. The number of spaces
provided for continuous beaching, mooring or docking of watercraft must not
exceed one for each allowable dwelling unit or site in the first tier
(notwithstanding existing mooring sites in an existing commercially used
harbor). Launching ramp facilities, including a small dock for loading and
unloading equipment, may be provided for use by occupants of dwelling units or
sites located in other tiers;
            4.   Structures, parking areas and other facilities must be treated
to reduce visibility as viewed from public waters and adjacent shorelands by
vegetation, topography, increased setbacks, color or other means acceptable to
the local unit of government, assuming summer leaf-on conditions. Vegetative
and topographic screening must be preserved, if existing, or may be required to
be provided;
            5.   Accessory structures and facilities, except water-oriented
accessory structures, must meet the required principal structure setback and
must be centralized; and   
            6.   Water-oriented accessory structures and facilities may be
allowed if they meet or exceed design standards contained in division (E)(2)
above and are centralized.
      (7)   Conversions. Local governments may allow existing resorts or other
land uses and facilities to be converted to residential planned unit
developments if all of the following standards are met.
         (a)   Proposed conversions must be initially evaluated using the same
procedures for residential planned unit developments involving all new
construction. Inconsistencies between existing features of the development and
these standards must be identified.
         (b)   Deficiencies involving water supply and sewage treatment,
structure color, impervious coverage, open space and shore recreation
facilities must be corrected as part of the conversion or as specified in the
conditional use permit.
         (c)   Shore and bluff impact zone deficiencies must be evaluated and
reasonable improvements made as part of the conversion. These improvements must
include, where applicable, the following:
            1.   Removal of extraneous buildings, docks or other facilities
that no longer need to be located in shore or bluff impact zones;
            2.   Remedial measures to correct erosion sites and improve
vegetative cover and screening of buildings and other facilities as viewed from
the water; and
            3.   a.   If existing dwelling units are located in shore or bluff
impact zones, conditions are attached to approvals of conversions that preclude
exterior expansions in any dimension or substantial alterations.
               b.   The conditions must also provide for future relocation of
dwelling units, where feasible, to other locations, meeting all setback and
elevation requirements when they are rebuilt or replaced.
         (d)   1.   Existing dwelling unit or dwelling site densities that
exceed standards in division (H)(5) above may be allowed to continue but must
not be allowed to be increased, either at the time of conversion or in the
future.
            2.   Efforts must be made during the conversion to limit impacts of
high densities by requiring seasonal use, improving vegetative screening,
centralizing shore recreation facilities, installing new sewage treatment
systems, or other means.

§ 152.101 ADULT ORIENTED ESTABLISHMENTS.
   (A)   Purpose and findings.
      (1)   Purpose.
         (a)   It is the purpose of this section to regulate adult oriented
establishments to promote the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the
citizens of the city and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to:
            1.   Prevent additional criminal activity within the city;
            2.   Prevent deterioration of neighborhoods and its consequent
adverse effect on real estate values of properties within the neighborhood;
            3.   To locate adult oriented establishments away from residential
areas, schools, churches, parks and playgrounds; and
            4.   Prevent concentration of adult oriented establishments within
certain areas of the city.
         (b)   The provisions of this section have neither the purpose nor
effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any
communicative materials, including adult oriented materials. Similarly, it is
not the intent nor effect of this section to restrict or deny access by adults
to adult oriented materials protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to
the Constitution of the United States or to deny access by distributors and
exhibitors of adult oriented entertainment to their intended market.
      (2)   Findings.
         (a)   The City Council makes the following findings about the effect
adult oriented establishments have on the character of the city’s
neighborhoods.
         (b)   In making these findings, the City Council accepts the
recommendations of staff who have reviewed the many reports, studies, judicial
decisions and experiences of other cities around the state and country
concerning the “secondary effects” on the areas in which the activities are
located or take place, including: The Report of the Attorney General Working
Group on Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses, dated June 6, 1989,
prepared by then Minnesota State Attorney General Hubert H. Humphrey, III; the
City of St. Cloud, Minnesota; the City of St. Paul, Minnesota; the City of Los
Angeles, California; the City of Austin, Texas; and, various other cities
throughout the country that have studied the impact of adult oriented
businesses. These studies have concluded that adult uses and sexually oriented
businesses have adverse impacts on the surrounding neighborhoods. Based on
these studies the City Council concludes the following.
            1.   Adult uses and sexually oriented business can contribute to an
increase in crime in the area where the businesses are located. This can be a
burden to the city crime prevention programs and law enforcement services.
            2.   Adult uses and sexually oriented businesses can significantly
contribute to the deterioration of residential neighborhoods and can increase
neighborhood blight. These businesses also can impair the character and quality
of the residential housing in the area where the businesses are located. This
situation could reduce the amount of desirable housing and cause residents to
flee the neighborhood.
            3.   The concentration of adult uses and sexually oriented
businesses in one area can greatly affect the area where the businesses are
concentrated. A cycle of decay can result from the influx and concentration of
adult uses and sexually oriented businesses. Others may perceive the presence
of the businesses as an indication that the area is deteriorating and results
in other businesses and residents moving or fleeing from the area. Lower
property values that can result from the concentration of the businesses, erode
the city’s tax base and contribute to blight.
            4.   Adult uses and sexually oriented businesses can have a
dehumanizing and destructive influence on young people and students attending
schools and can diminish or destroy the enjoyment and family atmosphere of
persons using parks, playgrounds and other public recreational areas. They can
interfere with or even destroy the spiritual experience of persons attending
church, synagogue or other places of worship, and can interfere with or even
destroy the opportunity for solemn and respectful contemplation at cemeteries
and similar facilities.
            5.   It is necessary to provide for the special and express
regulations of business establishments or commercial enterprises that operate
as adult body painting studios, adult book stores, adult cabarets, adult car
washes, adult companionship establishments, adult hotels or motels, adult
massage parlors or health clubs, adult motion picture arcades or theaters,
adult modeling studios, adult novelty businesses, adult saunas and similar
adult oriented services operating under various names to protect public health,
safety and welfare, and to guard against inception and transmission of disease.
            6.   Businesses such as the types described in division (A)(2)(b)5.
above, and all other similar establishments whose services include sessions
offered to adults conducted in private by members of the same or opposite sex,
and employing personnel with no specialized training, are susceptible to
operations contravening, subverting or endangering the morals of the city by
being the site of acts of prostitution, illicit sex and occasions of violent
crimes, and thus requiring close inspection, permitting and regulations.
            7.   Control and regulation of businesses of these types, in view
of the abuses often perpetrated, require intensive efforts by the Police
Department and other departments of the city. It is necessary for the city to
provide services to all of the city without concentrating the public services
in one area. The concentrated use of city services detracts from and reduces
the level of services available to the rest of the city. Thus, these types of
establishments can diminish the ability of the city to protect and promote the
general health, welfare, morals and safety of the city.
            8.   The limitation on the hours of operation and the regulation of
exterior appearance, including signage, of adult oriented business activities
is necessary to protect and secure neighboring uses, to control adverse noise
and traffic impacts associated with those activities, and otherwise address,
mitigate and, if possible, eliminate the adverse impacts and secondary effects
of sexually oriented business activities on the areas in which the activities
are located or taking place.
            9.   The City Council adopts the following land use and permitting
regulations, recognizing that it has an interest in the present and future
character of the city’s residential and commercial neighborhoods. These
regulations are to lessen the detrimental and adverse effects adult uses and
sexually oriented businesses have on adjacent land uses and to protect and
promote the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the city.

§ 153.01 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (A)   The City Council of the City of Hoyt Lakes finds that there is a need
for periodic municipal inspection of residential rental units in the city to
ensure that such units meet city and state safety, health, fire and zoning
codes and to promote the public health, safety and welfare of the community at
large and the residents of rental units within this city.
   (B)   The City Council of the City of Hoyt Lakes finds that a municipal
registration program is appropriate to effectively enforce residential rental
unit maintenance standards and correct or prevent law violations, nuisances,
and other disturbances and disorders involving residential rental units within
this city.
   (C)   The City Council of the City of Hoyt Lakes finds that an effective
means of implementing the foregoing findings is registration of all residential
rental units within the city and inspection of such units from time to time as
determined appropriate in the exercise of discretion by staff and personnel of
the city and in response to complaints involving such units.

(Ord. 236, passed 11-28-2022)
§ 153.08 FEES.

§ 153.12 CONDUCT ON REGISTERED PREMISES.
   (A)   It is the responsibility of the registration holder to require and
ensure that occupants of the registered premises conduct themselves in such a
manner as to not cause the premises to be disorderly or to be used, occupied or
maintained in violation of law or ordinance. For purposes of this section, a
rental unit is disorderly and in violation of law or ordinance when any of the
following activities occur in, on or at the registered premises:
      (1)   Conduct which constitutes a violation of the Hoyt Lakes City Code
relating to nuisances as it now exists or as hereafter amended.
      (2)   Conduct which constitutes a violation of Hoyt Lakes City Code 130,
the noise ordinances as it now exists or as hereafter amended.
      (3)   Conduct which constitutes disorderly conduct in violation of M.S. §
609.72 as it now exists or as hereafter amended.

possession of controlled substances pursuant to M.S. Chapter 152 as it now
exists or as hereafter amended.
      (5)   Conduct which constitutes a violation of any city ordinance or
state law relating to minors possessing or consuming alcohol, or relating to
providing, furnishing or serving alcohol to minors, or relating to sale of
alcoholic beverages.
      (6)   Conduct which constitutes a violation of state laws or city
ordinances relating to prostitution, indecent exposure or acts related to
prostitution as defined by state law.
      (7)   Conduct which constitutes a violation of city ordinances and state
laws relating to weapons or fire arms.
      (8)   Conduct which constitutes a violation of city ordinances or state
laws relating to assault, specifically including domestic assaults and criminal
sexual conduct.
      (9)   Conduct which constitutes a violation of ordinances or laws
relating to contributing to the need for protection, services or delinquency of
a minor as defined in M.S. § 260.315 as it now exists or as hereafter amended.
      (10)   Conduct which constitutes a violation of any other federal, state
or local ordinance or regulation and which is reasonably likely to threaten,
annoy or harass tenants or visitors to rental units, or to residents, visitors
or occupants of neighboring properties.
   (B)   The City Administrator shall administer this section of the chapter
and may delegate administration to a designee authorized in writing by the City
Administrator.
   (C)   If the Administrator determines that a violation of this section has
occurred, then the Administrator will give notice of the violation to the
registration holder and the renters of the rental unit, if known, and will
direct that the registration holder take steps to prevent further violations.
   (D)   If another violation of this section occurs within 90 days of the
incident for which notice was given as provided in division (C) above, then the
City Administrator will give notice of the violation to the registration holder
and the renters of the rental unit, if known, and will direct that the
registration holder take steps to prevent further violations. The City
Administrator will also, at that time, request that the registration holder
submit to the City Administrator, within ten days of the City Administrator’s
mailing of the notice of violation provided in this section, a report itemizing
all actions taken by the registration holder in response to all notices of
violations as to the rental unit within the preceding 90 days.
   (E)   If a third violation of this section occurs within 90 days after the
last of any two or more previous violations for which notices were given
pursuant to this section, and the registration holder has not sufficiently
taken action to prevent further violations, then the rental unit registration
for the premises may be denied, revoked, suspended or not renewed.
      (1)   Action to deny, revoke, suspend or not renew a rental unit
registration may be initiated by the City Administrator who shall give to the
registration holder a written notice of hearing before the City Administrator
to consider such denial, revocation, suspension or non-renewal.
      (2)   A notice of intent to deny, revoke, suspend or not renew
registration shall specify all violations of this section and shall state the
date, time, place and purpose of the hearing provided by this division.
      (3)   The hearing held pursuant to this division shall occur no later
than 30 days after notice.

suspend or not renew registration for all or any part of the registered
premises or may grant conditional registration upon such terms and conditions
as the Administrator finds necessary to accomplish the purpose of this chapter.
   (F)   No adverse registration action may be imposed where the violation of
this section occurred during the pendency of unlawful detainer eviction
proceedings brought under M.S. Chapter 566, as it may be amended from time to
time, or within 30 days of notice given by the registration holder to a tenant
to vacate the premises at which the violation occurred. Unlawful detainer
eviction proceedings or a notice to vacate the premises, will not, however, bar
adverse registration action unless diligently pursued by the registration
holder. Action to deny, revoke, suspend or not renew registration for violation
of this section may be postponed or dismissed by the City Administrator at any
time if it appears to the Administrator that the registration holder has taken
appropriate remedial action.
   (G)   The standard of proof to be used in determinations by the City
Administrator as to conduct constituting violations under this section is a
fair preponderance of evidence in support of such a determination. It is not
necessary that criminal charges be brought to support a determination of
violation of this section or a determination that conduct constituting a
violation of this section has occurred. It is necessary, in determining a
violation of this section, that law enforcement officers be called to the
rental unit in response to a complaint and that a police report and
investigation of the same be prepared.
   (H)   For the purpose of this chapter, a violation under this section
includes violations by the rental unit renters or occupants, or by their
visitors or guests, in or at the rental unit of the renters or tenants, or in,
at or upon its curtilage, including anywhere on the property grounds and
premises of an apartment building, home or mobile home park at which the rental
unit is situated.
   (I)   Failure of a registration holder to respond to notices provided in
this section is not, by itself alone, a violation of this chapter.
(Ord. 236, passed 11-28-2022)
§ 153.13 FAILURE TO GRANT REGISTRATION, REVOCATION, SUSPENSION OR FAILURE TO
RENEW REGISTRATION.
   (A)   The city reserves the right to not register a rental unit unless it
complies with the requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   Any registration issued under this chapter is subject to the right,
which is hereby expressly reserved by the city, to deny, suspend, revoke or not
renew the same should the registration holder or their agents, employees,
representatives or lessees directly or indirectly operate or maintain the
rental dwellings contrary to the provisions of this chapter or any other
ordinance of the city or any special permit issued by the city, or the laws of
the State of Minnesota. Provided, however, registration shall not be denied,
suspended, revoked or not renewed if the registration holder complies with a
compliance order or orders in a reasonably timely manner as determined by the
City Administrator.
   (C)   The City Administrator shall notify the applicant that registration
has been denied, or the registration holder that registration is being
suspended, revoked or not renewed. The suspension, revocation or non-renewal
shall occur 35 days after the date of the notification order, or at such later
date as set out in the notification.
   (D)   A determination by the City Administrator to deny, suspend, revoke or
not renew registration of a rental unit may be appealed to the City Council by
filing with the City Administrator a written notice of appeal within 15 days of
the date on which the City Administrator mails such determination to the
applicant or registration holder. In that event, the appeal will be heard by
the City Council at its next meeting occurring at least 15 days after the
filing of the notice of appeal.
   (E)   At any appeal of a determination by the City Administrator under this
chapter, the registration holder or applicant, local property manager for the
registration holder or applicant, or an attorney representing them, may appear
and make a presentation to the City Council. The City Administrator shall
present to the City Council the basis for the determination being appealed.
After the hearing, the Council may uphold, reverse or modify the decision of
the City Administrator based upon the provisions of this chapter and upon the
protection of the public health, sanitation, safety or general welfare of the
community at large or the residents of rental units within the city. The City
Council shall issue written findings and determination within 31 days of the
hearing, unless the Council extends that time for good cause.
   (F)   A decision of the City Council made as provided in this section may be
appealed by Writ of Certiorari to the Court of Appeals of the State of
Minnesota pursuant to its Rules of Civil Appellate Procedure.
(Ord. 236, passed 11-28-2022)
§ 153.14 SUMMARY ACTION.
   (A)   As a condition of receiving rental unit registration, each
registration holder is presumed to agree and consent that when the conduct of
any registration holder or registration holder’s agent, representative,
employee or lessee, or the condition of their rental unit, or the property in
or on which it is located, is detrimental to the public health, sanitation,
safety and general welfare of the community at large, or residents of the
rental units so as to constitute a nuisance, fire hazard, or other unsafe or
dangerous condition and thus give rise to an emergency, the City Administrator
shall have the authority to summarily condemn or close individual rental units
or such areas of the rental dwelling as the Administrator deems necessary.
Notice of summary condemnation shall be posted at the units or areas affected
and shall describe the units or areas affected. No person shall remove the
posted notice, other than the Fire Chief, East Range Police Chief, City
Administrator, or their designated representative. Any person aggrieved by the
decision or the action of the City Administrator or Fire Marshall set out in
this division, may appeal the decision following the procedures set out in this
chapter. The hearing shall be conducted in the same manner as provided in this
chapter, however, the date of the hearing may be expedited with the consent of
the registration holder.
   (B)   The decision of the City Administrator set forth in this division is
not voided by the filing of such appeal. Only after the hearing by the City
Council has been held will the decision or action of the City Administrator be
affected.

or law.
(Ord. 236, passed 11-28-2022)
§ 153.16 VIOLATIONS, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.

action under any of its fire, housing, zoning, health safety or other codes,
ordinances and state laws for violations thereof, or to seek injunctive relief
and criminal prosecution for violations of any ordinance, code or law. Nothing
contained in this chapter prevents the city from seeking injunctive relief
against a property owner or designated property manager who fails to comply
with the terms and conditions of this chapter or to obtain an order closing
such rental units until violations of this particular chapter have been
remedied by the property owner or designated property manager.
   (B)   Violation of this chapter is a misdemeanor. Each separate day on which
a continuing violation occurs is a separate violation.
