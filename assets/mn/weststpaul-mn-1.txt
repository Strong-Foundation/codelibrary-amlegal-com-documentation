INITIATIVE
SECTION 5.04. INITIATION OF MEASURES.
   Any five registered electors may form themselves into a committee for the
initiation of any ordinance except as provided in Section 5.01. Before
circulating any petition, they shall file a verified copy of their proposed
ordinance with the City Clerk together with their names and addresses as
members of such committee. They shall also attach a verified copy of the
proposed ordinance to each of the signature papers herein described, together
with their names and addresses as sponsors therefore.
SECTION 5.05. FORM OF PETITION AND OF SIGNATURE PAPERS.
   The petition for the adoption of any ordinance shall consist of the
ordinance, together with all the signature papers and affidavits thereto
attached. Such petition shall not be complete unless signed by a number of
registered electors equal to at least ten percent (10%) of the total number of
votes cast at the last preceding regular municipal election. All signatures
need not be on one signature paper, but the circulator of every such paper
shall make an affidavit that each signature appended to the paper is genuine
signature of the person whose name it purports to be. Each signature paper
shall be in substantially the following form:
   INITIATIVE PETITION
   Proposing an Ordinance to ___________ (stating the purpose of the
Ordinance), a copy of which
Ordinance is hereto attached. This Ordinance is sponsored by the following
committee of
registered electors:
      Name                         Address
      1. ________________________      __________________________
      2. ________________________      __________________________
      3. ________________________      __________________________
      4. ________________________      __________________________
      5. ________________________      __________________________
   The undersigned registered elector, understanding the terms and the nature
of Ordinance hereto
attached, petition the Council for its adoption or in lieu thereof, for its
submission to the electors
for their approval.
      Name                         Address
      __________________________       _________________________
adding as many more lines as are necessary so that all petitioners when totaled
will equal not less than ten percent (10%) of the total number of votes cast at
the last preceding regular municipal election.
   At the end of the list of signatures shall be appended the affidavit of the
circulator mentioned
above.
SECTION 5.06. FILING OF PETITIONS AND ACTION THEREON.
   All the signature papers shall be filed in the office of the City Clerk as
one instrument. Within five (5) days after the filing of the petition, the City
Clerk shall ascertain by examination the numbers of electors whose signatures
are appended thereto and whether this number is at least ten percent (10%) of
the total number of electors who cast their votes at the last preceding regular
municipal election. If he or she finds the petition insufficient or irregular,
the Clerk shall at once notify one or more of the committees or sponsors of
that fact, certifying the reason for the finding. The committee shall then be
given thirty (30) days in which to file additional signature papers and to
correct the petition in all other particulars. If at the end of that period,
the petition is found to be still insufficient or irregular, the Clerk shall
file it in the office and shall notify each member of the committee of that
fact. The final finding of the insufficiency or irregularity of a petition
shall not prejudice the filing of a new petition for the same purpose, nor
shall it prevent the council from referring the ordinance to the electors at
the next regular or any special election at its option.
SECTION 5.07. ACTION OF COUNCIL ON PETITION.
   When the petition is found to be sufficient, the City Clerk shall so certify
to the Council at its next meeting, stating the number of petitions and the
percentage of the total number of electors which they constitute, and the
Council shall at once read the ordinance and refer it to an appropriate
committee, which may be a committee of the whole. The committee or Council
shall thereupon provide for public hearings upon the ordinance, after the
holding of which the ordinance shall be finally acted upon by the Council not
later than sixty-five (65) days after the date upon which it was submitted to
the Council by the City Clerk. If the Council fails to pass the proposed
ordinance, or passes it in a form different from that set forth in the petition
and unsatisfactory to the petitioners, the proposed ordinance shall be
submitted by the Council to the vote of the electors at the next regular
municipal election; but if the number of signers of the petition is equal to at
least fifteen percent (15%) of the total number of electors voting at the last
regular municipal election, the Council shall call a special election upon the
measure. Such special election shall be held not less than thirty (30) days nor
more than forty-five (45) days from the date of final action on the ordinance
by the Council or after the expiration of sixty-five (65) days from the date of
submission to the Council when there has been no final action; but if a regular
election is to occur within three (3) months, the Council may submit the
ordinance at that election. If the Council passes the proposed ordinance with
amendments and at least 4/5 of the committee of petitioners do not express
their dissatisfaction with such amended form by a statement filed with the City
Clerk within ten (10) days of the passage thereof by the Council, the ordinance
need not be submitted to the electors.
SECTION 5.08. INITIATIVE BALLOTS.
   The ballots used when voting upon any such proposed ordinance shall state
the substance of the ordinance and shall give the electors the opportunity to
vote either “yes” or “no” on the question of adoption. If a majority of the
electors voting on any such ordinance vote in favor of it, it shall thereupon
become an ordinance of the City. Any number of proposed ordinances may be voted
upon at the same election but the elector shall be allowed to vote for or
against each separately. In case of inconsistency between two initiated
ordinances approved at one election, the one approved by the higher percentage
of electors voting on the question shall prevail to the extent of the
inconsistency.
SECTION 5.09. INITIATION OF CHARTER AMENDMENTS.
   Nothing in this Charter contained shall be construed as in any way affecting
the right of the electors under the constitution and statutes of Minnesota to
proposed amendments to this Charter.
REFERENDUM
SECTION 5.10. THE REFERENDUM.
   If within thirty (30) days of the effective date of any ordinance or
resolution a petition signed by registered electors of the City equal in number
to ten percent (10%) of the total vote at the last regular municipal election
is filed with the City Clerk requesting that any such ordinance or resolution
be repealed or rescinded or be submitted to a vote of the electors, the
ordinance or resolution shall thereby be prevented from going into operation.
All the signature papers shall be filed in the office of the City Clerk as one
instrument. Within five (5) days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal
holidays, after the filing of the petition, the City Clerk shall ascertain by
examination the numbers of registered electors whose signatures are appended
thereto and whether this number is at least ten percent (10%) of the total
number of electors who cast their votes at the last preceding regular municipal
election. The Council shall thereupon reconsider the ordinance or resolution at
its next regular meeting, and either repeal or rescind it or reaffirm the
ordinance or resolution as passed. In the latter case, the Council shall
immediately order a special election to be held thereon, or submit the
ordinance or resolution at the next regular municipal election, pending which
the ordinance or resolution shall remain suspended. If a majority of the
electors voting thereon is opposed to the ordinance or resolution, it shall not
become effective; but if a majority of the electors voting thereon favors the
ordinance or resolution, it shall go into effect immediately.
(Ord. 97-16, passed 10-13-1997; Ord. 99-21, passed 11-8-1999)
SECTION 5.11. REFERENDUM PETITIONS.
   The requirements laid down in Sections 5.04 and 5.05 above as to the
formation of committees for the initiation of ordinances and as to the form of
petitions and signature papers shall apply to the referendum as far as
possible, but with such verbal changes as may be necessary. A referendum
petition shall read substantially as follows:
   REFERENDUM PETITION
   Proposing the repeal of an ordinance or rescission of a resolution to
________________ (stating the purpose of the ordinance or resolution) a copy of
which ordinance or resolution is hereto attached. The proposed repeal or

the Council for its
submission to a vote of the electors for their approval or disapproval.

petitions when totaled will equal not less than ten percent (10%) of the total
number of votes cast at the last preceding regular municipal election.

SECTION 5.13. RECALL ELECTIONS.
   The holder of any elective office, in the City of West St. Paul, may be
removed at any time for malfeasance or nonfeasance in office by the electors
qualified to vote for a successor of such incumbent, in the following manner:
   Subdivision 1.   A petition signed by such electors equal in number to at
least fifteen percent (15%) of the currently registered voters; in the case of
Mayor, those registered voters in all Wards; in the case of Councilperson,
those registered voters in his/her own Ward, demanding a special election to
determine whether the person named therein shall be recalled, and to elect a
successor of the person sought to be removed, shall be filed with the Clerk.
The petition shall contain a general Statement, in not more than two hundred
words, of the specific grounds on which the removal is sought. The signatures
to the petition need not all be appended to one paper, but each signer shall
state his or her place of residence and street number. One of the signers of
each such paper shall make an oath that the signatures therein made are true,
as he or she believes and that each signature to the paper appended is the
genuine signature of the person whose signature it purports to be.
   Subdivision 2.   The signatures gathered for such petition, must be obtained
within a period of thirty (30) days from the date of the first signature.
   Subdivision 3.   Within ten (10) days from the date of filing such petition,
the Clerk shall ascertain from the voters register whether or not said petition
is signed by the requisite number of qualified electors. The Clerk shall attach
to the petition the certificate showing the result of the examination. If, by
the Clerk's certificate, the petition is shown to be insufficient, it may be
amended within ten (10) days from the date of said Clerk's certificate. The
Clerk shall, within ten days after such amendment make a similar examination of
the amended petition, and if the certificate shall show the same to be
insufficient, it shall be returned to the person filing the same, without
prejudice, however, to filing of a new petition to the same effect. If the
petition is deemed sufficient, the Clerk shall submit the same to the Council
without delay, and thereupon the Council shall order the same filed, and a copy
thereof delivered to the person sought to be recalled.
   Subdivision 4.   Within ten (10) days after the filing of said petition, the
Council shall fix a date for holding said special election not less than thirty
(30)) days, nor more than forty (40) days, from the date of said filing. In the
published call for the election, there shall be printed in not more than two
hundred (200) words, the reasons for demanding the recall of the officer, as
set forth in the recall petition, and in said call, in not more than two
hundred (200) words, the officer may justify his or her course in office.
   Subdivision 5.   Any qualified elector of the electoral district may file in
the same manner as for any City election for the office which may be filled at
any recall election.
   Subdivision 6.   Except as herein otherwise provided, such special election
shall be conducted, returned, and the result thereof declared, in all respects
as are general municipal elections. There shall be placed on the recall ballot
or voting machine, as to every officer whose recall is to be voted on 2022
thereat, the following question: "Shall (name of the person against whom the
recall petition is filed) be recalled from the office of (title of office)?"
Following which question shall be the words "Yes" and "No". On such ballots or
voting machines following each such question, there shall also be printed the
names of those persons who have been nominated as candidates to succeed the
person recalled in the case he or she shall be removed from office by said
recall election. The name of the person against whom the petition is filed
shall not appear on the ballot as a candidate for the office. If a majority of
those voting on the question of the recall of any incumbent from office, shall
vote "No", said incumbent shall continue in office.
   If a majority shall vote "Yes", said incumbent shall be deemed removed
therefrom upon the qualification of his or her successor. If the vote at any
such recall election shall recall the officer then the candidate who has
received the highest number of votes for the office shall thereby be elected
and shall hold office for the unexpired term.
   Subdivision 7.   No recall petition shall be filed against any officer until
he or she has actually held his or her office for at least six (6) months. No
person who has been recalled from office, or who has resigned from such office
while recall proceedings were pending against him or her, shall be elected or
appointed to any office in the City within one year after such recall or
resignation. Should any person resign from office while recall proceedings are
pending against him or her, the election provided for herein shall be called
and proceeded with but shall be limited to the purpose of electing his or her
successor in office.
   Subdivision 8.   If a majority of the Council shall fail or refuse to act in
such recall proceedings, compliance with the provisions of this section may be
enforced by proceedings in the district court of Dakota County at the suit of
any citizen of this City.

construction of public facilities that are necessary for the essential
functions of the City, no obligations shall be issued to pay current expenses

of certificates issued against any fund for any year with interest thereon
until maturity shall not exceed 50% of the total current taxes for the fund

authority of the city to make expenditures otherwise authorized by law. If
adopted, the council shall review the Policy periodically and update it as
needed. In establishing, reviewing, and approving the Policy, the council shall
consider whether the expenditures to be authorized by the Policy: 1) benefits
the community as a whole; 2) are directly related to governmental functions;
and 3) primarily benefits the public interest, not a private interest. In
establishing, reviewing, and approving the Policy, the council shall consider
the opinion of the city attorney and statewide sources of authority, which may
include judicial determinations, Minnesota Attorney General opinions, and
findings of the Office of the State Auditor. Expenditures related to any of the
following activities shall be deemed authorized if the Policy expressly
provides authorization: international, cultural, and economic development
programs; community events, festivals, and celebrations; miscellaneous employee
benefits; employee recognition; and funding for conference attendance. The
council may also provide specific authorization regarding any other
expenditure.

   All general laws and statutes of the State, as the same now exist,
applicable to all cities operating under home rule charter, or applicable to

apply to the City of West Saint Paul, and shall be construed as supplementary

      (1)   General rule. For the purpose of safeguarding the health and safety

any authorized officer to conduct inspections to determine the condition of the
buildings and premises located within the city. For the purpose of making the
inspection, the authorized officer is authorized to enter, examine and survey
the building or premises at all reasonable times.
         (a)   Notice. Prior to making the inspection, the authorized officer
will inform the occupants of the building or premises to be inspected of the
date and time of the inspection by personal service or regular mail postmarked
not less than 72 hours prior to the time the inspection is made.
         (b)   Access. After the written notice has been given, the owner,
occupant or operator of the building must give the authorized officer free
access to the building and its premises, for the purpose of the inspection,

dwelling unit or premises for its conformity to the requirements of this code,
and any evidence or information from the inspection or search may be used in
any court proceedings.
   (F)   Interference with official duties. It is unlawful for any person to
prevent, delay or interfere with representatives of the city while they are
engaged in the performance of his or her duties.
§ 10.98 ADMINISTRATIVE CITATIONS.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   The City Council seeks to offer an alternative method of
enforcement for city code violations rather than relying on the criminal court
system. The formal criminal prosecution process does not provide an environment
to adequately address the unique and sensitive issues that are involved in city
code violations, including, but not limited to, neighborhood concerns,
livability issues, economic impact, physical limitations of the offenders and
the stigma and unintended consequences of being charged with or convicted of a
misdemeanor offense. In addition, the court system is a slow, overburdened and
methodical process that is not conducive to dealing with the violations in a
prompt and timely manner. Finally, the penalties afforded the criminal court
system are restricted to fines or physical confinement, which are not always
effective solutions to address city code violations.
      (2)   In order to provide more flexibility in addressing city code
violations on an individualized basis that will be more efficient and
effective, the City Council finds that an alternative enforcement process is
necessary. Therefore, to protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens
of the city, it is the City Council’s intent to create a process for the use
and imposition of administrative civil penalties that will provide the public
and the city with a more effective alternative method for addressing city code
violations.
(2001 Code, § 120.01)
   (B)   Alternative methods of enforcement. A violation of the city code is a
misdemeanor pursuant to §
10.99; however, this section seeks to gain compliance with the city code as an
alternative to the commencement of any formal civil or criminal court action.
The administrative civil penalties proceedings are in addition to any other
legal or equitable remedy available to the city for city code violations. The
city may, in its discretion, choose not to issue an administrative citation and
may initiate criminal charges instead.
(2001 Code, § 120.03)
   (C)   Authority to issue compliance letters and administrative citations.
The city employees and agents identified in §
10.17(B) are authorized to issue compliance letters and administrative
citations for violations of the city code.

      (1)   Contents of compliance letter. If a city employee or agent
determines that a city code violation has occurred, when appropriate, a
compliance letter shall be issued. The compliance letter shall contain the
following information:
         (a)   A description or address of the property on which the city code
violation has occurred;
         (b)   The nature of the violation, including a reference to the
appropriate city code section;
         (c)   A compliance deadline, providing a reasonable time for
compliance based on the nature of the violation; and
         (d)   A statement that failure to correct the violation may result in
the imposition of an administrative citation, including a civil penalty and
stating the amount of the penalty as provided in the fee schedule.
      (2)   Service of compliance letter. The compliance letter may be served
on the offender by certified mail, regular mail sent to the last known legal
address, by personal service or by posting a copy in a conspicuous place in or
about the building or property affected by the letter.
      (3)   Reasonable extensions. Following service of the compliance letter,
the city shall attempt to work to resolve the violation, including, but not
limited to, offering reasonable extensions for compliance.
      (4)   Exceptions to issuance of a compliance letter. For violations of
any of the following sections, the city shall not be required to issue a
compliance letter and may proceed directly to issuance of an administrative
citation as provided in division (E) below.
         (a)   Repeat offender. If the same offender commits a subsequent
violation within 12 months after a compliance letter has been issued for a same
or similar offense.

not limited to, not having a license.

         (f)   Fire prevention violations. For violations of
Chapter 91, Fire Prevention Code.

immediate action to protect the public health, safety and welfare.
         (h)   Disorderly conduct or other similar behavior that tends to
disrupt, injure or annoy a reasonable person for which a compliance letter
would be moot, as the conduct or behavior has terminated.
   (E)   Administrative citation.
      (1)   Generally.
         (a)   Upon the failure to correct the violation specified in the
compliance letter within the time frame established in the compliance letter or
any extension thereof granted by the city, or for any offense for which a
compliance letter is not required, an administrative citation may be issued.
         (b)   The administrative citation shall be served by certified mail,
regular mail or by personal service and shall contain the following
information:
            1.   A description or address of the property on which the city
code violation has occurred;
            2.   Reference to the city code that is alleged to be violated;
            3.   The amount of the administrative civil penalty for the
specific city code violation, which shall be due and payable to the city within

penalty may result in it being assessed against the property as provided in

pays the administrative civil penalty and corrects the city code violation, no
further action will be taken for that same violation.
      (3)   Payment of penalty without correction of violation. If the offender
pays the administrative civil penalty but fails to correct the city code
violation, the city may issue a subsequent administrative citation, initiate
criminal proceedings or initiate any other proceedings or remedies available in
order to enforce correction of the city code violation.
      (4)   No payment of penalty and no correction of violation. If the
offender fails to pay the administrative civil penalty and fails to correct the
city code violation, the city may do any of the following, or any combination
thereof:
         (a)   Assess the administrative civil penalty against the property
pursuant to Minn. Stat. Chapter 429, as it may be amended from time to time;
         (b)   Issue a subsequent administrative citation, thereby commencing a
new administrative penalties process;
         (c)   Initiate criminal proceedings; and/or
         (d)   Initiate other enforcement action authorized by law.

SPECIAL EVENTS PERMIT
§ 32.35 GENERAL BACKGROUND.
   (A)   Purpose and intent.
      (1)   This subchapter governs the time, place and manner of holding
certain special events on city streets, on city property and on private
property when an event’s impact upon the health, fire, law enforcement, public
safety, transportation or other services exceeds those regularly provided to
that property.
      (2)   This subchapter is intended to promote the health, safety and
welfare of all residents and visitors of the city by ensuring that special
events do not create disturbances, become nuisances, a menace or threaten life,
health and property, disrupt traffic or threaten or damage private or public
property.
      (3)   It is not the intent of the City Council by enacting this
subchapter to regulate in any manner the content of speech or infringe upon the
right to assemble, except for regulating the time, place and manner of speech
and assembly and this subchapter should not be interpreted or construed
otherwise.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this subchapter, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      APPLICANT. Any person or organization who seeks a special event permit to
conduct or sponsor an event within the city.

district, commonly referred to as a school district, under Minn. Stat. §
123A.05, as it may be amended from time to time; or by an organization

Subd. 9, as it may be amended from time to time, where an elementary, middle,
secondary school, secondary vocational center or other school providing
educational services for any grade kindergartner through grade 12 is located;

school district or districts for children and their caregivers, relatives or
parents for the ages from birth to kindergarten, excluding properties
exclusively used for the remote or online delivery of educational programming.

rally, party, filming of a movie, video or television show, motorcade, run,

safety reasons, which were deemed necessary by the city, the applicant will be

(2001 Code, § 1315.01)
§ 33.03 PREVAILING WAGE RATES FOR FINANCIALLY PUBLICLY ASSISTED PROJECTS.
   (A)   Purpose. It is in the public interest that developments and buildings
constructed with financial assistance from the city be constructed and
maintained by the best means and highest quality of labor reasonably available
and that persons working on the buildings and developments be compensated
according to the real value of the services they perform and that wages of
laborers, workers and mechanics on developments and buildings financially
assisted by city funds be comparable to wages paid for similar work in the
community as a whole.
   (B)   Definition. FINANCIALLY-ASSISTED PROJECT means any private development
or redevelopment involving either the construction of new buildings or the
remodeling, reconstructing or expanding of existing buildings under the
following conditions: the city or EDA provides direct financial assistance to
the development by any of the following means:
      (1)   Grants;
      (2)   Tax increment financing;
      (3)   Revenue bonds or general obligation bonds;
      (4)   Loans; or

   (C)   Contractor requirement for payment of prevailing wage rate. For any
financially-assisted project, the developer shall require the following:
      (1)   The contractor and any subcontractor, agent and other person doing
or contracting to do all or a part of the work on the project must pay at least
the prevailing wage rate to all laborers and mechanics employed directly on the
project work site; and
      (2)   Upon request of the city, the contractor and any subcontractor,
agent and other person doing or contracting to do all or a part of the work of
the project shall within five working days supply the city with a copy of
payrolls showing wages paid, and a wage compliance statement with respect to
wages paid each of its mechanics and laborers employed directly on the project
work site. In the event such statements are not provided or in the event the
statements disclose that the required prevailing wage is not being paid, then
the city shall have the right to either withhold payments to the developer for
those periods of noncompliance or consider the developer in default and proceed
with its legal remedies. Any withheld payments shall be equal to the difference
between the wages paid and the prevailing wage rate for the period of
noncompliance. During the course of and upon completion of the contract work,
the city shall have the right to require an audit of the contractor’s books to
determine compliance or noncompliance. Each contractor and subcontractor shall
retain copes of the weekly payrolls for a period not less than one year after
completing of the work.
   (D)   Exceptions.
      (1)   The requirements set forth in division (C) above do not apply to
wage rates of laborers or mechanics who process or manufacture materials or
products or to the delivery of materials or products by or for commercial
establishments that have a fixed place of business from which they regularly

requirements set forth in division (C) above do apply to laborers or mechanics
who deliver material by depositing the material substantially in place,
directly or through spreaders, from the transporting vehicle.
      (2)   The requirements set forth in division (C) above do not apply to
financially-assisted projects that involve the housing replacement program or
that involve projects in which the financial assistance is less than $50,000.
(2001 Code, § 330)
§ 33.04 PROHIBITION OF CONVERSION THERAPY FOR MINORS BY LICENSED PROVIDERS.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to protect the physical and
psychological well-being of minors, including LGBTQ minors, from the harm
caused by conversion therapy.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      CONVERSION THERAPY. Any practice or treatment by a provider that seeks to
change an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity, including efforts
to change behaviors or gender expressions or to eliminate or reduce sexual or
romantic attractions or feelings toward individuals of the same gender.
CONVERSION THERAPY does not include counseling that provides support and
assistance to a person undergoing gender transition, or counseling that
provides acceptance, support, and understanding of a person or facilitates a
person's coping, social support, identity exploration, development, including
sexual orientation and gender identity, and neutral interventions to prevent or
address unlawful conduct or unsafe sexual practices, if such counseling is not
conducted with the goal of changing the person's sexual orientation or gender
identity.
      GENDER EXPRESSION. A person's expression of gender identity through
appearance and behavior, including how an individual believes that they are
perceived by others.
      GENDER IDENTITY. A person's sense of self as a woman, man, another
gender, or genderless.
      MINOR. Any person under 18 years of age.
      PROVIDER. An individual who is licensed, certified, or registered under
the laws of the State of Minnesota, including mental health practitioners and

(Ord. 20-020, passed 8-17-2020)
§ 33.05 REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION.
   (A)   Purpose. The city has a legitimate interest in imposing regulations to
protect the public health, safety, and general welfare. However, these
regulations may not be applied in a manner that denies reasonable accommodation
as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act and the federal Fair Housing
Amendments Act of 1988. It is the policy of the city to provide reasonable
accommodation for persons with disabilities seeking fair and equal access to
public services and to housing, in compliance with federal law. Reasonable
accommodation means granting a reasonable modification or waiver of city
regulations or policies to an individual with a disability, or, with relation
to housing, to a developer of housing for an individual with a disability, when
necessary to eliminate barriers to opportunities as required by the Americans
with Disabilities Act or the federal Fair Housing Amendments Act. The process
for making and acting upon requests for reasonable accommodation is set forth
in this section.
   (B)   Initiation of reasonable accommodation request. A person may request
the modification or waiver of city regulations or policies by submitting a
request in writing to the City Manager. For the purposes of this section,
"person" includes an individual with a disability, his or her representative,
or, with respect to housing, a developer or provider of housing for an
individual with a disability. The application must include a detailed
explanation of why the modification or waiver is reasonably necessary to make
the specific request available to the person, including verification of the
disability, as well as other information as may reasonably be required by the
City Manager. If the request relates to a matter requiring specific review or
approval by the city, then the applicant must file the request for reasonable
accommodation concurrently with the application seeking the review or approval.
When the data requested by the application seeking review or approval qualifies
as protected data under state or federal data laws, the City Manager may waive
the concurrent filing of the otherwise required application.
   (C)   Processing of reasonable accommodation request.
      (1)   Authority.  The City Manager, in consultation with the City
Attorney, has the authority to consider and act on requests for reasonable
accommodation, except that requests associated with another city review or
approval will be considered and decided concurrently with that application. A
decision must be in writing and may include the imposition of reasonable
conditions. In making a decision, the following factors must be considered:
         (a)   Whether there is a qualifying disability;
         (b)   Whether the request is needed to allow a disabled person equal
opportunity to use and enjoy public services generally available from the city
or to use and enjoy a dwelling or live in a particular neighborhood, in the
same manner as a person without disabilities;
         (c)   Whether the request is reasonable, considering such things as
undue financial impact or unreasonable administrative burden on city resources,
the potential impact on surrounding uses, the extent to which the accommodation
meets the stated need, and other alternatives that may meet that need;
         (d)   Whether the request would constitute a fundamental alteration of
the city's regulations, policies, or procedures; and
         (e)   Any other factor that may have a bearing on the request.
      (2)   Decision. The City Manager's written decision, including notice of
the right to appeal, must be mailed to the applicant and, if it impacts land
use or zoning, to the owners of all properties that are immediately adjacent to
the property that is the subject of the request. An aggrieved party may appeal
the City Manager's decision to the City Council by submitting a written request
to the City Clerk within ten days after the decision was mailed to that party.
The City Manager's decision is the final decision of the city, unless properly
appealed. If appealed, the decision of the City Council shall be final. Only
the aggrieved applicant and immediately adjacent property owners who received
notice of the written determination have a right to appeal.
   (D)   Applicability. 
      (1)   An approved request is granted only to an individual and, if
related to land use, zoning, or real property, does not run with the land. If
the request relates to land use, zoning or use of real property, the City
Manager has the discretion to determine the accommodation runs with the land
when:
         (a)   The accommodation is physically integrated into the residential
structure and cannot easily be removed or altered; or
         (b)   The accommodation is to be used by another individual with a
disability.
      (2)   In these instances, the City Manager may require that the applicant
record a covenant agreeing to comply with conditions established in the
determination before the issuance of any permits related to an approved
reasonable accommodation.
   (E)   Fees. There shall be no fee imposed in connection with a request for
reasonable accommodation made pursuant to the provisions of this section.

(2001 Code, § 830.01)
§ 34.06 SIDEWALK AND TRAIL SPECIAL IMPROVEMENT DISTRICT.
   (A)   Findings. The City Council finds that all areas within the city should
have safe pedestrian walkways and trails to and from schools and school bus
stops, public transportation facilities and other services to the neighborhood
and community. Minn. Stat. § 435.44, as it may be amended from time to time,
authorizes a city to establish sidewalk and trail improvement districts to
defray all or part of the total costs of sidewalk and trail construction and
repair and apportion the cost to all parcels located within the district on a
direct or indirect basis. The Council finds that the costs apportioned for such
sidewalk and trail improvements are reasonably related to the improvements or
repairs within the sidewalk and trail improvement district hereby established.
   (B)   District established. Based on Minn. Stat. § 435.44, as it may be
amended from time to time, and the city’s police powers, the City Council
hereby establishes the Sidewalk and Trail Improvement District (the
“District”), which includes all of the streets, sidewalks, trails, land and
parcels within the boundaries of the city.
   (C)   Assessment. The City Council shall establish an assessment policy for
all sidewalk or trail improvements or repairs within the District, as long as
such assessments are applied on a uniform basis as to each classification of
real estate. Where sidewalk or trail widths are wider than the standard width
of a typical sidewalk or trail, the additional costs may be assessed as a
direct benefit to the abutting property. An indirect benefit assessment may
involve all parcels or tracts of land located in the District without regard to
the location of the sidewalks or trails, as it is deemed that all parcels or
tracts of land within the District are benefitted equally.
   (D)   Assessment period. The city may assess the costs on all sidewalk and
trail improvements up to a maximum of five years on equal annual installments,
plus interest on the unpaid balance.

   (B)   Tax imposed. Every electric company must pay the city 6% of its
monthly gross revenues derived from the sale of electricity within the city.

   (C)   Accounting. For the purpose of ascertaining the gross revenues, each

must annually furnish the Finance Director with an accounting of the sales. A
qualified person from the electric company must verify the accounting. The
electric company agrees to make its records available for inspection by the
city at reasonable times provided that the city and its designated

of West St. Paul approved the imposition of a .05% sales and use tax to pay for
the cost of collecting and administering the taxes and to pay for certain costs
related to the funding of certain designated projects, as defined in division
(C) below.
   (B)   The legislature has by Laws of Minnesota for 2019, First Special
Session, Chapter 6, Article 6, Section 31, authorized the city to impose a
sales and use tax within the city to provide revenues to pay for the cost of
collecting and administering the taxes and to pay for certain costs related to
the funding of the designated projects, as defined in division (C) below. The
city approved the Act in accordance with applicable law.
   (C)   Definitions. The words, terms and phrases used in this section shall
have the meaning ascribed to them in Minn. Stat. § 297A.61, except where the
context clearly indicates otherwise. In addition, the following definitions
shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning.
      ACT. Laws of Minnesota for 2019, First Special Session, Chapter 6,
Article 6, Section 31.
      CITY. The City of West St. Paul.
      COMMISSIONER. The Commissioner of Revenue for the State of Minnesota,
acting under the authority of an agreement entered into between the city and
the State of Minnesota pursuant to the Act, or such other person designated to

is hereby imposed an additional excise tax in the amount of .05% on the gross
receipts from sales at retail and the storage, use, distribution or consumption
of goods or services which are taxable, pursuant to Minn. Stat. Chapter 297A
and occur within the city. The imposition, administration, collection and
enforcement of this tax shall be governed by the provisions of Minn. Stat. §
297A.99.
   (E)   Separate statement; collection from purchaser; advertising no tax;
minimum uniform tax collection methods. The sales and use tax shall be stated
and charged separately from the sales price or charge for service insofar as

a result of any transaction, any amount of tax less than one-half of one cent
may be disregarded and amounts of tax less than one-half of one cent may be
disregarded and amounts of tax one-half cent or more maybe considered an

tax shall be collected.
   (F)   Exemption certificates. A fully completed exemption certificate taken
from a purchaser to the effect that the property purchased is for resale or

this chapter will conclusively relieve the retailer from collecting and
remitting the tax to the extent the seller is also relieved of liability for
the sales and use tax under Minn. Stat. § 297A.665. A person who has obtained
from the Commissioner an exemption certificate pursuant to the Minn. Stat. §
297A.72 may use such exemption certificate for the purposes of the sales tax
imposed by the city.
   (G) Presumption of purpose of sale. For the purpose of the proper

maintaining a place of business in the city, or any other retailer otherwise
doing business within the city, upon making sales of any items described in

regard any salesman, representative, trucker, peddler or canvasser as the agent

whom the tangible property is being sold is obtained and may regard the dealer,
distributor, supervisor, employer or other person as a retailer for the
purposes of this section.

shall be subject to the same interests, penalties, and other rules as are
applicable to the state general sales tax imposed by Minn. Stat. Chapters 270C,
289A and 297A. The sales and use tax imposed by the city pursuant to this
section may be collected by the state on behalf of the city as provided by an
appropriate agreement with the Minnesota Commissioner of Revenue. The sales and
use tax imposed by the city pursuant to this section shall expire at the
earlier of:
         (a)   20 years after the tax is first imposed; or
         (b)   When the City Council determines that $28,000,000, plus an
amount sufficient to pay the costs related to issuing the bonds, including
interest on the bonds, has been received from the tax to pay for the cost of
the projects.
      (2)   Any funds remaining after payment of all such costs and retirement
or redemption of the bonds shall be placed in the general fund of the city. The
sales and use tax imposed by the city pursuant to this section may expire at
any earlier time if the City Council so determines by ordinance.
   (K)   Tax clearance; issuance of licenses. The city may not issue or renew a
license for the conduct of trade or business in the city if the Commissioner
notifies the city that the applicant for such license owes delinquent sales and
use taxes as provided in this section, or penalties or interest due on such
taxes. For the purposes of this section, the following terms have the following
meanings:
      (1)   Sales and use taxes include sales and use tax as provided in this
section including all penalties and interest due on said sales and use taxes.
      (2)   Delinquent taxes do not include a tax liability if:
         (a)   An administrative or court action which contests the amount or
validity of the liability has been filed or served;

also be sent to the applicant taxpayer. In the case of renewal of a license, if
the applicant requests a hearing in writing, within 30 days of the receipt of
the notice of delinquent taxes, then a contested case hearing shall be held by
the Commissioner under the same procedures as provided in Minn. Stat. § 270C.72
for the state sales and use tax imposed under Minn. Stat. Chapter 297A,
provided that if a hearing must be held on the state sales and use tax, the
hearings may be combined.
   (L)   Effective date; transitional sales. Except as otherwise provided
herein, the sales and use tax authorized by this section shall apply to sales
made on or after January 1, 2020 and shall be in addition to all other taxes

regarding sales that occur during the transition.

(Ord. 19-02, passed 2-11-2019)
§ 50.07 INDUSTRIAL USE SEWER STRENGTH CHARGES.
   (A)   Recitals. The Metropolitan Waste Control Commission, a metropolitan
commission organized and existing under the laws of the state (the
“Commission”), in order to receive and retain grants in compliance with the
Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 (the “Act”), being 33
U.S.C. §§ 1251 et seq., and regulations under it, has determined to impose an
industrial user sewer strength charge upon users of the Metropolitan Disposal
System (as defined in Minn. Stat. § 473.121(24), as it may be amended from time
to time) to recover operation and maintenance costs of treatment works
attributable to the strength of the discharge of industrial waste, in addition
to the charge based upon the volume of discharge. In order for the city to pay
the costs based upon strength of industrial discharge and allocated to it each
year by the Commission, it is necessary to establish sewer strength charges and
a formula for the computation for all industrial users receiving waste
treatment services within or served by the city. Furthermore, Minn. Stat. §
444.075(3), as it may be amended from time to time, empowers the city to make
the sewer charge a charge against the owner, lessee, occupant or all of them
and certify unpaid charges to the County Auditor as a tax lien against the
property served.
   (B)   Establishment of strength charges. For the purpose of paying the costs
allocated to the city each year by the Commission that are based upon the
strength of discharge of all industrial users receiving waste treatment
services within or served by the city, there is in addition to the sewer charge
based upon the volume of discharge, a sewer charge for each person, company or
corporation receiving waste treatment services within or served by the city,
based upon strength of industrial waste discharged into the sewer system of the
city (the “strength charge”).
   (C)   Establishment of strength charge formula. For the purpose of computing
the strength charge stated in division (B) above, the strength charge formula
designated in Res. 76-172 adopted by the governing body of the Commission on
June 15, 1976, is adopted by reference. The formula is based upon pollution
qualities and difficulty of disposal of the sewage produced through an
evaluation of pollution qualities and quantities in excess of an annual average
base and the proportionate costs of operation and maintenance of waste
treatment services provided by the Commission.
   (D)   Strength charge payment. The strength charge established by division
(B) above must be paid by each industrial user receiving waste treatment
services before the twentieth day succeeding the date of billing to the user by
or on behalf of the city, and the payment will be deemed to be delinquent if
not paid by the date done. Furthermore, if the payment is not paid before the
date due, an industrial user shall pay interest compounded monthly at the rate
of two-thirds of 1% per month on the unpaid balance due.
   (E)   Establishment of tax lien. As provided by Minn. Stat. § 444.075(3), as
it may be amended from time to time, if payment of the strength charge in
division (B) above is not paid before the sixtieth day succeeding the date of
billing to the industrial user by or on behalf of the city, the delinquent
sewer strength charge, plus accrued interest established pursuant to division
(D) above, will be deemed to be a charge against the owner, and the city or its
agent will certify the unpaid delinquent balance to the County Auditor with
taxes against the property served for collection as other taxes are collected.
(2001 Code, § 700.11)
§ 50.08 PROHIBITED DISCHARGE OF CLEAR WATER DRAINAGE FROM SUMP PUMPS AND OTHER
SOURCES INTO THE SANITARY SEWER SYSTEM.
   (A)   Applicability and purpose.
      (1)   This section shall apply to all water entering the sanitary sewer
system unless explicitly exempted by the city. The city and its representatives
are authorized to administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this
section.
      (2)   The Council finds that the discharge from roofs, rainspouts, yard
drains, surfaces, groundwater, sump pumps, footing tiles or swimming pools,
foundation drains, yard fountains, ponds, cistern overflows, water discharged
from any nonresidential air conditioning unit or system, or other means of
transmitting natural precipitation and surface waters, collectively referred to
as excess infiltration and inflow, into the sanitary sewer system, will and has
in the past overloaded the sanitary sewer system. The Council, therefore, finds
it essential for compliance with mandated City Code requirements that the
provisions of this section be strictly enforced.
      (3)   This section is not intended to modify or repeal any other
ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law. The requirements of
this section are in addition to the requirements of any other ordinance, rule,
regulation, or other provision of law, and where any provision of this section
imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule,
regulation or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive
or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment
shall apply.
   (B)   Clear water drainage. CLEAR WATER DRAINAGE, for the purpose of this
section, is defined as stormwater, natural precipitation, melting snow, ground
water or flow from roof runoff, ground surface runoff, subsurface drainage,
down spouts, eave troughs, rainspouts, yard drains, sump pumps, footing tiles
or swimming pools, foundation drains, yard fountains, ponds, cistern overflows,
water discharged from any nonresidential air conditioning unit or system, or
any other water that is not required to be treated by state of federal law,
that enters the sanitary sewer system through any separation, gap, crack,
fracture, collapse or other structural defect in the sewer lateral. Swimming
pool water that is required to be treated in accordance with city, county or
state regulations shall not be considered clear water.
   (C)   Private sewer lateral.  PRIVATE SEWER LATERAL, for the purpose of this
section, is defined as all sewer service pipes extending from the city sanitary
sewer main to the dwelling, building or structure it serves.
   (D)   Ownership responsibility. The property owner shall own and be
responsible for the routine maintenance and repair of the sanitary private
sewer lateral, including the connection to the city sanitary sewer main.
   (E)   Prohibited discharges into the sanitary sewer system. It shall be
unlawful for any person whose property is provided with sanitary sewer service
to directly or indirectly cause or permit to be discharged, pumped or drained
any clear water drainage into the city’s sanitary sewer system.
   (F)   Prohibited connections. No person shall make or maintain a connection
between any conductor, device or system designed to move clear water drainage
from its source to any pipe, cleanout, floor drain, foundation drain, sink or
any other apparatus with a direct connection to the city’s sanitary sewer
system.
   (G)   Sump pumps. A sump pump is a mechanical device used to remove liquid
collected in a sump usually constructed below the normal grade of the gravity
system, usually below basement floor level. Dwellings and other buildings and
structures that require a sump pump system to collect and discharge excess
clear water drainage because of the infiltration of water into basements, crawl
spaces and the like shall obtain a permit and have a permanently installed
discharge line that complies with the following:
      (1)   It shall not any time discharge water into the city’s sanitary
sewer system or be capable of connection or reconnection to the city's sanitary
sewer system;
      (2)   It shall provide for year-round discharge capability to the outside
of the dwelling, building or structure, to the city's storm sewer system;
      (3)   It shall consist of a rigid discharge line constructed of rigid
piping material inside the dwelling or building, without any connections for
altering the path of discharge, and if connected to the city’s storm sewer
line, must include a check valve of an approved type and diameter; and
      (4) It must be directed toward the front or rear yard so as not to
trespass or discharge onto adjoining properties.
   (H)   Inspections. For purposes of complying with the mandates of this
section to eliminate clear water drainage into the sanitary sewer system, the
Public Works Director, or his or her designee ("Inspector") is authorized to
conduct inspections of private sewer laterals and sump pumps for all single-
family, owner-occupied properties that discharge into the city's sanitary sewer
system for the limited purpose of confirming that there is no sump pump or
other prohibited discharge of clear water drainage. Such inspection shall be at
no expense to the owner, so long at the owner complies with the requirements
set forth in division (H)(2) below. Failure to have an inspection as required
in this section is a violation of the City Code.
      (1)   Except as set forth in division (H)(3) below, inspections are
required when one of the following occurs:
         (a)   The property is offered for sale or conveyance by deed or
contract for deed, unless the certificate of compliance is still valid pursuant
to division (I) below;
         (b)   The city orders a street improvement project and the property is
located on or adjacent to a street in the improvement project area; or
         (c)   For the purpose of safeguarding the health and safety of the
general public or occupants of a building to determine compliance with the City
Code and the city has identified specific areas that have exceeded peak flow
rates as established by the local authority having jurisdiction.
      (2)   Inspections shall be conducted pursuant to §
10.17. In addition to the inspection requirements in §
10.17, owners shall be required to comply with the following:
         (a)   Provide sufficient space and access to the private sewer lateral
within the dwelling, building or other structure, including removal of any
obstacles so that the private sewer lateral and waste stack cleanout or final
cleanout, as necessary, is completely accessible to the Inspector; and
         (b)   Clear, or contract with for services to clear, the private sewer
lateral of any root intrusions, structural blockages or any other intrusions
that prevent the completion of an inspection and to allow clear televising of
the private sewer lateral from the dwelling, building or other structure to its
connection with the city’s sanitary sewer main; and
         (c)   Remove, or contract with services to remove, any toilet on the
lowest level of the building for access purposes as described in division (H)
(2)(a) above; and
         (d)   The owner shall pay a penalty as provided in division (M) below
for any missed inspections. If the owner or the owner's representative arrives
later than 20 minutes past the scheduled inspection time without notification
prior to the appointment, it shall be considered a missed inspection.
      (3)   Inspections shall not be required under the following
circumstances:
         (a)   It is a newly constructed dwelling and title to the property is
transferred to the first owner;
         (b)   It is the sale or other transfer of title of any property with a
dwelling that is being conveyed to a public body;
         (c)   It is the sale or transfer of title of any property that
contains a dwelling that will be demolished;
         (d)   It is the sale or conveyance of any property that contains a
dwelling by a sheriff or other public or court officer in the performance of
their official duties. This exception does not apply to the sale by a person
appointed by a probate court; or
         (e)   The property is connected to a septic system and has no public
sewer access or has been granted a connection waiver by the city.
      (4)   The city shall complete its inspection reports within ten business
days from the date of the inspection and immediately send the report to the
property owner. The reports shall indicate all sewer lateral defects,
deficiencies and violations discovered in sufficient detail to identify the
violations and to contract for repairs as necessary.
      (5)   At the discretion of the Inspector, the Inspector may refuse to
conduct a scheduled inspection if doing so would pose a risk to the Inspector's
health, safety or welfare. In such cases, the property owner will be required
to have the inspection perfonned by an independent contractor at the property
owner's expense.
   (I)   Certificates of compliance. 
      (1)   Issuance. If, following inspection, it is determined that the
property is in compliance with this section, the city shall issue a certificate
of compliance. No new inspections or certificates for single-family, owner-
occupied properties shall be required until one of the events in division (H)
(1) above occurs.
      (2)   Certificate of compliance period. Certificates of compliance are
valid as follows:
         (a)   For any property that had a full sewer service line and/or
lining replacement, the certificate is valid for 25 years from the date of
issuance.
         (b)   For any property that had a partial sewer service line and/or
lining replacement, the certificate is valid for ten years from the date of
issuance or until January 1, 2026, whichever is later.
      (3)   The city shall issue a certificate of compliance if the inspection
verifies that all of the following conditions are met:
         (a)   There is no sewer pipe joint degradation, as evidenced by root
intrusion and mineral staining, scaling and deposits;
         (b)   There are no prohibited discharges or connections as defined by
divisions (E) and (F) above;
         (c)   There are no misaligned joints obstructing the flow of wastes
causing blockages, exfiltration of the intrusion of roots or minerals; or
         (d)   The lateral is free of holes, cracks, fractures, collapses, or
other structural defects.
   (J)   Residential rental properties. For residential rental properties, the
property owner is required to locate the building's sewer cleanout, open the
cleanout to ensure functionality, identify any private manholes or outside
cleanouts and locate all sump pump systems (if applicable). The property owner
shall obtain an independent inspection and submit an inspection report to the
city upon submission of a new or renewal rental license application. The
inspection report shall indicate that the property is free from prohibited
discharges and prohibited connections, including illegal sump pumps. If any
violations are discovered, corrections must be made pursuant to division (L)
below. The city shall conduct a reinspection or receive a post-repair video to
verify compliance. Upon verification that the corrections have been made, the
city shall issue a certificate of compliance.
   (K)   Commercial, industrial and HOA properties. For commercial and
industrial properties and condominium or townhome residential properties with a
homeowners’ association (“HOA properties”), property owners are required to
locate the building's sewer cleanout, open the cleanout to ensure
functionality, identify any private manholes or outside cleanouts and location
all sump pump systems (if applicable). The property owner shall obtain an
independent inspection and submit an inspection report to the city. The
inspection report shall indicate that the property is free from prohibited
discharges and prohibited connections, including illegal sump pumps. If any
violations are discovered, corrections must be made pursuant to division (L)
below. The city shall conduct a reinspection or receive a post-repair video to
verify compliance. Upon verification that corrections have been made, the city
shall issue a certificate of compliance.
   (L)   Violations.
      (1)   Violations, generally. Except as provided in division (L)(2) below,
for owner-occupied, single-family private sewer lateral violations discovered
during a time of sale inspection, when the Inspector determines there has been
a violation of any provision of this division, the Inspector will give notice
of the violation to the owner and occupant in writing and allow time for
compliance as follows.
         (a)   For residential rental, commercial, industrial and HOA
properties, private sewer lateral violations shall be corrected within 120 days
of discovery of the violation.
         (b)   For all sump pump violations, regardless of the classification
of the property, the violation shall be corrected within 30 days.
      (2)   Violations discovered at time of sale.
         (a)   Seller responsibilities. When the Inspector determines that
there has been a violation of any provision of this section prior to the sale,
the seller is responsible for correcting the violations prior to the sale,
unless the buyer has assumed such responsibility as provided in division (L)(2)
(b) below. Failure of a seller to disclose to a buyer that there are
uncorrected violations of this section is a violation of the City Code. When
correcting the violations, all necessary permits shall be obtained from the
city. Upon completion of the corrections, the city shall reinspect the property
to verify compliance or the seller shall provide a copy of a post-repair video
to the city.
         (b)   Buyer responsibilities. If a seller cannot correct the
violations prior to the sale, the seller must require the buyer to assume the
responsibility for correcting the violations, in which case, the seller and the
buyer shall sign and submit a written acknowledgment to the city that includes:
            1.   The buyer’s acceptance and assumption of responsibility for
correcting the violations within one year after closing on the property;
            2.   The buyer's understanding that either the city shall reinspect
the property to verify compliance or a copy of a post-repair video must be
provided to the city in order to verify that the corrections have been
completed;
            3.   The buyer's agreement to hold the city harmless from
liabilities and claims if the buyer occupies the dwelling prior to corrections
of the violations; and
            4.   The buyer's understanding that failure to correct violations
or deficiencies, failure to provide a post-repair video or failure to allow a
reinspection is a violation of the City Code and subjects the buyer to
penalties as stated in divisions (M), (O), and (P).
      (3)   Violations and corrections under the roadway. When the Inspector
determines that there has been a violation of any provision of this section and
the violations are under the roadway, the property owner will perform the
repairs, except as stated in division (L)(4) below. However, a property owner
shall not excavate in the roadway without permission from the City Engineer.
      (4)   Non-excavation violations and corrections. When the property owner
is correcting violations of the private sewer lateral between the street and
the building using a cured in place pipe ("pipe liner") or similar approved
repair methods, and the corrections only involve the lining of the private
sewer lateral, the contractor shall terminate the pipe liner as close to the
connection with the city's public sanitary sewer main as possible. If the pipe
liner extends into the public main, the contractor shall trim off the excess
portion and report its approximate location to the Public Works Department as
soon as possible.
   (M)   Penalty.
      (1)   A monthly penalty of $50 for owner-occupied, single-family
properties; and a monthly penalty of $300 for residential rental, commercial,
industrial and HOA properties shall be sent an invoice if:
         (a)   An owner fails to complete an inspection pursuant to divisions
(H), (J) and (K);
         (b)   An owner whose property was found in violation of this section
did not make the necessary repairs and furnish proof of those changes to the
city within the time frames required by this section;
         (c)   An owner fails to allow an inspection or reinspection to verify
compliance; or
         (d)   The property owner or occupant reconnects a clear water
discharge line to the municipal sanitary sewer system after it has been
previously disconnected at the city's or a court's direction. The property
owner will be subject to the penalty for all months between the last two
inspections.
      (2)   The penalty shall be added for every month during which the
property is not in compliance.
   (N)   Temporary waiver. The City Engineer may allow or require a temporary
waiver from the provisions of this section when strict enforcement would cause
a threat of damage or harm to other property, the environment or public safety
because of circumstances unique to the individual property or due to weather
conditions. A written request for a temporary waiver must be first submitted to
the City Engineer specifying the reasons for the request.
   (O)   City Engineer. The City Engineer may set conditions to any temporary
waiver issued. The City Engineer may terminate the waiver upon a failure to
comply with any conditions imposed in the temporary waiver or may take
appropriate legal action to enforce those conditions. The City Engineer must
give a five-day written notice of the termination to the property owner and
occupant setting forth the reasons for the termination. After expiration or
termination of a temporary waiver, the property owner must comply with the
provisions of this section.
   (P)   Public nuisance. An owner or occupant who fails to have an inspection,
who has done work that does not comply with this section, who reconnects to a
previously disconnected prohibited discharge, who fails to pay the penalty or
who has failed to do the work required by this section within the specified
time limit, will be deemed to have created a public nuisance subject to
abatement and assessment, as provided in
Chapter 94 of this City Code.
   (Q)   Remedies. The remedies provided in this section do not limit the right
of the city to pursue any other available legal remedy.

§ 50.09 STORMWATER ILLICIT DISCHARGE AND ILLICIT CONNECTION.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide for the health,
safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city through the regulation
of non-stormwater discharges to the storm drain system to the maximum extent
practicable as required by federal and state law. This section establishes
methods for controlling the introduction of pollutants into the storm drain
system in order to comply with requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System permit process. The objectives of this section are:
      (1)   To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the storm drain
system by stormwater discharges by any user;
      (2)   To prohibit illicit connections and discharges to the storm drain
system; and
      (3)   To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection,
surveillance, monitoring and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure
compliance with this section.
   (B)   Findings. The City Council hereby finds that non-stormwater discharges
to the city’s municipal separated storm sewer system are subject to higher
levels of pollutants that enter into receiving water bodies adversely affecting
the public health, safety and general welfare by impacting water quality,
creating nuisances, impairing other beneficial uses of environmental resources

modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of
law. The requirements of this section are in addition to the requirements of
any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, and where any
provision of this section imposes restrictions different from those imposed by
any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, then whichever
provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human
health or the environment shall control.
   (G)   Discharge prohibitions and exceptions.
      (1)   No person shall throw, drain or otherwise discharge, cause or allow
anyone under his or her control to throw, drain or otherwise discharge into the
MS4 any pollutants or waters containing any pollutants, other than stormwater.
The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal discharge to the storm
drain system is prohibited, except as described as follows:
         (a)   Water line flushing, landscape irrigation, diverted stream
flows, rising groundwaters, uncontaminated ground water infiltration,
uncontaminated pumped groundwater, discharges from potable water sources,
foundation drains, air conditioning condensation, irrigation water, springs,
water from crawl space pumps, footing drains, lawn watering, individual
residential car washing, flows from riparian habitats and wetlands,
dechlorinated swimming pool discharges and street wash water;
         (b)   Discharges or flow from firefighting activities and other
discharges authorized by the city as being necessary to protect public health
and safety;
         (c)   Discharges associated with dye testing; however this activity
requires a verbal notification to the Public Works Department prior to the time
of the test;
         (d)   Any non-stormwater discharge permitted under an NPDES permit,
waiver or waste discharge order issued to the discharger and administered under
the authority of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, provided that the
discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver or
order and other applicable laws and regulations, and provided that written
approval has been granted for any discharge to the storm drain system.
      (2)   No person shall throw, deposit, leave, maintain, keep or permit to
be thrown, deposited, left or maintained, in or upon any public or private
property, driveway, parking area, street, alley, sidewalk, component of the
storm drain system or water of the state, any refuse, rubbish, garbage, litter
or other discarded or abandoned objects, articles and accumulations, so that
the same may cause or contribute to pollution. Waste deposited in streets in
proper receptacles for the purposes of collection is exempted from this
prohibition.
      (3)   No person shall throw, deposit, place, leave, maintain or keep any
substance upon any street, alley, sidewalk, storm drain, inlet, catch basin
conduit or drainage structure, business place or upon any public or private
land, so that the same might be or become a pollutant, unless the substance is
in containers, recycling bags or any other lawfully established waste disposal
device.
   (H)   Illicit connection prohibitions.
      (1)   No person shall use any illicit connection to intentionally convey
non-stormwater to the city’s storm sewer system.
      (2)   The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of
illicit connections to the storm sewer system is prohibited. This prohibition
expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made in the past
regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practices
applicable or prevailing at the time of connection.
      (3)   A person is considered to be in violation of this section if the
person connects a line conveying sewage to the storm sewer system, or allows
such a connection to continue.
      (4)   If a drain or conveyance on a property has not been documented in
any plans or maps or equivalent documentation filed with the city which may be
connected to the storm drain system, the city may require the owner or occupant
of the property to locate the drain or conveyance to make certain that it is
not an illicit connection to the storm drain system. The city shall provide the
owner or occupant with a written notice requiring that the locating be
completed within a reasonable time period. The owner or occupant shall perform
the locating and shall provide the city with documentation that the drain or
conveyance is not an illicit connection.
   (I)   Industrial or construction activity discharges. Any person performing
any construction or industrial activity subject to an NPDES stormwater
discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of
compliance with the permit may be required in a form acceptable to the Public
Works Department prior to the allowing of discharge to the storm drain system.
   (J)   Requirement to prevent, control and reduce stormwater pollutants by
the use of BMPs. BMPs are required for any activity, operation or facility
which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the
storm drain system or waters of the state. The owner or operator of such
activity, operation or facility shall provide, at his or her own expense,
reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or
other wastes into the storm drain system or waters of the state through the use
of structural and non-structural BMPs. The owner or operator of a premise that
may be the source of an illegal discharge may be required by the city to
implement, at the discharger’s expense, additional structural and non-
structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the storm
drain system. These BMPs shall be part of the Stormwater Pollution Prevention
Plan if necessary for compliance with requirements of an NPDES permit.
Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing
the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent
practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this section.
   (K)   General provisions. All owners or occupants of property shall comply
with the following general requirements.
      (1)   No person shall leave, deposit, discharge, dump or otherwise expose
any chemical or septic waste in an area where discharge to streets or storm
sewer system may occur. This section shall apply to both actual and potential
discharges.
         (a)   Individual septic systems must be maintained to prevent failure,
which has the potential to pollute surface water.
         (b)   No part of any individual septic system requiring on-land or in-
ground disposal of waste shall be located closer than 150 feet from the
ordinary high water level in the case of DNR protected waters, or the wetland
boundary in the case of all other water bodies, unless it is proven by the
applicant that no effluent will immediately or gradually reach the water bodies
because of existing physical characteristics of the site or the system.
         (c)   Recreational vehicle sewage shall be disposed to a proper
sanitary waste facility. Waste shall not be discharged in an area where
drainage to streets or storm sewer systems may occur.
         (d)   For pools, water must be allowed to sit seven days without the
addition of chlorine to allow for chlorine to evaporate before discharging in
an area where drainage to streets or storm sewer systems may occur.
      (2)   Runoff of water from residential property shall be minimized to the
maximum extent practicable. Runoff of water from the washing down of paved
areas in commercial or industrial property is prohibited unless necessary for
health or safety purposes and not in violation of any other provisions of the
city code or zoning ordinances.
      (3)   Mobile washing companies (carpet cleaning, mobile vehicle washing,
etc.) shall dispose of wastewater to the sanitary sewer. Wastewater must not be
discharged where drainage to streets or storm sewer system may occur.
      (4)   Storage of materials, machinery and equipment must comply with the
following requirements.
         (a)   Objects, such as motor vehicle parts containing grease, oil or
other hazardous substances and unsealed receptacles containing hazardous
materials shall not be stored in areas susceptible to runoff.
         (b)   Any machinery or equipment that is to be repaired or maintained
in areas susceptible to runoff shall be placed in a confined area to contain
leaks, spills or discharges.
      (5)   Debris and residue shall be removed as follows.
         (a)   All motor vehicle parking lots and private streets shall be
swept at least once a year in the spring to remove debris. Such debris shall be
collected and properly disposed.
         (b)   Fuel and chemical residue or other types of potentially harmful
material, such as animal waste, garbage or batteries shall be removed as soon
as possible and disposed of properly. Household hazardous waste may be disposed
of through the county collection program or at any other appropriate disposal
site and shall not be placed in a trash container.
   (L)   Notification of spills. Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as
soon as any person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for
emergency response for a facility or operation has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal
discharges or pollutants discharging into the storm sewer system, or water of
the state said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery,
containment and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of
hazardous materials, said person shall immediately notify emergency response
agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a
release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the city within 24
hours of the discharge. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from
a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such
establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and
the actions taken to prevent its reoccurrence. Such records must be retained
for at least five years past the end of the NPDES industrial permit cycle.
Failure to provide notification of a release as provided in this section is a
violation of this section.
   (M)   Access to building for inspection, monitoring and/or dye testing.
      (1)   The city shall be permitted to enter and inspect all buildings
under this section as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with
this section provided the city gives 24 hours’ advanced notice. However, in
cases of emergency, the city shall be given immediate access.
      (2)   Facility operators shall allow the city ready access to all part of
the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, dye testing, examination
and copying of records that relate to the discharge of stormwater. Any
temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the area to be
inspected or sampled shall be promptly removed by the discharger at the request
of the Public Works Department and shall not be replaced.
      (3)   The city shall have the right to establish, at any building, such
devices as are necessary to conduct monitoring, sampling and/or dye testing of
the facility’s stormwater discharge.
      (4)   The city has the right to require the discharger to install
monitoring equipment as necessary. The monitoring equipment must be maintained
by the discharger in a safe and proper operating condition at all times. All
devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality must be calibrated in order
to ensure their accuracy.
      (5)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the city access to a facility is a
violation of this section.
      (6)   If the city has been refused access to any part of the premises
from which stormwater is discharged, and is able to demonstrate probable cause
to believe that there may be a violation of this section, or that there is a
need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling
program designed to verify compliance with this section or any order issued
hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the
community, then the city may seek issuance of an administrative search warrant
from any court of competent jurisdiction.
   (N)   Suspension of storm sewer system access.
      (1)   Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situation. The
city may, without prior notice, suspend storm sewer system discharge access to
a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened
discharge that presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the
environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the storm sewer or
waters of the state. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order
issued in an emergency, the city may take such steps as deemed necessary to
prevent or minimize damage to the storm sewer system or waters of the state, or
to minimize danger to persons.
      (2)   Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. All persons
discharging to the storm sewer system in violation of this section may have
their storm sewer system access terminated if such termination serves to abate
or reduce an illicit discharge. It is a violation of this section to reinstate
storm sewer system access to premises that have been terminated pursuant to
this section without the prior approval of the city.
   (O)   Enforcement.
      (1)   Notice of violation. A violation of this section is a public
nuisance. When the city finds that a person has violated a prohibition or
failed to meet a requirement of this section, the person is deemed to have
created a public nuisance subject to abatement and assessment, as provided in
City Code
Chapter 94. The city may also issue an administrative citation pursuant to City
Code §
10.98. In addition to any order issued to abate the public nuisance pursuant to
City Code
Chapter 94, the city may require the following:
         (a)   The performance of monitoring, analysis and reporting;
         (b)   The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs; and
         (c)   Any other requirement deemed necessary or appropriate.

      (3)   Permit parking zones. No person may park a vehicle in a permit
parking zone without first obtaining and displaying the proper permit.
         (a)   Petitioned permit parking zones.
            1.   In order to establish a permanent permit parking zone, 70% of
the residents and/or businesses who have an address within the proposed permit
parking zone must sign and file a written petition with the City Clerk
containing the following information:
               a.   The specific streets, blocks or area that should be
included in the permit parking zone, with a map depicting the proposed permit
parking zone;
               b.   The hours during which the parking permit should be
enforced;
               c.   The necessity for the permit parking zone; and
               d.   The printed names, addresses and signatures of 70% of the
property owners or adult occupants of properties within the proposed permit
parking zone. For purposes of calculating 70% only one signature shall be
counted per property or per legal address.
            2.   Council consideration. Upon receipt of a valid petition, the
city shall notify all property owners and occupants, if known, within the
proposed permit parking zone, as well as those property owners within 350 feet
of the proposed permit parking zone of the date and time that the petition will
be considered by the Council. After a hearing, the Council may approve, modify
or deny the permit parking zone in order to protect the health, safety and
welfare of the citizens of the city. If approved, a permit parking zone
establishing the boundaries of the zone and hours of enforcement will be
adopted by City Council resolution.
            3.   Permanent parking permits. Upon application to the Police
Department, owners and occupants who reside at a property address that is
within an approved permit parking zone, may be issued a parking permit. The
applicant must identify the vehicles to which the parking permit will be
permanently affixed by make, model and license plate number, and pay the
appropriate fee. The vehicles must register to the same property address for
which the parking permit is being requested. Employees who park work vehicles
at their residence may provide proof of residency at that address and proof of
employment as sufficient documentation for a permanent parking permit. The
parking permits shall be valid as long as the owner or occupant resides at the
property that is within the permit parking zone.
            4.   Temporary parking permits in permanent parking zones. Owners
and occupants who reside at a property address that is in the permit parking
zone may apply for a temporary parking permit on behalf of their guests. The
applicant must identify the dates for which the temporary parking permit is
requested, and pay the appropriate fee. The dates shall be listed on the
temporary parking permit, which must be prominently displayed in the vehicle.
            5.   The Council may establish appropriate fees by City Council
resolution to recover the costs associated with consideration and
implementation of a permit parking zone.
         (b)   Temporary permit parking only zones or temporary no-parking
zones. For the temporary placement of obstructions in the right-of-way, such as
a temporary outdoor storage container, pursuant to §
92.02(D) or for parking for an event of limited duration requiring an unusual
amount of on-street parking, property owners or tenants may apply for temporary
permit parking signs or temporary no-parking signs pursuant to this section.
            1.   Applications shall be reviewed and may be approved by the
Police Department according to the following process:
               a.   Written applications must be submitted to the police
department at least ten days prior to the dates requested and it must be
completed by the property owner or tenant who is requesting temporary signs for
right-of-way that is immediately adjacent to the applicant's property. If the
temporary signs are to be located on property that is not immediately adjacent
to the applicant's property, the applicant must provide written permission of
the property owners who abut the right-of-way being requested.
               b.   A minimum of two signs will be required. The city shall
require additional signs for every 20 feet of right-of-way needed for the
permit parking or no-parking zone, as determined by the city.
               c.   The applicant shall pas for the costs of the signs as set
forth in the city's fee schedule, and payment must be submitted prior to
installation of the signs.
               d.   The temporary signs shall only be posted during the dates
of the event as indicated on the application, which shall not exceed two weeks.
            2.   The city shall install and remove the signs.
            3.   No applications under this section shall be approved between
December 1 through February 28.
            4.   All owners of vehicles parking in a temporary permit parking
zone shall comply with snow emergency declarations and move their vehicles
accordingly.
            5.   All owners of vehicles parking in a temporary permit parking
zone shall prominently display the permit sticker issued by the city.
            6.   The city reserves the right to deny or revoke any temporary
permit parking or no-parking requests to protect the health, safety and welfare
of the public.
            7.   Vehicles parked in violation of this section shall be subject
to removal by the city.
      (4)   Prima facie violation. The presence of any motor vehicle on any
street when standing or parked in violation of this section is prima facie
evidence that the registered owner of the vehicle committed or authorized the
commission of the violation.
   (B)   Parking restrictions for private property. The outside parking and
storage on residentially-zoned property of large numbers of vehicles and
vehicles, materials, supplies or equipment not customarily used for residential
purposes in violation of the requirements set forth below is declared to be a
public nuisance because it: obstructs views on streets and private property;

   (C)   Declaration of dangerous or potentially dangerous dog.
      (1)   A police officer, community service officer, animal control officer
or other authorized city employee may declare a dog to be dangerous or
potentially dangerous when the officer has probable cause to believe that a dog
is dangerous or potentially dangerous. The following factors will be considered
in determining a dangerous or potentially dangerous dog:
         (a)   Whether any injury or damage to a person by the dog was caused
while the dog was protecting or defending a person or the dog’s offspring
within the immediate vicinity of the dog from an unjustified attack or assault;
         (b)   The size and strength of the dog, including jaw strength, and
the animal’s propensity to bite humans or other domestic animals; and
         (c)   Whether the dog has wounds, scarring, is observed in a fight, or
has other indications that the dog has been or will be used, trained or
encouraged to fight with another animal or whose owner is in possession of any
training apparatus, paraphernalia or drugs used to prepare such dogs to fight
with other animals.
      (2)   Beginning six months after a dog is declared dangerous or
potentially dangerous, an owner may request annually that the city review the
designation. The owner must provide evidence that the dog’s behavior has
changed due to the dog’s age, neutering, environment, completion of obedience
training or other factors. If enough evidence is provided, the city may rescind
the designation.
      (3)   Exceptions:
         (a)   The provisions of this section do not apply to dogs used by law
enforcement; and
         (b)   Dogs may not be declared dangerous or potentially dangerous if
the threat, injury or danger was sustained by a person who was:
            1.   Committing a willful trespass or other tort upon the premises
occupied by the owner of the dog;
            2.   Provoking, tormenting, abusing or assaulting the dog, or who
can be shown to have a history of repeatedly provoking, tormenting, abusing or
assaulting the dog; or
            3.   Committing or attempting to commit a crime.
   (D)   License required. The owner must annually license dangerous and
potentially dangerous dogs with the city and must license a newly declared
dangerous or potentially dangerous dog within 14 days after notice that a dog
has been declared dangerous or potentially dangerous. Regardless of any appeal
that may be requested, the owner must comply with the requirements of Minn.
Stat. § 347.52(a) and (c), as they may be amended from time to time, regarding
proper enclosures and notification to the city upon transfer or death of the
dog, until and unless a hearing officer or court of law reverses the
declaration.
      (1)   Process for dangerous dogs. The city will issue a license to the
owner of a dangerous dog if the owner presents sufficient evidence that:
         (a)   There is a proper enclosure;
         (b)   Written proof that there is a surety bond by a surety company
authorized to conduct business in the state in the sum of at least $300,000,
payable to any person injured by a dangerous dog, or receipt of a copy of a
policy of liability insurance issued by an insurance company authorized to do
business in the state in the amount of at least $300,000, insuring the owner
for any personal injuries inflicted by the dangerous dog. The surety bond or
insurance policy shall provide that no cancellation of the bond or policy will
be made unless the city is notified in writing by the surety company or the
insurance company at least ten days prior to the cancellation;
         (c)   The owner has paid the annual license fee for dangerous dogs as
may be established by the City Council;
         (d)   The owner has had a microchip identification implanted in the
dangerous dog. The name of the microchip manufacturer and identification number
of the microchip must be provided to the city. If the microchip is not
implanted by the owner, it may be implanted by the city at the owner’s expense;
and
         (e)   The owner provides proof that the dog has been sterilized. If
the owner does not sterilize the dog within 30 days, the city may seize the dog
and sterilize it at the owner’s expense.
      (2)   Process for potentially dangerous dogs. The city will issue a
license to the owner of a potentially dangerous dog if the owner presents
sufficient evidence that:
         (a)   There is a proper enclosure;
         (b)   The owner has paid the annual license fee; and
         (c)   The owner has had a microchip identification implanted in the
potentially dangerous dog. The name of the microchip manufacturer and
identification number of the microchip must be provided to the city. If the
microchip is not implanted by the owner, it may be implanted by the city at the
owner’s expense.
      (3)   Inspection. A pre-license inspection of the premises to ensure
compliance with the city code is required. If the city issues a license to the
owner of a dangerous or potentially dangerous dog, the city shall be allowed at
any reasonable time to inspect the dog, the proper enclosure and all places
where the animal is kept.
      (4)   Warning symbol. The owner of a dangerous dog licensed under this
section must post a sign with the uniform dangerous dog warning symbol on the
property in order to inform children that there is a dangerous dog on the
property. The sign will be provided by the city upon issuance of the license.
      (5)   Tags. A dangerous dog licensed under this section must wear a
standardized, easily identifiable tag at all times that contains the uniform
dangerous dog symbol, identifying the dog as dangerous. The tag shall be
provided by the city upon issuance of the license.
      (6)   License fee. The city will charge the owner an annual license fee
for a dangerous or potentially dangerous dog as may be established by the City
Council.
   (E)   Properly restrained in proper enclosure or outside of proper
enclosure. While on the owner’s property, an owner of a dangerous or
potentially dangerous dog must keep it in a proper enclosure. Inside a
residential home, there must be a secured area maintained where the dog will
stay when persons other than family members are present. If the dog is outside
the proper enclosure, the dog must be muzzled and restrained by a substantial
chain or leash no longer than four feet and under the physical restraint of an
adult. The muzzle must be made in a manner that will prevent the dog from
biting any person or animal but that will not cause injury to the dog or
interfere with its vision or respiration.
   (F)   Notification requirements to city.
      (1)   Relocation or death. The owner of a dog that has been declared
dangerous or potentially dangerous must notify the City Clerk or Police
Department in writing if the dog is to be relocated from its current address or
if the dog has died. The notification must be given in writing within 30 days
of the relocation or death. The notification must include the current owner’s
name and address, and the new owner’s name and the relocation address. If the
relocation address is outside of the city, the city may notify the local law
enforcement agency of the transfer of the dog into its jurisdiction.
      (2)   Renter’s obligations. A person who owns or possesses a dangerous or
potentially dangerous dog and who will rent property from another where the dog
will reside must disclose to the property owner prior to entering the lease
agreement and at the time of any lease renewal periods that the person owns or
possesses a dangerous or potentially dangerous dog that will reside at the
property. A dog owner, who is currently renting property, must notify the
property owner within 14 days of city notification if the owned dog is newly
declared as dangerous or potentially dangerous and the owner keeps the dog on
the property.
      (3)   Transfer of ownership into the city. No dog that has been
previously determined to be dangerous or potentially dangerous by another
jurisdiction shall be kept, owned or harbored in the city, unless the dog’s
owner complies with the requirements of this section prior to bringing the dog
into the city. Dogs in violation of this division are subject to impoundment
and destruction.
   (G)   Seizure. The city may immediately seize any dangerous or potentially
dangerous dog if:
      (1)   After 14 days after the owner has notice that the dog is declared
dangerous or potentially dangerous, the dog is not validly licensed and no
appeal has been filed;
      (2)   After 14 days after the owner has notice that the dog is dangerous,
the owner does not secure the proper liability insurance or surety coverage as
required or such required insurance is cancelled;
      (3)   The dog is not maintained in a proper enclosure;
      (4)   The dog is outside the proper enclosure and not under proper
restraint, as required by division (E) above;
      (5)   After 30 days after the owner has notice that the dog is dangerous,
the dog is not sterilized, as required by division (D)(1)(e) above; and
      (6)   The dog’s microchip has been removed.
   (H)   Reclamation. A dog seized under division (G) above may be reclaimed by
the owner of the dog upon payment of maintenance costs, and presenting proof to
the city that the requirements of this section have been met. A dog not
reclaimed under this division (H) within seven days may be disposed of and the
owner will be liable to the city for maintenance costs. A person claiming an
interest in a seized dog may prevent disposition of the dog by posting a
security in an amount sufficient to provide for the dog’s maintenance costs.
The security must be posted with the city within seven days of the seizure
inclusive of the date seized.
   (I)   Subsequent offenses: seizure. If a person has been convicted of
violating a provision of this section, and the person is charged with a
subsequent violation relating to the same dog, the dog may be seized. If the
owner is convicted of the crime for which the dog was seized, the court may
order that the dog be destroyed in a proper and humane manner and the owner pay
the maintenance costs. If the owner is not convicted and the dog is not
reclaimed by the owner within seven days after the owner has been notified that
the dog may be reclaimed, the dog may be disposed of, used for research or
destroyed.
   (J)   Notice; hearings.
      (1)   Notice. After a dog has been declared dangerous or potentially
dangerous or has been seized for destruction, the city shall give notice by
delivering or mailing it to the owner of the dog, or by posting a copy of it at
the place where the dog is kept, or by delivering it to a person residing on
the property, and telephoning, if possible. The notice shall include:
         (a)   A description of the seized dog; the authority for and purpose
of the declaration and seizure; the time, place and circumstances under which
the dog was declared; and the telephone number and contact person where the dog
is kept;

concerning the declaration and that failure to do so within 14 days of the date
of the notice will terminate the owner’s right to a hearing;
         (c)   A statement that if an appeal request is made within 14 days of
the notice, the owner must immediately comply with the requirements of Minn.

proper enclosures and notification to the city upon transfer or death of the
dog, until such time as the hearing officer issues an opinion;
         (d)   A statement that if the hearing officer affirms the dangerous
dog declaration, the owner will have 14 days from receipt of that decision to
comply with all other requirements of Minn. Stat. §§ 347.51, 347.515 and
347.52, as they may be amended from time to time;
         (e)   A form to request a hearing; and
         (f)   A statement that if the dog has been seized, all maintenance
costs of the care, keeping and disposition of the dog pending the outcome of
the hearing are the responsibility of the owner, unless a court or hearing
officer finds that the seizure or impoundment was not reasonably justified by
law.
      (2)   Right to hearing.
         (a)   After a dog has been declared dangerous, potentially dangerous
or has been seized for destruction, the owner may appeal in writing to the city
within 14 days after notice of the declaration or seizure. Failure to do so

hearing. The owner must pay a $100 fee for an appeal hearing.
         (b)   The appeal hearing will be held within 14 days of the request.
The hearing officer must be an impartial employee of the city or an impartial
person retained by the city to conduct the hearing.
         (c)   If the declaration or destruction is upheld by the hearing
officer, actual expenses of the hearing up to a maximum of $1,000, as well as
all maintenance costs, will be the responsibility of the dog’s owner. The
hearing officer shall issue a decision on the matter within ten days after the
hearing. The decision shall be delivered to the dog’s owner by hand delivery or
registered mail as soon as practical and a copy shall be provided to the city.
The decision of the hearing officer is final.
   (K)   Destruction of certain dogs. The Police Chief and/or hearing officer
are authorized to order the destruction or other disposition of any dog, after

      (1)   The dog has habitually destroyed property or habitually trespassed
in a damaging manner on property of persons other than the owner;

the city and must furnish proof in writing that the animal is being impounded.
On expiration of the ten days, if the animal does not have rabies, it may be
released and the city must be notified just prior to the release. If the animal

abandoned vehicles may not be placed, parked, permitted to remain, stored or
left for more than seven days unless adequately screened, or three days on a

§ 95.04 SALT STORAGE; ICE AND SNOW REMOVAL.
   (A)   Salt storage.
      (1)   Purpose. The city understands that lakes, rivers, streams and other
bodies of water are natural assets which enhance the environmental,
recreational, cultural and economic resources and contribute to the general
health and welfare of the community. The use of salt and other deicing
materials on sidewalks, parking lots, private streets, and driveways is a
common practice; however, scientific studies on the use and storage of salt and
deicing materials have demonstrated a relationship between stormwater runoff
and certain health and environmental concerns. The purpose of this Section is
to regulate the use of salt and deicing material storage areas within the city
in order to protect, restore and preserve the quality of its waters.
      (2)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definition shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
         IMPERVIOUS SURFACE. A constructed hard surface that either prevents or
retards the entry of water into the soil and causes water to run off the
surface in greater quantities and at an increased rate of flow than prior to
development. Examples include, but are not limited to, concrete, asphalt, or
gravel roads.
      (3)   Application. Any commercial, institutional, or non-NPDES permitted
industrial facility that uses salt and/or deicing materials for winter
operations must:
         (a)   Designate a salt storage area that is either covered or indoors;
         (b)   Ensure the salt storage area is situated on an impervious
surface; and
         (c)   Implement practices (sweeping, diversions, and/or containment)
to reduce exposure to the stormwater system when transferring materials within
that area.
   (B)   Ice and snow removal.
      (1)   General rule.
         (a)   Sidewalks. The owner or occupant of any property adjacent to a
public sidewalk must use due diligence to keep the entire sidewalk free from
environmental hazards and safe for pedestrians. No owner or occupant may allow
ice or snow to remain on the sidewalk longer than 12 hours after its deposit.
Ice and snow remaining on a public sidewalk longer than 12 hours is a public
nuisance.
         (b)   Trails. The city or county will clear ice and snow from all
trails.
      (2)   Notice. The city will serve notice upon the owner and occupant
ordering that the ice and snow be removed within 24 hours. Notice must be
served pursuant to
Chapter 94.
      (3)   Removal and assessment. Following service of the notice, if the
owner or occupant fails to comply, the city may remove the nuisance and assess
the costs pursuant to
Chapter 94.
      (4)   Deposit on public street. It is unlawful for any person to deposit
or cause to be deposited snow from private property or right-of-way onto a
public street.

they may be amended from time to time, and the other laws governing applicable
rights of the city and users of the right-of-way. This subchapter shall also be
interpreted consistent with Minn. Rules 7819.0050 through 7819.9950 where
possible.
      (2)   To the extent any provision of this subchapter cannot be
interpreted consistently with the Minnesota Rules, that interpretation most
consistent with the Act and other applicable statutory and case law is
intended.
      (3)    This subchapter shall not be interpreted to limit the regulatory
and police powers of the city to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary
to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public.

micro wireless facilities that are suspended on cable strung between existing
utility poles in compliance with national safety codes.
   (B)   However if any of the aforementioned work will hinder free and open
passage of the right-of-way, an obstruction permit is required pursuant to §
95.22(A)(2).
(Ord. 17-13, passed 11-27-2017)
§ 95.25 PERMIT FEES.
   (A)   Establishment. Permit fees will be established to recover the city
management costs and, when applicable, restoration costs. The permit fees are
set in the fee schedule. No permit fee will be required for an obstruction or
excavation permit issued to the city, although the city must be allocated its
full portion of the city management costs in calculating the permit fees.
   (B)   Payment required. No permit will be issued unless the applicable
permit fee has been paid.
   (C)   Work without a permit. Except as otherwise provided in §
95.31, a person who obstructs or excavates in the right-of-way before obtaining
a permit must pay double the normal fee for the permit.
   (D)   Non-refundable. Permit fees are not refundable.

(Ord. 17-13, passed 11-27-2017)
§ 95.26 RIGHT-OF-WAY PATCHING AND RESTORATION.
   (A)   Timing. The work to be done under the excavation permit, and the
patching and restoration of the right-of-way as required herein, must be
completed within the dates specified in the permit, increased by as many days
as work could not be done because of circumstances beyond the control of the
permittee or when work was prohibited as unseasonal or unreasonable under §
95.27(D).
   (B)   Patch and restoration. Permittee shall patch its own work. The city
may choose either to have the permittee restore the right-of-way or to restore
the right-of-way itself.
      (1)   City restoration. If the city restores the right-of-way, permittee
shall pay the costs thereof within 30 days of billing. If, following such
restoration, the pavement settles due to permittee’s improper backfilling, the
permittee shall pay to the city, within 30 days of billing, all costs
associated with correcting the defective work.
      (2)   Permittee restoration. If the permittee restores the right-of-way
itself, it shall at the time of application for an excavation permit post a
construction performance bond in accordance with the provisions of Minn. Rule
7819.3000.
      (3)   Degradation fee in lieu of restoration. In lieu of right-of-way
restoration, a right-of-way user may elect to pay a degradation fee. However,
the right-of-way user shall remain responsible for patching and the degradation
fee shall not include the cost to accomplish these responsibilities.
   (C)   Standards. All restoration must be in accordance with the written
standards and materials specified by the city, which must comply with state
standards. Subject to state rules, the city may prescribe additional
restoration procedures and standards on a case-by-case basis based on the
following considerations:
      (1)   The number, size, depth and duration of the excavation, disruption
or damage to the public right-of-way;
      (2)   The traffic volume carried by the public right-of-way;
      (3)   The character of the neighborhood surrounding the public right-of-
way;
      (4)   The pre-project condition of the public right-of-way;
      (5)   The remaining life expectancy of the public right-of-way due to the
project;
      (6)   The costs of the restoration method in relation to the prevention
of an accelerated depreciation of the public right-of-way that could result due
to the project work in the public right-of-way; and
      (7)   The likelihood that the particular restoration method would be
effective in slowing the depreciation of the public right-of-way that would
otherwise occur.
   (D)   Duty to correct defects. The permittee shall correct defects in
patching or restoration performed by permittee or its agents. The permittee
upon notification from the city shall correct all restoration work to the
extent necessary, using the method required by the city. Said work shall be
completed within five calendar days of the receipt to the notice from the city,
not including days during which work cannot be done because of circumstances
constituting force majeure or days when work is prohibited as unseasonable or
unreasonable under §
95.27(D).
   (E)   Failure to restore. If the permittee fails to restore the right-of-way
in the manner and to the condition required by the city, or fails to
satisfactorily and timely complete all restoration required by the city, the
city at its option may do such work. In that event the permittee shall pay to
the city, within 30 days of billing, the cost of restoring the right-of-way. If
permittee fails to pay as required, the city may exercise its rights under the
construction performance bond.
(Ord. 17-13, passed 11-27-2017)
§ 95.27 OTHER OBLIGATIONS.
   (A)   Limitation on area. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the area
right-of-way specified in the permit. No permittee may do any work outside the

      (1)   Make application for a permit extension and pay any additional fees
required thereby; and
      (2)   Be granted a new permit or permit extension.
   (B)   Limitations of dates. A right-of way permit is valid only for the
dates specified in the permit. No permittee may begin its work before the
permit start date or, except as provided herein, continue working after the end
date. If a permittee does not finish the work by the permit end date, it must
apply for a new permit for the additional time it needs, and receive the new
permit or an extension of the old permit before working after the end date of
the previous permit. This supplementary application must be submitted before
the permit end date.
   (C)   Compliance with other laws. Obtaining a right-of-way permit does not
relieve permittee of its duty to obtain all other necessary permits, licenses,
and authority and to pay all fees required by the city or other applicable
rule, law or regulation. A permittee shall comply with all requirements of
local, state and federal laws. A permittee shall perform all work in
conformance with all applicable codes and established rules and regulations,
and is responsible for all work done in the right-of-way pursuant to its
permit, regardless of who does the work.
   (D)   Seasonally prohibited work or unreasonable conditions. Except in an
emergency, and with the approval of the city, no right-of-way obstruction or
excavation may be done when seasonally prohibited or when conditions are
unreasonable for such work.

cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the life, health, safety
or well-being of the public.
      (2)   The Director may issue an order to the permittee for any work that
does not conform to the terms of the permit or other applicable standards,
conditions or codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the
violation will be cause for revocation of the permit. Within ten days after
issuance of the order, the permittee shall present proof to the Director that
the violation has been corrected. If such proof has not been presented within
the required time, the Director may revoke the permit pursuant to § 
95.32.
(Ord. 17-13, passed 11-27-2017)
§ 95.31 WORK DONE WITHOUT A PERMIT.
   (A)   Emergency situations. Each registrant shall immediately notify the
Director of any event regarding its facilities that it considers to be an
emergency. The registrant may proceed to take whatever actions are necessary to
respond to the emergency. Excavators’ notification to Gopher One Call regarding
an emergency situation does not fulfill this requirement. Within two business
days after the occurrence of the emergency, the registrant shall apply for the
necessary permits, pay the fees associated therewith, and fulfill the rest of
the requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with this subchapter
for the actions it took in response to the emergency.
   (B)   Emergency work by city. If the city becomes aware of an emergency
regarding a registrant’s facilities, the city will attempt to contact the local
representative of each registrant affected, or potentially affected, by the
emergency. In the event, the city may take whatever action it deems necessary
to respond to the emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the registrant
whose facilities occasioned the emergency.
   (C)   Non-emergency situations. Except in an emergency, any person who,
without first having obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or excavates a
right-of-way must subsequently obtain a permit and, as a penalty, pay double
the normal fee for said permit, pay double all the other fees required by the
code, deposit with the city the fees necessary to correct any damage to the
right-of-way, and comply with all the requirements of this subchapter.

violation is related to non-complying project work, the Director must notify
the permittee of the actions necessary to remedy the violation and the date by
which the correction must be completed, which must be a reasonable period of
time. The Director may impose additional or revised conditions on the permit to
mitigate or remedy the violation. If correction of the non-complying work is
not completed within the required time or if another basis for revocation
exists, the Director must provide written notice to the permittee of the basis
for revocation and the date of the revocation hearing under division (C) below.
The notice must be given to the permittee at least ten days before the date of
the revocation hearing.
   (C)   Hearing. A revocation hearing must be held on the date and location
specified in the notice, pursuant to City Code §

§ 95.34 MAPPING DATA.
   (A)   Information required. Each registrant and permittee must provide “as
built” mapping information in accordance with state rules and in a format
acceptable to the city, providing the following:
      (1)   The location of all of its underground and above ground facilities
and their appurtenances in the public right-of-way, identified by:
         (a)   Offsets from property lines, distances from the centerline of
the public right-of-way and from curb lines and other reference points as
requested by the city; or
         (b)   Coordinates derived from the coordinate system being used by the
city; and
         (c)   Approximate depth of facilities.
      (2)   The type, quantity and size of the facilities;
      (3)   A dimensional description of aboveground appurtenances;
      (4)   A legend explaining symbols, characters, abbreviations, scale and
other data shown on the map;
      (5)   The information in divisions (A)(1) through (A)(4) above also for
restoration work; and
      (6)   The information in divisions (A)(1) through (A)(4) above also for
abandoned facilities that remain in place.
   (B)   Submittal requirements.
      (1)   Within six months after the adoption of this subchapter, all public
right-of-way users that own or control facilities within public rights-of-way
within the city on that date must submit the detailed mapping including
restoration data in accordance with this section for all facilities located
within the public rights-of-way. Following initial mapping, all right-of-way
users must by April 1 of every year submit either:
         (a)   Detailed mapping for all new facilities and restoration located
within public rights-of-way in the city during the preceding calendar year; or
         (b)   Certification that no new facilities and restoration were

(Ord. 17-13, passed 11-27-2017)
§ 95.35 GENERAL PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Placement, location, and relocation of facilities must comply with the
Act, with other applicable law, and with Minn. Rules 7819.3100, 7819.5000, to
the extent the rules do not limit authority otherwise available to cities.
   (B)   Corridors.
      (1)   The city may assign a specific area within the right-of-way, or any
particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of facilities
that is or, pursuant to current technology, the city expects will someday be
located within the right-of-way. All excavation, obstruction, or other permits
issued by the city involving the installation or replacement of facilities
shall designate the proper corridor for the facilities at issue.
      (2)   Any registrant who has facilities in the right-of-way in a position
at variance with the corridors established by the city shall, no later than at
the time of the next reconstruction or excavation of the area where the
facilities are located, move the facilities to the assigned position within the
right-of-way, unless this requirement is waived by the city for good cause
shown, upon consideration of such factors as the remaining economic life of the
facilities, public safety, customer service needs and hardship to the
registrant.
   (C)   Limitation of space. To protect health, safety and welfare, or when
necessary to protect the right-of-way and its current use, the city shall have
the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional facilities
within the right-of-way. In making such decisions, the city shall strive to the
extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the right-
of-way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the public interest,
the public’s needs for the particular utility service, the condition of the
right-of-way, the time of year with respect to essential utilities, the
protection of existing facilities in the right-of-way and future city plans for
public improvements and development projects which have been determined to be
in the public interest.
   (D)   Damage to other facilities. When the city does work in the right-of-
way and finds it necessary to maintain, support or move a registrant’s
facilities to protect it, the city shall notify the local representative as
early as is reasonably possible. The costs associated therewith will be billed
to that registrant and must be paid within 30 days from the date of billing.
Each registrant shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any facilities
in the right-of-way which it or its facilities damage. Each registrant shall be
responsible for the cost of repairing any damage to the facilities of another
registrant caused during the city’s response to an emergency occasioned by that
registrant’s facilities.
   (E)   Nuisance. One year after the passage of this subchapter, any
facilities found in a right-of-way that have not been registered shall be
deemed to be a nuisance. The city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at
law or in equity, including, but not limited to, abating the nuisance or taking
possession of the facilities and restoring the right-of-way to a useable
condition.
   (F)   Pre-excavation facilities location. In addition to complying with the
requirements of Minn. Stat. §§ 216D.01 through 216D.09 (“One Call Excavation
Notice System”), as they may be amended from time to time, before the start
date of any right-of-way excavation, each registrant who has facilities or
equipment in the area to be excavated shall mark the horizontal and vertical
placement of all said facilities. Any registrant whose facilities are less than
20 inches below a concrete or asphalt surface shall notify and work closely
with the excavation contractor to establish the exact location of its
facilities and the best procedure for excavation.

facilities in the right-of-way must be located or relocated and maintained
underground in accordance with this section and applicable construction
standards.
   (C)   Undergrounding of permanent replacement, relocated or reconstructed
facilities. A permanent replacement, relocation or reconstruction of a facility
of more than 300 feet must be located, and maintained underground, with due
regard for seasonal working conditions. For purposes of this section,
RECONSTRUCTION means any substantial repair of or any improvement to existing
facilities. Undergrounding is required whether a replacement, relocation or
reconstruction is initiated by the right-of-way user owning or operating the
facilities, or by the city in connection with:
      (1)   The present or future use by the city or other local government
unit of the right-of-way for a public project;
      (2)   The public health or safety; or
      (3)   The safety and convenience of travel over the right-of-way.
   (D)   Exceptions to undergrounding. The following exceptions to the strict
application of this section will be allowed upon the conditions stated:
      (1)   Technical/economic feasibility; promotion of policy. Above-ground
installation, construction or placement of facilities will be allowed in
residential, commercial and industrial areas where the City Council finds that:
         (a)   Underground placement would place an undue financial burden upon
the landowner, ratepayers or right-of-way user or would deprive the landowner
of the preservation and enjoyment of substantial property rights;
         (b)   Underground placement is impractical or not technically feasible
due to topographical, subsoil or other existing conditions that adversely
affect underground facilities placement; or
         (c)   The right-of-way user clearly and convincingly demonstrates that
none of the purposes under §
95.35(A) would be advanced by underground placement of facilities on the
project in question, or the city determines on its own review that
undergrounding is not warranted based on the circumstances of the proposed
undergrounding.
      (2)   Temporary service. Above-ground installation, construction or
placement of temporary service lines will only be allowed:
         (a)   During new construction of any project for a period not to
exceed three months;
         (b)   During an emergency in order to safeguard lives or property
within the city; or
         (c)   For a period of not more than seven months when soil conditions
make excavation impractical.
      (3)   Developer responsibility. All owners, platters or developers are
responsible for complying with the requirements of this section, and before
final approval of any plat or development plan, must submit to the Director
written instruments from the appropriate right-of-way users showing that all
necessary arrangements for installation of such facilities have been made.
(Ord. 17-13, passed 11-27-2017)
§ 95.37 RIGHT-OF-WAY VACATION.
   (A)   Reservation of right. If the city vacates a public right-of-way that
contains the facilities of a public right-of-way user and the vacation does not
require the relocation of the facilities, the city must reserve, for itself and
the public right-of-way user, the right to install, maintain and operate
facilities in the vacated public right-of-way and to enter upon the public
right-of-way at any time for the purpose of reconstruction, inspecting,
maintaining or repairing the facilities.
   (B)   Relocation of facilities. If the local government unit vacates a
right-of-way that contains the facilities of a right-of-way user and the right-
of-way vacation requires the relocation of the right-of-way user’s facilities,
payment of the relocation costs must be determined as follows: (1) if the
vacation proceedings are initiated by the right-of-way user, the right-of-way
user must pay the relocation costs; (2) if the vacation proceedings are
initiated by the local government unit for a public project, the right-of-way
user must pay the relocation costs unless otherwise agreed to by the local
government unit and the right-of-way user; or (3) if the vacation proceedings
are initiated for the purpose of benefitting a person other than the right-of-
way user, the benefitted person must pay the relocation costs.
(Ord. 17-13, passed 11-27-2017)
§ 95.38 INDEMNIFICATION AND LIABILITY.
   (A)   Limitation of liability. Issuance of a public right-of-way permit does

   (A)   Declaration of policy. The health of the trees in the city is
threatened by shade tree pests, and the loss or ill health of trees growing
upon public and private property substantially depreciates the value of
property within the city and impairs the safety, good order, general welfare
and convenience of the public. In addition to and in accordance with Minn.
Stat. §§ 89.001, 89.01 and 89.51 through 89.64, as those sections may be
amended from time to time, the provisions of this section are adopted to
attempt to control and prevent the spread of these shade tree pests.
   (B)   Jurisdiction. The city shall have control of all street trees, shrubs
and other plantings now or hereafter in any street, park, public right-of-way
or easement, or other public place within the city limits, and shall have the
power to plant, care for, maintain, remove and replace such trees, shrubs and
other plantings.
   (C)   Declaration of a shade tree pest. The city may declare any vertebrate
or invertebrate animal, plant pathogen, or plant threatening to cause
significant damage to a shade tree or community forest in the community, to be
a shade tree pest and prescribe control measures to effectively eradicate,
control or manage the shade tree pest including necessary timelines for action.
   (D)   Public nuisances declared. A shade tree pest occurring within a
declared control zone is a public nuisance.
   (E)   Shade tree pest nuisances are unlawful. It is unlawful for any person
to permit any public nuisance as defined in this section to remain on any
premises the person owns or controls within the city. The nuisance may be
abated as provided in §
94.15.
   (F)   Definition of control areas. Upon declaring a shade tree pest, the
city may define one or more locations within the geographic boundaries of the
city to be within a shade tree pest control area, provided the locations are
characterized by biologic, composition, environmental and size factors
favorable to successful application of the control measures prescribed by the
city.
   (G)   Tree Inspector. The city may appoint a Tree Inspector. The Tree
Inspector will recommend to the Council the details of any program for the
declaration, control and prevention of shade tree pests. The Tree Inspector is
authorized to enforce or cause to be enforced the duties incident to such a
program adopted by the Council.
   (H)   Abatement of shade tree pest nuisances. In abating a nuisance declared
by ordinance under divisions (B) and (C) above, the organism, condition or
plant and any tree, wood or material identified as injurious to the health of

provides tree care, tree trimming or removal of trees, limbs, branches, brush
or shrubs for hire must be registered with the State Commissioner of
Agriculture under Minn. Stat. § 18G.07, as it may be amended from time to time.
   (K)   Inspection and application of control measures.
      (1)   The Tree Inspector is authorized to cause premises and places
within the city to be inspected to determine whether shade tree pests exist
thereon and to investigate all reported incidents of shade tree pests. The Tree
Inspector shall have the power to take all reasonable precautions to prevent
the maintenance of public nuisances and may enforce the provisions relating to
abatement in this section. Diagnosis of shade tree pests may be by the presence
of commonly recognized symptoms or by tests as may be recommended by the
Commissioner of the State Department of Agriculture or the Commissioner of the
State Department of Natural Resources.
      (2)   Except in situations of imminent danger to human life and safety,
the Tree Inspector shall not enter private property for the purpose of
inspecting or preventing maintenance of public nuisances without the permission
of the owner, resident or other person in control of the property, unless the
Tree Inspector has obtained a warrant or order from a court of competent
jurisdiction authorizing the entry.
      (3)   No person, firm or corporation shall interfere with the Tree
Inspector acting under his or her authority while engaged in activities
authorized by this section.
   (L)   Declared shade tree pests, control measures and control areas.
      (1)   Oak Wilt. Oak Wilt is declared a shade tree pest and is defined as
any living or dead tree, log, firewood, limb, branch, stump or other portion of
a tree from any species of the genus Quercus existing within the control area
defined that has bark attached and that exceeds three inches in diameter or ten
inches in circumference and contains to any degree any spore or reproductive
structures of the fungus Ceratocystis fagacaarum. Control measures prescribed
for abating Oak Wilt Disease are:
         (a)   Installation of a root graft barrier. A root graft barrier can
be ordered installed to prevent the underground spread of Oak Wilt Disease. The
city will mark the location of the root graft barrier. The barrier disrupts
transmission of the fungus within the shared vascular systems of root grafted
trees. The barrier is created by excavating or vibratory plowing a line at
least 42 inches deep between any oak tree infected with Oak Wilt Disease and
each nearby and apparently healthy oak tree within 50 feet of the infected
tree;
         (b)   Removal and disposal of trees on property zoned for residential
and commercial use. On property that is zoned residential and commercial, the
city may mark for removal trees that have the potential to produce spores of
the fungus Ceratocvstis fagacearum. After, and in no case before the
installation of the root graft barrier and no later than May 1 of the year
following infection all marked trees must be felled. The stump from such felled
trees must not extend more than three inches above the ground or, if taller,
must be completely debarked. If, however, after the city prescribes the
location for a root graft barrier, the city determines that installation of the
barrier is impossible because of the presence of pavement or obstructions such
as a septic system or utility line, the city may mark for removal all oak trees
whether living or dead, infected or not and located between an infected tree
and the marked barrier location. These marked trees must be felled and disposed
of no later than May 1 of the year following infection. The stump from such
felled trees must not extend more than three inches above the ground or, if
taller, must be completely debarked;
         (c)   Removal and disposal of trees on all other property. On all
other property, the city may mark for removal all oak trees whether living or
dead, infected or not and located between an infected tree and the marked
barrier location. These marked trees must be felled and disposed of no later
than May 1 of the year following infection. The stump from such felled trees
must not extend more than three inches above the ground or, if taller, must be
completely debarked;
         (d)   Wood disposal. All wood more than three inches in diameter or
ten inches in circumference from such felled trees must be disposed of by
burying or debarking or chipping or sawing into wane free lumber or by
splitting into firewood, stacking the firewood and immediately covering the
woodpile with unbroken four mil or thicker plastic sheeting that is sealed into
the ground until October 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in
which the tree was felled or by burning before May 1 of the year following
infection. Wood chips from infected trees may be stockpiled or immediately used
in the landscape; and
         (e)   Control area. The CONTROL AREA for Oak Wilt Disease is defined
as all lands within the boundaries of the city.
      (2)   Emerald Ash Borer. Emerald Ash Borer is declared a shade tree pest
and is defined as an insect that attacks and kills ash trees. The adults are
small, iridescent green beetles that live outside of trees during the summer
months. The larvae are grub or worm like and live underneath the bark of ash
trees.
         (a)   Control measures prescribed for abating Emerald Ash Borer are
those provided in the document, Minnesota Emerald Ash Borer Science Advisory
Group Recommendations on Preparing for Emerald Ash Borer in Minnesota.
         (b)   Definition of control areas. The CONTROL AREA for Emerald Ash
Borer is defined as all lands within the boundaries of the city.
      (3)   Dutch elm disease. Dutch elm disease is declared a shade tree pest
and is defined as a disease of elm trees caused by the fungus Ophiostoma ulmi
or Ophiostoma novo ulmi, and includes any living or dead tree, log, firewood,
limb, branch, stump or other portion of a tree from any species of the genus
Ulmus existing within the control area defined that has bark attached and that
exceeds three inches in diameter or ten inches in circumference and could
contain bark beetles or any spore or reproductive structures of the fungus
Ophiostoma ulmi or Ophiostoma novo ulmi.
         (a)   Control measures prescribed for abating Dutch elm disease are:
            1.   Use of fungicide. Fungicides may be effective in preventing
Dutch elm disease when injected into living trees that do not already show
symptoms of Dutch elm disease. Fungicide injections on private lands are
optional and, if performed, are at the landowner’s expense.
            2.   Removal and disposal of trees. Prompt removal of diseased
trees or branches reduces breeding sites for elm bark beetles and eliminates
the source of Dutch elm disease fungus. Trees that wilt before July 15 must be
removed within 20 days of detection (alternative: 30 days). Trees that wilt
after July 15 must be removed by April 1 of the following year. Diseased trees
not promptly removed will be removed by the city at the landowner’s expense.
Wood may be retained for use as firewood or sawlogs if it is de barked or
covered from April 15 to October 15 with 4mm plastic. The edges of the cover
must be buried or scaled to the ground.
         (b)   The CONTROL AREA for Dutch elm disease is defined as all lands
within the boundaries of the city.

97.04   Renting real property; penalties
§ 97.01 FINDINGS AND INTENT.
   Repeat predatory offenders, predatory offenders who use physical violence,
and predatory offenders who prey on children and vulnerable individuals, are
predators who present a threat to the public safety. Predatory offenders are
likely to use physical violence or force and to repeat their offenses. Most
predatory offenders commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever
reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. Moreover,
predatory offenders often learn and evolve as they commit additional offenses,
thereby making detection of their unlawfulness more difficult for authorities.
This makes the cost of predatory offender victimization to society at large,
while incalculable, clearly exorbitant.
   (B)   It is the intent of this chapter to serve the city’s compelling
interest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety and welfare of the
citizens of the city by creating areas around locations where children
regularly congregate wherein certain predatory offenders are prohibited from
establishing a primary or secondary address.
(Ord. 16-13, passed 12-12-2016; Ord. 18-08, passed 3-12-2018)
§ 97.02 DEFINITIONS.
   The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall

      (1)   Is required to register as a predatory offender under M.S. §
243.166;
      (2)   Is assigned at Risk Level II or Risk Level III under M.S. § 244.052
(3); and
      (3)   Has been convicted of a designated sexual offense, regardless of
whether the adjudication has been withheld.
   DESIGNATED SEXUAL OFFENSE. A conviction, commitment under M.S. Ch. 253B, or
admission of guilt under oath without adjudication involving any of the
following offenses: M.S. § 609.342, Subd. 1(a), (b), (g), (h), M.S. § 609.343,
Subd. 1(a), (b), (g), (h), M.S. § 609.344, Subd. 1(a), (b), (e), (f), (g), M.S.

2(1), 3(1), M.S. § 617.246, Subd. 2 successor statutes, or a similar offense
from another state.
   PRIMARY ADDRESS. The mailing address of the person's dwelling. If the
mailing address is different from the actual location of the dwelling, primary
address also includes the physical location of the dwelling described with as
much specificity as possible.
   SECONDARY ADDRESS. The mailing address of any place where the person
regularly or occasionally stays overnight when not staying at the person’s
primary address. If the mailing address is different from the actual location

place described with as much specificity as possible. However, the location of
a supervised publicly or privately-operated shelter or facility designated to
provide temporary living accommodations for homeless individuals as defined in
M.S. § 116L.361, subd. 5, does not constitute a secondary address.
(Ord. 16-13, passed 12-12-2016; Ord. 18-08, passed 3-12-2018)
§ 97.03 RESIDENCE PROHIBITION; PENALTIES; EXCEPTIONS.

            1.   If a business has an existing license for the licensed
activity and the license expires, then the City Clerk shall provide the owner
with 20 days’ calendar notice to cease and desist the activity (“cease and
desist notice”). If no completed application is received by the City Clerk
prior to the expiration of the date given in the cease and desist notice, then
the city shall post a cease and desist order for the activity for which a
license is required.
            2.   If a new business is conducting an activity for which a
license is required or an existing business is conducting a new activity for
which a license is required and no license has been approved, then the city may
immediately and without notice, post a cease and desist order for the activity
for which a license is required.
      (2)   Any business that continues to conduct an activity for which a
license is required without an approved license shall be in violation of this

30.05(C). If the applicant simultaneously submits an application for more than

investigation, the applicant must provide written authorization to the city to
investigate all facts set out in the application and to do a personal and

investigation shall be conducted as part of a personal background
investigation. The information obtained from the investigation shall be used to

should be granted a license. The recommendation may be based on any of the
following criteria:

license is sought;
            2.   Whether there is a material misrepresentation in the
application; and

         (b)   Investigation fee. All applicants that must undergo a background
investigation must pay an investigation fee with the license application.
Separate fees shall be charged for personal background investigations and
business background investigations. The City Council establishes the
investigation fees by City Council resolution. If an applicant applies for an
additional license within a calendar year, then the applicant shall only be
required to pay the renewal fee.
      (6)   Insurance coverage. The applicant must file with the City Clerk a
certificate of insurance from an insurance company duly licensed and qualified
to do business in the state, on a form approved by the city.
         (a)   Coverage requirements. The insurance policy certified must
provide coverages and amounts as required by the city.
         (b)   Coverage changes and cancellation. The applicant may not cancel
or change the insurance without 30 days’ prior written notice to the City Clerk
by certified mail. The certification of insurance must be continuously in
effect until 30 days after receipt of the written notice of cancellation or

   (A)   General provisions.
      (1)   License required. A person may not place or maintain a courtesy

§ 111.04 MASSAGE THERAPY.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this article of the city code is to prohibit
massage businesses and services to the public except those licensed as
therapeutic massage businesses and massage therapists pursuant to this section.
The licensing regulations prescribed herein are necessary in order to protect
businesses that are operating legitimate businesses, to prevent criminal
activity and to protect the health and welfare of the community. The purpose of
this section is not to impose restrictions or limitations on the freedom of
protected speech or expression.
   (B)   Findings of the City Council. The City Council makes the following
findings regarding the need to license therapeutic massage businesses and
therapists and to prohibit all other types of massage businesses and services
to the public:
      (1)   Persons who have bona fide and standardized training in therapeutic
massage, health, and hygiene can provide a legitimate and necessary service to
the general public.
      (2)   Health and sanitation regulations governing therapeutic massage
businesses and therapists can minimize the risk of the spread of communicable
diseases and can promote overall health and sanitation.
      (3)   Limiting the number of therapeutic massage business licenses and
license qualifications for the restrictions on therapeutic massage businesses
and therapists can minimize the risk that such businesses and persons will
facilitate prostitution and other criminal activity in the community.
      (4)   Massage services provided by persons with no specialized and
standardized training in massage can endanger citizens by facilitating the
spread of communicable diseases, by exposing citizens to unhealthy and
unsanitary conditions, and by increasing the risk of personal injury.
      (5)   Massage businesses which employ persons with no specialized and
standardized training can tax law enforcement services because such businesses
are more likely to be operated as fronts for prostitution and other criminal
activity than operations established by persons with standardized training.
      (6)   The training of professional massage therapists at accredited
institutions is an important means of ensuring the fullest measure of
protecting the public health, safety, and welfare.
   (C)   Definitions. The following words and terms when used in this section
shall have the following meanings unless the context clearly indicates
otherwise:
      ACCREDITED INSTITUTION. An educational institution holding accredited
status with the United States Department of Education or Minnesota Office of
Higher Education.
      ACCREDITED PROGRAM. A professional massage program accredited by the

(Ord. 20-004, passed 3-23-2020)
§ 111.07 PAWNBROKERS AND PRECIOUS METAL DEALERS.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   The City Council finds that pawnbrokers and precious metal dealers
potentially provide an opportunity for the commission of crimes and their
concealment because these businesses have the ability to receive and transfer
stolen property quickly and easily. The City Council also finds that consumer
protection regulation is warranted in transactions involving pawnbrokers and
precious metal dealers. The City Council further finds that the pawnbroker and
precious metal industries have outgrown the city’s current ability to
effectively or efficiently identify criminal activity related to pawnshops and
precious metal dealers. The purpose of this section is to prevent pawnbroker
and precious metal businesses from being used as facilities for the disposition
of illegally-obtained property, to aid in the identification of individuals
involved in criminal activities through the timely collection and sharing of
transaction information, and to ensure that the businesses comply with basic
consumer protection standards, thereby protecting the public health, safety and
general welfare of the citizens of the city.
      (2)   To help the Police Department better regulate current and future
pawnbroker and precious metal businesses, decrease and stabilize costs
associated with the regulation of the pawnbroker and precious metal industries,
and increase identification of criminal activities in the pawnbroker and
precious metal industries through the timely collection and sharing of
pawnbroker and precious metal transaction information, this section also
implements and establishes the required use of an automated pawn system (APS),
as approved by the Police Department.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.

pawning or selling the item to include an identifiable close up of that

transaction receipts:
            “Any personal property pledged to a pawnbroker within this state is
subject to sale or disposal when there has been no payment made on the account
for a period of not less than 60 days past the date of the pawn transaction,
renewal or extension; no further notice is necessary. There is no obligation
for the pledger to redeem pledged goods. The pledger of this item attests that
it is not stolen, that it has no liens or encumbrances against it, and the
pledger has the right to sell or pawn the item. This item is redeemable only by
the pledger to whom the receipt was issued, or any person identified in a
written and notarized authorization to redeem the property identified in the
receipt, or a person identified in writing by the pledger at the time of the
initial transaction and signed by the pledger. Written authorization for
release of property to persons other than the original pledger must be
maintained along with the original transaction record.”
      (10)   Disposition of pawned articles.
         (a)   When any article is sold or disposed of by the licensee, the
records shall contain the article sold with the date, the amount for which the
article was sold, interest and charges accrued, and identification of the
person to whom sold.
         (b)   For renewals, extensions and redemptions, the licensee shall
provide the original transaction identifier, the date of the current
transaction, and the type of transaction.
      (11)   Daily reports to Police Department using APS. All required
transaction record data must be transmitted electronically to the State Police
Department at the close of each business day using APS. If the licensee is
unable to report using APS due to technology failures or interruptions, then
all required records, including printed copies of all reportable transactions
along with the required photographs or video tape for that day, must be
maintained at the licensed premises and be made immediately available for
inspection upon request by a police officer. If the electronic transmission
failure is determined to be in the licensee’s system, the licensee must take
all reasonable steps including the replacement of its computer system and
related components in order to return the electronic reporting system to
working condition as soon as possible. If the nonfunctioning system or repair
will require more than ten days to return the system to a working condition,
the licensee must notify the Police Department. Failure by the licensee to
correct a problem with its computer or other systems causing the licensee’s
inability to electronically transmit required transaction data to APS or
failing to notify the Police Department of the malfunction within ten days is a
violation of this section. Regardless of the origin of the technical problems
that prevented the licensee from transmitting the required reports
electronically, upon correction of the problem, the licensee must
electronically transmit every reportable transaction to APS from each business
day that the problem existed.
      (12)   Monthly transaction fee. In addition to the annual license fee, a
licensee must pay a monthly transaction fee based on the actual number of
billable transactions conducted by the licensee at the rate established in the
fee schedule.
      (13)   Inspection of records. The records referred to in this section
shall be open to the inspection of the Police Department at all reasonable
times and shall be retained by the licensee on the licensed premises for at
least four years, except the video records, which must be retained for 90 days.
      (14)   Inspection of premises and items. At all times during the terms of
the license, the licensee must allow law enforcement officials to enter the
premises where the licensed business is located during normal business hours,
except in an emergency, for the purpose of inspecting the premises and
inspecting the items, merchandise and records to verify compliance with this
section or other applicable laws.
      (15)   Holding period for pawnbrokers.
         (a)   Pawned items. A person pledging, pawning or depositing an item
for security must have a minimum of 60 days from the date of that transaction
to redeem the item before it may be forfeited and sold, or in the case of
precious metal, traded, melted down or dismantled. During the 60 days following
the date of the pawn, pledged items may not be sold or otherwise removed from
the licensed location, unless it is redeemed by the person who pawned or
pledged the items.
         (b)   Purchased items. Any item purchased or accepted in trade by the
licensee must not be sold or otherwise removed from the premises for 30 days
from the date of the transaction, except gold and silver coins, as noted below.
      (16)   Holding period for precious metal dealers.
         (a)   General rule. Every precious metal dealer shall hold the
following items for a period of 14 days from the time of the transaction:
            1.   Coins that are purchased because of their numismatic or
antique value, (i.e., rare coin collection); and
            2.   All other secondhand items containing precious metal purchased
by the precious metal dealer.
         (b)   Exception. Gold and silver coins that are purchased with the
intent to refine (melt) or sell them to a refiner because of their precious
metal value, are not subject to the 14-day holding period requirement. During
the holding period, items shall not be removed from the licensed premises or
altered from their original state.
      (17)   Release of property. Pawnbroker licensees are prohibited from
redeeming any pawned item to anyone other than to:
         (a)   The person to whom the receipt was issued;
         (b)   Any person identified in a written and notarized authorization
to redeem the property; or
         (c)   Any person identified in writing by the pledger at the time of
the initial transaction and signed by the pledger.
      (18)   Pawning of motor vehicle titles. In addition to the other
requirements of this section, a pawnbroker who holds a title to a motor vehicle
as part of a pawn transaction must:
         (a)   Be licensed as a used motor vehicle dealer under Minn. Stat. §
168.27, as it may be amended from time to time, and post the license on the
pawnshop premises;

vehicle with the State Department of Public Safety;
         (c)   Verify that the pledger has automobile insurance on the motor

      (19)   Police order to hold property.
         (a)   Investigative hold. Whenever a law enforcement official from any
agency notifies a licensee not to sell an item, the item must not be sold or
removed, from the premises or melted or dismantled. The investigative hold
shall be confirmed in writing by the originating agency within 96 hours and
will remain in effect for 15 days from the date of initial notification, until
the investigative order is canceled, or until an order to hold/confiscate is
issued, pursuant to this section.
         (b)   Order to hold. Whenever the Police Department notifies a
licensee not to sell an item, the item must not be sold or removed from the
licensed premises until authorized to be released by the Police Department. The
order to hold expires 90 days from the date it is placed, unless the Police
Department determines additional time is necessary and notifies the licensee in
writing to continue the hold.
         (c)   Order to confiscate. If an item is identified as stolen or
evidence in a criminal case, the Police Department may:
            1.   Physically confiscate and remove the item from the licensed
premises, pursuant to a written order from the Police Department; or
            2.   Place the item on hold or extend the hold pursuant to this
section, and leave it on the licensed premises. When an item is confiscated,
the person doing so shall provide identification upon request of the licensee,
and shall provide the licensee the name and phone number of the confiscating
agency and investigator, and the case number related to the confiscation. The
Police Department shall provide the licensee with a property receipt for the
item confiscated.
         (d)   Notification of release. When an order to hold/confiscate is no
longer necessary, the Police Department will so notify the licensee.
   (G)   Prohibited acts.

(Ord. 20-005, passed 3-23-2020)
§ 111.08 SEXUALLY-ORIENTED BUSINESSES.
   (A)   Purpose, findings and conclusions.
      (1)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide the opportunity
for operation and establishment of sexually-oriented establishments while
providing controls that limit negative impacts of sexually-oriented
establishments on residential and commercial areas, and protect the general
health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city.
      (2)   Findings of the City Council. The City Council makes the following
findings regarding the effect that sexually-oriented establishments have on the
character of the city’s neighborhoods. In making these findings, the City
Council accepts the recommendations of a staff committee that has studied the
experiences of other cities across the country where sexually-oriented
establishments have located.
         (a)   The nature of sexually-oriented establishments is such that they
are recognized as having adverse secondary characteristics, particularly when
they are accessible to minors and located near residential property or related
residential uses such as schools, day care centers, libraries or parks.
         (b)   The concentration of sexually-oriented establishments has an
adverse effect upon the use and enjoyment of adjacent areas.
         (c)   The nature of sexually-oriented establishments requires that
they not be allowed within certain zoning districts and that they are subject
to special licensing provisions.
         (d)   Special regulation of sexually-oriented establishments is
necessary to ensure that their adverse secondary effects will not contribute to
or enhance criminal activity in the area of those uses, nor will they
contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the surrounding property and
lessening of its value.
      (3)   Conclusions of the City Council. In order to minimize any harmful
effects that sexually- oriented establishments may cause on adjacent properties
and to protect the health, safety and welfare of its citizens, the City Council
adopts the following regulations and restrictions, recognizing that it has a
great interest in the present and future character of the city’s residential
and commercial neighborhoods. Adoption of these regulations is not intended to
unreasonably restrict the opportunity of sexually-oriented establishments to
locate in the city.
      (4)   Consistency with Minn. Stat. § 617.242, as it may be amended from
time to time. This section is to be read in conjunction with Minn. Stat. §
617.242, as it may be amended from time to time, which regulates adult
entertainment establishments. To the extent that Minn. Stat. § 617.242, as it
may be amended from time to time, applies to portions or facets of the business
that are not regulated by this section, the statute shall apply. To the extent
that the provisions or regulations of the statute and this section are
inconsistent, the more restrictive provision or regulation shall apply.
   (B)   Licenses. All establishments, operating or intending to operate a
sexually-oriented establishment, as defined in §
153.457, must apply for and obtain a license pursuant to
Chapter 110. The license application must be submitted to the City Council at
least 60 days before the licensee desires to begin operation of the business.
      (1)   Applications. In addition to the application requirements of §
110.03, the application must contain the following:
         (a)   A sketch or diagram showing the configuration of the premises,

         (c)   The names, addresses, phone numbers and dates of birth of the

         (d)   The names and addresses of all creditors of the applicant,
owner, lessee or manager regarding credit that has been extended for the
purposes of constructing, equipping, maintaining, operating, furnishing or
acquiring the premises, personal effects, equipment or anything incident to the
establishment, maintenance and operation of the business; or
         (e)   Complete and accurate documentation establishing the interest of
the applicant and any other person who has an interest in the premises upon
which the building is proposed to be located or the furnishings of it, personal
property or the operation or maintenance of it. Documentation must be in the
form of a lease, deed, contract for deed, mortgage deed, mortgage credit
arrangement, loan agreements, security agreements or any other documents
establishing the interest of the applicant or any other person in the
operation, acquisition or maintenance of the business.
      (2)   Investigations. An investigation is required pursuant to §
110.03(C)(5).
      (3)   Management. If there is a manager in charge of the sexually-
oriented establishment or if the named manager in charge of a licensed business
changes, the licensee must comply with §
110.09.
      (4)   Requalification. An applicant who has been convicted of an offense
enumerated in division (D)(2)(g) below may qualify for a sexually-oriented
establishment license only when the time period required by division (D)(2)(g)
below.
   (C)   Inspections. An inspection is required pursuant to §
110.11 prior to approval of the license.
   (D)   Denial, suspension and revocation of license.
      (1)   In addition to the grounds enumerated in §
110.12, the City Council may deny, suspend or revoke a license if a licensee or
an employee of the licensee has:
         (a)   Engaged in the use or sale of alcoholic beverages or controlled
substances while on the sexually-oriented establishment premises other than at
an adult hotel or motel;
         (b)   Permitted gambling by any person on the sexually-oriented
establishment premises;
         (c)   Demonstrated an inability to operate or manage a sexually-
oriented establishment in a peaceful and law abiding manner, thus necessitating
action by law enforcement officers;
         (d)   Allowed prostitution on the premises; or
         (e)   Allowed any act of sexual intercourse, sodomy, oral copulation
or masturbation to occur in or on the licensed premises. This division (D)(1)
shall not apply if the act occurred in an adult hotel or motel, unless the act
occurred in a public place or within public view.
      (2)   In addition to the grounds enumerated in §
110.12, the City Council shall deny an application if the applicant:
         (a)   Is overdue in a payment to the city, county or state for taxes,
fees, fines or penalties assessed against the applicant or imposed upon the
applicant in relation to a sexually-oriented establishment, or if the state
prohibits the issuance of such a license because of assessed taxes, fees, fines
or penalties;

established at the time the license is issued and maintained throughout the
existence of the license and all renewals of the license. The time for
establishing residency within the metropolitan area may, for good cause, be
extended by the licensing authority. For the purposes of this section, the
METROPOLITAN AREA means the seven county metropolitan area as defined by Minn.
Stat. § 473.121(2), as it may be amended from time to time.
         (f)   The premises to be used for the sexually-oriented establishment
have not been approved by the health official, Fire Department, Zoning
Administrator and the Building Official as being in compliance with applicable
laws and ordinances; or
         (g)   An applicant has been convicted of a crime involving or arising
from any of the following offenses within the past five years:
            1.   Any sex crimes as defined by Minn. Stat. §§ 609.293 through
609.352, as they may be amended from time to time, inclusive or as defined by
any ordinance or statute in conformity therewith;
            2.   Any crime in Minn. Stat. §§ 609.746 through 609.749, 609.79,
609.795, 518.01, 609.224, 609.2242, as they may be amended from time to time or
related statutes dealing with sexual assault, sexual conduct, harassment,
obscenity or domestic abuse or as defined by any ordinance or statute in
conformity therewith; or
            3.   Any obscenity crime as defined by Minn. Stat. §§ 617.23
through 617.299, as they may be amended from time to time inclusive, or as

      (1)   No license may be issued for any of the following locations: a
place of business that is currently licensed as a tattoo establishment,
pawnshop, massage therapy business, reflexology business, check cashing or

    Because the city recognizes that many persons under the age of 21 years may
purchase or otherwise obtain, possess and use tobacco, tobacco products,
tobacco-related devices, electronic delivery devices and nicotine or lobelia
delivery products; and the sale of these products to persons under 21 years of
age are violations of both state and federal laws; and because smoking has been
shown to be the cause of several severe health problems which subsequently
place a financial burden on all levels of government, this chapter is intended
to regulate the sale, possession and use of tobacco, tobacco products, tobacco-
related devices, electronic delivery devices and nicotine or lobelia delivery
products for the purpose of enforcing and furthering existing laws, to protect
persons under 21 against the serious effects associated with the illegal use of
tobacco, tobacco products, tobacco-related devices, electronic delivery devices

policy of the state to prevent young people from starting to smoke as stated in

   Because the city recognizes that persons under the age of 21 years may have
opportunities to purchase or otherwise obtain, possess and use lower-potency
hemp edibles; and the sale of these products to persons under 21 years of age
are violations of state and federal laws; and because the use of lower-potency
hemp edibles by those underage subsequently places a financial burden on all
levels of government, this chapter is intended to regulate the sale of lower-
potency hemp edibles for the purpose of enforcing and furthering existing laws.
Additionally, the legislature legalized adult use cannabis, as well as lower-
potency hemp edibles, and specifically allowed local jurisdictions to adopt
reasonable time, place and manner regulations. Similar to the retail sale of
adult use cannabis, having a limit on the number of businesses operating a
business that is primarily dedicated to the retail sale of intoxicating hemp
edibles and which state law regulates with respect to minors further public
health, welfare and safety.

   (F)   Non-transferability. Other than state-approved transfers of ownership
required by Minn. Stat. § 342.12, as it may be amended from time to time, a
registration is non-transferable. All registrations issued under this section
are valid only on the premises for which the registration was issued. The
transfer of any registration to another location is prohibited. If there is a
change in the ownership of the license holder pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 342.12,
as it may be amended from time to time, the license holder must notify the city
of the change, along with submitting a copy of the newly transferred state-
issued license so that the city can update the registration.
   (G)   Instructional program. No person shall be issued a registration or
renewal registration to sell registered products unless an applicant has a
program for instructing all employees regarding the legal requirements
pertaining to the sale of registered products at the retail establishment for
which the registration was issued. The instructional program shall include, but
is not limited to, reviewing the law on the sale of registered products,
requiring employees to request identification from every customer who is under
27 years of age, providing information that the sale of registered products to
anyone under 21 is illegal, explaining what kind of proof of age is legally
acceptable, and that a sale to a person below the legal sales age can subject
the applicant and its employees to criminal and/or civil liability.
   (H)   Age verification device and digital security video. All registration
holders shall be required to install or possess age verification devices and
digital security video at the registered location. The Police Department shall
confirm that the devices have been installed prior to approval of the
registration.
   (I)   Moveable place of business. No registration shall be issued to a
movable place of business. Only fixed retail establishment locations shall be
eligible to be registered under this section.
   (J)   Secure display of lower-potency hemp edibles. All lower-potency hemp
edibles and devices shall either be stored behind a counter or other area not
freely accessible to customers, or in a case or other storage unit not left
open and accessible to the general public. This requirement does not apply to
specialty lower-potency hemp edible retailers, who must prohibit access to
anyone under the age of 21.
   (K)   Signage. Notice of the legal sales age and age verification
requirements must be posted at each location where registered products are
offered for sale. The required signage, which shall be provided to the
applicant by the city, must be posted in a manner that is clearly visible to
anyone who is or is considering making a purchase. On-site signs advertising
the business must comply with the city’s sign code.
   (L)   Code compliance. No registration shall be granted until all applicable
zoning requirements are met or until all conditions for approval of the use
have been satisfied. Upon notification of an application for a license from the
OCM, the city shall respond to the OCM within 30 days regarding whether the
application or the location listed in the application violates city code, Fire
Code, city registration requirements or zoning requirements.
   (M)   Limit on specialty lower-potency hemp edible retailers. No more than
two specialty lower-potency hemp edible retailer registrations shall be
available to be issued to businesses meeting the definition of specialty lower-
potency hemp edible retailer at any one time.
   (N)   First come, first served. Special lower-potency hemp edible retailers
registered with the city as of the effective date of this chapter, shall have
priority for renewal as long as those retailers file timely complete
applications and continue to comply with state law and local ordinances,
including State Building Code, Fire Code and city Zoning Code. If either or
both of the two specialty lower-potency hemp edible retailer registrations
become available, applications for new specialty lower-potency hemp edible
retailer registrations will be processed on a first-come, first-served basis
based on the city receiving a complete application and payment of all fees.
Applications will be considered complete when all materials required herein are
received by the city and include all required information.
   (O)   Exceptions. No registration shall be required for the following:
      (1)   Medical marijuana distribution facilities approved by the state
that are not a medical cannabis combination business.
      (2)   The sale of non-intoxicating hemp-derived consumer products or
hemp-derived topical products, which may be sold in any business establishment
in the B-2, B-3, or B-4 Zoning Districts.
      (3)   Hours of operation. Special lower-potency hemp edible retailers
hours are limited to the same hours of operation as liquor stores in the city.
On-site specialty lower-potency hemp edible retailers, who also have an on-sale
liquor license pursuant to Minn. Stat. Chapter 340A, as it may be amended from
time to time, may have hours consistent with the hours open as part of the on-
sale liquor licensure.
   (P)   Basis for recommendation to OCM of denial of state license or city’s
denial of a registration. Upon notice of receipt of application of license from
OCM related to lower-potency edible products, any of the following reasons are
grounds for recommending denial of licensing to the OCM or denying registration
with the city, unless otherwise required by law:
      (1)   The proposed use does not comply with the Zoning Ordinance (
Chapter 153).
      (2)   The proposed use does not comply with city registration
requirements or with health, building, maintenance or other provisions of the
city code or state law.
      (3)   The applicant has failed to pay all of the appropriate fees related
to the registration.
      (4)   The applicant is under the age of 21 years.
      (5)   The applicant has made fraudulent statements, misrepresentations,
not fully disclosed information or made false statements in the application or
investigation for or in the course of the applicant’s business.
      (6)   The applicant is applying for a location in an area that is
prohibited for such use by state law or the city Zoning Code or where the
property line is within 1,000 feet of a school.
      (7)   The applicant’s application, if granted, would result in more than
the number of specialty lower-potency hemp edible retailers than allowed by
city code, specifically in this chapter, at which time applicant may choose to
seek a lower-potency hemp edible retailer registration but must meet the
requirements of a lower-potency hemp edible retailer. The city shall
immediately notify the lower-potency hemp edible retailer in writing the
grounds for the suspension and notify the OCM.
   (Q)   Basis for suspension of registration. A registration may be suspended
if it does not comply with the Zoning Ordinance (
Chapter 153); is in an area prohibited for the use by state law or city zoning,
including within 1,000 feet of a school; does not comply with health, building,
maintenance or other provisions of the city code or state law; poses an
immediate threat to the health or safety of the public; operates illegally
under state law or city code; sells to customers under the age of 21 years;
sells or offers for sale products not complying with labeling or packaging
requirements set forth in state law or sells or offers to sell products outside
scope of state license. The city shall immediately notify the lower-potency
hemp edible retailer in writing the grounds for the suspension and notify the
OCM.
   (R)   Renewals. Once the OCM starts licensing and then annually thereafter,
the city shall renew an annual registration of a state-licensed lower-potency
hemp edible retailer that otherwise meets city code and other criteria set
forth herein, at the same time OCM renews the state license. A state-licensed
lower- potency hemp edible retailer shall apply to renew registration on a form
established by the city. Any renewal retail registration fee imposed by the
city shall be charged at the time of the second renewal and each subsequent
renewal thereafter. A renewal retail registration fee shall be set forth in the
city fee schedule and shall comply with state law.

§ 115.01 PURPOSE.
   Minn. Stat. Chapter 342, as it may be amended from time to time, authorizes
cities to protect the public health, safety and welfare of its residents by
regulating cannabis retail businesses within the city. Additionally, because
the city recognizes that persons under the age of 21 years may have
opportunities to purchase or otherwise obtain, possess and use adult-use
cannabis products; and the sale of these products to persons under 21 years of
age are violations of state and federal laws; and because the use of cannabis
by those underage subsequently places a financial burden on all levels of
government, this chapter is intended to regulate the sale of cannabis for the
purpose of enforcing and furthering existing laws.

time, within 30 days of receiving a copy of a state license application from
OCM, the city shall certify on a form provided by OCM whether a proposed
cannabis retail business complies with local zoning ordinances, local
registration requirements and, if applicable, with the State Fire Code and

   (B)   Pre-license certification of cannabis retail businesses.
      (1)   The City Manager or their designee is authorized to certify whether

Stat. § 342.13, as it may be amended from time to time.
      (2)   Potential licensees are responsible for making all necessary zoning
applications and requesting and scheduling any inspections related to the
Building and Fire Code. Potential licensees may contact the city to have
inspections conducted prior to the city receiving the request for certification
from the OCM. Building and Fire Code inspections will be valid for one year
from completion. If a potential licensee is not able to obtain necessary zoning
approvals or have any Building or Fire Code inspection complete within the 30
days allowed for city approval under the statute, the city will not certify the
application.
   (C)   All registered cannabis business retail establishments shall be open

   (C)   Registration fee. For cannabis retail business registrations, the
applicant shall submit the registration fee pursuant to city fee schedule and
consistent with Minn. Stat. § 342.11, as it may be amended from time to time.
The city shall not charge an application fee. A medical combination business
operating an adult-use cannabis retail business location may only be charged a
single registration fee. The initial registration fee shall include the initial
retail registration fee and the first annual renewal fee. The registration fee
is non-refundable once processed. For cannabis businesses as that term is
defined herein and in state law, other than cannabis retail businesses or those
cannabis businesses with a retail endorsement, no registration fee is required
but those businesses still must comply with state law, city code, including
applicable Building and Fire Code, and city Zoning Code.
   (D)   Registration term. The term of an adult-use cannabis retail business
registration shall be for the same term as the OCM-approved term. Registration
fees will not be prorated.
   (E)   Non-transferability. Other than state-approved transfers of ownership
required by Minn. Stat. § 342.12, as it may be amended from time to time, a
registration is non-transferable. All registrations issued under this section
are valid only on the premises for which the registration was issued. The
transfer of any registration to another location is prohibited. If there is a
change in the ownership of the license holder pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 342.12,
as it may be amended from time to time, the license holder must notify the city
of the change, along with submitting a copy of the newly transferred state-
issued license so that the city can update the registration.
   (F)   Instructional program for cannabis retail businesses. No person shall
be issued a registration or renewal registration as a cannabis retail business
unless an applicant has a program for instructing all employees regarding the
legal requirements pertaining to the sale of registered products at the retail
establishment for which the registration was issued. The instructional program
shall include, but is not limited to, reviewing the law on the sale of
registered products, requiring employees to request identification from every
customer who is under 27 years of age, providing information that the sale of
registered products to anyone under 21 is illegal, explaining what kind of
proof of age is legally acceptable, and that a sale to a person below the legal
sales age can subject the applicant and its employees to criminal and/or civil
liability.
   (G)   Age verification device and digital security video at cannabis retail
businesses. All cannabis retail business registration holders shall be required
to install or possess age verification devices and digital security video at
the registered location. The Police Department shall confirm that the devices
have been installed prior to approval of the registration.
   (H)   Moveable place of business. No cannabis retail business registration
shall be issued to a movable place of business. Only fixed retail establishment
locations shall be eligible to be registered under this section.
   (I)   Signage. Notice of the legal sales age and age verification
requirements must be posted at each location where registered products are
offered for sale. The required signage, which shall be provided to the
applicant by the city, must be posted in a manner that is clearly visible to
anyone who is or is considering making a purchase. On-site signs advertising
the business must comply with the city’s sign code.
   (J)   Zoning and city code compliance.
      (1)   No registration shall be granted until all applicable code
requirements and zoning requirements are met or until all conditions for
approval of the use have been satisfied. Upon receipt of an application for a
license from the state, the city shall respond to the OCM within 30 days if the
application or the location listed in the application violates city code,
including Building or Fire Code, or zoning requirements.
      (2)   Hours of operation. Cannabis business retailers hours are limited
to the same hours of operation as liquor stores in the city.
   (K)   Limit on cannabis retail businesses. The city shall limit the number
of cannabis retail business to two at any one time, regardless of the varying
types of state retail licenses included in Minn. Stat. § 342.01, Subd.14, as it
may be amended from time to time. In the event that the OCM contacts the city
notifying it of an application for any type of license included in the
definition of cannabis businesses that intends to sell product at retail, and
the granting of the additional application would create more than two
registered cannabis business retailers in the city, the city shall respond to
the OCM within 30 days that the applicant does not comply with city code and
recommend denial by the OCM.
   (L)   First come, first served. Applications for registration will be
processed on a first-come, first-served basis based on the city receiving a
complete application and payment of all fees. Applications will be considered
complete when all materials and information required herein are received by the
city.
   (M)   Exceptions. No registration shall be required for the following:
      (1)   Medical cannabis combination businesses licensed by the state not
selling product at retail.
      (2)   Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the providing of adult-use
cannabis products or intoxicating hemp products to an individual as part of a
lawfully recognized religious, spiritual or cultural ceremony.
   (N)   Basis for recommendation of denial of license. 
      (1)   Upon notice of application of license from OCM related to a
cannabis retail business, any of the following reasons are grounds for
recommending denial of licensing to the OCM or denying registration, except as
may otherwise be provided by law:
         (a)   The proposed use does not comply with the Zoning Ordinance (
Chapter 153 of city code).
         (b)   The proposed use does not comply with health, building,
maintenance or other provisions of the city code, fire code or state law.
         (c)   The applicant has failed to pay all of the appropriate fees
related to the registration.
         (d)   The applicant is under the age of 21 years.
         (e)   The applicant has made fraudulent statements,
misrepresentations, not fully disclosed information or made false statements in
the application or investigation for or in the course of the applicant’s
business.
         (f)   The applicant is prohibited by federal, state or other local
law, ordinance or other regulation, from holding such a registration.
         (g)   The applicant is applying for a location in an area that is
prohibited for such use by state law or the city Zoning Code or where the
property line is within 1,000 feet of a school.
         (h)   The applicant’s application, if granted, would result in more
than the allowable number of cannabis business retailers or specialty lower-
potency hemp edible businesses under city code and specifically in this
chapter.
      (2)   The city shall immediately notify the retailer in writing the
grounds for its decision.
   (O)   Basis for suspension of registration.
      (1)   A registration may be suspended if:
         (a)   It does not comply with the Zoning Ordinance (
Chapter 153 of city code).
         (b)   It is in an area prohibited for the use by state law or city
zoning, including within 1,000 feet of property line of a school.
         (c)   It does not comply with health, building, maintenance or other
provisions of the city code, fire code or state law.
         (d)   It poses an immediate threat to the health or safety of the
public.
         (e)   It operates illegally under state law or city code or exceeds
the allowable number of retailers.
         (f)   It sells to customers under the age of 21 years.
         (g)   It sells or offers for sale products not complying with labeling
or packaging requirements set forth in state law or sells or offers to sell
products outside scope of state license.
      (2)   The city shall immediately notify the retailer in writing the
grounds for the suspension.
   (P)   Renewals. The city shall renew an annual registration of a state-
licensed cannabis retail business that otherwise meets city code and other
criteria set forth herein, at the same time OCM renews the state license. A
state-licensed cannabis retail business shall apply to renew registration on a
form established by the city. A cannabis business retail registration issued
under this chapter shall not be transferred. Any renewal retail registration
fee imposed by the city shall be charged at the time of the second renewal and
each subsequent renewal thereafter. A renewal retail registration fee shall not
exceed the limits set forth in Minn. Stat. § 342.11, as it may be amended from
time to time.

   (D)   No person under 21 may furnish, sell or attempt to sell registered
products on behalf of an applicant.
(Ord. 24-011, passed 11-25-2024)
§ 115.07 PROCESS REGISTRATION DENIAL, SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION.
   (A)   Grounds for denial, suspension or revocation. The city may deny or
suspend a registration for any of the reasons listed in § 115.06 above,

retailer a response to the complaint within seven calendar days and perform any
necessary inspections within 30 calendar days.
   (G)   Length of suspension. The continuation of consideration of an
application or renewal for registration or the suspension of a cannabis retail
business registration may be for up to 30 calendar days. If the OCM suspends
the business’s corresponding license for a longer period, then the city can
continue consideration of an application or renewal for registration or suspend
a cannabis business retailer registration for longer. The business may not make
sales to customers if their registration is suspended or not on active status
due to a continuation. With respect to suspensions, the city may reinstate a
registration if it determines that the violations have been resolved and it has

§ 133.07 SOCIAL HOST LIABILITY.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   The City Council intends to discourage underage possession and
consumption of alcohol, even if done within the confines of a private
residence, and intends to hold persons criminally responsible who host events
or gatherings where persons under 21 years of age possess or consume alcohol,
regardless of whether the person hosting the event or gathering supplied the
alcohol.
      (2)   The City Council finds that:
         (a)   Events and gatherings held on private or public property where
alcohol is possessed or consumed by persons under the age of 21 are harmful to
those persons and constitute a potential threat to public health, safety and
welfare requiring prevention or abatement;
         (b)   Prohibiting underage consumption acts to protect underage
persons, as well as the general public, from injuries related to alcohol
consumption, such as alcohol overdose or alcohol-related traffic collisions;
         (c)   Alcohol is an addictive drug which, if used irresponsibly, could
have drastic effects on those who use it as well as those who are affected by
the actions of an irresponsible user;
         (d)   Often, events or gatherings involving underage possession and
consumption occur outside the presence of parents. There are, however, times
when the parent(s) is/are present and, condone the activity, and in some
circumstances provide the alcohol;
         (e)   Even though giving or furnishing alcohol to an unrelated
underage person is a crime, it is difficult to prove, and an ordinance is
necessary to help further combat underage consumption; and
         (f)   A deterrent will be created by holding a person criminally
responsible for hosting an event or gathering where underage possession or
consumption of alcohol occurs.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      ALCOHOL. Ethyl alcohol, hydrated oxide of ethyl, or spirits of wine,
whiskey, rum, brandy, gin or any other distilled spirits including dilutions
and mixtures thereof from whatever source or by whatever process produced.

or gather together for a social occasion or other activity.

electric or communication utility in the exercise of its functions as a
utility, except as otherwise provided in this Code.
      (2)   Definition. As used in this section, REASONABLY SAFE TO PERSONS AND
PROPERTY, as applied to electrical installations and electrical equipment,
means safe to use in the service that the installation or equipment is intended
without unnecessary hazard to life, limb or property.
      (3)   Interpretation. For purposes of interpretation of this section, the
most recently published edition of the National Electrical Code will determine
the definitions, interpretations, scope of the work and terms used in this
section.
   (B)   Electrical Inspector; emergencies. In cases of emergency when
necessary for safety to persons and property, or when electrical equipment may
interfere with the work of the Fire Department, the Electrical Inspector has
the authority to disconnect or cause immediate disconnection of any electrical
equipment.
   (C)   Permits.
      (1)   Permit required. An electrical permit is required for each
installation, alteration or addition of electrical work for light, heat and
power in the city pursuant to §§
32.15 through
32.20.
      (2)   Exception. No permit will be required for electrical installations

issued.
      (2)   Compliance. Conformity of installations of electrical equipment
with applicable regulations in the current National Electrical Code, National
Electrical Safety Code or electrical provisions of other safety codes which
have been approved by the American Standards Association, will be evidence that
such installations are reasonably safe to persons and property, together with
such additions and exceptions contained in this section. Noncompliance with the
provisions of this section will be evidence that the installation is not
reasonably safe to persons and property.
      (3)   Moved buildings. Buildings or structures moved into the city must
conform to all of the requirements of this Code for new buildings or
structures.
      (4)   Existing buildings. Existing buildings or structures that have been

installation that a permit is required or that has been disconnected or ordered
to be disconnected by the Electrical Inspector. The public or private utility

Electrical Inspector, if the Inspector considers any electrical installation
unsafe to life and property or installed contrary to this section.

firm or corporation installing the electrical equipment must give the
Electrical Inspector due notice and inspections may be made periodically during
the progress of the work.
      (3)   Routine inspections and compliance. At regular intervals, the
Electrical Inspector will visit all premises where work may be done under

previous inspection. The Electrical Inspector may issue a certificate of
approval for the work if it is found to be in conformity with the provisions of
this section.

Electrical Inspector to be dangerous to persons or property because it is
defective or defectively installed, the person responsible for the electrical
equipment will be notified in writing of the defective conditions. The person
responsible must make any changes or repairs required in the judgment of the
Electrical Inspector to place such equipment in safe condition within 15 days
or any longer period that may be specified in the notice. If such work is not

resident of the state, the place of residence is unknown, the party is an

   (A)   If any building ordered razed, removed or made safe and sanitary by
repairs contains personal property or fixtures which will unreasonably
interfere with the razing, removal or repair of the building, or if the razing
or removal of the building makes necessary the removal of the personal property
or fixtures, the original order of the City Council may direct the removal of
the personal property or fixtures within a reasonable time.

the City Council subsequently desires to enforce a judgment under this

the order must be served upon the owner of record of the premises or the
owner’s agent, the taxpayer identified in the property tax records for that
parcel, the holder of the mortgage or sheriffs certificate, and any

that has requested notice by delivering or mailing a copy to the interested
persons at the last known address. Service by mail is complete upon mailing.
   (B)   Securing building by city; lien. If the owner of the building fails to
either comply or provide to the City Council a reasonable plan and schedule to
comply with an order issued under division (A) above within six days after the
order is served, the City Council may cause the building to be properly
secured, and the cost of securing the building may be charged against the real
estate pursuant to §
150.069.

requires immediate action to protect the public health and safety, the City
Manager may take any and all actions necessary to secure the building.

locks, repairing or boarding windows and doors, posting “no trespassing” signs,

152.03   Dedication required
   
152.04   Parks and Recreation Committee recommendation
   
152.05   Land dedication
   
152.06   Park dedication fee
   
152.07   Combination of park dedication fee and land dedication
§ 152.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   Minn. Stat. § 462.358(2)(b), as it may be amended from time to time,
provides that the city’s subdivision regulations may require that a reasonable
portion of any proposed subdivision be dedicated to the public or preserved for
conservation purposes or for public use and that the city may alternatively
accept an equivalent cash contribution.
   (B)   The City Council recognizes it is essential to the health, safety and
welfare of the residents of the city that the character and quality of the
environment be considered to be of major importance in the planning and
development of the city.
   (C)   In this regard, the manner in which land is developed or redeveloped
and used is a high priority.
   (D)   The preservation of land for park, playground and public open space
purposes as it relates to the use, development and redevelopment of land for
residential, commercial and industrial purposes is essential to maintaining a
healthful and desirable environment for all citizens of the city.
   (E)   The City Council wishes to provide these amenities for citizens today,
and be mindful of future citizens.
   (F)   The City Council finds that development and redevelopment of land for
residential, commercial and industrial purposes creates a need for park and
recreational land and facilities within the city.
   (G)   It is the intent and purpose of this chapter to provide for that need.
(2001 Code, § 1022.01)
§ 152.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   DEVELOPER. The person who applies for subdivision approval, who may be the
land owner or his or her representative.
   DEVELOPMENT. New construction on a vacant lot.
   PARK DEDICATION FEE. A cash contribution in lieu of a land dedication.
   REDEVELOPMENT. Reconstruction, alteration or remodeling of a building on
land from which the city has not previously received parkland dedication or
reconstruction, alteration or remodeling of a building on land for which the
platting application results in a change in the number of lots or an increase
in density.
(2001 Code, § 1022.03)
§ 152.03 DEDICATION REQUIRED.
   (A)   General rule. For all platting applications that involve development
or redevelopment, developers must dedicate land for parks, playground, public
open spaces and trails, and/or pay a park dedication fee.
      (1)   If the number of lots is decreased, then the land dedication or
park dedication fee applies to each new lot on which development or
redevelopment will occur.
      (2)   If the number of lots is increased, then the land dedication or
park dedication fee applies to each lot or lots on which the development or
redevelopment will occur.
      (3)   No land dedication or park dedication fee shall be applied to a lot
on which no development or redevelopment will occur.
   (B)   Exception. Previously platted land from which a park dedication has
been received that is being re-platted with the same number of lots is exempt
from park dedication requirements.
(2001 Code, § 1022.05)
§ 152.04 PARKS AND RECREATION COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION.
   Prior to final plat approval, the Parks and Recreation Committee must
recommend to the City Council the land and/or park dedication fee for the
proposed development or redevelopment.
(2001 Code, § 1022.07)
§ 152.05 LAND DEDICATION.
   (A)   Formula.
      (1)   For development or redevelopments when a land dedication is made,
the following formula will be used as a guideline to determine the appropriate
land dedication requirements.
      (2)   The city may deviate from the following percentages based on unique
circumstances associated with the site:
 
Type of Use Land Dedication Percentage
Commercial  8%
Industrial  8%
PUD         Percentage based on actual usage
Residential 8%
 
   (B)   Dedication of parkland outside of development. Developers may, with
approval of the City Council, dedicate the required parkland in property
outside the development or redevelopment and located within areas designated in
the city’s Parks Master Plan.
   (C)   Condition of parkland. The developer must rough grade the dedicated
parkland to city specifications.
   (D)   Change of parkland requirements. The City Council, upon consideration
of a particular type of development or redevelopment, may require larger or
smaller parcels of land to be conveyed to the city if the City Council
determines that the present or future residents would require larger or smaller
land for park and playground purposes.
   (E)   Suitability of parkland. Land must be reasonably suitable for its
intended use and must be at a location convenient to the people to be served
and consistent with the park and recreational purposes. Land with dead trees,
trash, junk, pollutants and unwanted structures is not acceptable unless the
developer first removes the unacceptable material. To be eligible for park
dedication, the land that is dedicated must be located outside of the drainage
ways, floodplains or ponding areas after the site has been developed or
redeveloped.
   (F)   Partial credit for private parkland. Where private open space for park
and recreation purposes is provided in a proposed development or redevelopment,
such areas may be used for partial credit, at the discretion of the City
Council, against the land or park dedication fee requirement for park and
recreational purposes, provided the City Council finds it is in the public
interest to do so.
(2001 Code, § 1022.09)
§ 152.06 PARK DEDICATION FEE.
   (A)   Alternative. As an alternative to the land dedication, the city may
require a park dedication fee. The developer shall pay the park dedication fee
before a building permit will be issued.
   (B)   Use of park dedication fees. The city shall use park dedication fees
only for acquisition and development or improvement of parks, recreational
facilities, playgrounds, trails, wetlands or open space based upon the approved
park systems plan. Park dedication fees shall not be used for ongoing operation
or maintenance of parks, recreational facilities, playgrounds, trails, wetlands
or open space. Park dedication fees will be separately accounted for in the
city’s Park Capital Fund and only used for the purposes enumerated.
   (C)   Calculation of park dedication fee. The park dedication fee shall be
based on a reasonable estimate of the fair market value of the land that is
being developed or redeveloped as determined by the County Assessor or other
relevant factors, and shall include the value added by existing utilities,
streets and other public improvements serving the property, but shall not
include the value added of all other existing improvements on the land. The
park dedication fee shall not exceed the amount stated in the fee schedule.
(2001 Code, § 1022.11)
§ 152.07 COMBINATION OF PARK DEDICATION FEE AND LAND DEDICATION.
   The city and developer may negotiate a combination of a park dedication fee,
land dedication and/or development of the land for park purposes to fulfill the
park dedication requirements of this chapter.

(Ord. passed 10-11-1963)
§ 153.027 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Purpose/standards.
      (1)   Authority. Pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 462.357(6), as it may be
amended from time to time, the Committee of Adjustments may grant a variance
from the terms of this chapter.
      (2)   Criteria for granting a variance. A variance may only be granted by
the Committee of Adjustments when:
         (a)   The variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent
of this chapter;
         (b)   The terms of the variance are consistent with the Comprehensive
Plan; and
         (c)   The applicant for the variance establishes that there are
practical difficulties in complying with this chapter.
      (3)   Definition of practical difficulties. PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES, as
used in connection with the granting of a variance, means that:
         (a)   The property owner proposes to utilize the property in a
reasonable manner;
         (b)   The plight of the property owner is due to circumstances unique
to the Property that were not created by the property owner; and
         (c)   The variance will not alter the essential character of the
neighborhood.
      (4)   Restrictions on granting variances. The following restrictions
shall be applied when considering granting a variance:
         (a)   Economic considerations alone do not constitute practical
difficulties; and
         (b)   The Committee of Adjustments may not permit as a variance any
use that is not allowed in this chapter for property in the district where the
affected person’s land is located (i.e., a use variance).
      (5)   Imposition of conditions. The Committee of Adjustments may impose
conditions when granting a variance, however, conditions imposed must be
directly related to and must bear a rough proportionality to the impact created
by the variance.
      (6)   Written findings. In granting a variance, the Committee of
Adjustments shall make written findings stating the grounds upon which the
variance is justified.
   (B)   Exhibits. In addition to the application, the following exhibits shall
be required:
      (1)   Map or plat as listed on the application;
      (2)   Plans and drawings showing the proposed variance; and
      (3)   Other documents as required by the Zoning Administrator.
   (C)   Public hearings. The Committee of Adjustments shall hold a public
hearing on all applications for a variance.
      (1)   Notice of the public hearing shall be given not less than ten days
nor more than 30 days prior to the date of the hearing by publication in the
designated legal newspaper of the city. The notice shall contain the date, time
and place of the hearing and a description of the land and the proposed
variance. At least ten days before the hearing, the City Clerk shall mail a
notice to the owner and to each of the property owners within 150 feet of the
property for which the variance is sought. Failure of the City Clerk to mail
the notice or failure of the property owners to receive the notice shall not
invalidate the proceedings.
      (2)   Action by Committee of Adjustments: the Committee of Adjustments
shall consider the application at the scheduled hearing.
         (a)   Within 60 days after the date of receipt of the completed
application by the Committee of Adjustments, the Committee must approve or deny
the application. Failure of the Committee to deny a request within 60 days or
any extension thereof as provided in division (C)(2)(c) below is approval of
the request.
         (b)   The time limit begins upon the receipt of a completed
application. A completed application shall mean a written request containing
all information required by law, or by a previously adopted rule, ordinance or
policy of the city. If the Zoning Administrator receives an application that
does not contain all the required information, the City Clerk shall send notice
within 15 business days of the receipt of the request telling the applicant
that the application is not accepted and indicating what information is
missing. The 60-day time limit begins again after receipt of a completed
application, as in division (C)(2)(a) above.
         (c)   The city may extend the time limit before the end of the initial
60-day period by providing written notice of the extension to the applicant.
The notice must contain the reasons for the extension and its anticipated
length, which may not exceed 60 days unless approved by the applicant.
         (d)   The applicant may waive the 60-day period by providing a written
waiver.
   (D)   Denial. The Committee of Adjustments may deny an application for a
variance upon a written finding of legally sufficient reasons with a factual
basis. No application for a variance which has been denied wholly or in part
shall be resubmitted for a period of six months from the date of the order of
denial, except on grounds of new evidence or proof of changes of conditions
found to be valid by the Committee of Adjustments.
   (E)   Lapse of variance. A variance shall lapse and become null and void one
year following the date on which the variance became effective, unless prior to
the expiration of one year the work or improvement described in the variance is
commenced and diligently pursued on the subject site. A variance may be
extended once by the City Council for a period of six months. For any
commercial use, failure to maintain the property may result in revocation of
any extension.
   (F)   Revocation. A violation of any condition set forth in granting a
variance shall be a violation of this chapter and shall terminate the variance.
A revocation resulting in termination of a variance may be appealed as set
forth in §
153.026(B).
§ 153.028 CONDITIONAL USES.
   (A)   Purpose/standards.

this chapter, which is necessary to achieve the objectives of the Comprehensive
Plan, conditional uses are permitted in certain districts subject to the
granting of a use permit.
         (a)   Because of their unusual characteristics, conditional uses
require special consideration so they may be located properly with respect to
the objectives of the Comprehensive Plan and with respect to their effects on
surrounding properties. In order to achieve these purposes, the City Council is
empowered to grant and to deny applications for conditional use permits and to
impose reasonable conditions upon the granting of these permits.
         (b)   Uses authorized by conditional permit under this section shall
be considered a conforming use, but only in accordance with the conditions set
forth in the conditional use permit.
      (2)   A conditional use permit may be granted by the City Council after
demonstration by evidence that:
         (a)   The proposed location of the conditional use is in accord with
the objectives of the Comprehensive Plan, and the purposes of the district in
which the site is located;
         (b)   The establishment, maintenance or operation of the conditional
use will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, comfort
or general welfare;
         (c)   The conditional use will not be injurious to the use and
enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purpose already
permitted, nor substantially diminish and impair property values within the
surrounding area;
         (d)   The establishment of the conditional use will not impede the
normal and orderly development and improvement of surrounding property for uses
permitted in the district;
         (e)   Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and other necessary
facilities have been or will be provided;
         (f)   Adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress
or egress so designated as to minimize traffic congestion in the public
streets; and
         (g)   The conditional use shall, in all other respects, conform to the
applicable regulations of the specific district in which it is located, and of
this chapter in general.
      (3)   The Planning Commission may recommend, and the City Council may
stipulate the conditions and restrictions upon the establishment, location,
construction, maintenance and operation of the conditional use as deemed
necessary for the protection of the public interest and to secure compliance
with the requirements specified in this chapter.
   (B)   Exhibits. The following exhibits shall be required:
      (1)   Map or plat as listed on the application form;

and place of the hearing and a description of the land and the proposed
conditional use. At least ten days before the hearing, the City Clerk shall
mail an identical notice to the owner and to each of the property owners within
350 feet of the property for which the conditional use permit is sought.
Failure of the City Clerk to mail the notice or failure of the property owners
to receive the notice shall not invalidate the proceedings.
      (2)   Action by City Council: The City Council must approve or deny the
application within 60 days after receipt of all information requested by the
city. The time limitation and extension of time are the same as set forth in §
153.027(C)(2).
   (D)   Denial. The City Council may deny an application for a conditional use
permit upon a written finding of legally sufficient reasons with a factual
basis. No application for a conditional use permit which has been denied wholly
or in part shall be resubmitted for a period of six months from the date of the
order of denial, except on grounds of new evidence or proof of changes of
conditions found to be valid by the City Council.
   (E)   Lapse of conditional use permit. A conditional use permit shall lapse
and become null and void one year following the date on which the conditional
use permit became effective, unless prior to the expiration of one year a
building permit is issued by the Building Official and construction is
commenced and diligently pursued toward completion on the subject site, or a
certificate of occupancy is issued by the Building Official for the subject
site or structure. A conditional use permit may be extended once for a period
of six months by the City Council. For any commercial use, failure to maintain
the property may result in revocation of any extension.
   (F)   Revocation. A violation of any condition set forth in a conditional
use permit shall be a violation of this chapter and shall terminate the
conditional use permit.

   (A)   Purpose/standards.
      (1)   In order to give flexibility to the district use regulations of
this chapter, which is necessary to achieve the objectives of the Comprehensive
Plan, interim uses are allowed in certain districts subject to the granting of
an interim use permit. Because of their temporary characteristics, interim uses
require special consideration so they may be located properly with respect to
the objectives of the Comprehensive Plan and with respect to their effects on
surrounding properties. In order to achieve these purposes, the City Council is
empowered to grant and to deny applications for interim use permits and to
impose reasonable conditions upon the granting of these permits. Uses
authorized under this section shall be considered a conforming use, but only in
accordance with the conditions set forth in the interim use permit.
      (2)   The City Council may grant an interim use permit for the interim

         (a)   The use conforms to the zoning regulations;
         (b)   The date or event that will terminate the use can be identified

PD PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICTS
§ 153.280 INTENT.

protect and preserve valuable natural resources and amenities, and to assure a
higher quality environment.

§ 153.397 ANTENNA TOWERS.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. In order to accommodate the communication needs of
residents and businesses while protecting the public health, safety and general
welfare of the community, the Council finds that these regulations are
necessary to:
      (1)   Minimize adverse visual effects of towers through careful design,
siting standards and zoning restrictions;
      (2)   Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure
through structural standards and setback requirements; and
      (3)   Maximize the use of existing and approved towers and buildings to
accommodate new personal communications services antennas in order to reduce
the number of towers needed to serve the community.
   (B)   Personal communications services tower. All persons proposing to
erect, construct or locate a tower within the city, shall apply for and obtain
a conditional use permit according to the provisions in this chapter. An
application for a conditional use permit for a personal communications services
tower shall not be approved unless it can be documented by the applicant that
the telecommunications equipment planned for the proposed tower cannot be
accommodated on an existing or approved tower or building within a one-half
mile radius of the proposed tower due to one or more of the following reasons:
      (1)   The planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity of the
existing or approved tower or building, as documented by a qualified and
licensed professional engineer, and the existing or approved tower cannot be
reinforced, modified or replaced to accommodate planned or equivalent equipment
at a reasonable cost;
      (2)   The planned equipment would cause interference materially impacting
the usability of other existing or planned equipment at the tower or building
as documented by a competent radio frequency engineer and the interference
cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost; and/or
      (3)   Existing or approved towers and buildings within the one-half mile
radius cannot accommodate the planned equipment at a height necessary to
function reasonably as documented by a competent radio frequency engineer.

interests of the public health, safety and welfare to provide for the wise
development of shorelands of public waters. The legislature of the state has
delegated responsibility to the municipalities of the state to regulate the
subdivision, use and development of the shorelands of public waters and thus
preserve and enhance the quality of surface waters, preserve the economic and
natural environmental values of shorelands, and provide for the wise
utilization of waters and related land resources. This responsibility is hereby
recognized by the city.

SEXUALLY-ORIENTED ESTABLISHMENTS
§ 153.455 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of this section is to provide the opportunity for
operation and establishment of sexually-oriented establishments while providing
controls that limit the negative impacts of sexually-oriented establishments on
residential and commercial areas, and protecting the general health, safety and
welfare of the citizens of the city.
   (B)   The nature of sexually-oriented establishments is such that they are
recognized as having adverse secondary characteristics, particularly when they
are accessible to minors and located near residential property or related
residential uses such as schools, day care centers, libraries or parks.
   (C)   Furthermore, the concentration of sexually-oriented establishments has
an adverse effect upon the use and enjoyment of adjacent areas. The nature of
sexually-oriented establishments requires that they not be allowed within
certain zoning districts or within minimum distances from each other or
residential uses.
   (D)   Special regulation of sexually-oriented establishments is necessary to
ensure that the adverse secondary effects will not contribute to or enhance
criminal activity in the area of the uses nor will it contribute to the
blighting or depreciation of surrounding property.

entry of water into the soil, and causes water to run off the surface in
greater quantities and/or at an increased rate of flow than existed prior to
development.
      (2)   Examples include rooftops, sidewalks, driveways, parking lots, and
concrete, asphalt or gravel roads. Bridges over surface waters are considered
IMPERVIOUS SURFACES.
   LAND DISTURBANCE ACTIVITY.
      (1)   Any activity or activities on a site that may result in soil

stabilized in accordance with the city’s requirements as soon as possible; or
         (f)   Any activity that, in the discretion of the city, should be
exempt from the provisions of this section. The city may exempt an activity
from the provisions of this section if all of the following standards and
requirements are met:
            1.   Existing draining and ponding patterns are not significantly
altered so as to adversely affect adjoining land;
            2.   The resultant grade and slopes at the property line are in
substantial conformity to the surrounding natural topography and are set so as
to minimize erosion and provide for sufficient drainage so that both natural
and stormwater enter and leave the property at the original or natural drainage
points;
            3.   All banks will be left with a slope not greater than one foot
vertical to four foot horizontal, except that greater slope shall be permitted
if it is in substantial conformity to the immediately surrounding area, and in
the judgment of the city, it is not expected to adversely affect future
development of the site. All excavated areas shall be finally graded in
substantial conformity to the surrounding natural topography; and

not be permitted to collect upon it.
   LINEAR PROJECT. Construction of new or fully reconstructed roads, trails,
sidewalks, or rail lines that are not part of a common plan of development or

   MAXIMUM EXTENT PRACTICABLE (MEP). The statutory standard (33 U.S.C. § 1342
(p)(3)(B)(iii)) that establishes the level of pollutant reductions that an
owner or operator of regulated MS4s must achieve. The U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (USEPA) has intentionally not provided a precise definition
of MEP to allow maximum flexibility in MS4 permitting. The pollutant reductions
that represent MEP may be different for each small MS4, given the unique local
hydrologic and geologic concerns that may exist and the differing possible
pollutant control strategies. Therefore, each permittee will determine
appropriate BMPs to satisfy each of the six minimum control measures (MCMs)
through an evaluative process. The USEPA envisions application of the MEP
standard as an iterative process.
   MS4. Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System.
   NPDES/SDS GENERAL STORMWATER PERMIT FOR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY. The National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System/State Disposal System general stormwater
permit for construction activity as required by the Minnesota Pollution Control
Agency.

accordance with all applicable conditions of this permit.
   OPERATOR. The person, firm, governmental agency, or other entity designated
by the owner who has day to day operational control and/or the ability to
modify project plans and specifications related to the site plan. The permit
application must list the operator as a permittee. Subcontractors hired by and

or other pavement material. Examples include, but are not limited to, roads,
sidewalks, driveways and parking lots.
   PERMANENT COVER. Surface types that will prevent soil failure under erosive
conditions. Examples include: gravel, concrete, perennial vegetative cover, or
other landscaped material that will permanently arrest soil erosion. Permittees
must establish a uniform perennial vegetative cover (i.e., evenly distributed,
without large bare areas) with a density of 70% of the native background
vegetative cover for the area on all unpaved areas and areas not covered by
permanent structures, or equivalent permanent stabilization measures. PERMANENT
COVER does not include temporary BMPs such as wood fiber blanket, mulch, and
rolled erosion control products.
   PERMITTEE. Any person, entity or group that applies to the city for a
building permit, subdivision approval, or a grading permit. PERMITTEE also
means that person or entity’s agents, employees, contractors, subcontractors
and others acting under the person, entity or group’s direction.
   RECEIVING WATER. Any lake, river, stream or wetland that receives stormwater
discharges from an MS4.

below water level.
   SEDIMENTATION. The process or action of depositing sediment caused by
erosion.
   SEDIMENT CONTROL. The methods employed to prevent sediment from leaving the
development site. SEDIMENT CONTROL practices include silt fences, sediment
traps, earth dikes, drainage swales, check dams, subsurface drains, pipe slope
drains, storm drain inlet protection and temporary or permanent sedimentation
basins. A floating silt curtain placed in the water is not a sediment control
BMP to satisfy perimeter control requirements, except as provided for in the
NPDES/SDS general stormwater permit for construction activity.
   SIGNIFICANT MATERIALS. Includes, but is not limited to: raw materials,
fuels, materials such as solvents, detergents, and plastic pellets; finished
materials such as metallic products; raw materials used in food processing or
production; hazardous substances designated under § 101(14) of the

any chemical the facility is required to report pursuant to § 313 of the
Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA); fertilizers,
pesticides and waste products such as ashes, slag, and sludge that have the
potential to be released with stormwater discharges. When determining whether a
material is SIGNIFICANT, the physical and chemical characteristics of the
material should be considered (e.g., the material’s solubility,
transportability and toxicity characteristics) to determine the material’s
pollution potential (40 C.F.R. § 122.26(b)(12)).
   SITE PLAN. A joint stormwater and erosion and sediment control plan that is

been covered by appropriate materials such as mulch, staked sod, riprap,
erosion control blanket, mats or other material that prevents erosion from
occurring. Grass, agricultural crop or other seeding alone is not
STABILIZATION. Mulch materials must achieve approximately 90% ground coverage
(typically two tons/acre).
   STORMWATER. Any precipitation runoff, stormwater runoff, snow melt off and
any other surface runoff and drainage as defined by Minn. Rule 7090.0080, subp.

basins and filtration systems are not considered to be VOLUME REDUCTION
PRACTICES.
   WATERS OF THE STATE. As defined in Minn. Stat. § 115.01(22), as it may be
amended from time to time, the term means all streams, lakes, ponds, marshes,
watercourses, waterways, wells, springs, reservoirs, aquifers, irrigation
systems, drainage systems and all other bodies or accumulations of water,
surface or underground, natural or artificial, public or private, which are
contained within, flow through, or border upon the state or any portion
thereof.

§ 154.03 CONSTRUCTION AND POST-CONSTRUCTION SITE PLAN.
   (A)   Construction stormwater management. Any applicant proposing a land
disturbance activity within the city that is one-half acre or larger, including
projects less than one-half acre that are part of a larger common plan of
development or sale, shall apply to the city for a grading permit. Any
applicant proposing a land disturbance activity within the city that is one
acre or larger will also have to obtain coverage under the Minnesota Pollution
Control Agency’s Construction Stormwater General Permit – MNR100001 (CSW
permit). The applicant shall submit a grading plan and a site plan with the
application. No construction activity shall begin until the site plan is
approved by the city engineer and the grading permit is issued. At a minimum,
the applicant’s site plan must include all items as required by the most
current CSW permit, including but not limited to:
      (1)   Erosion prevention practices;
      (2)   Sediment control practices;
      (3)   Dewatering and basin draining;
      (4)   Inspection and maintenance;
      (5)   Pollution prevention management measures;
      (6)   Temporary sediment basins; and
      (7)   Termination condition.
   (B)   Post-construction stormwater management. Post-construction management
applies to a land disturbance of greater than or equal to one-half acre,
including projects less than one-half acre that are part of a larger common
plan of development or sale. Applicants shall submit a site plan with post-
construction stormwater management BMPs designed with accepted engineering
practices to the city engineer for review and approval prior to any
construction activity.
      (1)   The permittee shall use permanent structural best management
practices in order to achieve the applicable minimum control requirements as
specified by the most current version of the National Pollution Discharge
Elimination System/State Disposal System (NPDES/SDS) Municipal Separate Storm
Sewer (MS4) permit. The permanent structural BMPs must treat the water quality
volume on any project where the sum of the new impervious surface and the fully
reconstructed impervious surface equals one or more acres.
         (a)   For construction activity (excluding linear projects), the water
quality volume must be calculated as one inch times the sum of the new and the
fully reconstructed impervious surface.
         (b)   For linear projects, the water quality volume must be calculated
as the larger of one inch times the new impervious surface or one-half inch
times the sum of the new and the fully reconstructed impervious surface.
      (2)   The permittee is prohibited from using infiltration techniques to
achieve the conditions in §
154.03(B)(1)(a) and (b) when the infiltration stormwater BMP will receive
discharges from or be constructed in areas:
         (a)   That receive discharges from vehicle fueling and maintenance
areas, regardless of the amount of new and fully reconstructed impervious
surface;
         (b)   Where high levels of contaminants in soil or groundwater may be
mobilized by the infiltrating stormwater. To make this determination, the
owners and/or operators of construction activity must complete the MPCA’s site
screening assessment checklist or conduct their own assessment. The submitted
assessment must be retained with the site plans;
         (c)   Where soil infiltration rates are more than 8.3 inches per hour
unless soils are amended to slow the infiltration rate below 8.3 inches per
hour;
         (d)   With less than three feet of separation distance from the bottom
of the infiltration system to the elevation of the seasonally saturated soils
or the top of bedrock;
         (e)   Of predominately Hydrologic Soil Group D (clay) soils;
         (f)   In an Emergency Response Area (ERA) within a Drinking Water
Supply Management Area (DWSMA) as defined in Minn. Rule 4720.5100, subp. 13,
classified as high or very high vulnerability as defined by the Minnesota
Department of Health;
         (g)   In an ERA within a DWSMA classified as moderate vulnerability
unless the permittee performs or approves a higher level of engineering review
sufficient to provide a functioning treatment system and to prevent adverse
impacts to groundwater;
         (h)   Outside of an ERA within a DWSMA classified as high or very high
vulnerability unless the permittee perform or approves a higher level of
engineering review sufficient to provide a functioning treatment system and to
prevent adverse impacts to groundwater;
         (i)   Within 1,000 feet up-gradient or 100 feet down gradient of

deicing activities.
      (3)   For non-linear projects where the water quality volume cannot cost
effectively be treated as required by §
154.03(B)(1)(a), on the site of the original construction activity, the owner
of the construction activity shall identify locations where off-site treatment
projects can be completed. If the entire water quality volume is not addressed
on the site of the original construction activity, the remaining water quality
volume must be addressed through off-site treatment and, at a minimum, the
permittee must:
         (a)   Select an off-site location using the following order of
preference:
            1.   Locations that yield benefits to the same receiving water that
receives runoff from the original construction activity;
            2.   Locations within the same Department of Natural Resources
catchment area as the original construction activity;
            3.   Locations in the next adjacent Department of Natural Resources
catchment area up-stream; or
            4.   Locations anywhere within the city’s jurisdiction.
         (b)   Off-site treatment projects must involve the creation of new
permanent structural stormwater BMPs or the retrofit of existing structural
stormwater BMPs, or the use of a properly designed regional structural
stormwater BMP. Routine maintenance of structural stormwater BMPs required by
the MS4 permit cannot be used to meet mitigationrequirements of §
154.03(B).
         (c)   Off-site treatment projects must be completed no later than 24
months after the start of the original construction activity.
      (4)   For linear projects where the entire water quality volume cannot be
treated within the existing right-of-way in accordance with §
154.03(B)(1)(b), a reasonable attempt to obtain additional right-of-way,
easement, or other permission to treat the stormwater during the project
planning process must be made. Volume reduction practices must be considered
first. Volume reduction practices are not required if the practices cannot be
provided cost effectively as approved by the city engineer. If additional
right-of-way, easements, or other permission cannot be obtained, owners of
construction activity must maximize the treatment of the water quality volume
prior to discharge.
      (5)   The permittee, upon approval by the city, may elect to make a
payment in lieu of a private mitigation project, as outlined in §
154.03(B)(1), as funding for a public stormwater project. The payment will be
used to meet the requirements of §
154.03(B)(1)(a) and (b) utilizing the same criteria in §
154.03(B)(3)(a), (b) and (c).
      (6)   Long-term inspection and maintenance plans for privately-owned
permanent stormwater management facilities are required. They must be submitted
with the grading permit application and site plan to the city for review and
approval.
      (7)   The owners of private stormwater structural BMPs, constructed after
August 1, 2013, to meet the requirements of §
154.03(B)(1)(a) and (b), and are directly connected to the city’s MS4 are
responsible for the long term operations and maintenance of the BMP. The owner
shall allow the city engineer upon presentation of credentials, to access to
the site at all times in accordance with the provisions of §
154.10. The city may assess the owner for maintenance costs if the owner fails
to complete the required maintenance. The city may also direct the owner to
modify, reconstruct or construct a new structural stormwater BMP, if the
current structural BMP fails to meet the requirements of §
154.03(B)(1)(a) and (b). The city may assess the engineering and construction
costs to the owner.

practices will be maintained; and
      (15)   How collected sediment and floating debris will be disposed.
   (F)   Minimum stormwater pollution control measures and related inspections.
The following minimum control measures are required where bare soil is exposed;
(due to the diversity of individual construction sites, each site will be
individually evaluated; where additional control measures are needed, they will
be specified at the discretion of the city; the city will determine what action
is necessary to prevent excessive erosion from occurring on the site):
      (1)   All grading plans and building site surveys must be reviewed by the
city for effectiveness of erosion control measures in the context of the site
topography and drainage;
      (2)   Sediment control measures must be properly installed by the builder
before construction activity begins. The structures may be adjusted during dry
weather to accommodate short-term activities, such as those that require very
large vehicles. As soon as this activity is finished or before rainfall, the
erosion and sediment control structures must be returned to the configuration
specified by the city. A sediment control inspection must then be scheduled,
and passed before a footing inspection will be done;
      (3)   Diversion of channeled runoff around disturbed areas, if practical,
or the protection of the channel;
      (4)   If a stormwater management plan involves directing some or all of
the site’s runoff, the applicant or his or her designated representative shall
obtain from adjacent property owners any necessary easements or other property
interests concerning the flowing of the water;
      (5)   The scheduling of the site’s activities to lessen their impact on
erosion and sediment creation;
      (6)   Minimize amount of exposed soil; and
      (7)   Control runoff as follows: Unless precluded by moderate or heavy
snow cover (mulching can take place if a light snow cover is present),
stabilize all exposed inactive disturbed soil areas within 100 feet of any
water of the state, or within 100 feet any conveyance (curb, gutter, storm
sewer inlet, drainage ditch and the like) to a water of the state with sod,
seed or weed free mulch. This must be done if the developer will not work the
area for seven days on slopes greater than three feet horizontal to one foot
vertical (3:1), 14 days on slopes ranging from 3:1 to 10:1 and 21 days for
flatter slopes.
      (8)   Generally, sufficient silt fence will be required to hold all sheet
flow runoff generated at an individual site, until it can either infiltrate or
seep through silt fence’s pores.
      (9)   Temporary stockpiling of 50 or more cubic yards of excess soil on
any lot or other vacant area may require a grading permit for the earth moving
activity in question.
      (10)   For soil stockpiles greater than ten cubic yards the toe of the
pile must be more than 25 feet from a road, drainage channel and stormwater
inlet or property line. If for any reason a soil stockpile of any size is
located closer than 25 feet from a road, drainage channel, stormwater inlet or
property line, and left for more than seven days, it must be covered with tarps
or controlled in some other manner.
      (11)   All sand, gravel or other mining operations taking place on the
development site shall have a national pollutant discharge elimination system
general stormwater permit for industrial activities and all required State
Department of Natural Resources permits.
      (12)   Temporary rock construction entrances may be required wherever
vehicles enter and exit a site.
      (13)   Parking is prohibited on all bare lots and all temporary
construction entrances, except where street parking is not available.
      (14)   Public streets must be cleaned and swept whenever tracking of
sediments occurs and before sites are left idle for weekends and holidays.
Establishment of a regular sweeping schedule is encouraged.
      (15)   Water, impacted by the construction activity, that is being
removed from the site by pumping must be treated by temporary sedimentation
basins, geotextile filters, grit chambers, sand filters, up-flow chambers,
hydro-cyclones, swirl concentrators or other appropriate controls. The water
shall not be discharged in a manner that causes erosion or flooding of the
site, receiving channels, adjacent property or a wetland.
      (16)   All storm drain inlets must be protected during construction until
control measures are in place with either silt fence or an equivalent barrier
that meets accepted design criteria, standards and specifications of the State
Pollution Control Agency.
      (17)   Catch basins; all newly installed and rehabilitated catch basins
must be provided with a sump area for collecting coarse-grained material, when
required by the city. The basins must be cleaned when they are half filled with
material.
      (18)   Roof drain leaders; if possible, all newly constructed and
reconstructed buildings must route roof drain leaders to pervious areas (not
natural wetlands) where the runoff can infiltrate. The discharge rate shall be
controlled so that no erosion occurs in the pervious areas.
      (19)   Follow-up inspections must be performed by the developer or
subsequent owner on a regular basis to ensure that erosion and sediment control
measures are properly installed and maintained. In cases where cooperation is
withheld, construction stop orders may be issued by the city, until erosion and
sediment control measures meet specifications. A second erosion and sediment
control/grading inspection must then be scheduled and passed before the final
inspection will be done.
      (20)   Inspection and maintenance: all stormwater pollution control
management facilities must be designed to minimize the need of maintenance, to
provide easy vehicle and personnel access for maintenance purposes and be
structurally sound. These facilities must have a plan of operation and
maintenance that ensures continued effective removal of the pollutants carried
in stormwater runoff. The city or its designated representative shall inspect
all stormwater management facilities during construction. Thereafter, the
developer or subsequent owner shall inspect at least once every five years. The
developer or subsequent owner will keep all inspection records on file for a
period of six years.
   (G)   Permanent stormwater pollution controls.
      (1)   The applicant shall install or construct, or pay the city fees for
all stormwater management facilities necessary to manage increased runoff, so
that the two-year, ten-year and 100-year peak storm discharge rates existing
before the proposed development, are not increased. These predevelopment rates
shall be based on the last ten years of how that land was used. Accelerated
channel erosion must not occur as a result of the proposed land disturbing or
development activity. An applicant may also make an in-kind or a monetary
contribution to the development and maintenance of community stormwater
management facilities designed to serve multiple land disturbing and
development activities undertaken by one or more persons, including the
applicant.
      (2)   All calculations and information used in determining these peak
storm discharge rates shall be submitted along with the stormwater pollution
control plan.
      (3)   The applicant shall consider reducing the need for stormwater
management facilities by incorporating the use of natural topography and land
cover such as natural swales and depressions as they exist before development
to the degree that they can accommodate the additional flow of treated (e.g.,
settled) water without compromising the integrity or quality of the wetland or
pond.
      (4)   The following stormwater management practices must be investigated
in developing the stormwater management part of the stormwater pollution
control plan in the following descending order of preference:
         (a)   Protect and preserve as much natural or vegetated area on the
site as possible, minimizing impervious surfaces, and directing runoff to
vegetated areas rather than to adjoining streets, storm sewers and ditches;
         (b)   Flow attenuation by use of open vegetated swales and natural
depressions;
         (c)   Stormwater wet detention facilities (including percolation
facilities); and
         (d)   A combination of successive practices may be used to achieve the
applicable minimum control requirements specified in division (G) above. The
applicant shall provide justification for the method selected.
   (H)   Minimum design standards for stormwater wet detention facilities. At a
minimum these facilities must conform to the most current technology as
reflected in the current version of the State Pollution Control Agency’s
publication, Protecting Water Quality in Urban Areas and the current
requirements found in the same agency’s NPDES permits for stormwater associated
with construction activities.
   (I)   Minimum protection for natural wetlands.
      (1)   Runoff must not be discharged directly into wetlands without
appropriate quality (i.e., treated) and quantity runoff control, depending on
the individual wetland’s vegetation.
      (2)   At the minimum, a 30-foot wide protective buffer strip of
predevelopment vegetation, if possible, shall surround all wetlands. The buffer
strip’s width shall be increased at least four feet for every 1% of slope of
the surrounding land. The city may choose to extend the size of the buffer
strip to protect sensitive wetlands from degradation.
         (a)   Detailed buffer design is usually site specific. Therefore the
city can require a larger buffer than the minimum.
         (b)   For newly constructed buffer sites the design criteria should
follow common principles and the example of nearby natural areas. The site
should be examined for existing buffer zones and mimic the nearby slope
structure and vegetation as much as possible. Buffer design and protection
during construction should do any or all of the following: slow water runoff,
trap sediment, enhance water infiltration, trap fertilizers, pesticides,
pathogens, heavy metals, trap blowing snow and soil, and act as corridors for
wildlife. How much stress is put on these functions will determine the buffer
zone’s final configuration.
         (c)   The applicant or developer or subsequent owner shall maintain
the buffer strip for the first year.
         (d)   Because drain tiles will short-circuit the benefits of vegetated
buffer strips, drain tiles on the development site should be identified and
rendered inoperable.
         (e)   Buffer strips may be made into perpetual conservation easements.
      (3)   Wetlands must not be drained or filled, wholly or partially, unless
replaced by either restoring or creating wetland areas of at least equal public
value. Compensating for the impact by replacing or providing substitute wetland
resources or environments with those of at least equal public value.
Compensation, including the replacement ratio and quality of replacement should
be consistent with the requirements outlined in the rules adopted by the Board
of Water and Soil Resources.
      (4)   Work in and around wetlands must be guided by the following
principles in descending order of priority:
         (a)   Avoid the direct or indirect impact of the activity that may
destroy or diminish the wetland;
         (b)   Minimize the impact by limiting the degree or magnitude of the
wetland related activity and its implementation;
         (c)   Rectify the impact by repairing, rehabilitating or restoring the
affected wetland environment with one of at least equal public value; and
         (d)   Reduce or eliminate the adverse impact over time by preservation
and maintenance operations during the life of the activity.
   (J)   Models/methodologies/computations. Hydrologic models and design
methodologies used for the determining runoff characteristics and analyzing
stormwater management structures must be approved by the city. Plans,
specifications and computations for stormwater management facilities submitted
for review must be sealed and signed by a licensed professional engineer. All
computations must appear in the plans submitted for review, unless otherwise
approved by the city.
(Ord. 23-003, passed 3-13-2023)
§ 154.05 REVIEW.
   The city shall review the site plan or stormwater pollution control plan.
   (A)   Permit required. If the city determines that the site plan or
stormwater pollution control plan meets the requirements of this chapter, the
city shall issue a permit valid for a specified period of time, which
authorizes the land disturbance or construction activity contingent on the
implementation and completion of the submitted plan.
   (B)   Denial. If the city determines that the site plan or stormwater
pollution control plan does not meet the requirements of this chapter, the city
shall not issue a permit for the land disturbance or construction activity. All
land use and building permits for the site in question must be suspended until
the developer has an approved site plan or stormwaterpollution control plan.
(Ord. 23-003, passed 3-13-2023)
§ 154.06 MODIFICATION OF PLAN.
   An approved site plan or stormwater pollution control plan may be modified

security deposited with the city for faithful performance of the site plan or
stormwater pollution control plan and any site plan or stormwater and pollution
control plan related remedial work must be released six months after the
completion of the installation of all stormwater pollution control measures as
shown on the grading and/or the stormwater pollution control plan and
establishment of final stabilization.
(Ord. 23-003, passed 3-13-2023)
§ 154.08 NOTIFICATION OF FAILURE TO PROPERLY IMPLEMENT SITE PLAN OR STORMWATER
POLLUTION CONTROL PLAN.
   The city shall notify the developer when the city is going to act on the
financial securities part of this chapter.
   (A)   Notification by the city. The initial contact will be to a party or
parties listed on the application and/or the site plan. Forty-eight hours after
notification by the city or 72 hours after the failure of erosion control
measures, whichever is less, the city, at its discretion, may begin corrective
work.
   (B)   Erosion off-site.
      (1)   If erosion breaches the perimeter of the site, the applicant shall
immediately develop a cleanup and restoration plan, obtain the right-of-entry
from the adjoining property owner, and implement the cleanup and restoration
plan within 48 hours of obtaining the adjoining property owner’s permission.
      (2)   In no case, unless written approval is received from the city,
shall more than seven calendar days go by without corrective action being
taken.
      (3)   If in the discretion of the city, the applicant does not repair the
damage caused by the erosion, the city may do the remedial work required and
charge the cost to the applicant.
   (C)   Erosion into streets, wetlands or water bodies.
      (1)   If eroded soils (including tracked soils from construction

bodies, prevention strategies, cleanup and repair must be immediate.
      (2)   The applicant shall provide all traffic control and flagging
required to protect the traveling public during the cleanup operations.
   (D)   Failure to do corrective work. When an applicant fails to conform to
any provision of this policy within the time stipulated, the city may take the
following actions:
      (1)   Withhold the scheduling of inspections and/or the issuance of a
certificate of occupancy;
      (2)   Revoke any permit issued by the city to the applicant for the site
in question;
      (3)   Direct the correction of the deficiency by city forces or by a
separate contract. The issuance of a permit constitutes a right-of-entry for
the city or its contractor to enter upon the construction site for the purpose
of correcting deficiencies in erosion control;
      (4)   All costs incurred by the city in correcting site plan deficiencies
must be reimbursed by the applicant. If payment is not made within 30 days
after costs are incurred by the city, payment will be made from the applicant’s
financial securities as described in §
154.07; and
      (5)   If there is an insufficient financial amount, in the applicant’s
financial securities as described in §
154.07, to cover the costs incurred by the city, then the city may assess the
remaining amount against the property.

§ 155.01 PURPOSE AND INTERPRETATION.
   (A)   Purpose. Each new subdivision becomes a permanent unit in the basic
physical structure of the future community, a unit to which the future
community will of necessity by forced to adjust. Piecemeal planning of such
subdivisions, without correlation to the Comprehensive Guide Plan, will bring a
disastrous disconnected patchwork of plats and poor circulation of traffic. In
order that new subdivisions will contribute toward an attractive, orderly,
stable and wholesome community environment, adequate municipal services and
safe streets, all subdivisions hereafter platted within the incorporated limits
of the city shall in all respects, fully comply with the regulations
hereinafter set forth in this chapter.
   (B)   Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the
provisions of this chapter shall be the minimum requirements adopted for the
protection of the public health, safety and general welfare.
(Ord. 620, passed 11-8-1963)
§ 155.02 SCOPE.

(Ord. 620, passed 11-8-1963)
§ 155.04 MINIMUM SUBDIVISION DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (A)   Conformity with the Comprehensive Guide Plan.
      (1)   The proposed subdivision shall conform to the Comprehensive Guide
Plan, and all applicable provisions of state law and the Zoning Ordinance of
the city.
      (2)   Exception for R-2 Multiple Residence District. Any lot zoned as R-
2 Multiple Residence District under said Zoning Ordinance may after the
erection of the duplex therein, be subdivided into two lots notwithstanding the
regulations stated in said ordinance which apply to duplex family dwelling
districts. It is the intent of this paragraph to correct inequities by
permitting both inhabitants of a two-family dwelling which may be divisible by
a vertical plane, to apply for homestead classification and by enabling the
conveyance or mortgage of one portion of such a two-family dwelling, after
recording of such subdivision plat or recordable survey.
      (3)   Except as provided in division (A)(1), all other regulations
pertaining to duplex zoned property shall apply to such subdivision.
   (B)   Street plan. The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade, and
location of all streets shall conform to the Comprehensive Guide Plan and to
these regulations; and shall be considered in their relation to existing and
planned streets, to reasonable circulation of traffic, to topographical
conditions, to runoff of storm water, to public convenience and safety, and in
their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by
such streets.
      (1)   Continuation of existing streets. The arrangement of streets in new
subdivisions shall make provision for the appropriate continuation of existing
streets in adjoining areas.
      (2)   Future projection of streets. Where adjoining areas are not
subdivided, but may be subdivided, the arrangement of streets in a new
subdivision shall make provision for the proper projection of streets into
adjoining areas by carrying the new streets to the boundaries of the new
subdivision at appropriate locations.
   (C)   Streets.
      (1)   Widths. All right-of-way widths and pavement widths (face to face
of curb) shall conform to the following minimum dimensions:

      (4)   Vertical curves. Different connecting streets gradients shall be
connected with vertical curves. Minimum length, in feet, of these curves shall
be 30 times the algebraic difference in the percent of grade of the two
adjacent slopes.
      (5)   Street jogs. Street jogs are only permitted for local streets,
marginal access roads, and cul-de-sacs which shall have a center line off-set
of 150 feet or more.
      (6)   Local streets. Local streets shall be so aligned that their use by
through traffic will be discouraged.
      (7)   Cul-de-sacs. Maximum length of cul-de-sac streets shall be 600 feet
measured along the center line from the intersection of origin to end of right-
of-way.
      (8)   Marginal access streets. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an
existing or planned major thoroughfare, the City Council may require a street
approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way for adequate
protection of residential properties, and to afford separation of through and
local traffic. Such marginal access streets shall be located at a distance from
the major thoroughfare suitable for the appropriate use of intervening land, as
for park purposes in residential districts, or for commercial or industrial
purposes in appropriate districts. Such distances shall also be determined with
due regard for the requirements of approach grades and future grade
separations.
      (9)   Half streets. Half streets shall be prohibited, except where
essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with
the other requirements of these regulations; and except where the City Council
finds it will be practicable to require the dedication of the other half when
the adjoining property is subdivided. Wherever there is a half street adjacent
to a tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted
within such tract.
      (10)   Private streets. Private streets shall not be approved nor shall
public improvements be approved for any private street.
      (11)   Hardship to owners of adjoining property avoided. The street
arrangements shall not be such as to cause hardship to owners of adjoining
property in platting their own land and providing convenient access to it.
   (D)   Alleys.
      (1)   Local requirements. Either a public or private alley shall be
provided in a block where commercially zoned property abuts a major
thoroughfare or a major street. Alleys in residential areas other than those
zoned for multiple-family use shall not be permitted, except that in the case
of extending the length of an existing block, provisions shall be made for
appropriate continuation of the existing alley.
      (2)   Widths. All alley rights-of-way and pavement widths shall conform
to the following minimum standards:
 
Classification           ROW     PVMT
Industrial or commercial 24 feet 20 feet
Residential (two-way)    20 feet 18 feet
Residential              20 feet 18 feet
 
      (3)   Grades. All alley gradients along the property line shall be at
least 0.6% and shall not exceed 8%.
   (E)   Intersections.
      (1)   Angle of intersections. The angle formed by the intersecting street
shall not be less than 60 degrees with 90 degree intersections preferred.
      (2)   Size of intersections. Intersections of more than four corners
shall be prohibited.
      (3)   Corner radii. Roadways of street intersections shall be rounded by
a radius of not less than 15 feet. Roadways of alley-street intersections shall
be rounded by a radius of not less than ten feet. Corners at the entrances to
the turn around portions of cul-de-sacs shall be rounded by a radius of not
less than 15 feet.
   (F)   Curbing. Curbing shall be included as part of the required street
surface improvement and shall thus be designed for installation along both
sides of all roadways in accordance with the standards of the city.
   (G)   Sidewalks.
      (1)   Location. Sidewalks shall be designed in accordance with the
standards of the city for construction along both sides of all major and
secondary thoroughfares, local streets, marginal access streets and cul-de-
sacs. The sidewalks shall be located next to the property line.
      (2)   Widths. All sidewalk widths shall conform to the following minimum
standards:
 
Classification                                 Width

Multiple-Family Zone and Public Building Sites 6 feet
Commercial Zone                                10 feet
Industrial Zone                                4 feet
 
      (3)   Grades. Sidewalks shall slope one-quarter inch per foot away from
the property line and the profile grade shall not exceed 6%.
   (H)   Pedestrian ways. In blocks over 900 feet long, pedestrian crosswalk
right-of-ways through the blocks of at least ten feet wide may be required by

§ 155.10 PUBLIC SITES AND OPEN SPACES.
   (A)   Public sites.
      (1)   Where a park, playground, or other recreational area, school site,
or other public ground that has been proposed in the Comprehensive Guide Plan
is located in whole or in part within a proposed subdivision, such proposed
public site shall be designated as such upon the proposed plat of the
subdivision and should be dedicated to the city or to the school district.
      (2)   The City Council will determine within a reasonable period of time
after submission of the proposed plat of the subdivision whether to acquire, by
purchase or condemnation proceedings, that portion of the proposed public site
that the subdivider does not choose to dedicate.
      (3)   In order to expedite development of the subdivision, the City
Council may desire to approve a portion of the proposed subdivision plat prior
to approving that portion that is directly affected by the public site being
proposed in the Comprehensive Guide Plan.
   (B)   Open spaces. When the Planning Commission has recommended to the City
Council prior to or in conjunction with a recommendation on a proposed plat,
that open spaces, suitably located, of adequate size for parks, playgrounds, or
other recreational purposes for local use, should be dedicated to the city by a
subdivider. If the subdivider has not agreed to do so, the City Council shall
be required to act to approve or disapprove the proposed plat of the
subdivision only within a period of 90 days in order to take the necessary
steps to acquire, through purchase or condemnations, all or part of the open
space.

§ 155.12 VARIANCES.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   The City Council may grant a variance from these regulations
following a finding that all of the following conditions exist:
         (a)   There are special circumstances or conditions affecting said
property such that a strict application of the provisions of this chapter would
deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of his/her land.
         (b)   The variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of
a substantial property right of the petitioner.
         (c)   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the
public welfare or injurious to other property in the territory in which said
property is situated.
      (2)   In making this finding the Council shall consider the nature of the
proposed use of land and the existing use of land in the vicinity, the number
of persons to reside or work in the proposed subdivision and the probable
effect of the proposed subdivision upon traffic conditions in the vicinity. In
granting a variance herein provided the Council shall prescribe only conditions
that it deems desirable or necessary to the public interest.
   (B)   Complete neighborhood or planned development projects. The City
Council may grant a variance from these regulations in case of a plan for a
Planned Development Project (see Zoning Ordinance) or in case of a plan for a
complete community or neighborhood which, in the judgement of the City Council,
provides adequate public spaces and includes provisions for efficient
circulation, light, air, and other needs. In making its findings, as required
herein below, the City Council shall take into account the nature of the
proposed use of land and the existing use of land in the vicinity, the number
of persons to reside or work in the proposed subdivision and the probable
effect of the proposed subdivision upon traffic conditions in the vicinity. The
City Council shall find that:
      (1)   The proposed project will constitute a desirable and stable
community development.
      (2)   The proposed project will be in harmony with the adjacent areas.
   (C)   Applications required.
      (1)   Application for any such variance shall be made in writing, by the
subdivider, at the time when the proposed plat is filed for the consideration
of the City Council. Application stating fully and clearly all facts relied
upon by the petitioner, and shall be supplemented with maps, plans, or other
additional data which may aid the City Council in the analysis of the proposed
project. The plans for such development shall include such covenants,
restrictions, or other legal provisions necessary to guarantee the full
achievement of the plan.
      (2)   The application for variance and accompanying materials shall be
referred to the Planning Commission for study and recommendation prior to
action by the City Council.
(Ord. 620, passed 11-8-1963)

one-half acres or more in area and have a minimum width of 150 feet. However,

registered land survey of the lot or lots to be divided or consolidated. Such
plat or survey shall show the dimensions of said lots as measured upon the
recorded plat, and also the proposed division thereof. A written description of
the separately described tract or tracts which will result from the proposed
division or consolidation shall be filed with such plat or survey.
      (3)   The separately described tract of land to be conveyed or designated
for building permit purposes by reason of such division or consolidation as
described upon said proposed plat or registered land survey, shall not be less
than the minimum dimensions required to secure the minimum lot area or width
specified in the city Zoning Ordinance.
      (4)   As a result of such division or consolidation as herein authorized,
no remaining part of an original subdivision lot shall become a separately
described tract having less than the minimum dimensions required to secure the
minimum lot area or width specified in the city Zoning Ordinance.
      (5)   In the division of any lot wherein a divided part thereof does not
abut a dedicated public roadway, public easements for streets, sanitary and
storm sewers, electric, gas and water facilities shall be required and
dedicated, unless the same be waived by the City Council after recommendation
of the Planning Commission.

of an owner or owners who shall have complied with division (A) of this
section, the Building Inspector, subject only to other applicable ordinances of
the city, is hereby authorized to issue the building permit requested for any

survey notwithstanding any provisions of §§
155.01 through
155.14 to the contrary.
   (C)   Effects of failure or inability to file such a survey or registered
land survey. No building permit shall be issued in the event any owner or
owners shall fail or be unable to comply with division (A) of this section in
making a division or consolidation of lands included in recorded plats. In all
instances where lands have not been platted in lots and blocks as mentioned in
division (A) hereof, all such property and the division or consolidation
thereof shall be subject to the provisions of §§
155.01 through
155.14.
