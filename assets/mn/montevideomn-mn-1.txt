CHAPTER 1
Name, Boundaries, Powers And General Provisions
Section 1.01. Name And Boundaries. 
The City of Montevideo, in the County of Chippewa, and State of Minnesota,
shall, upon the taking effect of this charter, continue to be a municipal
corporation, under the name and style of the City of Montevideo, with the same
boundaries as now are or hereafter may be established.
Section 1.02. Powers Of The City.
The city shall have all powers which it may now or hereafter be possible for a
municipal corporation in this state to exercise in harmony with the
constitutions of this state and of the United States. It is the intention of
this charter that every power which the people of the City of Montevideo might
lawfully confer upon themselves, as a municipal corporation, by specific
enumeration in this charter shall be deemed to have been so conferred by the
provisions of this section. This charter shall be construed liberally in favor
of the city and the specific mention of particular powers in the charter shall
not be construed as limiting in any way the generality of the power herein
sought to be conferred.
Section 1.03. Charter A Public Act.
This charter shall be a public act and need not be pleaded or proved in any
case.
CHAPTER 2
Form Of Government
Section 2.01. Form Of Government.
The form of government established by this charter shall be known as the
"Council-Manager Plan". All discretionary powers of the city, both legislative
and executive, shall vest in and be exercised by the city council, subject to
the initiative, referendum, and recall powers of the people. It shall have
complete control over the city administration, but shall exercise this control
exclusively through the city manager and shall not itself attempt to perform
any administrative work.
Section 2.02. The Mayor.
The mayor shall be the chief executive officer of the city, and shall exercise
all powers and perform all duties conferred and imposed upon him by this
charter, the ordinances of the city and laws of the state. He shall be
recognized as the official head of the city for all ceremonial purposes, by the
courts for the purpose of serving civil processes, and by the governor for the
purpose of martial law. He shall study the operations of the city government
and shall report to the council any neglect, dereliction of duty or waste on
the part of any officer or department of the city. In time of public danger or
emergency he may, with the consent of the council take command of the police,
maintain order, and enforce the law. In the event of a vacancy in the office of
the mayor, whether by death, resignation, or any other cause, the council shall
appoint a mayor for the unexpired term, but in case of a recall the vacancy
shall be filled in the manner provided in this charter.
Section 2.03. Elective Officers 1
.
The elective officers of the city shall be a mayor and five councilmen, who
shall be qualified electors and who shall be elected at large in the manner
hereinafter provided. The five councilmen shall serve for a term of four years
and until their successors are elected and qualified. The mayor shall serve for
a term of two years and until his successor is elected and qualified.
   The terms of all officers shall begin on the first Monday after the first
Tuesday in January following a regular municipal election.
   All present elective officers shall hold office until their respective terms
expire.
 
Notes
1 1. Section 2.03 amended by Ordinance 476, 4-7-1975, effective 7-6-1975.
Section 2.04. Incompatible Offices.
No member of the council shall be appointed city manager nor shall any member
hold any paid municipal office or employment under the city; and until one year
after the expiration of his term as mayor or councilman no former member shall
be appointed to any paid office or employment under the city, which office or
employment was created or the emoluments of which were increased during his
term as councilman, and no mayor or councilman shall hold any other office
which is incompatible with such offices under the laws of the State of
Minnesota. Nothing in this charter shall, however, prevent a paid volunteer
fireman from serving as mayor or councilman.
Section 2.05. Vacancies In The Council.
A vacancy in the council shall be deemed to exist in case of the failure of any
person elected thereto to qualify on or before the date of the second regular
meeting of the new council, removal from the city, continuous absence from the
city for more than three months, or conviction of a felony of any person
whether before or after his qualification, or by reason of the failure of any
councilman without good cause to perform any of the duties of membership in the
council for a period of three months. In each such case the council shall by
resolution declare such vacancy to exist and shall forthwith appoint an
eligible person to fill the same until the next regular municipal election,
when the office shall be filled for the unexpired term; provided that any
vacancy resulting from a recall election or from a resignation following the
filing of a recall petition shall be filled in the manner provided in such
case.
Section 2.06. Salaries.
Salaries of the mayor and councilmen shall be fixed as provided in Minnesota
Statutes 415.11 as the same may from time to time amended, and until so fixed,
they shall continue to receive the same salary they were receiving at the time
of the adoption of this charter.
Section 2.07. Boards.
The council shall appoint five park commissioners, a board of health consisting
of three members, a city planning commission, and may appoint a radio
commission, an airport commission, and such other boards and commissions as it
may deem necessary. They shall be appointed by the council by ballot, and the
affirmative vote of three members shall be necessary for such appointments. The
park commissioners shall hold their offices for five years and until their
successors shall have been appointed and qualified. The members of the board of
health shall be appointed annually. The duties of the various boards and
commissions shall be fixed by the council by ordinances. All present members
shall hold office until their respective term expires.
Section 2.08. Investigation Of City Affairs.
The council and the city manager or either of them, and any officer or officers
formally authorized by them shall have power to make investigations into the
city's affairs, to subpoena witnesses, administer oaths, and to compel the
production of books and papers. The council may at any time provide for an
examination or audit of the accounts of any officer or department of the city
government. The accounts of the city shall be audited by the state public
examiner or a certified public accountant at least once each year.
Section 2.09. Interference With Administration.
Neither the council nor any of its members shall dictate the appointment or in
any manner interfere with the city manager or prevent him from exercising his
own judgment in the appointment of officers and employees in the administrative
service. Except for the purpose of inquiry the council and its members shall
deal with and control the administrative service solely through the city
manager, and neither the council nor any member thereof shall give orders to
any of its subordinates of the city manager; either publicly or privately.
CHAPTER 3
Procedure Of Council
Section 3.01. Council Meetings.
On the first Monday after the first Tuesday in January following a regular
municipal election, the council shall meet at the usual place and time for the
holding of council meetings. At this time the newly elected members of the
council shall assume their duties. Thereafter the council shall meet at such
times as may be prescribed by ordinance or resolution, except that they shall
meet in regular session twice each month. The mayor, or any two members of the
council, may call special meetings of the council upon at least twelve hours'
notice to each member of the council.
   Such notice shall be delivered personally to each member or shall be left
with some responsible person at the member's usual place of residence.
   All meetings of the council shall be public, and any citizen shall have
access to the minutes and records thereof at all reasonable times.
Section 3.02. Officers Of The Council.
The city clerk, or other city official selected by the council, shall be the
secretary of the council and serve as such at its meetings, and shall keep such
records and perform such other duties as may be required by this charter or by
vote of the council. The president of the council shall be elected by the
council from its members at the first regular meeting of the council in January
following each city election.
Section 3.03. Rules Of Procedure And Quorum.
The council shall determine its own rules and order of business, and shall keep
a journal of its proceedings. A majority of all members elected shall
constitute a quorum to do business, but a less number may adjourn from time to
time. The council shall provide by ordinance a means by which a minority may
compel the attendance of absent members.
Section 3.04. Ordinances, Resolutions And Motions.
Except as in this charter otherwise provided, all legislation shall be by
ordinance, and except as otherwise required in this charter or by ordinance of
the City of Montevideo, or by the laws of the State of Minnesota, all other
actions of the council may be by motion. The aye and no vote on ordinances,
resolutions and motions shall be recorded unless the vote is unanimous. Except
as otherwise provided in this charter, an affirmative vote of the members of
the council present shall be required for the passage of all motions, and four
votes shall be required for the passage of all ordinances and resolutions.
Section 3.05. Procedure On Ordinances.
The enacting clause of all ordinances shall be in the words, "The City of
Montevideo does ordain." Every ordinance shall be presented in writing. No
ordinance except an emergency ordinance shall be passed at the meeting at which
it is introduced, and at least one week shall elapse between its introduction
and final passage.
Section 3.06. Emergency Ordinances.
An emergency ordinance or resolution is an ordinance or resolution for the
immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety, in which the
emergency is defined or declared in a preamble thereto, separately voted upon,
and agreed to by at least four members of the council, as recorded by ayes and
noes. An emergency ordinance or resolution must be in writing, but may be
enacted without previous filing. No grant of any franchise shall be construed
to be an emergency ordinance. No prosecution shall be based upon the provisions
of any emergency ordinance until twenty four hours after the ordinance has been
filed with the city clerk and posted in three conspicuous places, or until the
ordinance has been published, unless the person charged with violation had
actual notice of the passage of the ordinance prior to the act or omission
complained of.
Section 3.07. Procedure On Resolutions.
Every resolution shall be presented in writing and read in full before a vote
is taken thereon, unless the reading of a resolution is dispensed with by
unanimous consent.
Section 3.08. Signing And Publication Of Ordinances And Resolutions.
Every ordinance or resolution passed by the council shall be signed by the
president of the council and attested by the city clerk, and shall be filed
with the city clerk and by him recorded and preserved. Every ordinance, except
emergency ordinances, shall, before it takes effect, forthwith be presented to
the mayor for his approval. If he approves he shall sign the same, but if he
disapproves it, he shall return it to the city council with his objections
thereto, by depositing the same with the city clerk, to be presented to the
city council at the next regular meeting, and if the same shall not be returned
to him before the next regular meeting of the city council after it shall have
been presented to him, it shall have the same force and effect as if approved
by him. Upon the return of any ordinance by the mayor, without his approval,
the city council may at the next regular meeting thereof pass the same by the
affirmative vote of all five members, and it shall have the same effect as if
approved by the mayor. Every ordinance except emergency ordinances shall be
published once in the official paper of the city within fifteen days after its
approval by the mayor or after its passage by the council over the veto of the
mayor, and shall be recorded in a book kept for that purpose, which record
shall be attested by the city clerk.
Section 3.09. When Ordinances And Resolutions Take Effect.
Emergency ordinances and resolutions, and ordinances and resolutions making the
annual tax levy, determining the annual budget, and providing for local
improvements and assessments, shall take effect immediately upon their passage.
All other ordinances enacted by the council shall take effect thirty days after
the date of their publication unless a later date is fixed therein, in which
event they shall take effect at such later date. Ordinances and resolutions
adopted by the electors of the city shall take effect at the time fixed
therein, or, if no such time is designated therein, then immediately upon the
adoption thereof.
Section 3.10. Amendment And Repeal Of Ordinances And Resolutions.
Every ordinance or resolution repealing a previous ordinance or resolution or
section or subdivision thereof shall give the number, if any, and the title of
the ordinance or resolution to be repealed in whole or in part. No ordinance or
resolution or section or subdivision thereof shall be amended by reference to
the title alone, but such an amending ordinance or resolution shall set forth
in full each section or subdivision to be amended, and shall indicate new
matter by underscoring and old matter to be omitted by enclosing it in
brackets. In newspaper publication, the same indications of omitted and new
matter shall be used except that italics or bold-faced type may be substituted
for underscoring, and omitted matter may be printed in capital letters without
parentheses.
Section 3.11. Revision And Codification Of Ordinances.
The city may revise, rearrange and codify its ordinances with such additions
and deletions as may be deemed necessary by the council. Such ordinance code
shall be published in book, pamphlet or continuously revised loose-leaf form,
and copies shall be made available by the council at the office of the city
clerk for general distribution to the public free or at a reasonable charge.
Publication in such a code shall be sufficient publication of any ordinance
provision not previously published if a notice that copies of the codification
are available at the office of the city clerk is published in the official
newspaper for at least two successive weeks.
CHAPTER 4
Nominations And Elections
Section 4.01. Election Date.
A regular municipal election shall be held on the first Tuesday after the first
Monday in November in every even numbered year at such place or places as the
city council may designate.
Section 4.02. Procedure.
Nominations and elections shall be conducted as provided in the general
election laws of the State of Minnesota.
CHAPTER 5
Initiative, Referendum And Recall
Section 5.01. Powers, Reserved By The People.
The people of Montevideo reserve to themselves the powers, in accordance with
the provisions of this charter, to initiate and adopt resolutions and
ordinances, to require measures passed by the council to be referred to the
electorate for approval or disapproval, and to recall public officials. These
powers shall be called the initiative, the referendum, and the recall
respectively.
Section 5.02. Expenditures By Petitioners.
No member of any initiative, referendum or recall committee, no circulator of a
signature paper, and no signer of any such paper, or any other person shall
accept or offer reward, pecuniary or otherwise for service rendered in
connection with the circulation thereof, but this shall not prevent the
committee from incurring an expense not to exceed one hundred dollars for legal
advice, stationery, copying, printing and notaries' fees. Any violation of the
provisions of this section shall constitute a misdemeanor.
Section 5.03. Further Regulations.
The council may after the organization of the city government under this
charter provide by ordinance such further regulations for the initiative,
referendum, and recall, not inconsistent with this charter, as may be deemed
necessary. Such ordinance shall include the relevant provisions of this
charter.
Section 5.04. Initiation Of Measure.
Any five electors may form themselves into a committee for the initiation of
any measure of public concern. After formulating their measure they shall file
a verified copy thereof with the city clerk together with their names and
addresses as members of such committees. They shall also attach a verified copy
of the proposed measure to each of the signature papers herein described,
together with their names and addresses as sponsors therefor.
Section 5.05. Form Of Petition And Of Signature Papers.
The petition for the adoption of any measure shall consist of the measure
together with all the signature papers and affidavits thereto attached. Such
petition shall not be completed unless signed by a number of voters equal to at
least ten percent of the total number of votes cast at the last preceding
regular municipal election. All the signatures need not be on one signature
paper, but the circulator of every such paper shall make an affidavit that each
signature appended to the paper is the genuine signature of the person whose
name it purports to be. Each signature paper shall be in substantially the
following form:
   INITIATIVE PETITION
Proposing an ordinance (or resolution as the case may be) to                   
(stating the purpose of the measure), a copy of which ordinance (or resolution)
is hereto attached. This measure is sponsored by the following committee of
electors:
   Name            Address
1.                                                                     
2.                                                                    
3.                                                                    
4.                                                                    
5.                                                                    
The undersigned electors, understanding the terms and the nature of the measure
hereto attached, petition the council for its adoption, or, in lieu thereof,
for its submission to the electors for their approval.
   Name            Address
1.                                                                    
2.                                                                    
3.                                                                    
At the end of the list of signatures shall be appended the affidavit of the
circulator, mentioned above.
Section 5.06. Filing Petitions And Action Thereon.
All the signature papers shall be filed in the office of the city clerk as one
instrument. Within five (5) days after the filing of the petition the city
clerk shall ascertain by examination the number of electors whose signatures
are appended thereto, and whether this number is at least ten percent of the
total number of electors who cast their votes at the last preceding regular
municipal election. If he finds the petition insufficient or irregular, he
shall at once notify all the members of the committee of sponsors of that fact
in writing by mail, certifying the reasons for his finding. The committee shall
then be given thirty days in which to file additional signature papers and to
correct the petition in all other particulars. If at the end of the period the
petition is found to be still insufficient or irregular the clerk shall file
the same in his office or shall notify by mail each member of the committee of
that fact. The final finding of the insufficiency or irregularity of a petition
shall not prejudice the filing of a new petition for the same purpose, nor
shall it prevent the council from referring the measure to the electors at the
next regular or any special election, at its option.
Section 5.07. Action Of Council On Petition.
Whenever the petition shall be found to be sufficient, the city clerk shall so
certify to the council at its next meeting, stating the number of petitioners
and the percentage of the total number of voters which they constitute, and the
council shall at once read the measure and refer it to an appropriate
committee, which may be a committee of the whole. The committee or council
shall thereupon provide for public hearings upon the measure, after the holding
of which the measure shall be finally acted upon by the council not later than
sixty five days after the date upon which such measure was submitted to the
council by the city clerk. If the council shall fail to pass the proposed
measure, or shall pass it in a form different from that set forth in the
petition and unsatisfactory to the petitioners, the proposed measure shall be
submitted by the council to the vote of electors at the next regular municipal
election. But in case the number of signers of said petition is equal to at
least twenty five percent of the total number of voters voting at the last
regular municipal election, then the council shall call a special election,
upon the measure to be held not less than thirty nor more than forty five days
from such date, unless a regular election is to occur within three months, in
which case it may be submitted at such regular municipal election. In case the
council passes the proposed measure with amendments and at least four-fifths of
the committee of petitioners do not express their dissatisfaction with such
amended form by a certificate filed with the city clerk within ten days from
the passage thereof by the council, then the measure need not be submitted to
the electors.
Section 5.08. Initiative Ballots.
The ballots used when voting upon any such proposed measure shall state the
substance thereof and shall give the voter the opportunity to vote either "Yes"
or "No". If a majority of the electors voting on any such measure shall vote in
favor thereof, it shall thereupon become an ordinance or resolution of the city
as the case may be. Any number of proposed measures may be voted upon at the
same election, but in case there shall be more than one, the voter shall be
allowed to vote for or against each separately. In the event of the
simultaneous adoption of two initiated ordinances containing inconsistent
provisions, the one adopted by the larger majority shall prevail.
Section 5.09. Initiation Of Charter Amendments.
Nothing in this charter contained shall be construed as in any way affecting
the right of the electors under the constitution and statutes of Minnesota to
propose amendments to this charter.
Section 5.10. The Referendum.
If prior to the date when an ordinance or resolution takes effect a petition
signed by qualified electors of the city equal in number to fifteen percent of
the total vote at the last regular municipal election be filed with the city
clerk requesting that any such measure, or any part thereof, be repealed or be
submitted to a vote of the electors, the said measure shall thereby be
prevented from going into operation. The council shall thereupon reconsider the
said measure at its next regular meeting, and either repeal the same, or repeal
by the petitioners, or by aye and no votes reaffirm its adherence to the
measure as passed. In the latter case the council shall immediately order an
election to be held thereon, pending which the ordinance or resolution shall
remain suspended. If a majority of the voters voting thereon are opposed to the
measure it shall not become effective; but otherwise it shall take effect
immediately or on the date therein specified.
Section 5.11. Referendum Petitions.
The requirements laid down in Sections 5.04 5.05, and 5.06 above as to the
formation of committees for the initiation of measures and as to the form of
petitions and signature papers and action thereon shall apply to the referendum
as far as possible, but with such verbal changes as may be necessary. A
referendum petition shall read as follows:
   REFERENDUM PETITION
Proposing the repeal of an ordinance (or resolution, as the case may be) to
(stating the purpose of the measure), a copy of which ordinance (or resolution)
is hereto attached. The proposed repeal is sponsored by the following committee

Section 5.12. Referendum Ballots.
The ballots used in any referendum election shall conform to the rules laid
down in Section 5.08 of this charter for initiative ballots.
Section 5.13. The Recall.
Any five electors may form themselves into a committee for the purpose of
bringing about the recall of any elected officer of the city. The committee
shall certify to the city clerk the name of the officer whose removal is
sought, a statement of the grounds for removal in not more than two hundred
fifty words and their intention to bring about his recall. A copy of this
certificate shall be attached to each signature paper and no signature paper
shall be put into circulation previous to certification.
Section 5.14. Recall Petition.
The petition for the recall of any official shall consist of a certificate
identical with that filed with the city clerk as provided in Section 5.13,
together with all the signature papers and affidavit thereto attached. Such
petition shall not be completed unless signed by a number of voters equal to at
least twenty five percent of the total number of votes cast at the last
preceding regular municipal election. All the signatures need not be on one
signature paper, but the circulator of every such paper shall make an affidavit
that each signature appended to the paper is the genuine signature of the
person whose name it purports to be. Each signature paper shall be in
substantially the following form:
   RECALL PETITION
Proposing the recall of                   from his office as                  
which recall is sought for the reasons set forth in the attached certificate.
This movement is sponsored by the following committee of electors:
   Name            Address

2.                                                                    
3.                                                                       
4.                                                                    
5.                                                                    
The undersigned electors, understanding the nature of the charges against the
officers herein sought to be recalled, desire the holding of a recall election
for that purpose.
1.                                                                    
2.                                                                    
3.                                                                    
At the end of the list of signatures shall be appended the affidavit of the
circulator, mentioned above.
Section 5.15. Filing Of Petition.
Within thirty days after the filing of the original certificate, the committee
shall file the completed petition in the office of the city clerk. The city
clerk shall examine the same within the next five days, and if he finds it
irregular in any way, or finds that the number of signers is less than twenty
five percent of the total number of electors who cast their votes at the last
preceding regular municipal election, he shall so notify all of the members of
the committee by mail. The committee then shall be given ten days in which to
file additional signature papers and to correct the petition in all other
respects, but they may not change the statement of the grounds upon which the
recall is sought. If at the end of that time the city clerk finds the petition
still insufficient or irregular, he shall notify all the members of the
committee by mail to that effect and shall file the petition in his office. No
further action shall be taken thereon.
Section 5.16. Recall Election.
If the petition or amended petition be found sufficient, the city clerk shall
transmit it to the council without delay. The council shall at its next regular
meeting, by motion, provide for the holding of a special recall election not
less than thirty nor more than forty five days thereafter, provided that if any
other municipal election is to occur within sixty days after such meeting, the
council may in its discretion provide for the holding of the recall election at
that time.
Section 5.17. Procedure At Recall Election.
In the published call for the election, whether posted on bulletin boards or
printed in the official paper, there shall be given the statement for the
grounds for the recall and also, in not more than five hundred words, the
answer of the officer concerned in justification of his course in office.
Candidates to succeed the officer to be recalled shall be nominated in the
usual way, and the election shall be conducted as far as possible in accordance
with the usual procedure in municipal elections.
Section 5.18. Form Of Ballot.
Unless the officer whose removal is sought shall have resigned within ten days
after the receipt by the council of the completed recall petition, the form of
the ballot at such election shall be as near as may be: "Shall A be recalled?",
the name of the officer whose recall is sought being inserted in place of A,
and the electors shall be permitted to vote separately "Yes" or "No" on this
question. The ballot shall also contain the name of the candidates to be voted
upon to fill the vacancy, in case the recall is successful, under the caption:
"Candidates to fill the place of A, if recalled". But the officer whose recall
is sought shall not himself be a candidate upon such ballot. In case a majority
of those voting for and against the recall of any official shall vote in favor
of recalling such official, he shall be thereby removed from office, and in
that event the candidate who receives the highest number of votes for his place
shall be elected thereto for the remainder of the unexpired term. If the
officer sought to be recalled shall have resigned within ten days after the
receipt by the council of the completed recall petition, the form of ballot at
the election shall be the same, as nearly as may be, as the form in use at a
regular municipal election.
CHAPTER 6

the United States. The city manager shall be appointed for an indefinite
period, and he shall be removable by the council at any time. If removed at any

provisions of this charter, it may combine the duties of various offices as it
may see fit.
Section 6.05. Purchases And Contracts.
The city manager shall be the chief purchasing agent of the city. All city
purchases and contracts shall be made or let by the city manager when the

CHAPTER 7
Taxation And Finances
Section 7.01. Council To Control Finances.
The council shall have full authority over the financial affairs of the city,
and shall provide for the collection of all revenues and other assets, the
auditing and settlement of accounts, and the safekeeping and disbursement of
public moneys, and in the exercise of a sound discretion shall make
appropriations for the payment of all liabilities and expenses.
Section 7.02. Fiscal Years.

to the assessment of such property and the collection of such taxes.
Section 7.04. Board Of Equalization.
The council shall constitute a board of equalization to equalize assessments of
property for taxation purposes according to law.
Section 7.05. Preparation Of The Annual Budget.
The city manager shall prepare the estimates for the annual budget. The budget
shall be by funds and shall include all the funds of the city, except the funds
made up of proceeds of bond issues, utility funds, and special assessment
funds, and may include any of such funds of the discretion of the council. The
estimates of expenditures for each fund budgeted shall be arranged for each
department or division of the city under the following heads: (1) Ordinary
expenses (for operation, maintenance, and repairs); (2) payment of principal
and interest on bonds and other fixed charges; (3) capital outlays (for new
construction, new equipment, and all improvements of a lasting character).
Ordinary expenses shall be subdivided into: (a) salaries and wages, with a list
of all salaried offices and positions, including the salary allowance and the
number of persons holding each; (b) other expenses, with sufficient detail to
be readily understood. All increases and decreases shall be clearly shown. In
parallel columns shall be added the amounts granted and the amounts expended
under similar heads for the past two completed fiscal years and the current
fiscal year, actual to date and estimated for the balance of the year. In
addition to the estimates of expenditures, the budget shall include for each
budgeted fund a statement of the revenues which have accrued for the past two
completed fiscal years with the amount collected and the uncollected balances
together with the same information, based in so far as necessary on estimates
for the current fiscal year, and on estimate of the revenues for the ensuing
fiscal year. The statement of revenues for each year shall specify the
following items; sums derived from (a) taxation; (b) fees, (c) fines, (d)
interest, (e) miscellaneous, not included in the foregoing, (f) sales and
rentals, (g) earnings of public utilities and other public service enterprises,
(h) special assessments, and (i) sales of bonds and other obligations. Such
estimates shall be printed or typewritten and there shall be sufficient copies
for each member of the council, for the city manager, for the city clerk, and
three at least, to be posted in public places in the city. The estimates shall
be submitted to the council at its first regular monthly meeting in September
and shall be made public. The city manager may submit with the estimates such
explanatory statement or statements as he may deem necessary, and during the
first three years of operation under this charter he shall be authorized to
interpret the requirements of this section as requiring only such comparisons
of the city's finances with those of the previous government of the city as may
be feasible and pertinent.
Section 7.06. Passage Of The Budget.
The budget shall be the principal item of business at the first regular monthly
meeting of the council in September and the council shall hold adjourned
meetings from time to time until all the estimates have been considered. The
meetings shall be so conducted as to give interested citizens a reasonable
opportunity to be heard. The budget estimates shall be read in full and the
city manager shall explain the various items thereof as fully as may be deemed
necessary by the council. The annual budget finally agreed upon shall set forth
in detail the complete financial plan of the city for the ensuing fiscal year
for the funds budgeted, and shall be signed by the majority of the council when
adopted. It shall indicate the sums to be raised, and from what sources, and
the sums to be spent, and for what purposes according to Section 7.05. The
total sum appropriated shall be less than the total estimated revenue by a safe
margin. The council shall adopt the budget not later than the first week of
October by a resolution which shall set forth the total for each budgeted fund
and each department with such segregation as to objects and purposes of
expenditures as the council deems necessary for purpose of budget control. The
council shall also adopt a resolution levying whatever taxes it considers
necessary within statutory limits for the ensuing year for each fund. The tax
levy resolution shall be certified to the county auditor in accordance with law
not later than October 10. At the beginning of the fiscal year, the sums fixed
in the budget resolution shall be and become appropriated for the several
purposes named in the budget resolution and no other.
Section 7.07. Enforcement Of The Budget.
It shall be the duty of the city manager to enforce strictly the provisions of
the budget. He shall not approve any order upon the city treasurer for any
expenditure unless an appropriation has been made in the budget resolution, nor
for any expenditure covered by the budget resolution unless there is a
sufficient unexpended balance left after deducting the total past expenditures
and the sum of all outstanding orders and encumbrances. No officer or employee
of the city shall place any order or make any purchase except for a purpose and
to the amount authorized in the budget resolution. Any obligation incurred by
any person in the employ of the city for any purpose not authorized in the
budget resolution or for any amount in excess of the amount therein authorized
shall be a personal obligation upon the person incurring the expenditure.
Section 7.08. Alterations In The Budget.
After the budget resolution has been adopted, the council shall have no power
to increase the amounts fixed in the budget resolution, by the insertion of new
items or otherwise, beyond the estimated revenues, unless the actual receipts
exceed the estimates and then not beyond the actual receipts. The council may
at any time, by resolution, approved by a majority of its members, reduce the
sums appropriated for any purpose by the budget resolution, or by a vote of
four members, authorize the transfer of sums from unencumbered balances of
appropriations in the budget resolution to other purposes.
Section 7.09. Emergency Appropriation In Budget.
The council may include an emergency appropriation as a part of the budget but
not to exceed ten percent of the total budget. A transfer from the emergency
appropriation to any other appropriation shall be made only by a vote of at
least four members of the council, and shall be used only for the purposes
designated by the council.
Section 7.10. Disbursements, How Made.
No disbursement of city funds shall be made except by check signed by the city
manager and treasurer and specifying the purposes for which the disbursement is
made and the fund from which it is drawn. No such check shall be issued until
there is money to the credit of the fund from which it is to be paid sufficient
to pay it together with all outstanding encumbrances upon the fund. No such
check shall be issued until the claim to which it relates has been supported by
an itemized bill, payroll, or time-sheet approved and signed by the responsible
city officer who vouches for its correctness and reasonableness. The city
manager shall note on each contract requiring the payment of money by the city
the particular fund out of which it is to be paid. The council may by ordinance
make further regulations for the safe-keeping and disbursement of the funds of
the city.
Section 7.11. Funds To Be Kept.
   Subd. 1.There shall be maintained in the city treasury the funds provided
for in the following subdivisions.
   Subd. 2. A general fund for the payment of such expenses of the city as the
council may deem proper. Into this fund shall be paid all money not provided
herein or by statute to be paid into any other fund.
   Subd. 3. A debt service fund, into which shall be paid all receipts from
taxes or other sources for the payment of principal and interest of all
obligations issued by the city except bonds issued on account of any local
improvement to be financed wholly or partly by special assessments and bonds
issued on account of any municipally owned utility. Out of this fund shall be
paid the principal and interest of such obligations when due. Any surplus in
such fund not needed immediately for debt service may be invested under the
direction of the council in such securities as are authorized by statute for
the investment of such funds; and such investments may be liquidated at any
time. To the extent required by law, a separate account in the debt service
fund shall be maintained for each issue of city obligations.
   Subd. 4. A bond fund, into which shall be paid and disbursed the proceeds of
all bonds issued by the city except bonds issued on account of any local
improvement to be financed wholly or party by special assessments and bonds
issued on account of any municipally owned utility. A separate bond account
shall be kept for each issue of such bonds.
   Subd. 5. A special assessment fund, which shall be used to finance local
improvements to be paid for, in whole or in part, from special assessments
against benefited property. There shall be paid into this fund: (1) collections
of special assessments, with interest, levied against benefited property; (2)
proceeds of bonds or warrants sold by the city to finance local improvements to
be paid for, in whole or in part, by special assessments; and the proceeds of
inter-fund loans; (3) amounts from other city funds representing either (a)
apportionments of costs against the city at large, (b) benefit assessments
against city property, or (c) appropriations to maintain the integrity of the
fund. There shall be paid out of this fund: (1) all expenses and costs of the
improvement projects financed through the fund; (2) the redemption of all
special assessment fund obligations, with interest, at or before maturity; and
any inter-fund loans; and (3) abatements of assessments and refunds of receipts
in error. The council shall maintain the integrity of this fund by
appropriations from tax funds if necessary, and in addition may by ordinance
create and maintain in the fund a cash reserve sufficient for working capital
purposes. In order to anticipate the collection of special assessments and the
municipal share of the cost of a local improvements, the council may by a
majority vote issue and sell obligations pledging the full faith and credit of
the city, or pledging only special assessments, in such amounts and maturities
as it may determine, but the aggregate amount of such obligations outstanding
at any time shall not exceed the sum of the following: (1) all assessments
levied and uncollected; (2) cost of work in progress to be financed in whole or
in part by special assessments, and (3) the cash reserve for working capital as
previously determined by ordinance. In order that the fund may be administered
on a self-sustaining basis, all local improvement projects financed through it
shall upon completion be certified by the city manager as to total cost, which
shall thereupon be apportioned by the council either as assessments against
benefited property or as amounts due from other city funds. Amounts apportioned
against other city funds shall be due when installments of special assessments
levied for the same project are due, corresponding assessment rolls shall be
charged interest as in the case of assessments and shall be credited to the
fund, with any interest due, when collected. To the extent required by law, a
tax for the city's share of the cost shall be levied before any obligations
against the fund are issued and sold. When a local improvement to be financed
wholly or partly from special assessment is undertaken under any applicable
statute, any provision of this subdivision inconsistent with the statute shall
not apply.
   Subd. 6. A public utility fund, into which shall be paid all money derived
from the sale of obligations issued on account of any municipally owned utility
and all money derived from the sale of utility services, and from the sale of
any property acquired for or used in connection with any such utility. There
shall be paid out of this fund the cost of the purchase, construction,
operation, maintenance and repair of such utility, including the principal of
and interest upon obligations which have been or shall be issued on its
account. Separate accounts within the public utility fund shall be kept for all
utilities which are operated separately.
   Subd. 7. In addition to the foregoing funds, there may be maintained in the
city treasury, whenever the council deems it advisable, the following funds:
      (a)   One or more working capital or revolving funds, for financing self-
sustaining activities not accounted for through other funds;
      (b)   One or more trust and agency funds, for the care and disbursement
of money received and held by the city as trustee or custodian or in the
capacity of any agent for individuals or other governmental units;
      (c)   Such other funds as may be required by statute or ordinance.
   Subd. 8. In lieu of establishing any of the types of funds specified in
Subd. 7, the council may provide for the recording of operations or activities
for which the use of such funds might be suitable through the maintenance of
separate accounts in any appropriate fund already established. The council
shall have full power by ordinance or resolution to make inter-fund loans,
except from trust and agency funds, as it may deem necessary and appropriate
from time to time.
Section 7.12. Accounts And Reports.
The city manager shall be the chief accounting officer of the city and of every
branch thereof, and the council may prescribe and enforce proper accounting
methods, forms, blanks, and other devices consistent with the law, this
charter, and the ordinances adopted in accord therewith. He shall submit to
this council a statement each month showing the amount of money in the custody
of the city treasurer, the status of all funds, the amount spent or chargeable
against each of the annual budget allowances and the balances left in each, and
such other information about the finances of the city as the council may
require. Once each year on or before the last day of February, the city manager
shall submit a report to the council covering the entire financial operations
of the city for the past year. This report shall show: the actual receipts and
expenditures omitting duplications and stating the cash balance at the
beginning of the last fiscal year and at the close, the total outlays for
operation and maintenance and the total capital outlays; the condition of each
of the funds; the total receipts by sources and the total expenditures by
general purposes; the total outstanding bonds and debts of the city when due
the amount of new bonds issued and the amount redeemed and the interest rate of
each; the condition of all the annual budget allowances; an inventory of all
the property owned by the city; and such further information as the city
manager deems advisable or the council requires.
Section 7.13. City Indebtedness 1
.
Except as provided in Sections
7.14 and
7.15, no obligations shall be issued to pay current expenses, but the council
may issue and sell obligations for any other municipal purpose in accordance
with law and within the limitations prescribed by law. Such obligations which
do not exceed $50,000.00 in any one issue may be issued and sold without
approval of the electors of the city. Except where an issue of obligations does
not exceed $50,000.00, or where an election is not required by some other
provision of this charter or by state law, no such obligation shall be issued
and sold without the approval of a majority of the electors of the city voting
on the question at a general or special election.

collection of taxes levied for any fund and not yet collected. The total amount
of certificates issued against any fund for any year with interest thereon
until maturity shall not exceed ninety percent of the total current taxes for
the fund uncollected at the time of issuance. Such certificates shall be issued
on such terms and conditions as the council may determine and shall bear
interest at a rate not to exceed six percent per annum, but they shall become
due and payable not later than the 1st day of April of the year following their
issuance. The proceeds of the tax levied for the fund against which tax
anticipation certificates are issued and the full faith and credit of the city
shall be irrevocably pledged for the redemption of the certificates in the
order of their issuance against the fund.
Section 7.15. Emergency Debt Certificates.
If in any year the receipts from taxes or other sources should from some
unforeseen cause become insufficient for the ordinary expenses of the city, or
if any calamity or other public emergency should subject the city to the
necessity of making extraordinary expenditures, the council may by ordinance
issue and sell on such terms and in such manner as the council determines,
emergency debt certificates to run not to exceed two years and to bear interest
at not more than six percent per year. A tax sufficient to pay principal and
interest on such certificates with the margin required by law shall be levied
as required by law. The ordinance authorizing an issue of such emergency debt
certificates shall state the nature of the emergency and be approved by at
least four members of the council. It may be passed as an emergency ordinance.

The city council finds that use of services provided by pawnbrokers provides an
opportunity for the commission of crimes and their concealment because pawn
businesses have the ability to receive and transfer property stolen by others
easily and quickly. The city council also finds that consumer protection
regulation is warranted in transactions involving pawnbrokers. The purpose of
this chapter is to prevent pawn businesses from being used as facilities for
the commission of crimes and to assure that such businesses comply with basic
consumer protection standards, thereby protecting the public health, safety and
general welfare of the citizens of the city.
To help the police department better regulate current and future pawn
businesses, decrease and stabilize costs associated with the regulation of the
pawn industry and increase identification of criminal activities in the pawn
industry through the timely collection and sharing of pawn transaction
information, this chapter also implements and establishes the required use of

at a stipulated price, or who loans money secured by chattel mortgage on
personal property, taking possession of the property or any part thereof so
mortgaged. To the extent that a pawnbroker's business includes buying personal
property previously used, rented or leased, or selling it on consignment, the
provisions of this chapter shall be applicable.

hazard, and general aesthetic depreciation, the keeping of more than four (4)
cats and/or dogs (not more than 3 of which can be dogs), on the premises for
more than four (4) consecutive days is hereby declared to be a nuisance; except

5-4-8 of this chapter, within five (5) days after impounding, may be sold with
the proceeds applied to the cost of confinement and sale, and the balance
returned to the city. If, after making reasonable efforts to sell the dog or
cat, no sale is obtained, the dog or cat may be humanely destroyed or given
away. (Ord. 897, 4-5-2010)
5-4-10: PERMISSIBLE RETURN OF UNRESTRAINED ANIMAL:
Notwithstanding the provisions of section
5-4-6 of this chapter, if an animal is found unrestrained and its owner can be
identified and located, such animal need not be impounded but may, instead, be

shall surrender the animal for the quarantine period to the city pound or shall
at the owner's own expense, place it in a veterinary hospital. (Ord. 911, 3-7-
2011)

chapter;
the presiding officer of said court shall issue a summons directed to the owner
of said dog or cat commanding such owner to appear before said court to show
cause why said dog or cat should not be seized by any police officer, or

reasonable cause to believe that a particular dog presents a clear and
immediate danger to residents of the city because it is infected with rabies
(hydrophobia) or because of a clearly demonstrated vicious nature, the officer,
after making reasonable attempts to impound such dog, may summarily destroy
said dog. (Ord. 897, 4-5-2010)

Abandoned motor vehicles constitute a hazard to the health and welfare of the
people of the city in that such vehicles can harbor noxious diseases, furnish
shelter and breeding places for vermin, and present physical dangers to the
safety and well being of children and other citizens. Abandoned motor vehicles
and other scrap metals also constitute a blight on the landscape of the city
and, therefore, a detriment to the environment. The abandonment and retirement
of motor vehicles constitutes a waste of a valuable source of useful metal. It
is, therefore, in the public interest that the present accumulation of
abandoned motor vehicles be eliminated and that future abandonment of motor
vehicles be prevented. (Ord. 619, 8-20-1984)

the person in control of such property; or a motor vehicle voluntarily
surrendered by its owner to and accepted by the city. For purposes of this
definition, motor vehicle shall include any automobile, truck, motorcycle,
scooter, race car, demolition derby car, snowmobile or any other motorized
device required to possess a license issued by the state. A vehicle shall not
be determined to be abandoned when kept in an enclosed garage or enclosed
storage building. A vehicle shall not be determined to be abandoned if it is
being actively and consistently worked on and the premises on which the work is
being done is maintained in an orderly manner; provided, that no more than one
such vehicle is in a condition that would otherwise qualify it as abandoned at
any one time and provided repairs do not exceed forty eight (48) hours in any
seven (7) day period. Vehicles on the premises of junkyards and automobile
graveyards, which are defined, maintained and licensed in accordance with
Minnesota statutes section 161.242, or which are licensed and maintained in

7-1A-1: FINDINGS, PURPOSE AND INTENT:
To provide for the health, safety and welfare of its citizens, and to ensure
the integrity of its streets and the appropriate use of rights of way, the city
strives to keep its rights of way in a state of good repair and free from
unnecessary encumbrances.
Accordingly, the city hereby enacts this chapter regulating right-of-way
permits and administration. This chapter imposes reasonable regulation on the
placement and maintenance of facilities and equipment currently within its
rights of way or to be placed therein at some future time. It is intended to
complement the regulatory roles of state and federal agencies. Under this
chapter, persons excavating and obstructing the rights of way will bear
financial responsibility for their work. Finally, this chapter provides for
recovery of out-of-pocket and projected costs from persons using the public
rights of way.
This chapter shall be interpreted consistently with 1997 session laws, chapter
123, substantially codified in Minnesota Statutes sections 237.16, 237.162,
237.163, 237.79, 237.81 and 238.086 (the "Act") and the other laws governing
applicable rights of the city and users of the right of way. This chapter shall
also be interpreted consistent with Minnesota Rules 7819.0050–7819.9950 where
possible. To the extent any provision of this chapter cannot be interpreted
consistently with the Minnesota Rules, that interpretation most consistent with
the act and other applicable statutory and case law is intended. This chapter
shall not be interpreted to limit the regulatory and police powers of the city
to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to protect the health, safety
and welfare of the public. (Ord. 813, 4-2-2001)

the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional facilities
within the right of way. In making such decisions, the city shall strive to the
extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the right of
way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the public interest,
the public's needs for the particular utility service, the condition of the
right of way, the time of year with respect to essential utilities, the

competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct and

8-4-38: CONNECTION CHARGE:
   A.   Flexibility In Application: Whenever the city council determines that a
special assessment is not practical or feasible or will be inequitable and will

served with water or sanitary sewer, the city council may by resolution provide
that a connection charge be paid for providing water or sanitary sewer service
to any property.
   B.   Content Of Resolution: Any such resolution shall fix the amount of the
connection charge to be paid and shall describe the property to be benefited

assessed and may be paid in the same manner as special assessments for local
improvements are assessed and paid.
   D.   Additional Charges Possible: Any such connection charge shall be in
lieu of any special assessment against the property benefited for the service
for which the connection charge is made, and no property for which a connection
charge has been paid shall be assessed otherwise for the same service, but this
shall not prevent additional connection charges being made for additional
connections to the water or sanitary sewer lines to provide additional services
to the same property. (Ord. 479, 7-7-1975)

at the expense of the property owner. In areas where water or sewer service
line stubs/curb boxes have been installed, the owner of the property being
served may connect to those lines or stubs, but the city neither guarantees
their location or state of repair. All initial costs to connect water and sewer
service lines to the main are at the cost of the property owner, including
connections to previously installed stub lines.
   A.   Water Service Line Defined: A "water service line" is any line which
connects the city main to the property being served. Once installed at cost to
the property owners, ownership and maintenance of the water line is defined as:
      1.   Property Owner Owns And Maintains: From the property side of the
curb box (shutoff), including the flare and nut connection to the curb box, to
the house or business being served. This includes valves, meter valves,
sprinkler systems and appurtenances such as backflow preventers and pressure
reducers, whether or not installed by the city. The property owner is also
responsible to repair frozen water lines from the house to the main.
      2.   City Owns And Maintains: The water service lines from the curb box
(shutoff) to the main. The city shall also own all city installed unused stubs
or water service line extensions, up to and including the curb box.
      3.   Abandoned Lines: Property owners who abandon or no longer need the
use of a service line must pay the full cost of the abandonment or
disconnection of the line, including all costs to remove the line, up to the
main, if so directed by the city. These costs include all costs to repair the
right of way, curbs, sidewalks and streets. Once correctly abandoned, under the
direction of the city, the city will take ownership of the remaining stub,
shutoff or line, if left in place at the direction of the city.
   B.   Sanitary Sewer Service Line Defined: A "sanitary sewer service line" is
any sanitary sewer line which is less than eight inches (8") in diameter and
also includes any sanitary sewer line which is eight inches (8") or more in
diameter where such size is made necessary to provide service to a particular
individual or individuals and is not an extension of the City sanitary sewer.

comply with such notice and, after having heard the objections thereto, if any,
the Council does not determine otherwise, the Council may cause such action to
be taken by the City. The City shall notify the property owner of the amount of
the expenditure and require reimbursement therefor. If the owner does not
reimburse the City within thirty (30) days of the date of notification, the
City may recover such expenditure, either by civil action against the owner or
by ordering the Clerk to extend such sum as a special assessment against the
affected property and to certify the same to the County auditor for collection
in the manner as provided by law.
   B.   Emergency Procedure: In case of an emergency arising out of or caused
by the property owner's failure to comply with this chapter, the City may take
whatever action is necessary to correct the emergency. The City shall then send
the property owner a notice by certified mail of the action taken, the amount
necessary to reimburse the City for its costs and disbursements in correcting
the situation, and a time and place when the owner may appear before the
Council to be heard as to the necessity of the City's action and the amount of
the reimbursement required. If, after having heard the objections thereto, if
any, the Council does not determine otherwise, the Council may order the City
to recover such expenditure, either by civil action against the owner or by
ordering the Clerk to extend such sum as a special assessment against the
affected property, and to certify the same to the County auditor for collection

will cease. Investigation and/or resolution of the matter in response to the
warning notice in no way relieves the alleged violator of liability for any
violations occurring before or after receipt of the warning notice. Nothing in
this subsection shall limit the authority of the city of Montevideo to take any
action, including emergency action or any other enforcement action, without
first issuing a warning notice.
   C.   Notice Of Violation: Whenever the city manager finds that a person has
violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this chapter, the
city manager may order compliance by written notice of violation to the
responsible person. Such notice shall be personally served upon the person
alleged to have violated this chapter.
The notice of violation shall contain:
      1.   The name and address of the alleged violator;
      2.   The address when available or a description of the building,
structure or land upon which the violation is occurring, or has occurred;
      3.   A statement specifying the nature of the violation;
      4.   A description of the remedial measures necessary to restore
compliance with this chapter and a time schedule for the completion of such
remedial action;
      5.   A statement of the penalty or penalties that shall or may be
assessed against the person to whom the notice of violation is directed;
      6.   A statement that the determination of violation may be appealed to
the city by filing a written notice of appeal with the city manager within
thirty (30) days of service of notice of violation; and
      7.   A statement specifying that, should the violator fail to restore
compliance within the established time schedule, the work will be done by a
designated governmental agency or a contractor and the expense thereof shall be
charged to the violator.
Such notice may require without limitation:
      1.   The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;
      2.   The elimination of illicit connections or illegal discharges;
      3.   That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and
desist;
      4.   The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property;
      5.   Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation costs; and
      6.   The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
   D.   Suspension Of MS4 Access:
      1.   Emergency Cease And Desist Orders: When the city manager finds that
any person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this
chapter, or any order issued hereunder, or that the person's past violations
are likely to recur, and that the person's violations have caused or
contributed to an actual or threatened discharge to the MS4 or waters of the
United States which reasonably appears to present an imminent or substantial
endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or to the environment, the
city manager may issue an order to the violator directing it immediately to
cease and desist all such violations and directing the violator to:
         a.   Immediately comply with all ordinance requirements; and
         b.   Take such appropriate preventative action as may be needed to
properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including immediately
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
Any person notified of an emergency order directed to it under this subsection
shall immediately comply and stop or eliminate its endangering discharge. In
the event of a discharger's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the
emergency order, the city manager may take such steps as deemed necessary to
prevent or minimize harm to the MS4 or waters of the United States, and/or
endangerment to persons or to the environment, including immediate termination
of a facility's water supply, sewer connection, or other municipal utility
services. The city manager may allow the person to recommence its discharge
when it has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city manager that the
period of endangerment has passed, unless further termination proceedings are
initiated against the discharger under this chapter. A person who is
responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent
endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes
of the harmful discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future
occurrence, to the city manager within ten (10) days of receipt of the
emergency order. Issuance of an emergency cease and desist order shall not be a
bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the
violator.
      2.   Suspension Due To Illicit Discharges In Emergency Situations: The
city manager may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a
person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened
discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the
environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of
the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order
issued in an emergency, the city manager may take such steps as deemed
necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United
States, or to minimize danger to persons.
      3.   Suspension Due To The Detection Of Illegal Discharge: Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have their MS4 access
terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illegal discharge. The
city manager will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4
access. The violator may petition the city of Montevideo for a reconsideration
and hearing.
A person violates this chapter if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises
terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the city
manager.
   E.   Civil Penalties: In the event the alleged violator fails to take the
remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or otherwise fails to
cure the violations described therein within thirty (30) days, or such greater
period as the city manager shall deem appropriate, after the city of Montevideo
has taken one or more of the actions described above, the city manager may
impose a penalty not to exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00) (depending on the
severity of the violation) for each day the violation remains unremedied after
receipt of the notice of violation. (Ord. 916, 3-19-2012)
8-6-12: APPEAL OF NOTICE OF VIOLATION:
Any person receiving a notice of violation may appeal the determination of the
city manager by filing a written notice of appeal with the city manager. The
notice of appeal must be received within thirty (30) days from the date of
service of the notice of violation. Hearing on the appeal before the
appropriate authority or his/her designee shall take place within thirty (30)
days from the date of receipt of the notice of appeal. The decision of the
municipal authority or their designee shall be final. (Ord. 916, 3-19-2012)
8-6-13: ENFORCEMENT MEASURES AFTER APPEAL:
If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth
in the notice of violation, or, in the event of an appeal, within thirty (30)
days of the decision of the municipal authority upholding the decision of the
city manager, then representatives of the city of Montevideo may enter upon the
subject private property and are authorized to take any and all measures
necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property. It shall be
unlawful for any person, owner, agent or person in possession of any premises
to refuse to allow the government agency or designated contractor to enter upon
the premises for the purposes set forth above. (Ord. 916, 3-19-2012)
8-6-14: COST OF ABATEMENT OF THE VIOLATION:
The city may recover the costs of abatement of the violation, including
administrative costs, either by civil action against the person served the
notice of violation or, if service has been had upon the owner of the property
on which the violation occurred, by ordering the city clerk to extend such sum
plus twenty five percent (25%) thereof as a special assessment against the
property on which the violation existed and to certify the same to the county
auditor for collection in the same manner as taxes and special assessments are
collected. (Ord. 916, 3-19-2012)
8-6-15: VIOLATIONS DEEMED A PUBLIC NUISANCE:
In addition to the enforcement processes and penalties provided, any condition
caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this
chapter is a threat to public health, safety, and welfare, and is declared and
deemed a nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored at the violator's
expense, and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or otherwise compel the
cessation of such nuisance may be taken. (Ord. 916, 3-19-2012)
8-6-16: REMEDIES NOT EXCLUSIVE:
The remedies listed in this chapter are not exclusive of any other remedies
available under any applicable federal, state or local law and it is within the
discretion of the city of Montevideo to seek cumulative remedies. (Ord. 916, 3-

Grantee shall make use of existing poles and other above and below facilities
available to grantee to the extent it is technically and economically feasible
to do so.
   B.   Notwithstanding the above grant to use rights of way, no right of way
shall be used by grantee if city determines that such use is inconsistent with
the terms, conditions, or provisions by which such right of way was created or
dedicated, or with the present use of the right of way.
   C.   This franchise shall be nonexclusive, and city reserves the right to
grant a use of said rights of way to any person at any time during the period
of this franchise for the provision of cable service. The terms and conditions
of any such grant of use of the rights of way shall be, when taken as a whole
no less burdensome or more beneficial than those imposed upon grantee pursuant
to this franchise. (Ord. 827, 8-5-2002, eff. 8-26-2002)
9-1-4-3: LEASE OR ASSIGNMENT PROHIBITED:
No person may lease grantee's system for the purpose of providing cable service
until and unless such person shall have first obtained and shall currently hold
a valid franchise or other lawful authorization containing substantially
similar burdens and obligations to this franchise. Any assignment of rights
under this franchise shall be subject to and in accordance with the
requirements of section
9-1-11-5 of this chapter. This provision shall not prevent grantee from
complying with any commercial leased access requirements or any other provision
of applicable laws. (Ord. 827, 8-5-2002, eff. 8-26-2002)
9-1-4-4: FRANCHISE TERM:
This franchise shall be in effect for a period of ten (10) years from the date
of acceptance by grantee, unless sooner renewed, revoked or terminated as
herein provided. Pursuant to section
9-1-6 of this chapter, grantee has agreed to upgrade the cable system serving
the city to 750 MHz capacity on or before May 31, 2003. Section
9-1-6 of this chapter does not mandate that the grantee utilize fiber optics
for its distribution system as part of the upgrade. If grantee constructs and
activates fiber optics to replace existing trunk facilities within the city
serving subscriber nodes of seven hundred fifty (750) or fewer, this franchise
shall be automatically extended for an additional five (5) years bringing the
total franchise term to fifteen (15) years from date of acceptance. The
construction and activation of fiber as outlined above must be completed on or
before December 31, 2009. Grantee shall cooperate with any desired verification
by the city. (Ord. 827, 8-5-2002, eff. 8-26-2002)
9-1-4-5: PREVIOUS FRANCHISES:

9-1-4-6: COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS, RESOLUTIONS AND ORDINANCES:
   A.   The terms of this franchise shall define the contractual rights and
obligations of grantee with respect to the provision of cable service and
operation of the system in city. However, grantee shall at all times during the
term of this franchise be subject to all lawful exercise of the police power,
statutory rights, local ordinance making authority, and eminent domain rights
of city. This franchise may also be modified or amended with the written
consent of city and grantee as provided in section
9-1-14-3 of this chapter.
   B.   Grantee shall comply with the terms of any city ordinance or regulation
of general applicability which addresses usage of the rights of way within
city, which may have the effect of superseding, modifying or amending the terms
herein, except that grantee shall not, through application of such city
ordinance or regulation of rights of way, be subject to additional burdens with
respect to usage of rights of way which exceed burdens on similarly situated
rights of way users.
   C.   In the event of any conflict between this franchise and any city
ordinance or regulation which addresses usage of the rights of way, the
conflicting terms of this franchise shall govern.
   D.   In the event any city ordinance or regulation which addresses usage of
the rights of way adds to, modifies, amends, or otherwise differently addresses
issues addressed in this franchise, grantee shall comply with such ordinance or
regulation of general applicability, regardless of which requirement was first
adopted except that grantee shall not, through application of such city
ordinance or regulation of rights of way, be subject to additional burdens with
respect to usage of rights of way which exceed burdens on all similarly
situated rights of way users.
   E.   In the event grantee cannot determine how to comply with any right of
way requirement of city, whether pursuant to this franchise or other
requirement, grantee shall immediately provide written notice of such question,
including grantee's proposed interpretation, to city, in accordance with
section
9-1-4-9 of this chapter. City shall provide a written response within fourteen
(14) days of receipt indicating how the requirements cited by grantee apply.
Grantee may proceed in accordance with its proposed interpretation in the event
a written response is not received within seventeen (17) days of mailing or
delivering such written question. City will use all reasonable best efforts to
ensure that no right of way ordinance provisions unduly slow grantee's system
rebuild unless necessary to address health safety and welfare concerns. (Ord.

9-1-4-7: RULES OF GRANTEE:
Grantee shall have the authority to promulgate such rules, regulations, terms

9-1-4-8: TERRITORIAL AREA INVOLVED:
This franchise is granted for the corporate boundaries of city, as they exist
from time to time. In the event of annexation by city, or as development
occurs, any new territory shall become part of the territory for which this
franchise is granted; provided, however, that grantee shall only be required to
extend cable service beyond its present cable system boundaries pursuant to
section
9-1-6-9 of this chapter. Access to cable service shall not be denied to any
group of potential residential cable subscribers because of the income of the
residents of the area in which such group resides. Grantee shall be given a
reasonable period of time to construct and activate cable plant to cable
service annexed or newly developed areas but in no event to exceed nine (9)

detail for city to determine compliance with the franchise and applicable laws.
   D.   City may issue reasonable policy guidelines to all grantees to
establish procedures for determining how to control issuance of engineering
permits to multiple grantees for the use of the same rights of way for their
facilities. Grantee shall cooperate with city in establishing such policy and
comply with the procedures established by the city manager or his or her
designee to coordinate the issuance of multiple engineering permits in the same
right of way segments.
   E.   Failure to obtain permits or comply with permit requirements shall
subject grantee to all enforcement remedies available to city under applicable
laws or this franchise.

whenever commercially reasonable and shall not construct or install any new,
different or additional poles, conduits or other facilities on public property
until the written approval of city is obtained. No location or any pole or wire
holding structure of grantee shall be a vested interest, and such poles or
structures shall be removed or modified by grantee at its own expense whenever
city determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby.
   B.   The facilities of grantee shall be installed underground in those areas
of city where existing telephone and electric services are both underground at
the time of construction by grantee. In areas where either telephone or
electric utility facilities are installed aerially at the time of system
construction, grantee may install its facilities aerially; however, at such
time as the existing aerial facilities are placed underground, grantee shall
likewise place its facilities underground at its sole cost. If city requires
utilities to bury lines which are currently overhead, and the city financially
participates in said undergrounding, then the city will provide the same cost
sharing to the grantee. (Ord. 827, 8-5-2002, eff. 8-26-2002)
9-1-5-4: MINIMUM INTERFERENCE:

or damaged during the construction, repair, replacement, relocation, operation,
maintenance, expansion, extension or reconstruction of the system shall be
promptly and fully restored by grantee, at its expense, to a condition as good
as that prevailing prior to grantee's work, as determined by city. If grantee

Each grantee shall keep accurate installation records of the location of all
facilities in the rights of way and public ways and furnish them to city upon
request. Grantee shall cooperate with city to furnish such information in an
electronic mapping format, if possible, compatible with the then current city
electronic mapping format. Upon completion of new or relocation construction of
underground facilities in the rights of way and public ways, grantee shall
provide city with installation records in an electronic format, if possible
compatible with the then current city electronic mapping format showing the
location of the underground and aboveground facilities. (Ord. 827, 8-5-2002,
eff. 8-26-2002)
9-1-5-11: LOCATING FACILITIES:

   A.   When city uses its prior superior right to the rights of way and public
ways, grantee shall move its property that is located in the rights of way and
public ways, at its own cost, to such a location as city directs.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the public project is paid for
totally or in part by nonpublic funds, then grantee's costs of moving its
property shall be borne by the source of the nonpublic funds in the same ratio
as the nonpublic funds bear to the total project costs.
   B.   Nothing in this franchise shall be construed to prevent city from
constructing, maintaining, repairing or relocating sewers; grading, paving,
maintaining, repairing, relocating and/or altering any right of way;
constructing, laying down, repairing, maintaining or relocating any water
mains; or constructing, maintaining, relocating, or repairing any sidewalk or
other public work. (Ord. 827, 8-5-2002, eff. 8-26-2002)

conflict, the following shall apply:
   A.   Prior To City Notice To Proceed To Contractor: Grantee shall, within a
reasonable time, but in no event exceeding three (3) months, remove or relocate
the conflicting facility. This time period shall begin running upon receipt by
grantee of written notice from city. However, if both city and grantee agree,

   A.   Subject to grantee's compliance with section
9-1-5-13 of this chapter, if grantee's relocation effort so delays construction
of a public project causing city to be liable for delay damages, grantee shall
reimburse city for those damages attributable to the delay created by grantee.
In the event grantee should dispute the amount of damages attributable to
grantee, the matter shall be referred to the city engineer for a decision. In
the event that grantee disagrees with the city engineer's decision, the matter
shall be submitted to the city manager or the city manager's designee for
determination, whose decision shall be final and binding upon grantee as a
matter of city review, but nothing herein waives any right of appeal to the
courts.
   B.   In the event city becomes aware of a potential delay involving
grantee's facilities, city shall promptly notify grantee of this potential
delay. (Ord. 827, 8-5-2002, eff. 8-26-2002)

but not limited to, the implementation and the utilization of the access

facilities, the penalty shall be two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per day

by grantee to grantee's subscribers, less costs of prosecution, which shall
include, but not be limited to, reasonable attorney fees.
   C.   Each violation of any provision of this franchise shall be considered a
separate violation for which a separate penalty can be imposed.

conditions or provisions of this franchise, or for any other violation
contemplated in subsection B of this section, a written notice shall be given
to grantee informing it of such violation. At any time after thirty (30) days
(or such longer reasonable time which, in the sole determination of city, is
necessary to cure the alleged violation) following local receipt of notice,
provided grantee remains in violation of one or more terms, conditions or
provisions of this franchise, in the sole opinion of city, city may draw from
the letter of credit all penalties and other monies due city from the date of
the local receipt of notice.
   E.   Whenever the letter of credit is drawn upon, grantee may, within seven
(7) days of such draw, notify city in writing that there is a dispute as to
whether a violation or failure has in fact occurred. Such written notice by
grantee to city shall specify with particularity the matters disputed by
grantee. All penalties shall continue to accrue from the letter of credit
during any appeal.

a final decision within sixty (60) days thereafter.

credit delivered pursuant hereto, in whole or in part, grantee shall replace or
replenish to its full amount the same within ten (10) days and shall deliver to

the full amount stated in subsection A of this section as a substitution of the
previous letter of credit. This shall be a continuing obligation for any draws
upon the letter of credit.
   G.   If any letter of credit is not so replaced or replenished, city may
draw on said letter of credit for the whole amount thereof and use the proceeds
as city determines in its sole discretion. The failure to replace or replenish
any letter of credit may also, at the option of the city, be deemed a default
by grantee under this franchise. The drawing on the letter of credit by city,
and use of the money so obtained for payment or performance of the obligations,
duties and responsibilities of grantee which are in default, shall not be a
waiver or release of such default.
   H.   The collection by city of any damages, monies or penalties from the
letter of credit shall not affect any other right or remedy available to city,
nor shall any act, or failure to act, by city pursuant to the letter of credit,
be deemed a waiver of any right of city pursuant to this franchise or
otherwise. (Ord. 827, 8-5-2002, eff. 8-26-2002)

For purposes of this article, the following capitalized terms listed in
alphabetical order shall have the following meanings:
CITY: The city of Montevideo, county of Chippewa, state of Minnesota.
CITY UTILITY SYSTEM: Facilities used for providing public utility service owned
or operated by city or agency thereof, including sewer, storm sewer, water
service, street lighting and traffic signals, but excluding facilities for
providing heating, lighting or other forms of energy.
COMMISSION: The Minnesota public utilities commission, or any successor agency
or agencies, including an agency of the federal government which preempts all
or part of the authority to regulate electric retail rates now vested in the
Minnesota public utilities commission.
COMPANY: Northern States Power Company, a Minnesota corporation, DBA Xcel
Energy, its successors and assigns including all successors or assignees that
own or operate any part or parts of the electric facilities subject to this
franchise.
ELECTRIC FACILITIES: Electric transmission and distribution towers, poles,
conductors, lines, guys, anchors, conduits, fixtures, and necessary
appurtenances owned or operated by company for the purpose of providing
electric energy for public use.
NONBETTERMENT COSTS: Costs incurred by company from relocation, removal or
rearrangement of electric facilities that do not result in an improvement to
the electric facilities.
NOTICE: A writing served by either party on the other party. Notice to company
shall be mailed to the General Counsel, Legal Services, 414 Nicollet Mall, 5th
Floor, Minneapolis, MN 55401. Notice to the city shall be mailed to the City
Administrator, 103 Canton Ave., P.O. Box 517, Montevideo, MN 56265-0517. Either

9-2A-2: ADOPTION OF FRANCHISE:
   A.   Grant Of Franchise: City hereby grants company, for a period of twenty
(20) years from the date this article is passed and approved by the city, the
right to transmit and furnish electric energy for light, heat and power or
similar electric energy purposes for public and private use within and through
the limits of the city as its boundaries now exist or as they may be extended
in the future. For these purposes, company may construct, operate, repair and
maintain electric facilities in, on, over, under and across the public ways and
public grounds of city, subject to the provisions of this article. Company may
do all reasonable things necessary or customary to accomplish these purposes,
subject, however, to such reasonable regulations as may be imposed by the city
pursuant to this article and to the further provisions of this franchise
agreement.
   B.   Effective Date; Written Acceptance: This franchise shall be in force
and effect from and after the passage of this article and publication as
required by law and its acceptance by company. If company does not file a
written acceptance with the city within ninety (90) days after the date the
city council adopts this article, or otherwise places the city on notice before
that time that the company does not accept all terms of this franchise, the
city council by resolution may revoke this article or seek its enforcement in a
court of competent jurisdiction.
   C.   Service, Rates And Area: The service to be provided and the rates to be
charged by company for electric service in the city are subject to the
jurisdiction of the commission. The area within the city in which company may
provide electric service is subject to the provisions of Minnesota statutes,
section 216B.40.
   D.   Publication Expense: The expense of publication of this article will be
paid by city and reimbursed to city by company.
   E.   Dispute Resolution: If either party asserts that the other party is in
default in the performance of any obligation hereunder, the complaining party
shall notify the other party of the default and the desired remedy. The
notification shall be written. Representatives of the parties must promptly
meet and attempt in good faith to negotiate a resolution of the dispute. If the
dispute is not resolved within thirty (30) days of the written notice, the
parties may jointly select a mediator to facilitate further discussion. The
parties will equally share the fees and expenses of this mediator. If a
mediator is not used or if the parties are unable to resolve the dispute within
thirty (30) days after first meeting with the selected mediator, either party
may commence an action in district court to interpret and enforce this
franchise or for such other relief as may be permitted by law or equity.
   F.   Continuation Of Franchise: If the city and company are unable to agree
on the terms of a new franchise by the time this franchise expires, this
franchise will remain in effect until a new franchise is agreed upon, or until
ninety (90) days after the city or company serves written notice to the other
party of its intention to allow the franchise to expire, but in no event shall
this franchise continue for more than one year after expiration of the twenty
(20) year term set forth in subsection A of this section. (Ord. 886, 12-15-
2008)
9-2A-3: LOCATION, OTHER REGULATIONS:
   A.   Location Of Facilities: Electric facilities shall be located,
constructed and maintained so as not to interfere with the safety and
convenience of ordinary travel along and over public ways and so as not to
disrupt normal operation of any city utility system. Electric facilities shall
be located on public grounds as determined by the city. Company's construction,
reconstruction, operation, repair, maintenance location and relocation of
electric facilities shall be subject to any permit requirements authorized in a
separate ordinance and other reasonable regulations of the city, consistent
with authority granted the city to manage its public ways and public grounds
under state law, to the extent not inconsistent with a specific term of this
franchise agreement. Company may abandon underground electric facilities in
place, provided, at city's request, company will remove, at its own expense,
abandoned metal conduits or concrete encased conduit or other facilities
interfering with a city improvement project, to the extent such conduit is
uncovered by excavation conducted as part of the city's improvement project.
   B.   Street Openings: Company shall not open or disturb the surface of any
public way or public ground for any purpose without first having obtained a
permit from the city, if required by a separate ordinance, for which the city
may impose a reasonable fee. Permit conditions imposed on company shall not be
more burdensome than those imposed on other utilities for similar facilities or
work. Company may, however, open and disturb the surface of any public way or
public ground without permit if: 1) an emergency exists requiring the immediate
repair of electric facilities, and 2) company gives telephone, e-mail or
similar notice to the city before, if reasonably possible, commencement of the
emergency repair. Within two (2) business days after commencing the repair,
company shall apply for any required permits and pay any required fees.
   C.   Restoration: After undertaking any work requiring the opening of any
public way, company shall restore the public way in accordance with Minnesota
rules, part 7819.1100 and applicable city ordinances to the extent consistent
with law. Company shall restore the public ground to as good a condition as
formerly existed, and shall maintain any paved surface in good condition for
two (2) years thereafter, but shall have no obligation to water any grass or
other vegetation thereon. All work shall be completed as promptly as weather
permits. If company shall not promptly perform and complete the work, remove
all dirt, rubbish, equipment and material, and put the public ground in the
said condition, the city shall have, after demand to company to cure and the
passage of a reasonable period of time following the demand, but not to exceed
five (5) days, the right to make the restoration of the public ground at the
expense of company. Company shall pay to the city the cost of such work done
for or performed by the city. This remedy shall be in addition to any other
remedy available to the city for noncompliance with this subsection.
   D.   Performance Security: The city hereby waives any requirement in the
normal course of company operations, for company to post a construction
performance bond, certificate of insurance, letter of credit or any other form
of security or assurance that may be required under a separate existing or
future ordinance of the city, of a person or entity obtaining the city's
permission to install, replace or maintain facilities in a public way or the
public ground. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city reserves the right to
require a performance bond for new facilities installation, relocation,
replacement, or repairs, when the company's completion of its work is required
in order for the city to proceed with its work for constructing a public
improvement to the public way project on a timely basis.
   E.   Avoid Damage To Electric Facilities: Nothing in this article relieves
any person, including company, from liability arising out of the failure to
exercise reasonable care to avoid damaging electric facilities or other persons
or property while performing any activity.
   F.   Notice Of Improvements: The city shall give company reasonable written
notice of plans for improvements to public ways where the city has reason to
believe that electric facilities may affect or be affected by the improvement.
The notice must contain: 1) the nature and character of the improvements, 2)
the public ways upon which the improvements are to be made, 3) the extent of
the improvements, 4) the time when the city will start the work, and 5) if more
than one public way is involved, the order in which the work is to proceed. The
notice must be given to company a sufficient length of time, considering
seasonal working conditions, in advance of the actual commencement of the work
to permit company to make any necessary additions, alterations or repairs to
its electric facilities.
   G.   Shared Use Of Poles: Company shall make space available on its poles or
towers for city fire, water utility, police or other city facilities whenever
such use will not interfere with the use of such poles or towers by company, by
another electric utility, by a telephone utility, or by any cable television
company or other form of communication company. In addition, the city shall pay
for any added cost incurred by company because of such use by city.
   H.   Mapping Information: Company must promptly provide mapping information
for any of its underground electric facilities in accordance with Minnesota
rules parts 7819.4000 and 7819.4100. (Ord. 886, 12-15-2008)
9-2A-4: RELOCATIONS:
   A.   Relocation In Public Ways: Company shall comply with the requirements
of any applicable ordinance of the city relating to relocation of electric
facilities in public ways to the extent consistent with Minnesota rules, part
7819.3100 and applicable law.
   B.   Relocation In Public Ground: The city may require company at company's
expense to relocate or remove its electric facilities from public ground upon a
finding by city that the electric facilities have become or will become a
substantial impairment to the existing or proposed public use of the public
ground. Such relocation shall comply with applicable city ordinances consistent
with law.
   C.   Projects With Federal Funding: Relocation, removal, or rearrangement of
any electric facilities made necessary because of the extension into or through
city of a federally aided highway project shall be governed by the provisions
of Minnesota statutes section 161.46, as supplemented or amended. It is
expressly understood that the right herein granted to company is a valuable
property right and city shall not order company to remove or relocate its
facilities without compensation when a public way is vacated, improved or
realigned because of a renewal or a redevelopment plan which is financially
subsidized in whole or in part by the federal government or any agency thereof,
unless the reasonable nonbetterment costs of such relocation are first paid to
company. The city, however, is obligated to pay company only for those portions
of its relocation costs for which city has received federal funding
specifically allocated for relocation costs in the amount requested by the
company.
   D.   No Waiver: The provisions of this section apply only to electric
facilities constructed in reliance on a franchise from city and company does
not waive its rights under an easement or prescriptive right or state or county
permit. (Ord. 886, 12-15-2008)
9-2A-5: TREE TRIMMING:
Unless otherwise provided in any permit or other reasonable regulation required
by the city under separate ordinance, company may trim all trees and shrubs in
the public ways and public grounds of city to the extent company finds
necessary to avoid interference with the proper construction, operation, repair
and maintenance of any electric facilities installed hereunder, provided that
company shall save the city harmless from any liability arising therefrom.
(Ord. 886, 12-15-2008)
9-2A-6: INDEMNIFICATION:
   A.   Indemnity Of City: Company shall indemnify and hold the city harmless
from any and all liability on account of injury to persons or damage to
property occasioned by the construction, maintenance, repair, inspection, the
issuance of permits, or the operation of the electric facilities located in the
public ways and public grounds. The city shall not be indemnified for losses or
claims occasioned through its own negligence except for losses or claims
arising out of or alleging the city's negligence as to the issuance of permits
for, or inspection of, company's plans or work.
   B.   Defense Of City: In the event a suit is brought against the city under
circumstances where this agreement to indemnify applies, company at its sole
cost and expense shall defend the city in such suit if written notice thereof
is promptly given to company within a period wherein company is not prejudiced
by lack of such notice. If company is required to indemnify and defend, it will
thereafter have control of such litigation, but company may not settle such
litigation without the consent of the city, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. This section is not, as to third parties, a waiver of
any defense or immunity otherwise available to the city; and company, in
defending any action on behalf of the city shall be entitled to assert in any
action every defense or immunity that the city could assert in its own behalf.
This franchise agreement shall not be interpreted to constitute a waiver by the
city of any of its defenses of immunity or limitations on liability under
Minnesota statutes, chapter 466. (Ord. 886, 12-15-2008)
9-2A-7: VACATION OF PUBLIC WAYS:
The city shall give company at least two (2) weeks' prior written notice of a
proposed vacation of a public way. Except where required for a city improvement
project, the vacation of any public way, after the installation of electric
facilities, shall not operate to deprive company of its rights to operate and
maintain such electric facilities, until the reasonable cost of relocating the
same and the loss and expense resulting from such relocation are first paid to
company. In no case, however, shall the city be liable to company for failure
to specifically preserve a right of way under Minnesota statutes section
160.29. In accordance with Minnesota rules, part 7819.3200, if the city's order
directing vacation of the public way does not require relocation of the
company's electric facilities, the vacation proceedings shall not be deemed to
deprive company of its right to continue to use the right of way of the former
public way for its electric facilities installed prior to such order of
vacation. (Ord. 886, 12-15-2008)
9-2A-8: CHANGE IN FORM OF GOVERNMENT:
Any change in the form of government of the city shall not affect the validity
of this article. Any governmental unit succeeding the city shall, without the
consent of company, succeed to all of the rights and obligations of the city
provided in this article. (Ord. 886, 12-15-2008)
9-2A-9: FRANCHISE FEE:
The city, at the time of adopting this franchise agreement, does not desire to
require that company collect a franchise fee from its customers in the city. At
a future date during the term of this franchise agreement, the city may
determine that it desires company to collect a franchise fee of not more than
five percent (5%) of the company's gross revenues. The term "gross revenues"
means all sums, excluding any surcharge or similar addition to the company's
charges to customers for the purpose of reimbursing the company for the cost
resulting from the franchise fee, received by the company from the sale of
electricity to its retail customers within the corporate limits of the city. In
such event, the city may give company notice to amend this franchise agreement
to authorize collection of a franchise fee, in a percent of not more than five
percent (5%) to be set by the city, by separate ordinance in an amount per
class of customer and upon such terms and conditions as company at that time is
willing to incorporate in its electric franchise agreements. Upon receipt of
such notice company shall negotiate in good faith with city to so amend this
franchise agreement. (Ord. 886, 12-15-2008)
9-2A-10: PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE:
   A.   Severability: Every section, provision, or part of this article is
declared separate from every other section, provision, or part; and if any
section, provision, or part shall be held invalid, it shall not affect any
other section, provision, or part; provided, however, if any provision is held
invalid, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to substitute, to the
extent reasonably possible, amended provisions that validly carry out the
primary purpose of the invalid provisions. Where a provision of any other city
ordinance conflicts with the provisions of this article, the provisions of this
article shall prevail.
   B.   Limitation On Applicability: This article constitutes a franchise
agreement between the city and company as the only parties and no provision of
this franchise shall in any way inure to the benefit of any third person
(including the public at large) so as to constitute any such person as a third
party beneficiary of the agreement or of any one or more of the terms hereof,
or otherwise give rise to any cause of action in any person not a party hereto.
(Ord. 886, 12-15-2008)
9-2A-11: AMENDMENT PROCEDURE:
Either party to this franchise agreement may at any time propose that the
agreement be amended. This article may be amended at any time by the city
passing a subsequent ordinance declaring the provisions of the amendment, which
amendatory ordinance shall become effective upon the filing of company's
written consent thereto with the city clerk after city council adoption of the
amendatory ordinance. (Ord. 886, 12-15-2008)
9-2A-12: PREVIOUS FRANCHISES SUPERSEDED:
This franchise supersedes any previous electric franchise granted to company or
its predecessor. (Ord. 886, 12-15-2008)

of transmitting into and through said City such electric energy, provided that
such poles and transmission lines shall be so located as in no way to interfere

and alleys, and provided that said Grantee, its successors and assigns, in the
erection and maintenance of such poles, masts, wires, lamps, transformers,
fixtures and transmission lines, shall be subject to such reasonable
regulations as may be imposed by the City Council. (1998 Code)
9-2B-2: CONDITIONS AND PROVISIONS:
The rights herein granted to the Grantee, its successors and assigns, are
subject to the following conditions and provisions:
   A.   That the Grantee shall be subject to and will perform on its part, all
of the terms of chapter 10 as well as all other pertinent provisions of the
Charter of the City of Montevideo.
   B.   That the Grantee shall in no case claim or pretend to exercise any

the laying of pipes or conduits under the streets or public places, or for the
placing in the streets or other public places of any permanent or semi-
permanent fixtures whatsoever, shall be subject to the condition that the
Council shall have the power to require such alteration therein or relocation

acceptance of and consent to all of the terms, conditions and limitations
contained in this Article granting the franchise as well as of the provisions

11-5-2012)
9-3-3: CONDITIONS OF USE:
   A.   Location Of Facilities: Gas facilities must be located, constructed,
installed and maintained so as not to interfere with the city utility system or
the safety and convenience of ordinary travel along, over and under public
ways. The company's construction, reconstruction, operation, repair,
maintenance, location, and relocation of gas facilities is subject to other
reasonable ordinances and regulations of the city consistent with authority
granted to the city to manage its public ways and public grounds under state
law and to the extent not inconsistent with a specific term of this franchise.
   B.   Field Location: Field locations for their respective facilities will be
provided by the company and city in accordance with Minnesota statutes 216D,
under the Gopher State One Call system.
   C.   Right Of Way Permit Required: Except for the verification of field
location, the company may not open or disturb the surface of any public way or
public ground without first having obtained a right of way permit from the city
if required by a separate ordinance, for which the city may impose a reasonable
fee. The permit conditions imposed on the company may not be more burdensome
than those imposed on other entities for similar facilities or work. The
company may, however, open and disturb the surface of any public way or public
ground without a right of way permit if: 1) an emergency exists requiring the
immediate repair of gas facilities and 2) the company gives notice to the city
before, if possible, commencement of the emergency repair. Within two (2)
business days after commencing the repair, the company must apply for any
required permits and pay the required fees.
   D.   Restoration: After undertaking any work requiring the opening of any
public way, the company shall restore the public way in accordance with
Minnesota administrative rules, part 7819.1100 and applicable city ordinances
consistent with law. Company shall restore a public ground to as good a
condition as formerly existed. All work shall be completed as promptly as
weather permits, and if company shall not promptly perform and complete the
work, remove all dirt, rubbish, equipment and material, and put the public way
or public ground in the said condition, the city shall have, after demand to
company to cure and the passage of a reasonable period of time following the
demand, but not to exceed five (5) days, the right to make the restoration of
the public way or public ground at the expense of company.
This remedy is in addition to any other remedies available to the city for
noncompliance with this section, including, but not limited to, adherence to
the requirements of the right of way permit.
   E.   Avoid Damage To Gas Facilities: The company must take reasonable
measures to prevent the gas facilities from causing damage to persons or
property. The company must take reasonable measures to protect the gas
facilities from damage that could be inflicted on the gas facilities by
persons, property or the elements. The company must take protective measures
when the city performs work near the gas facilities, if given reasonable notice
by the city of such work prior to its commencement.
   F.   Notice Of Improvements: The city must give the company reasonable
written notice of plans for improvements to public ways or public grounds where
the city has reason to believe that gas facilities may affect or be affected by
the improvement. The notice will contain: 1) the nature and character of the
improvements, 2) the public ways or public grounds upon which the improvements
are to be made, 3) the extent of the improvements, 4) the time when the city
will start the work, and 5) if more than one public way or public ground is
involved, the order in which the work is to proceed. The notice will be given
to company a sufficient length of time, considering seasonal working
conditions, in advance of the actual commencement of the work to permit company
to make any additions, alterations or repairs to its gas facilities the company
deems necessary. The company shall have the right to request additional time in
advance of the actual commencement of the work if required to make any
necessary additions, alterations or repairs to its gas facilities.
   G.   Mapping Information: The city may require the company to provide
complete and accurate mapping information for any of its gas facilities in
accordance with the requirements of Minnesota rules 7819.4100. At the request
of company, any information requested by the engineer which qualifies as a
"trade secret" under Minnesota statutes section 13.37(b) shall be treated as
trade secret information as detailed therein. (Ord. 922, 11-5-2012)
9-3-4: RELOCATIONS:
   A.   Relocation Of Gas Facilities In Public Ways: The company shall comply
with Minnesota rules, part 7819.3100 and applicable city ordinances consistent
with law. The city must give reasonable written notice to the company that a
possible relocation of gas facilities is required. The engineer and company
representatives will meet in an attempt to resolve facilities conflict. To the
extent that an alternative to relocation of gas facilities which is reasonably
acceptable to city cannot be developed, the company must relocate its gas
facilities at its own expense. The city must give the company reasonable
written notice of plans to vacate for a city improvement project, or to grade,
regrade or change the alignment of any public way, or to construct or
reconstruct any city utility system.
   B.   Relocation Of Gas Facilities In Public Ground: The city may require the
company to relocate gas facilities from public ground upon a finding by the
city that the gas facilities have become or will become a substantial
impairment of the public use to which the public ground is or will be put. The
relocation or removal will be at the company's expense and shall comply with
applicable city ordinances consistent with law. The provision of this
subsection applies only to gas facilities constructed in reliance on this
franchise and the company does not waive its rights under an easement or
prescriptive right in the public ground.
   C.   Vacation Of Public Ways: The city must give the company at least two
(2) weeks' notice of a proposed vacation of a public way. The city and the
company shall comply with Minnesota rules 7819.3200 and applicable ordinances
consistent with law. Except where required for a city street or other
improvement project or as otherwise provided in subsection B of this section,
the vacation of a public way, after the installation of gas facilities, does
not deprive the company of its rights to operate and maintain the gas
facilities until the reasonable cost of relocating the same and the loss and
expense resulting from such relocation are first paid to the company by the
city or the party requesting the vacation. The city is not liable to the
company for failure to specifically preserve a right of way in the manner
permitted by law.
   D.   Projects With Federal Funding: Relocation, removal or rearrangement of
any gas facilities made necessary because of the extension into or through the
city of a federally aided highway project will be governed by the provisions of
Minnesota statutes section 161.46. (Ord. 922, 11-5-2012)
9-3-5: DEFENSE AND INDEMNIFICATION:
   A.   Indemnification Of City: Company shall indemnify and hold harmless the
city from any and all liability on account of injury to persons or damage to
property occasioned by the construction, maintenance, repair, inspection of,
the issuance of permits, or the operation of the gas facilities located in the
public ways and public grounds. The city shall not be indemnified or held
harmless for liability, losses, claims, proceedings or causes of action caused
through its own negligence except for liability, losses, claims, proceedings or
actions arising out of or alleging the city's negligence as to the issuance of
permits for, or inspection of, the gas facilities or company's plans.
   B.   Defense Of City: In the event a suit, action, claim or proceeding is
brought against the city under circumstances where this agreement to indemnify
applies, the company shall, at its sole cost and expense, defend the city in
such suit, action, claim or proceeding if written notice thereof is promptly
given to the company within a period of time wherein the company is not
prejudiced by lack of such notice. If the company is required to indemnify and
defend the city, the company shall have control of the defense. Company may not
settle such suit, action, claim or proceeding without the consent of the city,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. This section is not, and
shall not be interpreted or shall not constitute as to third parties, a waiver
of any defense or immunity available to the city. The company, in defending any
suit, action, claim or proceeding on behalf of the city, shall be entitled to
assert in such suit, action, claim or proceeding every defense or immunity the
city could assert on its own behalf. This franchise agreement shall not be
interpreted to constitute a waiver by the city of any of its defenses of
immunity or limitations on liability pursuant to Minnesota law or statute.
   C.   Bond: If the city has reasonable cause to believe that MDU Resources
Group, Inc., does not have the financial ability to perform its obligations
under this chapter, the city may require the company to post a bond for any
damages or loss suffered by city as a result of such failure including attorney
fees and costs. (Ord. 922, 11-5-2012)

This chapter and the rights and obligations conferred hereby, is binding on and
inures to the benefit of the city and its successors and on the company and its
successors and permitted assigns. This chapter and the franchise it confers may

consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The city shall be entitled to
reimbursement from company for all reasonable and direct legal, administrative
and consulting costs and fees associated with city's review of any request to
assign or transfer. (Ord. 922, 11-5-2012)
9-3-7: CHANGE IN FORM OF GOVERNMENT:
Any change in the form of government of the city shall not affect the validity
of this chapter. Any governmental unit succeeding the city shall, without the
consent of company, succeed to all of the rights and obligations of the city
provided in this chapter. (Ord. 922, 11-5-2012)
9-3-8: FRANCHISE FEE:
   A.   Separate Ordinance: The city hereby reserves the right to implement, by
passage of a separate ordinance, a franchise fee to be collected and remitted
by the company to the city. Said franchise fee will be in accordance with state
law and regulations. In the event such a franchise fee is implemented, the
company agrees to make available for inspection by the city, at reasonable
times all records necessary to audit the company's determination of the
franchise fee payments. The separate ordinance shall not be adopted until at
least thirty (30) days after written notice enclosing such proposed ordinance
has been served upon the company. The fee shall become effective ten (10) days
after written notice enclosing such adopted ordinance has been served upon the
company by certified mail.
   B.   Condition Of Fee: The separate ordinance imposing the fee shall not be
effective against the company unless it lawfully imposes a fee of the same or
substantially similar amount on the sale of gas energy within the city by any
other gas energy supplier, provided that, as to such supplier, the city has the
authority or contractual right to require a franchise fee or similar fee
through a previously agreed upon franchise.
   C.   Collection Of Fee: The franchise fee shall be payable not less than
quarterly during complete billing months of the period for which payment is to
be made. The franchise fee formula may be changed from time to time, however,
the change shall meet the same notice requirements and the fee may not be
changed more often than annually. Such fee shall not exceed any amount that the
company may legally charge to its customers prior to payment to the city. Such
fee is subject to subsequent reductions to account for uncollectibles and
customer refunds incurred by the company. The company agrees to make available
for inspection by the city at reasonable times all records necessary to audit
the company's determination of the franchise fee payments.
   D.   Continuation Of Franchise Fee: The franchise fee, if any, being imposed
by the city at the time the most recent of any previous franchise granted to
the company by the city expired remains in effect until it is changed in the
manner provided for implementation of such fee. If this franchise expires and
city and the company are unable to agree upon terms of a new franchise, the
franchise fee, if any, being imposed by the city at the time this franchise
expires, will remain in effect until a new franchise is agreed upon. (Ord. 922,

the city, company shall serve all inhabitants of such additional territory in
the same manner and on the same terms as those of the territory now within its
limits. In the event that such additional service requires extension of the gas
facilities, such extensions shall be subject to the provisions of the
applicable rate schedules and general terms attached to the rate schedules as
filed by the company with the Minnesota public utilities commission, all of
which are by reference made part of this franchise. Should said extension of
gas facilities be deemed by the company as not economically feasible, company
shall allow a third party to make a contribution in aid of construction in the
amount of the difference in cost between the total project cost and the amount
that is determined to be financially feasible by the company. This contribution
in aid of construction shall not constitute an ownership position of the gas
facilities by the contributing third party. Failure on the part of the company
to allow a third party to make such a contribution may be considered a default
in the performance hereof, subject to subsection
9-3-2F of this chapter. (Ord. 922, 11-5-2012)

constitute any such person as a third party beneficiary of the agreement or of
any one or more of the terms hereof, or otherwise give rise to any cause of
action in any person not a party hereto. (Ord. 922, 11-5-2012)

continuous gas utility service to any group of customers, for any reason within
the company's reasonable control, including, but not limited to, insolvency or
due to a dispute with its gas source(s) or gas transporters, that the
commission deems to be a failure of service, the company hereby agrees that the
city and affected customers may be irreparably harmed and that the city may
take emergency action as necessary, in any court or administrative agency of
competent jurisdiction. In that event, company shall cooperate and do all
things within its control to restore service or allow the city to step in or

   F.   Denial For Noncompliance: If the planning commission recommends denial
of a conditional use permit or the council orders such denial, it shall include
in its recommendation or determination findings indicating in which areas the
proposed use does not comply with the standards required by this title.
   G.   Permittee: A conditional use permit shall be issued for a particular
use and not for a particular person, except in the case of a permit granted for
the uses of land reclamation, mining or soil or mineral processing. In such

another without the written consent of the city. However, such consent by the
city shall not be unreasonably withheld.
   H.   Periodic Review, Term Of Permit: A periodic review of the use may be
attached as a condition of approval of a conditional use permit. Unless
otherwise stipulated, the term shall be the life of the use.
   I.   Revocation: Failure to comply with any condition set forth in a
conditional use permit, or any other violation of this title, shall be a
misdemeanor and shall also constitute sufficient cause for the termination of
the conditional use permit by the city council following a public hearing.
   J.   Expiration: If substantial construction has not taken place within six
(6) months of the date on which the conditional use permit was granted, the
permit is void except that, on application, the council, after receiving
recommendation from the planning commission, may extend the permit for such
additional period as it deems appropriate. If the conditional use is
discontinued for six (6) months, the conditional use permit shall become void.
This provision shall apply to conditional use permits issued prior to the
effective date hereof, but the six (6) month period shall not be deemed to
commence until the effective date hereof. (Ord. 826, 7-15-2002)
11-3-8: VARIANCES:
   A.   Criteria For Granting Variances: A variance to the provision of this
title may be recommended by the board of zoning adjustment to provide relief to
the landowner in those cases where this title imposes undue hardship or
practical difficulties to the property owner in the use of the land. No use
variances may be issued. A variance may be granted only in the event that all
of the following circumstances exist:
      1.   Exception or extraordinary circumstances apply to the property which
do not apply generally to other properties in the same zone or vicinity and
result from lot size or shape, topography or other circumstances over which the
owners of property since enactment of this title have had no control.
      2.   The literal interpretation of the provisions of this title would
deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the
same district under the terms of this title.
      3.   That the special conditions or circumstances do not result from the
actions of the applicant.
      4.   That granting the variance requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this title to owners of other
lands, structures or buildings in the same district.
      5.   That the variance requested is the minimum variance. Economic
conditions alone shall not be considered a hardship.
      6.   The variance would not be materially detrimental to the purposes of
this title, or to other property in the same zone.
      7.   The proposed variance will not impair an adequate supply of light
and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the congestion of the
public streets, or substantially diminish or impair property values within the
neighborhood.
   B.   Required Exhibits For Variances:
      1.   Required Information: A boundary description and preliminary
building and site development plan subject to approval of the zoning
administrator. The board of zoning adjustment may require a certified survey.
      2.   Proof Of Ownership: Evidence of ownership or enforceable option on
the property.
   C.   Procedures: The procedure for obtaining a variance from the regulations
of this title are as follows:

exhibits to the board of zoning adjustment within thirty (30) days after
receipt, and shall notify all property owners within the affected zone and
within one hundred feet (100') of the outer boundaries of the property in
question; however, failure of any property owner to receive such notification
shall not invalidate the proceedings.
      4.   Notice Of Hearing: The zoning administrator shall set the date for a
public hearing and shall have notice of such hearing published in the legal
newspaper at least once, not less than ten (10) days and not more than thirty
(30) days prior to said hearing.
      5.   Hearing: The board of zoning adjustment shall hold a public hearing
on the proposed variance and shall make a decision on the proposal within
thirty (30) days. The board of zoning adjustment may impose such restrictions
and conditions upon the premises benefited by a variance as may be necessary to
comply with the standards established by this title, or to reduce or minimize
the effect of such variance upon other properties in the neighborhood, and to
better carry out the intent of the variance. The board of zoning adjustment
shall take one of three (3) actions, i.e., approval, denial or conditional
approval.
      6.   Action By City Council: The city council shall act upon the
application within thirty (30) days after receiving the recommendation of the
board of zoning adjustment.
      7.   Right To Appeal: The applicant shall have the right to appeal the
decision of the board of zoning adjustment to the city council within ten (10)
days after the decision by the board.
      8.   Reapplication: No application by a property owner for a variance
shall be submitted to the board of appeals within a six (6) month period
following a denial of such a request, except the board may permit a new
application if, in the opinion of the board, new evidence of change or
circumstances warrant it.
      9.   Expiration: A variance shall be deemed to authorize only one
particular use and shall expire if work does not commence within six (6) months
of the date of granting such variance or if that use ceases for more than six
(6) consecutive months.
      10.   Revocation: The city council may revoke a variance if any
conditions established as part of granting the variance request are violated,
following a public hearing. (1998 Code)

ORDINANCE. Those sections of land affected by this Chapter are indicated in
Exhibit A on file in the office of the City Clerk. (1998 Code)
11-11-2: PURPOSE AND AUTHORITY:
The Montevideo/Chippewa County Joint Airport Zoning Board, created and
established by joint action of the Common Council of the City, the Board of
County Commissioners of Chippewa County and the Town Boards of Sparta and
Rosewood Townships pursuant to the provisions and authority of Minnesota
Statutes section 360.063, hereby finds and declares that;
   A.   Effect Of Hazards: An airport hazard endangers the lives and property
of users of the Montevideo/Chippewa County Airport, and property or occupants
of land in its vicinity, and also, if of the obstructive type, in effect
reduces the size of the area available for the landing, takeoff, and
maneuvering of aircraft, thus tending to destroy or impair the utility of the
Montevideo/Chippewa County Airport and the public investment therein.
   B.   Creation Of Hazards A Nuisance: The creation or establishment of an
airport hazard is a public nuisance and an injury to the region served by the
Montevideo/Chippewa County Airport.
   C.   Necessary Prohibition: For the protection of the public health, safety,
order, convenience, prosperity, and general welfare, and for the promotion of
the most appropriate use of land, it is necessary to prevent the creation or
establishment of airport hazards.
   D.   Prevention: The prevention of these airport hazards should be
accomplished, to the extent legally possible, by the exercise of the police
power without compensation.
   E.   Public Funds To Abate: The prevention of the creation or establishment
of airport hazards and the elimination, removal, alteration, mitigation,
marking or lighting of existing airport hazards are public purposes for which
political subdivisions may raise and expend public funds. (1998 Code)

set forth above, the following airspace zones are hereby established: Primary
Zone, Horizontal Zone, Conical Zone, Approach Zone, and Transitional Zone and
whose locations and dimensions are as follows:
      1.   Primary Zone:
         a.    All that land which lies directly under an imaginary primary
surface longitudinally centered on a runway and:
            (1)   Extending 200 feet beyond each end of Runways 14-32 and 06-
24.
            (2)   Coinciding with each end of Runway 03-21.
         b.   The elevation of any point on the primary surface is the same as
the elevation of the nearest point on the runway center line. The width of the
primary surface is:
            (1)   500 feet for Runways 14-32 and 6-24.
            (2)   250 feet for Runway 03-21.
      2.   Horizontal Zone: All that land which lies directly under an
imaginary horizontal surface 150 feet above the established airport elevation,
or a height of 1184.5 feet above mean sea level, the perimeter of which is
constructed by swinging arcs of specified radii from the center of each end of
the primary surface of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by lines
tangent to those arcs. The radius of each arc is 6,000 feet for Runways 14-32,
06-24 and 03-21.
      3.   Conical Zone: All that land which lies directly under an imaginary
conical surface extending upward and outward from the periphery of the
horizontal surface at a slope of 20 to 1 for a horizontal distance of 4,000
feet as measured radially outward from the periphery of the horizontal surface.
      4.   Approach Zone:
         a.   All that land which lies directly under an imaginary approach
surface longitudinally centered on the extended center line at each end of a
runway. The inner edge of the approach surface is at the same width and
elevation as, and coincides with, the end of the primary surface. The approach
surface inclines upward and outward at a slope of:
            (1)   40:1 for Runways 14-32 and 06-24.
            (2)   20:1 for Runway 03-21.
         b.   The approach surface expands uniformly to a width of:
            (1)   3,500 feet for Runway 14-32 at a distance of 10,000 feet to
the periphery of the conical surface.
            (2)   3,500 feet for Runway 06-24 at a distance of 10,000 feet to
the periphery of the conical surface.
            (3)   2,250 feet for Runway 03-21 at a distance of 10,000 feet to
the periphery of the conical surface.
      5.   Transitional Zone: All that land which lies directly under an
imaginary surface extending upward and outward at right angles to the runway
center line and center line extended at a slope of 7 to 1 from the sides of the
primary surfaces and from the sides of the approach surfaces until they
intersect the horizontal surface or the conical surface.
   B.   Height Restrictions: Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, and
except as necessary and incidental to airport operations, no structure or tree
shall be constructed, altered, maintained or allowed to grow in an airspace
zone created in subsection A of this Section so as to project above any of the
imaginary airspace surfaces described in said subsection A hereof. Where an
area is covered by more than one height limitation, the more restrictive
limitations shall prevail.
   C.   Boundary Limitations: The airspace obstruction height zoning
restrictions set forth in this Section shall apply for a distance not to exceed
one and one-half (11/2) miles beyond the perimeter of the airport boundary and
in that portion of an airport hazard area under the approach zone for a
distance not exceeding two (2) miles from the airport boundary. (1998 Code)
11-11-5: LAND USE SAFETY ZONING:
   A.   Safety Zone Boundaries: In order to carry out the purpose of this
Chapter, as set forth above and also, in order to restrict those uses which may
be hazardous to the operational safety of aircraft operating to and from the
Montevideo/Chippewa County Airport, and furthermore to limit population and
building density in the runway approach areas, thereby creating sufficient open
space so as to protect life and property in case of an accident, there are
hereby created and established the following land use safety zones:
      1.   Safety Zone A: All land in that portion of the approach zones of a
"runway", as defined in subsection
11-11-4A of this Chapter, which extends outward from the end of primary surface
a distance equal to two-thirds (2/3) of the planned length of the runway, which
distance shall be:
         a.   2,670 feet for Runway 14-32.
         b.   2,400 feet for Runway 06-24
         c.   1,667 feet for Runway 03-21.
      2.   Safety Zone B: All land in that portion of the approach zones of a
"runway" as defined in subsection
11-11-4A of this Chapter, which extends outward from Safety Zone A a distance
equal to one- third (1/3) of the planned length of the runway, which distance
shall be:
         a.   1,330 feet for Runway 14-32.
         b.   1,200 feet for Runway 06-24.

         e.   The following uses are specifically prohibited in Zone B:
churches, hospitals, schools, theaters, stadiums, hotels and motels, trailer
courts, campgrounds, and other places of frequent public or semi-public
assembly.
      4.   Zone C: Zone C is subject only to height restrictions set forth in
subsection
11-11-4B of this Chapter, and to the general restrictions contained in
subsection B1 of this Section.
      5.   Exemptions - Established Residential Neighborhoods:
         a.   Land uses which existed as of July 2, 1979 in the established
residential neighborhoods set forth in subsection A4 above, and as shown on the
Zoning Map are subject to the height restrictions of subsection
11-11-4B of this Chapter and the general restrictions of subsection B1 of this
Section. Land uses which come into existence after July 2, 1979 are treated as
though they were not in a designated established residential neighborhood and
are subject to the Zone A or Zone B restrictions as the case may be.
         b.   Land uses in established residential neighborhoods which violate
any of the following restrictions are prohibited as safety hazards and must be
acquired, altered or removed at public expense. Those conditions are as
follows:
            (1)   The following land uses if they exist in Safety Zones A or B
and in an established residential neighborhood in a built-up urban area are
considered by the State Commissioner to constitute airport safety hazards so
severe, either to persons on the ground or to the air-traveling public, or
both, that they are hereby prohibited:
               (A)    Any structure which a person or persons customarily use
as a principal residence and which is located entirely inside Safety Zone A
within one thousand feet (1,000') of the end of the primary zone;
               (B)    Any structure which a person or persons customarily use
as a principal residence and which is located entirely within Safety Zones A or
B and which penetrates an imaginary approach surface as defined by subsection
11-11-4A of this Chapter;
               (C)    Any land use in Safety Zone A or B which violates any of
the following standards:
                  (i)    The land use must not create or cause interference
with the operation of radio or electronic facilities on the airport or with
radio or electronic communications between the airport and aircraft;
                  (ii)    The land use must not make it difficult for pilots to
distinguish between airport lights and other lights;
                  (iii)    The land use must not result in glare in the eyes of
pilots using the airport or impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport;
               (D)    Any isolated residential building lot zoned for single-
family or two-family residences on which any structure, if built, would be
prohibited by subsection B5b(1)(A), above. An "isolated" residential building
lot is one located in an area in which the predominant land use is single-
family or two-family residential structures; and
               (E)    Any other land use which presents, in the opinion of the
State Commissioner, a material danger to the landing, taking off or maneuvering
of aircraft or to the safety of persons on the ground. In making such a
determination, the State Commissioner shall consider the following factors:
                  (i)    Possibility that the land use may contribute to or
cause a collision of two (2) or more aircraft or an aircraft and some other
object;
                  (ii)    Possibility that the land use may, in case of an
aircraft accident, cause an explosion, fire or the release of harmful or
noxious fumes, gases or substances;
                  (iii)    Tendency of the land use to increase the number of
persons that would be injured in case of an aircraft accident;
                  (iv)    Effect of the land use on availability of clear areas
for emergency landings; and
                  (v)    Flight patterns around the airport, the extent of use
of the runway in question, the type of aircraft using the airport, whether the
runways are lighted, whether the airport is controlled, and other similar
factors.
   C.   Boundary Limitations: The land use zoning restrictions set forth in
this Section shall apply for a distance not to exceed one mile beyond the
perimeter of the airport boundary and in that portion of an airport hazard area
under the approach zone for a distance not exceeding two (2) miles from the
airport boundary. (1998 Code)
11-11-6: AIRPORT ZONING MAP:
The several zones herein established are shown on the Montevideo/Chippewa
County Airport Zoning Map consisting of four (4) sheets, prepared by Thomas N.
Rodeberg, and dated April 15, 1983, on file in the office of the City Clerk and
made a part hereof, which Map, together with such amendments thereto as may
from time to time be made, and all notations, references, elevations, data,
zone boundaries, and other information thereon, shall be and the same is hereby
adopted as part of this Chapter. (1998 Code)
11-11-7: NONCONFORMING USES; REGULATIONS NOT RETROACTIVE:
The regulations prescribed by this Chapter shall not be construed to require
the removal, lowering, or other changes or alteration of any structure or tree
not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date of the Ordinance
codified in this Chapter, and Title 2, Chapter 3 of this Code, or otherwise
interfere with the continuance of any nonconforming use. Nothing herein
contained shall require any change in the construction, alteration, or intended
use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior
to the effective date of the Ordinance codified in this Chapter and Title 2,
Chapter 3 of this Code, and is diligently prosecuted and completed within two
(2) years thereof. (1998 Code)
11-11-8: PERMITS:
   A.   Future Uses:
      1.   Except as specifically provided in subsection A2 and A3 hereunder,
no material change shall be made in the use of land and no structure shall be
erected, altered or otherwise established in any zone hereby created unless a
permit therefor shall have been applied for and granted by the Airport Zoning
Administrator, hereinafter provided for. Each application for a permit shall
indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient
particularity to permit it to conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If
such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted.
      2.   However, a permit for a tree or structure of less than seventy five
feet (75') of vertical height above the ground shall not be required in the
horizontal and conical zones or in any approach and transitional zones beyond a
horizontal distance of four thousand two hundred feet (4,200') from each end of
the runway, except when such tree or structure, because of terrain, land
contour, or topographic features, would extend the height or land use limit
prescribed for the respective zone.
      3.   Nothing contained in this foregoing exception shall be construed as
permitting or intending to permit any construction, alteration, or growth or
any structure or tree in excess of any of the height limitations established by
this Chapter as set forth in Section
11-11-4 of this Chapter and the land use limitations set forth in Section
11-11-5 of this Chapter.
   B.   Existing Uses: Before any existing use or structure may be replaced,
substantially altered or repaired, or rebuilt within any zone established
herein, a permit must be secured authorizing such replacement, change or
repair. No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or
creation of an airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree
to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date
of the Ordinance codified in this Chapter or any amendments thereto, or than it
is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all
applications for such a permit shall be granted.
   C.   Nonconforming Uses Abandoned Or Destroyed: Whenever the Airport Zoning
Administrator determines that a nonconforming structure or tree has been
abandoned or more than eighty percent (80%) torn down, deteriorated, or
decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to
exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning
regulations. Whether application is made for a permit under this subsection or
not, the Airport Zoning Administrator may order the owner of the abandoned or
partially destroyed nonconforming structure, at such owner's own expense, to
lower, remove, reconstruct, or equip the same in the manner necessary to
conform to the provisions of this Chapter. In the event the owner of the
nonconforming structure shall neglect or refuse to comply with such order for
ten (10) days after receipt of written notice of such order, the Airport Zoning
Administrator may, by appropriate legal action, proceed to have the
nonconforming structure lowered, removed, reconstructed, or equipped and assess
the cost and expense thereof against the land on which the structure is or was
located. Unless such an assessment is paid within ninety (90) days from the
service of notice thereof on the owner of the land, the sum shall bear interest
at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum from the date the cost and expense
is incurred until paid and shall be collected in the same manner as are general
taxes. (1998 Code)
11-11-9: VARIANCES:
Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit
the growth of any tree, or use such person's property not in accordance with
the regulations prescribed in this Chapter, may apply to the Airport Board of
Adjustment, as provided for in Title 2, Chapter 3 of this Code, for a variance
from such regulations. If a person submits an application for a variance by
certified mail to the members of the Board and the Board fails to grant or deny
the variance within four (4) months after the last member receives the
application, the variance shall be deemed to be granted by the Board. When the
variance is granted by reason of the failure of the Board to act on the
variance, the person receiving the variance shall notify the Board and the
State Commissioner of Transportation by certified mail that the variance has
been granted. The applicant shall include a copy of the original application
for the variance with this notice to the State Commissioner. The variance shall
be effective sixty (60) days after this notice is received by the Commissioner
subject to any action taken by the Commissioner pursuant to Minnesota Statutes
section 360.063, subdivision 6a. Such variances shall be allowed where it is
duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations would
result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and relief granted would
not be contrary to the public interest but do substantial justice and be in
accordance with the spirit of this Chapter, provided any variance so allowed
may be subject to any reasonable conditions that the Board of Adjustment or
State Commissioner may deem necessary to effectuate the purpose of this
Chapter. (1998 Code)
11-11-10: HAZARD MARKING AND LIGHTING:
   A.   Nonconforming Uses: The owner of any nonconforming structure or tree is
hereby required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon
of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the Airport Zoning
Administrator to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the
airport the presence of such airport hazards. Such markers and lights shall be
installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the City and County.
   B.   Permits And Variances: Any permit or variance granted by the Airport
Zoning Administrator or Airport Board of Adjustment as the case may be, may, if
such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this Chapter and
be reasonable in the circumstances, so condition such permit or variance as to
require the owner of the structure or tree in question at such person's own
expense, to install, operate, and maintain thereon such markers and lights as
may be necessary to indicate to pilots the presence of an airport hazard. (1998
Code)
11-11-11: AIRPORT ZONING ADMINISTRATOR:
   A.   It shall be the duty of the Montevideo City Manager to administer and
enforce the regulations prescribed herein. Applications for permits and
variances shall be made to the Airport Zoning Administrator upon a form
furnished by the Zoning Administrator. Permit applications shall be promptly
considered and granted or denied by the Zoning Administrator in accordance with
the regulations prescribed herein. The Zoning Administrator shall promptly
notify the applicant whether the permit application has been granted or denied.
   B.   Variance applications shall be forthwith transmitted by the Zoning
Administrator for action by the Airport Board of Adjustment provided for in
Title 2, Chapter 2 of this Code. (1998 Code)
11-11-12: APPEALS:
   A.   Any person aggrieved, or any taxpayer affected by any decision of the
Airport Zoning Administrator made in the administration of this Chapter may
appeal to the Airport Board of Adjustment. Such appeals may also be made by any
governing body of a municipality, county, or airport zoning board, which is of
the opinion that a decision of the Zoning Administrator is an improper
application of this Chapter as it concerns such governing body or board.
   B.   All appeals hereunder must be commenced within thirty (30) days of the
Airport Zoning Administrator's decision, by filing with the Zoning
Administrator a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The Zoning
Administrator shall forthwith transmit to the Airport Board of Adjustment all
the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was
taken. In addition, any person aggrieved, or any taxpayer affected by any
decisions of the Zoning Administrator made in the administration of this
Chapter who desires to appeal such decision shall submit an application for a
variance by certified mail to the members of the Board of Adjustment in the
manner set forth in Minnesota Statute section 360.068, subdivision 2.
   C.   An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action
appealed from, unless the Airport Zoning Administrator certifies to the Airport
Board of Adjustment after the notice of appeal has been filed with it, that by
reason of the facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in the Zoning
Administrator's opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such
case, proceedings shall not be stayed except by order of the Board of
Adjustment on notice to the Zoning Administrator and on due cause shown.
   D.   The Airport Board of Adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for hearing
appeals, give public notice and due notice to the parties in interest, and
decide the same within a reasonable time. Upon the hearing any party may appear
in person or by agent or by attorney. The Board of Adjustment shall promptly
notify the appellant of its decision on any appeal.
   E.   The Airport Board of Adjustment may, in conformity with the provisions
of this Chapter and Title 2, Chapter 3, reverse or affirm, in whole or in part,
or modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from and
may make such order, requirement, decision or determination, as may be
appropriate under the circumstances, and to that end shall have all the powers
of the Airport Zoning Administrator. (1998 Code)
11-11-13: JUDICIAL REVIEW:
Any person aggrieved, or any taxpayer affected by any decision of the Airport
Board of Adjustment, or any governing body of a municipality, county, or
airport zoning board, which is of the opinion that a decision of the Board of
Adjustment is illegal may present to the District Court of Chippewa County a
verified petition setting forth that the decision or action is illegal, in
whole or in part, and specifying the grounds of the illegality. Such petition
shall be presented to the Court within thirty (30) days after the decision is
filed in the office of the Board of Adjustment. The petitioner must exhaust the
remedies provided in this Chapter before availing himself of the right to
petition the Court as provided by this Section. (1998 Code)
11-11-14: CONFLICTS:
Where there exists a conflict between any of the regulations or limitations
prescribed in this Chapter and Title 2, Chapter 3 of this Code and any other
regulations applicable to the same area, whether the conflict be with respect
to the height of structures or trees, the use of land, or any other matter, the
more stringent limitation or regulation shall govern and prevail. (1998 Code)
11-11-15: SEVERABILITY:
   A.   In any case in which the provisions of this Chapter and Title 2,
Chapter 3 of this Code, although generally reasonable, are held by a court to
interfere with the use or enjoyment of a particular structure or parcel of land
to such an extent, or to be so onerous in their application to such a structure
or parcel of land, as to constitute a taking or deprivation of that property in
violation of the Constitution of this State or the Constitution of the United
States, such holding shall not affect the application of this Chapter and Title
2 Chapter 3 of this Code as to other structures and parcels of land, and to
this end the provisions of this Chapter and Title 2 Chapter 3 of this Code are
declared to be severable.
   B.   Should any section or provision of this Chapter and Title 2 Chapter 3
of this Code be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such
decision shall not affect the validity of this Chapter and Title 2, Chapter 3
of this Code as a whole or any part thereof other than the parts so declared to
be unconstitutional or invalid. (1998 Code)

1984. Copies thereof shall be filed with the Commissioner of Transportation,
Division of Aeronautics, State of Minnesota and the County Recorder, Chippewa
County, Minnesota. (1998 Code)
11-11-17: PENALTY:
Every person who shall construct, establish, substantially change, alter or
repair any existing structure or use, or permit the growth of any tree without
having complied with the provision of the Ordinance codified in this Chapter
and Title 2, Chapter 3 of this Code, or who, having been granted a permit or
variance under the provisions of the Ordinance codified in this Chapter and
Title 2, Chapter 3 of this Code, shall construct, establish, substantially
change or substantially alter or repair any existing growth or structure, or
permit the growth of any tree, except as permitted by such permit or variance,
shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be subject to penalty as provided in
Section
1-4-1 of this Code. Each day a violation continues to exist shall constitute a
separate offense. The Airport Zoning Administrator may enforce all provisions
of this Chapter through such proceedings for injunctive relief and other relief
as may be proper under the laws of Minnesota Statute section 360.073 and other
applicable law. (1998 Code)

11-12-1: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE:
   A.   Statutory Authorization: The legislature of the State of Minnesota has,
in Minnesota Statutes chapter 103F and section 462.357 delegated the
responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations designed to
minimize flood losses. Therefore, the City Council does ordain as follows.
   B.   Findings Of Fact:
      1.   Periodic Inundation: The flood hazard areas of Montevideo, are
subject to periodic inundation which results in potential loss of life, loss of
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety and general welfare.
      2.   Methods Used To Analyze Flood Hazards: This Chapter is based upon a
reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which is consistent with the
standards established by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.
   C.   Statement Of Purpose: It is the purpose of this Chapter to promote the
public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize those losses
described in subsection B1 of this Section by provisions contained herein.
(Ord. 660, 9-18-1989)
11-12-2: GENERAL PROVISIONS; DEFINITIONS:
   A.   Lands To Which Chapter Applies: This Chapter shall apply to all lands
within the jurisdiction of Montevideo shown on the Official Zoning Map and/or
the attachments thereto as being located within the boundaries of the Floodway
or Flood Fringe Districts. (Ord. 660, 9-18-1989)
   B.   Adoption Of Official Zoning Map And Attached Materials: The City of
Montevideo Zoning Map, together with all materials attached thereto is hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this Chapter. The attached
material shall include the Flood Insurance Study for the City of Montevideo
prepared by the U.S. Geological Survey of the United States Department of the
Interior dated November 1971; and the Flooded Area Map of Montevideo, Minnesota
prepared by the U.S. Geological Survey dated 1971; and the City of Montevideo,
Minnesota Flood Hazard Boundary Map and Flood Insurance Rate Map prepared by
the Department of Housing and Urban Development as issued under a revised date
of July 19, 1979; and the Flood Frequency Profiles of the Chippewa River and
the Minnesota River at Montevideo, Minnesota, prepared by George H. Carlson of
the U.S. Geological Survey and dated 1971. The Official Zoning Map shall be on
file in the City Hall. (Ord. 664, 3-26-1990)
   C.   Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation: The regulatory flood protection
elevation shall be an elevation no lower than one foot (1') above the elevation
of the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation caused by
encroachments on the flood plain that result from designation of a floodway.
   D.   Interpretation:
      1.   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this
Chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation
or repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes.
      2.   The boundaries of the zoning districts shall be determined by
scaling distances on the Official Zoning Map. Where interpretation is needed as
to the exact location of the boundaries of the district as shown on the
Official Zoning Map, as for example where there appears to be a conflict
between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions and there is a formal
appeal of the decision of the Zoning Administrator, the Board of Zoning
Adjustment shall make the necessary interpretation, subject to the approval and
confirmation of the Council. All decisions will be based on elevations on the
regional 100-year flood profile and other available technical data. Persons
contesting the location of the district boundaries shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to present their case to the Board and to submit technical
evidence.
   E.   Abrogation And Greater Restrictions: It is not intended by this Chapter
to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed
restrictions. However, where this Chapter imposes greater restrictions, the
provisions of this Chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent
with this Chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
   F.   Warning And Disclaimer Of Liability: This Chapter does not imply that
areas outside the flood plain districts or land uses permitted within such
districts will be free from flooding or flood damages. This Chapter shall not
create liability on the part of the City or any officer or employee thereof for
any flood damages that result from reliance on this Chapter or any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   G.   Severability: If any section, clause, provision or portion of this
Chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the remainder of this Chapter shall not be affected thereby.
   H.   Definitions: Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used
in this Chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the same meaning as
they have in common usage and so as to give this Chapter its most reasonable
application.
   ACCESSORY USE OR STRUCTURE: A use or structure on the same lot with, and of
a nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal use or
structure.

or base subgrade (below ground level) on all four (4) sides, regardless of the
depth of excavation, below ground level.
   CONDITIONAL USE: A specific type of structure or land use listed in the
official control that may be allowed but only after an in-depth review
procedure and with appropriate conditions or restrictions as provided in the
official zoning controls or building codes and upon a finding that: 1) certain
conditions as detailed in the Zoning Ordinance exist, and 2) the structure and/
or land use conform to the comprehensive land use plan if one exists and are
compatible with the existing neighborhood.
   EQUAL DEGREE OF ENCROACHMENT: A method of determining the location of
floodway boundaries so that flood plain lands on both sides of a stream are
capable of conveying a proportionate share of flood flows.
   FLOOD: A temporary increase in the flow or stage of a stream or in the stage
of a wetland or lake that results in the inundation of normally dry areas.
   FLOOD FREQUENCY: The frequency for which it is expected that a specific
flood stage or discharge may be equalled or exceeded.
   FLOOD FRINGE: That portion of the flood plain outside of the floodway. Flood
fringe is synonymous with the term "floodway fringe" used in the Flood
Insurance Study for the City of Montevideo.

watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regional flood.
   FLOODPROOFING: A combination of structural provisions, changes or
adjustments to properties and structures subject to flooding, primarily for the
reduction or elimination of flood damages.
   FLOODWAY: The bed of a wetland or lake and the channel of a watercourse and
those portions of the adjoining flood plain which are reasonably required to
carry or store the regional flood discharge.
   OBSTRUCTION: Any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment,
projection, excavation, channel modification, culvert, building, wire, fence,
stockpile, refuse, fill, structure or matter in, along, across, or projecting

retard, or change the direction of the flow of water, either in itself or by
catching or collecting debris carried by such water.
   PRINCIPAL USE OR STRUCTURE: All uses or structures that are not accessory
uses or structures.
   REACH: A hydraulic engineering term to describe a longitudinal segment of a
stream or river influenced by a natural or manmade obstruction. In an urban
area, the segment of a stream or river between two (2) consecutive bridge
crossings would most typically constitute a reach.
   REGIONAL FLOOD: A flood which is representative of large floods known to
have occurred generally in Minnesota and reasonably characteristic of what can
be expected to occur on an average frequency in the magnitude of the 100-year
recurrence interval. Regional flood is synonymous with the term "base flood"
used in the Flood Insurance Study.
   REGULATORY FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION: The regulatory flood protection
elevation shall be an elevation no lower than one foot (1') above the elevation
of the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation caused by
encroachments on the flood plain that result from designation of a floodway.
   STRUCTURE: Anything constructed or erected on the ground or attached to the
ground or on-site utilities, including, but not limited to, buildings,
factories, sheds, detached garages, cabins, manufactured homes, travel
trailers/vehicles not meeting the exemption criteria specified in subsection

660, 9-18-1989)
11-12-5: FLOOD FRINGE DISTRICT (FF):
   A.   Permitted Uses: Permitted uses shall be those uses of land or
structures listed as permitted uses in the underlying zoning use district(s).
If no preexisting, underlying zoning use districts exist, then any residential
or nonresidential structure or use of a structure or land shall be a permitted
use in the flood fringe, provided such use does not constitute a public
nuisance. All permitted uses shall comply with the standards for flood fringe
permitted uses listed in subsection B of this Section and the standards for all
flood fringe permitted and conditional uses listed in subsection E of this
Section.
   B.   Standards For Flood Fringe Permitted Uses:
      1.   All structures, including accessory structures, must be elevated on
fill so that the lowest floor including basement floor is at or above the
regulatory flood protection elevation. The finished fill elevation for
structures shall be no lower than one foot (1') below the regulatory flood
protection elevation and the fill shall extend at such elevation at least
fifteen feet (15') beyond the outside limits of the structure erected thereon.
      2.   As an alternative to elevation on fill, accessory structures that
constitute a minimal investment and that do not exceed five hundred (500)
square feet for the outside dimension at ground level may be internally
floodproofed in accordance with subsection
11-12-4D5c of this Chapter.
      3.   The cumulative placement of fill where at any one time in excess of
one thousand (1,000) cubic yards of fill is located on the parcel shall be
allowed only as conditional use, unless said fill is specifically intended to
elevate a structure in accordance with subsection B1 of this Section.
      4.   The storage of any materials or equipment shall be elevated on fill
to the regulatory flood protection elevation.
      5.   The provisions of subsection E of this Section shall apply.
   C.   Conditional Uses: Any structure that is not elevated on fill or
floodproofed in accordance with subsection B1 and B2 of this Section or any use
of land that does not comply with the standards in subsection B3 and B4 of this
Section shall only be allowable as a conditional use. An application for a
conditional use shall be subject to the standards and criteria and evaluation
procedures specified in subsections D and E of this Section and subsection
11-12-9D of this Chapter.
   D.   Standards For Flood Fringe Conditional Uses:
      1.   Alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill may be
utilized to elevate a structure's lowest floor above the regulatory flood
protection elevation. These alternative methods may include the use of stilts,
pilings, parallel walls, etc., or above-grade, enclosed areas such as crawl
spaces or tuck under garages. The base or floor of an enclosed area shall be
considered above grade and not a structure's basement or lowest floor if: a)
the enclosed area is above grade on at least one side of the structure; b) is
designed to internally flood and is constructed with flood resistant materials;
and c) is used solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage. The
above-noted alternative elevation methods are subject to the following
additional standards:
         a.   Design And Certification: The structure's design and as-built
condition must be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect
as being in compliance with the general design standards of the State Building
Code and, specifically, that all electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and
air conditioning equipment and other service facilities must be at or above the
regulatory flood protection elevation or be designed to prevent flood water
from entering or accumulating within these components during times of flooding.
         b.   Specific Standards For Above-Grade, Enclosed Areas: Above-grade,
fully enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages must be
designed to internally flood and the design plans must stipulate:
            (1)   The minimum area of openings in the walls where internal
flooding is to be used as a floodproofing technique. When openings are placed
in a structure's walls to provide for entry of flood waters to equalize
pressures, the bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot (1')
above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices; provided, that they permit the automatic entry and exit
of flood waters.
            (2)   That the enclosed area will be designed of flood resistant
materials in accordance with FP-3 or FP-4 classifications in the State Building
Code and shall be used solely for building access, parking of vehicles or
storage.
      2.   "Basements" as defined by subsection
11-12-2H of this Chapter, shall be subject to the following:
         a.   Residential basement construction shall not be allowed below the
regulatory flood protection elevation.
         b.   Nonresidential basements may be allowed below the regulatory
flood protection elevation provided the basement is structurally dry
floodproofed in accordance with subsection D3 below of this Section.
      3.   All areas of nonresidential structures including basements to be
placed below the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be floodproofed in
accordance with the structurally dry floodproofing classifications in the State
Building Code. Structurally dry floodproofing must meet the FP-1 or FP-
2 floodproofing classification in the State Building Code and this shall
require making the structure watertight with the walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of
buoyancy. Structures floodproofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 classification shall not
be permitted.
      4.   When at any one time more than one thousand (1,000) cubic yards of
fill or other similar material is located on a parcel for such activities as
on-site storage, landscaping, sand and gravel operations, landfills, roads,
dredge spoil disposal or construction of flood control works, an erosion/
sedimentation control plan must be submitted unless the community is enforcing
a State-approved shoreland management ordinance. In the absence of a State-
approved shoreland ordinance, the plan must clearly specify methods to be used
to stabilize the fill on-site for a flood event at a minimum of the 100-year or
regional flood event. The plan must be prepared and certified by a registered
professional engineer or other qualified individual acceptable to the governing
body. The plan may incorporate alternative procedures for removal of the
material from the flood plain if adequate flood warning time exists.
      5.   Storage Of Materials And Equipment:
         a.   The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of
flooding, flammable, explosive or potentially injurious to human, animal or
plant life is prohibited.
         b.   Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if readily
removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning and in
accordance with a plan approved by the governing body.
      6.   The provisions of subsection
11-12-5E of this Chapter shall also apply. (Ord. 660, 9-18-1989)
   E.   Standards For All Flood Fringe Uses:
      1.   All new principal structures must have vehicular access at or above
an elevation not more than two feet (2') below the regulatory flood protection
elevation. If a variance to this requirement is granted, the Board of Zoning
Adjustment must specify limitations on the period of use or occupancy of the
structure for times of flooding and only after determining that adequate flood
warning time and local flood emergency response procedures exist. (Ord. 660, 9-
18-1989; amd. 1998 Code)
      2.   Commercial Uses: Accessory land uses, such as yards, railroad tracks
and parking lots may be at elevations lower than the regulatory flood
protection elevation. However, a permit for such facilities to be used by the
employees or the general public shall not be granted in the absence of a flood
warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area would be
inundated to a depth greater than two feet (2') or be subject to flood
velocities greater than four feet (4') per second upon occurrence of the
regional flood.
      3.   Manufacturing and Industrial Uses: Measures shall be taken to
minimize interference with normal plant operations especially along streams
having protracted flood durations. Certain accessory land uses such as yards
and parking lots may be at lower elevations subject to requirements set out in
subsection E2 above. In considering permit applications, due consideration
shall be given to needs of an industry whose business requires that it be
located in flood plain areas.
      4.   Fill shall be properly compacted and the slopes shall be properly
protected by the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable method.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for
removing the special flood hazard area designation for certain structures
properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation. FEMA's
requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection
standards for multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should
be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of
special flood hazard area designation will be requested.
      5.   Flood plain developments shall not adversely affect the hydraulic
capacity of the channel and adjoining flood plain of any tributary watercourse
or drainage system where a floodway or other encroachment limit has not been
specified on the Official Zoning Map.
      6.   Standards for travel trailers and travel vehicles are contained in
subsection
11-12-8C of this Chapter.
      7.   All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system that resists flotation, collapse and lateral
movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use
of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in
addition to applicable State or local anchoring requirements for resisting wind
forces. (Ord. 660, 9-18-1989)
11-12-6: SUBDIVISIONS:
   A.   Review Criteria: No land shall be subdivided which is unsuitable for
the reason of flooding, inadequate drainage, water supply or sewage treatment
facilities. All lots within the flood plain districts shall contain a building
site at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation. All subdivisions
shall have water and sewer treatment facilities that comply with the provisions
of this Chapter and have road access both to the subdivision and to the
individual building sites no lower than two feet (2') below the regulatory
flood protection elevation. For all subdivisions in the flood plain, the
floodway and flood fringe boundaries, the regulatory flood protection elevation
and the required elevation of all access roads shall be clearly labeled on all
required subdivision drawings and platting documents.
   B.   Removal Of Special Flood Hazard Area Designation: The Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for removing the special
flood hazard area designation for certain structures properly elevated on fill
above the 100-year flood elevation. FEMA's requirements incorporate specific
fill compaction and side slope protection standards for multi-structure or
multi-lot developments. These standards should be investigated prior to the
initiation of site preparation if a change of special flood hazard area
designation will be requested. (Ord. 660, 9-18-1989)
11-12-7: PUBLIC UTILITIES, RAILROADS, ROADS AND BRIDGES:
   A.   Public Utilities: All public utilities and facilities such as gas,
electrical, sewer and water supply systems to be located in the flood plain
shall be floodproofed in accordance with the State Building Code or elevated to
above the regulatory flood protection elevation.
   B.   Public Transportation Facilities: Railroad tracks, roads and bridges to
be located within the flood plain shall comply with Sections
11-12-4 and
11-12-5 of this Chapter. Elevation to the regulatory flood protection elevation
shall be provided where failure or interruption of these transportation
facilities would result in danger to the public health or safety or where such
facilities are essential to the orderly functioning of the area. Minor or
auxiliary roads or railroads may be constructed at a lower elevation where
failure or interruption of transportation services would not endanger the
public health or safety.
   C.   On-Site Sewage Treatment And Water Supply Systems: Where public
utilities are not provided: 1) on-site water supply systems must be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems; and 2) new
or replacement on-site sewage treatment systems must be designed to minimize or
eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the
systems into flood waters and they shall not be subject to impairment or
contamination during times of flooding. Any sewage treatment system designed in
accordance with the State's current statewide standards for on-site sewage
treatment systems shall be determined to be in compliance with this subsection.
(Ord. 660, 9-18-1989)
11-12-8: MANUFACTURED HOMES AND MANUFACTURED HOME PARKS AND PLACEMENT OF TRAVEL
TRAILERS AND TRAVEL VEHICLES:
   A.   Compliance: New manufactured home parks and expansions to existing
mobile manufactured home parks shall be subject to the provisions placed on
subdivisions by Section
11-12-6 of this Chapter.
   B.   New Or Replacement Homes: The placement of new or replacement
manufactured homes in existing manufactured home parks or on individual lots of
record that are located in flood plain districts will be treated as a new
structure and may be placed only if elevated in compliance with Section
11-12-5 of this Chapter. If vehicular road access for preexisting manufactured
home parks is not provided in accordance with subsection
11-12-5E1 of this Chapter, then replacement manufactured homes will not be
allowed until the property owner(s) develops a flood warning emergency plan
acceptable to the governing body.
      1.   All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system that resists flotation, collapse and lateral
movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use
of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in
addition to applicable State or local anchoring requirements for resisting wind
forces.
   C.   Travel trailers and travel vehicles that do not meet the exemption
criteria specified in subsection C1 below shall be subject to the provisions of
this Chapter and as specifically spelled out in subsections C3 and C4 below.
      1.   Exemption: Travel trailers and travel vehicles are exempt from the
provisions of this Chapter if they are placed in any of the areas listed in
subsection C2 below and further they meet the following criteria:
         a.   Have current licenses required for highway use.
         b.   Are "highway ready", meaning on wheels or the internal jacking
system, are attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities
commonly used in campgrounds and trailer parks and the travel trailer/travel
vehicle has no permanent structural type additions attached to it.
         c.   The travel trailer or travel vehicle and associated use must be
permissible in any preexisting, underlying zoning use district.
      2.   Areas Exempted For Placement Of Travel/Recreational Vehicles:
         a.   Individual lots or parcels of record.
         b.   Existing commercial recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds.
         c.   Existing condominium-type associations. (Ord. 660, 9-18-1989)
      3.   Travel trailers and travel vehicles exempted in subsection C1 above
lose this exemption when development occurs on the parcel exceeding one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00) for a structural addition to the travel trailer/
travel vehicle or an accessory structure such as a garage or storage building.
The travel trailer/travel vehicle and all additions and accessory structures
will then be treated as a new structure and shall be subject to the elevation/
floodproofing requirements and the use of land restrictions specified in
Sections
11-12-4 and
11-12-5 of this Chapter. (Ord. 664, 3-26-1990)
      4.   New commercial travel trailer or travel vehicle parks or campgrounds
and new residential type subdivisions and condominium associations and the
expansion of any existing similar use exceeding five (5) units or dwelling
sites shall be subject to the following:
         a.   Any new or replacement travel trailer or travel vehicle will be
allowed in the Floodway or Flood Fringe Districts provided said trailer or
vehicle and its contents are placed on fill above the regulatory flood
protection elevation and proper elevated road access to the site exists in
accordance with subsection
11-12-5E1 of this Chapter. Any fill placed in a floodway for the purpose of
elevating a travel trailer shall be subject to the requirements of Section
11-12-4 of this Chapter.
         b.   All new or replacement travel trailers or travel vehicles not
meeting the criteria of subsection C4a above may, as an alternative, be allowed
as a conditional use if in accordance with the following provisions and the
provisions of subsection
11-12-9D of this Chapter. The applicant must submit an emergency plan for the
safe evacuation of all vehicles and people during the 100-year flood. Said plan
shall be prepared by a registered engineer or other qualified individual and
shall demonstrate that adequate time and personnel exist to carry out the
evacuation. All attendant sewage and water facilities for new or replacement
travel trailers or other recreational vehicles must be protected or constructed
so as to not be impaired or contaminated during times of flooding in accordance
with subsection
11-12-7C of this Chapter. (Ord. 660, 9-18-1989)
11-12-9: ADMINISTRATION:
   A.   Zoning Administrator: A Zoning Administrator designated by the

passage or amendment of this Chapter but which is not in conformity with the
provisions of this Chapter may be continued subject to the following
conditions:
   A.   No such use shall be expanded, changed, enlarged or altered in a way
which increases its nonconformity.
   B.   Any alteration or addition to a nonconforming structure or
nonconforming use which would result in increasing the flood damage potential
of that structure or use shall be protected to the regulatory flood protection
elevation in accordance with any of the elevation on fill or floodproofing
techniques (i.e., FP-1 through FP-4 floodproofing classifications) allowable in
the State Building Code, except as further restricted in subsection C below.
(Ord. 660, 9-18-1989)
   C.   The cost of any structural alterations or additions to any
nonconforming structure over the life of the structure shall not exceed fifty
percent (50%) of the current estimated market value of the structure unless the
conditions of this Section are satisfied. The cost of all structural
alterations and additions constructed since the adoption of the community's
initial flood plain controls must be calculated into today's current cost which
will include all costs such as construction materials and a reasonable cost
placed on all manpower or labor. If the current cost of all previous and
proposed alterations and additions exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the current
market value of the structure, then the structure must meet the standards of
Section
11-12-4 or
11-12-5 of this Chapter for new structures depending upon whether the structure
is in the floodway or flood fringe, respectively.
   D.   If any nonconforming use is discontinued for twelve (12) consecutive
months, any future use of the building premises shall conform to this Chapter.
The Assessor shall notify the Zoning Administrator in writing of instances of
nonconforming uses which have been discontinued for a period of twelve (12)
months.

11-12-11: PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION:
   A.   Violation of the provisions of this Chapter or failure to comply with
any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards
established in connection with grants of variances or conditional uses) shall
constitute a misdemeanor and shall be punishable as defined by law.
   B.   Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City from taking such other
lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. Such actions
may include but are not limited to:
      1.   In responding to a suspected ordinance violation, the Zoning
Administrator and local government may utilize the full array of enforcement
actions available to it including, but not limited to, prosecution and fines,
injunctions, after-the-fact permits, orders for corrective measures or a
request to the National Flood Insurance Program for denial of flood insurance
availability to the guilty party. The City shall act in good faith to enforce
these official controls and to correct ordinance violations to the extent
possible so as not to jeopardize its eligibility in the National Flood
Insurance Program.
      2.   When an ordinance violation is either discovered by or brought to
the attention of the Zoning Administrator, the Zoning Administrator shall
immediately investigate the situation and document the nature and extent of the
violation of the official control. As soon as is reasonably possible this
information will be submitted to the appropriate Department of Natural
Resources and Federal Emergency Management Agency Regional Office along with
the community's plan of action to correct the violation to the degree possible.
      3.   The Zoning Administrator shall notify the suspected party of the
requirements of this Chapter and all other official controls and the nature and
extent of the suspected violation of these controls. If the structure and/or
use is under construction or development, the Zoning Administrator may order
the construction or development immediately halted until a proper permit or
approval is granted by the community. If the construction or development is
already completed, then the Zoning Administrator may either:
         a.   Issue an order identifying the corrective actions that must be
made within a specified time period to bring the use or structure into
compliance with the official controls; or
         b.   Notify the responsible party to apply for an after-the-fact
permit/development approval within a specified period of time not to exceed
thirty (30) days.
      4.   If the responsible party does not appropriately respond to the
Zoning Administrator within the specified period of time, each additional day
that lapses shall constitute an additional violation of this Chapter and shall
be prosecuted accordingly. The Zoning Administrator shall also upon the lapse
of the specified response period notify the landowner to restore the land to
the condition which existed prior to the violation of this Chapter. (Ord. 660,
9-18-1989)
11-12-12: AMENDMENTS:
   A.   The flood plain designation on the Official Zoning Map shall not be
removed from flood plain areas unless it can be shown that the designation is
in error or that the area has been filled to or above the elevation of the
regional flood and is contiguous to lands outside the flood plain. Special
exceptions to this rule may be permitted by the State Commissioner of Natural
Resources if said Commissioner determines that, through other measures, lands
are adequately protected for the intended use.
   B.   All amendments to this Chapter, including amendments to the Official
Zoning Map, must be submitted to and approved by the State Commissioner of
Natural Resources prior to adoption.
   C.   Changes in the Official Zoning Map must meet the Federal Emergency
Management Agency's (FEMA) technical conditions and criteria and must receive
prior FEMA approval before adoption. The State Commissioner of Natural
Resources must be given ten (10) days' written notice of all hearings to
consider an amendment to this Chapter and said notice shall include a draft of

including rooftop structures related to elevators and other mechanical
utilities shall be completely screened from contiguous properties and adjacent
streets with materials of similar type, quality, and appearance as that of the
principal structure. If it is either physically impossible or impracticable to
completely screen these utilities, the Planning Commission may, during site
plan review, recommend alternative solutions that render them aesthetically
compatible with the principal structure.
   E.   Loading And Service Areas/Outdoor Storage: The perimeter views of all
external loading and service areas and any areas of outdoor storage must be
screened from residential uses and adjacent public streets and the public front
and office sides of all business and industrial uses, except at access points.
Such screening can be accomplished through the placement of the building on the
lot or the placement of a building on an adjacent lot. Screening can also be
accomplished through the use of berming, landscaping (80 percent opaque at the
time of maturity) or existing vegetation. If screen walls are proposed, then
the materials used shall be of similar type, quality, and appearance as those

12-1-1: SHORT TITLE:
This Title shall be known as the SUBDIVISION ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF
MONTEVIDEO, and will be referred to as "this Title". (Ord. 470, 2-18-1975)
12-1-2: PURPOSE:
In order to safeguard the best interests of the City and to assist the
subdivider in harmonizing his or her interests with those of the City at large,
the following rules and regulations are adopted in order that adherence to same
will bring results beneficial to both parties. Because each new subdivision
becomes a permanent unit in the basic unit structure of the expanding
community, and to which the community will be forced to adhere, and because
piecemeal planning of subdivisions will bring an undesirable disconnected
patchwork of pattern and poor circulation of traffic unless its design and
arrangement is correlated to a Comprehensive Plan of the City aiming at a
unified scheme of community interests, all subdivision of land hereafter
submitted for approval to the Planning Commission shall, in all respects, fully
comply with the regulations hereinafter set forth in this Title. It is the
purpose of this Title to make certain regulations and requirements for the
platting of land within the City pursuant to the authority contained in
Minnesota Statutes chapters 429, 471, 505 and section 462.358, which
regulations the Council deems necessary for the health, safety and general
welfare of this community. (Ord. 470, 2-18-1975)
12-1-3: JURISDICTION:
The regulations herein governing plats and subdivision of land shall apply
within the corporate limits of the City and the unincorporated area within two
(2) miles of its limits; provided, that the townships having jurisdiction over
the areas adjacent to the City have not adopted ordinances for the regulation
of subdivision of land or platting. (Ord. 470, 2-18-1975)
12-1-4: APPLICATION OF TITLE:
Any plat, hereafter made, for each subdivision or each part thereof lying
within the jurisdiction of this Title, shall be prepared, presented for
approval, and recorded as herein prescribed. The regulations contained herein
shall apply to the subdivision of a lot, tract or parcel of land into three (3)
or more lots, tracts or other division of land for the purpose of sale or of
building development, whether immediate or future, including the resubdivision
or replatting of land or lots. Division of land in tracts larger than five (5)
acres in area and three hundred feet (300') in width shall be exempt from the
requirements of this Title. (Ord. 470, 2-18-1975)
12-1-5: APPROVALS NECESSARY FOR ACCEPTANCE OF PLATS:
Before any plat shall be recorded or be of any validity, it shall have been
approved by the City Planning Commission and by the Council as having fulfilled
the requirements of this Title. (Ord. 470, 2-18-1975)
12-1-6: COMPLIANCE:
No plat of any subdivision within the jurisdiction of this Title shall be
entitled to record in any Register of Deeds' office or have any validity until
the plat thereof has been prepared, approved and acknowledged in the manner
prescribed by this Title. (Ord. 470, 2-18-1975)
12-1-7: BUILDING PERMITS:
No building permits shall be issued by the City for the construction of any
building, structure or improvement to the land or to any lot in a subdivision,
as defined herein, until all requirements of this Title have been complied
with. (Ord. 470, 2-18-1975)

12-3-4: Easements
12-3-5: Public Sites And Open Spaces
12-3-1: BLOCKS:
   A.   The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks, and lots within blocks, shall
be determined with due regard to:
      1.   Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs
of the principal and all required accessory uses.
      2.   Zoning requirements as to lot sizes and dimensions, and provisions
regulating off-street parking and loading spaces.
      3.   Needs for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of
street traffic.
      4.   Limitations and opportunities of topography.
      5.   Where no existing plat controls, the blocks in residential
subdivisions shall normally not exceed one thousand three hundred twenty feet
(1,320') in length, except where topography justifies a departure from this
maximum.
   B.   Residential blocks shall normally be of sufficient width for two (2)
tiers of lots. Block lengths shall be determined by circulation and other
needs. Where residential blocks with lots deeper than two hundred feet (200')
are proposed, a reservation for a future street through the block,
longitudinally, may be required.
   C.   Blocks intended for business or industrial use shall be of such width
as to be considered most suitable for their respective use, including adequate
space for off-street parking and deliveries.
   D.   Pedestrianways of sufficient width shall be required where deemed
essential to provide circulation, or access to schools, playgrounds, shopping
centers, transportation and other community facilities. (Ord. 470, 2-18-1975)
12-3-2: LOTS:
   A.   The minimum lot area, lot width and lot depth shall conform to the
requirements of the zoning district in which the plat is situated as required
by the City Zoning Ordinance.
   B.   Corner lots for residential use shall have sufficient width to permit
appropriate building setback from both roads as required by the City Zoning
Ordinance.
   C.   Side lines of lots shall be approximately at right angles to road or
street lines or radial to curved road or street lines.
   D.   Double frontage lots shall be avoided except where lots back on a
highway or other arterial street, or where topographic or other conditions
render subdividing otherwise unreasonable. Such double frontage lots shall have
additional depth sufficient to allow space for screen planting along the back
lot line.
   E.   Every lot must have the minimum required frontage on a public dedicated
road or street other than an alley, and have satisfactory access to such
existing public street for purposes of firefighting, utilities and other public
and quasi-public services. This requirement may be waived as to planned
developments.
   F.   Setback or building lines shall not be less than the setback required
by the City Zoning Ordinance. On those lots which are intended for business or
industrial use, the setback shall not be less than the setback required by the
City Zoning Ordinance. (Ord. 470, 2-18-1975)
12-3-3: STREETS AND ALLEYS:
   A.   The arrangement of streets shall conform as nearly as possible to the
City Comprehensive Plan. Except for cul-de-sacs, roads and streets normally
shall connect with roads and streets already dedicated in adjoining or adjacent
subdivisions, or provide for future connections to adjoining unsubdivided
tracts, or shall be a reasonable projection of roads In the nearest subdivided
tracts. The arrangement of streets shall be considered in their relation to the
reasonable circulation of traffic, to topographic conditions, to runoff storm
water, to public convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation to
the proposed uses of the area to be served.
   B.   Minor streets and marginal streets should be so planned as to
discourage their use by nonlocal traffic. Dead-end streets and roads shall be
prohibited, but cul-de-sacs will be permitted where topography or other
conditions justify their use. Cul-de-sacs shall normally not be longer than
five hundred feet (500'), including a terminal turnaround which shall be
provided at the closed end, with an outside curb radius of at least fifty feet
(50') and a right-of-way radius of not less than sixty feet (60').
   C.   Where the plat to be submitted includes only part of the tract owned or
intended for development by the subdivider, a tentative plan of a proposed
future street system for the unsubdivided portion shall be prepared and
submitted by the subdivider.
   D.   When a tract is subdivided into larger than normal building lots or
parcels, such lots or parcels shall be so arranged as to permit the logical
location and openings of future roads and appropriate resubdivision, with
provision for adequate utility connections for such resubdivision.
   E.   Under normal conditions, streets shall be designed so as to intersect
as nearly as possible at right angles, except where topography or other
conditions justify variations. Under normal conditions, the minimum angle of
intersection of streets shall be eighty degrees (80o). Street intersection jogs
with an offset of less than one hundred twenty five feet (125') shall be
avoided.
   F.   Wherever the proposed subdivision contains or is adjacent to the right
of way of a State or Federal highway, provision shall be made for a marginal
access street or road approximately parallel and adjacent to the boundary of
such right of way, or for a road or street at a distance suitable for the
appropriate use of land between such road or street and right of way. Such
distance shall be determined with due consideration for the minimum distance
required for approach connections to future grade separations, or for lot
depths.
   G.   Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial districts, except
that this requirement may be waived where other definite and assured provision
is made for service access, such as on-site loading, unloading and parking
consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed. Alleys, where provided,
shall not be less than twenty feet (20') wide. Dead-end alleys and any alleys
in residential areas shall be avoided wherever possible, but if unavoidable,
such dead-end alleys may be approved if adequate turnaround facilities are
provided at the closed end.
   H.   Dedication of half streets or roads will not be approved, except where
it is essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision and in
conformity with the other requirements of these regulations, where it is found
that it will be practical to require the dedication of the other half when the
adjoining property is subdivided, or where it becomes necessary to acquire the
remaining half by condemnation so that it may be improved in the public
interest.
   I.   For all public ways hereafter dedicated and accepted, the minimum
right-of-way widths for streets, and thoroughfares shall be as shown in the
Comprehensive Plan for Montevideo and where not shown therein, the minimum
right-of-way width for streets. thoroughfares, alleys or pedestrianways
included in any subdivision shall not be less than the minimum dimensions for
each classification as follows:
 
Major thoroughfare     100 feet
Secondary thoroughfare 80 feet
Collector street       60 feet
Minor street           60 feet
Marginal access street 50 feet
Alley                  20 feet
Pedestrianway          10 feet
 
Where existing or anticipated traffic on major and secondary thoroughfares
warrants greater widths of right of way, these shall be required.
   J.   The grades in all streets, thoroughfares, collector streets, minor
streets and alleys in any subdivision shall be prescribed by the City Engineer
and wherever practical shall not exceed the following:
 
Major thoroughfare     5 percent
Secondary thoroughfare 5 percent
Collector street       5 percent
Minor street           8 percent
Alley                  8 percent
 
In addition, there shall be a minimum grade on all streets and thoroughfares of
not less than one-half of one percent (0.5%).
   K.   The horizontal and vertical alignment standards on all streets shall be
as follows:
      1.   Horizontal: Radii of center line:
 
                       Desirable Minimum Acceptable
Major thoroughfare     800 feet  500 feet
Secondary thoroughfare 800 feet  500 feet
Collector street       500 feet  300 feet
 
There shall be a tangent between all reversed curves of a minimum length as
follows:
 
                      Minimum Acceptable
Major thoroughfare     100 feet
Secondary thoroughfare 100 feet
Collector street       50 feet
 
      2.   Vertical: All changes in street grades shall be connected by
vertical parabolic curves of such length as follows:
 
Major or secondary thoroughfares 300 feet minimum
Collector or minor street        100 feet minimum
 
   L.   All proposed streets shall be offered for dedication as public streets,
except that private streets may be permitted, following approval of the
variance application, within the boundaries of property under one ownership.
(Ord. 470, 2-18-1975)
12-3-4: EASEMENTS:
   A.   An easement for utilities at least six feet (6') wide shall be provided
along the side line of lots, front line and/or rear line of lots where
necessary to form a continuous right of way, at least twelve feet (12') in
width. If necessary for the extension of water main or sewer lines or similar
utilities, easements of greater width may be required along lot lines or across
lots.
   B.   Utility easements shall connect with easements established in adjoining
properties. These easements, when approved, shall not thereafter be changed
without the approval of the City Council, by ordinance, upon the recommendation
of the Planning Commission.
   C.   Additional easements for pole guys should be provided at the outside of
turns. Where possible, lot lines shall be arranged to bisect the exterior angle
so that pole guys will fall along side lot lines.
   D.   Where a subdivision contains or is traversed by a watercourse,
drainageway, channel, lake or stream, a storm water easement, drainage right of
way or park dedication, whichever the Planning Commission may deem the most
adequate, conforming substantially with the lines of such watercourses, shall
be provided, together with such further width or construction, or both, as will
be adequate for the storm water drainage of the area. The width of such
easements shall be determined by the City Engineer. (Ord. 470, 2-18-1975)
12-3-5: PUBLIC SITES AND OPEN SPACES:
In subdividing land or resubdividing an existing plat, due consideration shall
be given by the subdivider and by the Planning Commission upon review, to the
dedication or reservation of suitable site for schools, parks, playgrounds,
conservation areas, or other public or semipublic recreational areas or open
spaces. Areas so dedicated or reserved shall conform as nearly as possible to
the Comprehensive Plan. Whenever the Comprehensive Plan shows the proposed park
or recreational area partially or completely within a proposed subdivision, the
preliminary and final plats of said subdivision shall show the proposed site as
reserved and the City shall have one year from date of approval of the
preliminary plat by the Planning Commission in which to purchase said land or
to initiate condemnation proceedings with respect thereto. (Ord. 470, 2-18-

   A.   Prior to the filing of an application for conditional approval of the
preliminary plat, the subdivider shall submit for review with the planning
staff, subdivision sketch plans which shall contain the following information:
tract boundaries, north point, description of nature and purpose of tract,
streets on and adjacent to the tract, significant topographical and physical
features, proposed general street layout and proposed general lot layout.
   B.   Such sketch plans will be considered as submitted for informal and
confidential discussion between the subdivider and the staff. Submission of a
subdivision sketch plan shall not constitute formal filing of a plat with the
City.
   C.   As far as may be practical on the basis of a sketch plan, the planning
staff will informally advise the subdivider as promptly as possible of the
extent to which the proposed subdivision conforms to the design standards of
this Title and will discuss possible plan modifications necessary to ensure
conformance. (Ord. 470, 2-18-1975)
12-4-2: PRELIMINARY PLAT:
   A.   Filing: Three (3) copies of a preliminary plat and one copy of a
vicinity sketch of any proposed subdivision shall be filed with the Planning
Commission.
   B.   Approval Of The Planning Commission: The preliminary plat shall be
submitted to the Planning Commission at least ten (10) days prior to a
Commission meeting at which consideration is requested. The Planning Commission
shall hold a public hearing on said preliminary plat. Notice of public hearing
shall be published in a paper of general circulation at least ten (10) days
prior to the hearing date. Public notice shall consist of a general description
of the proposal, the time, date and place of hearing. Approval or disapproval
of a preliminary plat will be conveyed to the subdivider in writing within ten
(10) days after the meeting of the Planning Commission at which such plat was
considered. In case the plat is disapproved, the subdivider shall be notified
of the reason for such action and what requirements will be necessary to meet
the approval of the Commission.
   C.   Approval Of The Council: After the public hearing and review of the
preliminary plat by the Planning Commission, such preliminary plat, together
with the recommendations of the Planning Commission, shall be submitted to the
City Council for consideration. The Council shall act on each plat forwarded by
the Planning Commission within sixty (60) days after submission to the Council.
Approval or disapproval of the preliminary plat shall be conveyed to the
subdivider in writing within ten (10) days after the meeting of the Council at
which such plat was considered. In case the plat is disapproved, the subdivider
shall be notified of the reason for such action and what requirements will be
necessary to meet the approval of the Council.
The approval of the preliminary plat does not constitute an acceptance of the
subdivision, but is deemed to be an authorization to proceed with the final
plat. This approval of the preliminary plat shall be effective for a period of
six (6) months, unless an extension is granted by the Council. The subdivider
may file a final plat limited to such portion of the preliminary plat which he
proposes to record and develop at the time; provided, that such portion must
conform to all requirements of this Title. If some portion of the final plat
has not been submitted for approval within this period, a preliminary plat must
again be submitted to the Planning Commission and the Council for approval.
(Ord. 470, 2-18-1975)

In case the plat is disapproved, the subdivider shall be notified of the reason
for such action and what requirements shall be necessary to meet the approval
of the Commission.
   D.   Approval Of The Council: After review and approval of the final plat by
the Planning Commission, such final plat, together with the recommendations of
the Planning Commission shall be submitted to the Council for approval. If
accepted, the final plat shall be approved by resolution, which resolution
shall provide for the acceptance of all streets, alleys, easements or other
public ways, and parks, or other open spaces dedicated to public purposes. If
disapproved, the grounds for any refusal to approve a plat shall be set forth
in the proceedings of the Council and reported to the person or persons
applying for such approval. If the Council does not act within sixty (60) days
after submission of the final plat to it, the failure to take action shall be
deemed to be an approval of the final plat. If the Council deems it advisable
to promote cooperation with a township, it may require that either the
preliminary plat or the final plat be submitted to a town board for its
comments and suggestions. (Ord. 470, 2-18-1975)
12-4-4: PLAN REQUIREMENTS:
Both the preliminary plat and the final plat shall in all respects comply with
the requirements for plats prescribed by the laws of the State. The Planning
Commission may require such additional information on either the preliminary
plat or the final plat as it deems necessary to make clear any portion of the
proposed plan for the area or to protect the owners of adjacent property or
future owners of the areas to be platted.

BASIC IMPROVEMENTS
SECTION:
12-5-1: General
12-5-2: Street Improvements
12-5-3: Public Utilities
12-5-1: GENERAL:
   A.   Before a final plat is approved by the City Council, the City Council
may require the subdivider of the land covered by the said plat to execute and
submit to the City Council an agreement, which shall be binding on his or their
heirs, personal representatives and assigns, that he or they will cause no
private construction to be made on said plat or file or cause to be filed any
application for building permits for such construction until all improvements
required under this Title have been made or arranged for in the manner
following as respects the highways, roads or streets to which the lots sought
to be constructed have access.
   B.   Prior to making of such required improvements, the City Council may
require the subdivider to deposit with the City Clerk an amount equal to one
and one-quarter (11/4) times the City Engineer's estimated cost of such
improvements, either in cash or an indemnity bond, with sureties satisfactory
to the City, conditioned upon the payment of all construction costs incurred in
making of such improvements and all expense incurred by the City for
engineering and legal fees and other expense in connection with the making of
such improvements.
   C.   No final plat shall be approved by the City Council without first
receiving a report from the City Engineer certifying that the improvements
described herein, together with the agreements and documents required herein
meet the minimum requirements of all applicable ordinances. Drawings showing
all improvements as built shall be filed with the City Engineer.
   D.   No final plat shall be approved by the City Council on land subject to
flooding or containing poor drainage facilities and on land which would make
adequate drainage of the streets or roads and lots impossible. However, if the
subdivider agrees to make improvements which will, in the opinion of the City
Engineer, make the area suitable for use without interfering with the flow of
water under flood conditions, the final plat of the subdivision may be
approved. In no event, however, shall a plat be approved unless the same
complies with the flood plain regulations of the City 1 .
   E.   All of the required improvements to be installed under the provisions
of this Title shall be inspected during the course of their construction by the
City Engineer or an inspector appointed by the Council. (Ord. 470, 2-18-1975)
 
Notes
1 1. See Title 11, Chapter 12 of this Code.
12-5-2: STREET IMPROVEMENTS:
   A.   The City Council may require the full width of the right of way to be
graded, including the subgrade of the areas to be paved, in accordance with the
standards and specifications for street construction as approved by the
Council.
   B.   Storm sewers, culverts, storm water inlets and other drainage
facilities may be required where, in the opinion of the City Engineer, they are
necessary to ensure adequate storm water drainage for the subdivision. Where
required the drainage facilities shall be constructed in accordance to the
standards and specifications for street construction as approved by the
Council. (Ord. 470, 2-18-1975)
12-5-3: PUBLIC UTILITIES:
   A.   All utility lines for telephone and electric service shall be placed in
rear line easements when carried on overhead poles.
   B.   Where telephone, electric and/or gas service lines are to be placed
underground entirely, conduits or cables shall be placed within easements or
dedicated public ways, in such a manner so as not to conflict with other
underground services. All drainage and other underground utility installations
which traverse privately owned property shall be protected by easements. (Ord.
470, 2-18-1975)
CHAPTER 6
VARIANCES
SECTION:
12-6-1: General
12-6-1: GENERAL:
The Planning Commission may recommend a variance from any of the provisions of
this Title when, in its opinion, undue hardship may result from strict
compliance. In granting any variance, the Commission shall prescribe any
conditions that it deems necessary to or desirable for the protection of the
public interest. In making its findings, as required hereinbelow, the Planning
Commission shall take into account the nature of the proposed use of land and
the existing use of land in the vicinity, the number of persons who do or will
reside or work in the proposed subdivision and the probable effect of the
proposed subdivision upon traffic conditions in the vicinity. No variance shall
be granted unless the Planning Commission finds:
