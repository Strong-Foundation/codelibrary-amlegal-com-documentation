procedure at such election shall conform as nearly as possible to that herein
provided for other municipal elections.
Section 30.   JUDGES AND CLERKS OF ELECTION.
   The council shall at least 25 days before each municipal election appoint

CHAPTER 5
Initiative, Referendum and Recall
Section 34.   POWERS RESERVED BY THE PEOPLE.
   The people of Gaylord reserve to themselves the powers, in accordance with
the provisions of this charter, to initiate and adopt ordinances, to require
measures passed by the council to be referred to the electorate for approval or
disapproval, and to recall elected public officials, except there shall be no
initiative or recall of ordinances which appropriate money or authorize the
levy of taxes. These powers shall be called the initiative, the referendum, and
the recall, respectively.
Section 35.   EXPENDITURES BY PETITIONERS.
   No member of any initiative, referendum, or recall committee, no circulator
of a signature paper, and no signer of any such paper, or other person, shall
accept or offer any reward, pecuniary or otherwise, for service rendered in
connection with the circulation thereof, but this shall not prevent the
committee from incurring an expense not to exceed fifty dollars for legal
advice, stationery, copying, printing and notaries’ fees. Any violation of the
provisions of this section shall constitute a misdemeanor.
Section 36.   FURTHER REGULATIONS.
   The council, after the organization of the city government under this
charter, may provide by ordinance such further regulations for the initiative,
referendum, and recall, not inconsistent with this charter, as may be deemed
necessary. Such ordinance shall include the relevant provisions of this
charter.
Section 37.   INITIATION OF MEASURES.
   Any five electors must first form themselves into a committee for the
initiation of any measure of public concern. After formulating their measure
they shall file a verified written notice with the city administrator or clerk
together with their names and addresses as members of such committee.
Section 38.   FORM OF PETITION AND OF SIGNATURE PAPERS.
   The petition for the adoption of any measure shall consist of the measure
together with all the signature papers and affidavits thereto attached. Such
petition shall not be complete unless signed by a number of voters equal to at
least ten per cent of the total number of votes cast at the last preceding
regular municipal election. All the signatures need not be on one signature
paper, but the circulator of every such paper shall make an affidavit that each
signature appended to the paper is the genuine signature of the person it
purports to be. Each signature paper shall be in substantially the following
form:
INITIATIVE PETITION
proposing an ordinance to ____________ (stating the purpose of the measure), a
copy of which ordinance is hereto attached. This measure is sponsored by the
following committee of electors:
   NAME                     ADDRESS
l.______________   _______________________
2.______________   _______________________
3.______________   _______________________
4.______________   _______________________
5.______________   _______________________
   The undersigned electors, understanding the terms and the nature of the
measure hereto attached, petition the council for its adoption, or, in lieu
thereof, for its submission to the electors for their approval.
   Name                     Address
1.______________   _______________________
2.______________   _______________________
3.______________   _______________________
   At the end of the list of signatures shall be appended the affidavit of the
circulator mentioned above.
Section 39.   FILING OF PETITIONS AND ACTION THEREON.
   All the signature papers shall be filed in the office of the city clerk as
one instrument. Within five days after the filing of the petition the city
clerk shall ascertain by examination the number of electors whose signatures
are appended thereto, and whether this number is at least ten percent of the
total number of electors who cast their votes at the last preceding regular
municipal election. If he/she finds the petition insufficient or irregular, he/
she shall at once notify one or more of the committee or sponsors of that fact,
certifying the reasons for his/her finding. The Committee shall then be given
thirty days in which to file additional signature papers and to correct the
petition in all other particulars. If at the end of that period the petition is
found to be still insufficient or irregular the clerk shall file the same in
his/her office and shall notify each member of the committee of that fact. The
final finding of the insufficiency or irregularity of a petition shall not
prejudice the filing of a new petition for the same purpose, nor shall it
prevent the council from referring the measure to the electors at the next
regular or any special election, at its option.
Section 40.   ACTION OF COUNCIL ON PETITION.
   Whenever the petition shall be found to be sufficient, the city clerk Shall
so certify to the council at its next meeting, stating the number of
petitioners, and the percentage of the total number of voters which they
constitute, and the council shall at once read the measure and refer it to an
appropriate committee, which may be a committee of the whole. The committee or
council shall thereupon provide for public hearings upon the measure, after the
holding of which the measure shall be finally acted upon by the council not
later than sixty-five days after the date upon which such measure was submitted
to the council by the city clerk. If the council shall fail to pass the
proposed measure, or shall pass it in a form different from that set forth in
the petition and is unsatisfactory to the petitioners, the proposed measure
shall be submitted by the council to the vote of the electors at the next
regular municipal election. But in case the number of signers of said petition
is equal to at least fifteen percent of the total number of voters voting at
the last regular municipal election, then the council shall call a special
election upon the measure to be held not less than thirty nor more than forty-
five days from such date, unless a regular election is to occur within three
months, in which case it may be submitted at such regular municipal election.
In case the council passes the proposed measure with amendments and at least
four-fifths of the committee of petitioners do not express their
dissatisfaction with such amended form by a certificate filed with the city
clerk within ten days from the passage thereof by the council, then the measure
need not be submitted to the electors.
Section 41.   INITIATIVE BALLOTS.
   The ballots used when voting upon any such proposed measure shall state the
substance thereof, and shall give the voter the opportunity to vote either “For
the measure” or “Against the measure.” If a majority of the electors voting on
any such measure shall vote in favor thereof, it shall thereupon become an
ordinance of the city. Any number of proposed measures may be voted upon at the
same election, but in case there shall be more than one, the voter shall be
allowed to vote for or against each separately. In case of inconsistency
between two initiated ordinances approved at one election, the one approved by
the higher percentage of electors voting on the question shall prevail to the
extent of the inconsistency.
Section 42.   INITIATION OF CHARTER AMENDMENTS.
   Nothing in this charter shall be construed as in any way affecting the right
of the electors under the constitution and statutes of Minnesota to propose
amendments to this charter.
REFERENDUM
Section 43.   THE REFERENDUM.
   If prior to the date when an ordinance takes effect a petition signed by
qualified electors of the city equal in number to fifteen percent of the total
vote at the last regular municipal election be filed with the city clerk
requesting that any such measure, or any part thereof, be repealed or be
submitted to a vote of the electors, the said measure shall there by be
prevented from going into operation. The council shall thereupon reconsider the
said measure at its next regular meeting, and either repeal the same, or repeal
the sections thereof to which objection has been raised by the petitioners, or
by aye or no vote reaffirm its adherence to the measure as passed. In the
latter case the council shall immediately order an election to be held thereon,
pending which the ordinance shall remain suspended. If a majority of the voters
voting thereon are opposed to the measure, it shall not become effective; but
if a majority of the voters voting thereon favor the measure, it shall go into
effect immediately or on the date therein specified.
Section 44.   REFERENDUM PETITIONS.
   The requirements laid down in sections above as to the formation of
committees for the initiation of measures and as to the form of petitions and
signature papers shall apply to the referendum as far as possible, but with
such verbal changes as may be necessary. A referendum petition shall read as
follows:
REFERENDUM PETITION
proposing the repeal of an ordinance to (stating the purpose of the measure), a
copy of which ordinance is hereto attached. The proposed repeal is sponsored by
the following committee of electors;
   Name                     Address
1.______________    ________________________
2.______________   ________________________
   The undersigned petitioners, understanding the nature of the measure hereto
attached, and believing it to be detrimental to the welfare of the city,
petition the council for its submission to a vote of the electors for their
approval or disapproval.
   Name                     Address
1.______________    ________________________
2.______________   ________________________
Section 45.   REFERENDUM BALLOTS.
   The ballots used in any referendum election shall conform to the rules laid
down in Section 41 of this charter for initiative ballots.
RECALL
Section 46.   RECALL PETITIONS.
   The petition for the recall of any official shall consist of a certificate
identical with that filed with the city clerk together with all the signature
papers and affidavits thereto attached. All the signatures need not be on one
signature paper, but the circulator of every such paper shall make an affidavit
that each signature appended to the paper is the genuine signature of the
person whose name it purports to be. Each signature paper shall be in
substantially the following form:
RECALL PETITION
proposing the recall of ______________ from his/her office as
___________________, which recall is sought for the reasons set forth in the
attached certificate. This movement is sponsored by the following committee of
electors:
   Name                     Address
1.______________    ________________________
2.______________   ________________________
   The undersigned electors, understanding the nature of the charges against
the officer herein sought to be recalled, desire the holding of a recall
election for that purpose.
   Name                     Address
1.______________    ________________________
2.______________   ________________________
   At the end of the list of signatures shall be appended the affidavit of the
circulator mentioned above.
Section 47.   FILING OF PETITION
   Within thirty days after the filing of the original certificate, the
committee shall file the completed petition in the office of the city clerk.
The city clerk shall examine the same within the next five days, and if he/she
finds it irregular in any way, or finds that the number of signers is less than
twenty-five percent of the total number of electors who cast their votes at the
last preceding regular municipal election, he/she shall so notify one or more
members of the committee. The committee shall then be given ten days in which
to file additional signature papers and to correct the petition in all other
respects, but they may not change the statement of the grounds upon which the
recall is sought. If at the end of that time the city clerk finds the petition
still insufficient or irregular he/she shall notify all members of the
committee to that effect and shall file the petition in his/her office. No
further action shall be taken thereon.
Section 48.   RECALL ELECTION.
   If the petition or amended petition be found sufficient, the city clerk
shall transmit it to the council without delay, and shall also officially
notify the person sought to be recalled of the sufficiency of the petition and
of the pending action. The council shall at its next meeting, by motion,
provide for the holding of a special recall election not less than thirty nor
more than forty-five days thereafter, provided that if any other municipal
election is to occur within sixty days after such meeting, the council may in
its discretion provide for the holding of the recall election at that time.
Section 49.   PROCEDURE AT RECALL ELECTION.
   In the published call for the election, whether posted on bulletin boards or
printed in the official paper, there shall be given the statement of the
grounds for the recall and also, in not more than five hundred words, the
answer of the officer concerned in justification of his/her course in office.
Candidates to succeed the officer to be recalled shall be nominated in the
usual way, and the election shall be conducted as far as possible, in
accordance with the usual procedure in municipal elections.
Section 50.   FORM OF RECALL BALLOT.
   Unless the officer whose removal is sought shall have resigned within ten
days after the receipt by the council of the completed recall petition, the
form of the ballot at such election shall be as near as may be: “Shall A be
recalled?”, the name of the officer whose recall is sought being inserted in
place of A, and the electors shall be permitted to vote separately “Yes” or
“No” upon the question. The ballot shall also contain the names of the
candidates to be voted upon to fill the vacancy, in case the recall is
successful, under the caption: “Candidates to fill the place of A, if
recalled.” But the officer whose recall is sought shall not himself/herself be
a candidate upon such ballot. In case a majority of those voting for and
against the recall of any official shall vote in favor of recalling such
official, he/she shall be thereby removed from office, and in that event the
candidate who receives the highest number of votes for his/her place shall be
elected thereto for the remainder of the unexpired term. If the officer sought
to be recalled shall have resigned within ten days after the receipt by the
council of the completed recall petition, the form of ballot at the election
shall be the same, as nearly as may be, as the form in use at a regular
municipal election.
   CHAPTER 6
Administration of City Affairs
Section 51.   DEPARTMENTS OF ADMINISTRATION.
   The city council shall exercise control over all administrative affairs of
the city, either directly or through its elective officers and heads of
departments, except as delegated exclusively to the mayor in this charter, and
any regulations by ordinance consistent therewith. The council may create such
departments, divisions, and bureaus for the administration of the city’s
affairs as may seem necessary for efficient administration, and from time to
time may alter the powers and organization of the same.
Section 52.   POWERS AND DUTIES OF COUNCIL.
   The council shall make all necessary rules, regulations and appointments to
office as herein required. The council may set a probationary period for any
person hired by it. All employees and subordinate officers shall attend council
meetings as they may be required by the council; they shall keep the council
fully informed as to the operation and needs of their various departments, and
shall perform all other duties required by this charter. Employees appointed by
the council shall be removed by it only after giving such appointee a
reasonable hearing.
Section 53.   CONTRACTS. HOW LET.
   In all cases of work to be done by contract, or of the purchase of personal
property of any kind, where the amount involved exceed the limit set by state
law, unless the council shall by an emergency ordinance otherwise provide, the
city administrator or city clerk shall advertise for bids in such manner as may
be designated by the council. A contract means as agreement entered into by the
City for the sale or purchase of supplies, materials, equipment or the rental
thereof, or the construction, alteration, repair or maintenance of real or
personal property. Contracts of this magnitude shall be let only by the
council, and shall be let to the lowest responsible bidder. The council may,
however, reject any and all bids. Nothing contained in this chapter shall
prevent the council from contracting for the doing of work with patented
processes, or from the purchase of patented applicances. Further regulations
for the making of bids and the letting of contracts shall be made by ordinance,
subject to the provisions of this charter.
CHAPTER 7
Taxation and Finance
Section 54.   COUNCIL TO CONTROL FINANCES.
   The council shall have full authority over the financial affairs of the

system of local taxation and to change the same from time to time. Insofar as
the city procures a revenue from taxes upon real and personal property as such,
it shall conform as fully as possible to the general state law as to the
assessment of such property and the collection of such taxes.
Section 57.   BOARD OF EQUALIZATION.
   The council or designee shall constitute a board of equalization to equalize
assessments of property for taxation purposes according to law.
Section 58.   LEVY AND COLLECTION OF TAXES.
   On or before September 15th each year the council shall levy by resolution
the taxes necessary to meet the requirements for the ensuing calendar year. The
city clerk shall transmit to the county auditor annually, not later than
September 15th, a statement of all the taxes levied, and such taxes shall be
collected and the payment thereof be enforced with and in like manner as state
and county taxes. No tax shall be invalid by reason of any informality in the
manner of levying the same, nor because the amount levied shall exceed the
amount required to be raised for the special purposes for which the same is
levied, but in that case the surplus shall go into the fund to which such tax
belongs.
Section 59.   TAX SETTLEMENT WITH COUNTY TREASURER.
   The city treasurer shall see to it that all moneys in the county treasury
belonging to the city are promptly turned over to the city according to law.
Section 60.   DISBURSEMENTS. HOW MADE.
   All disbursements shall be made only on regular vouchers issued by the city
administrator or city clerk, duly authorized by the council, countersigned by
the mayor and the treasurer, which shall indicate the fund out of which the
disbursement shall be made. Each order when signed by the city clerk,
countersigned by the mayor and the city treasurer, shall become a check payable
to the payee at the bank indicated thereon. But no such order or check shall be
issued until there is money to the credit of the fund out of which it is to be
paid, sufficient to pay the same together with all then outstanding
encumbrances upon such fund. No claim against the city shall be allowed unless
accompanied by an itemized bill and voucher, payroll, or time sheet signed by
the responsible officer who has personal knowledge of the facts in the case and
vouches for the correctness and reasonableness of the claim. The council may by
ordinance make further regulations for the safekeeping and disbursement of the
funds of the city.
Section 61.   FUNDS TO BE KEPT.
   There shall be maintained in the treasury the following funds for the
support of which the council may levy taxes:

extension, maintenance, and operation of any public utility owned and operated
by the city, including the payment of the interest on any bonds or other
indebtedness which may be a lien upon such utility. There shall be paid into
this fund all moneys derived from the sale of bonds issued on account of any
such utility, and from the operation of such utility, and from the sale of any
property acquired for or used in connection with, any such utility. There shall
be paid out of this fund the cost of the purchase, construction, extension,
operation, maintenance, and repair of such utility, including the interest upon
all bonds or other indebtedness which may be a lien upon such utility. Any
surplus in said fund may be used for the purchase of any bonds or certificates
of indebtedness issued against said utility, and for the payment of such bonds
or other indebtedness upon their maturity. Separate funds and accounts shall be
kept for each such utility operated separately, and in case two or more
utilities are operated together the funds and accounts shall be kept separate
as far as practicable.
   (c)   A general fund for the support of such other funds and for payment of
such expenses of the city as council may deem proper. Into this fund shall be
paid all moneys not herein provided to be paid into any other fund.
   (d)   A permanent improvement revolving fund. There shall be paid into this
fund moneys received from special assessments levied for local improvements.
The council may be resolution determine the aggregate amount of the assessments
for local improvements which, in its judgment, shall be extended for payment,
as is provided in this charter. The council may order the issuance and sale of
bonds representing such aggregate sum which shall entitle the holder thereof to
demand and receive from the city of Gaylord upon the surrender of such bonds to
the treasurer on or after the date of payment thereof, the amount of money
named therein to be paid, with the date of interest stipulated to be paid
thereon to the due date thereof and not after such date. Such bonds may be
issued in such amounts and become due on such dates as the council may
determine. The proceeds of the sale of said bonds shall be paid into the
permanent improvement revolving fund. The council may, in its descretion,
either sell said bonds direct to investors, or may contract for the sale of all
such bonds that may be issued during the calendar year. No sale of such bonds
by contract, shall be made except after advertising for bids, at least one week
prior to sale and such sales shall be made to the lowest responsible bidder.
Bids must be asked on the basis of a rate of interest specified in the
proposals and on the net interest basis on which the bidder will pay par for
the same.
Section 62.   RECEIPTS TO GO TO CITY TREASURER.
   All receipts of money belonging to the city, or any branch thereof,
excepting only those funds collected by the county treasurer, shall be paid
into the city treasurer by the person authorized to receive the same at the
close of each business day. All such moneys, and also all moneys received upon
tax settlements from the county treasurer, shall be deposited as soon as
practicable but no later than one week from receipt.
Section 63.   ACCOUNTS AND REPORTS.
   The city administrator or city clerk in the city administrator’s absence
shall be the chief accounting officer of the city and of every branch thereof,
and the council may prescribe and enforce accounting methods, forms, blanks,

accord with it. He/She shall submit to the council a statement each month
showing the amount of money in the custody of the city treasurer, the status of
all funds, the amount spent or chargeable against each of the annual budget
allowances and the balances left in each, and such other information relative
to the finances of the city as the council may require. Once each year, on or
before the last day of January, the city clerk shall submit a report to the
council covering the entire financial operations of the city for the past year.
This report shall show the actual total receipts and actual total expenditures,
omitting duplications, and stating the cash balance at the beginning of the
last, fiscal year and at the close; the total outlays for operation and
maintenance, and the total capital outlays; the condition of each of the funds;
the total receipts by sources and the total expenditures by general purposes;
the total outstanding bonds and debts of the city, when due, the amount of new
bonds issued and the amount redeemed, the interest rate of each; and such
further information as the council and other city officials and the taxpayers
should have.
Section 64.   CITY INDEBTEDNESS.
   Except as provided in Sections 65 and 66, no obligations shall be issued to
pay current expenses, but the council may issue and sell obligations for any
other municipal purpose in accordance with law and within the limitations
prescribed by law. Except in the case of obligations for which an election is
not required by this charter or by state law, no such obligations shall be
issued and sold without the approval of the majority of the electors of the
city voting on the question at a general or special election.

terms and conditions as the council may determine, but they shall become due
and payable not later than the 1st day of April of the year following their
issuance. The proceeds of the tax levied for the fund against which tax
anticipation certificates are issued and the full faith and credit of the city
shall be irrevocably pledged for the redemption of the certificates in the
order of their issuance against the fund.
Section 66.   EMERGENCY DEBT CERTIFICATES.
   If in any year the receipts from taxes or other sources should from some
unforseen cause become insufficient for the ordinary expenses of the city, or
if any calamity or other public emergency should subject the city to the
necessity of making extraordinary expenditures, the council may by ordinance
issue and sell on such terms and in such manner as the council determines
emergency debt certificates to run not to exceed two years. A tax sufficient to
pay principal and interest on such certificates with the margin required by law
shall be levied as required by law. The ordinance authorizing an issue of such
emergency debt certificates shall state the nature of the emergency and be
approved by at least four members of the council. It may be passed as an
emergency ordinance.

for the planning and location of public works of art, public buildings, parks,
playgrounds, harbors, bridges, transportation lines, and other public

local character. The amounts assessed to benefited property to pay for such
local improvements may equal the cost of the improvement, including all costs
and expenses connected therewith, with interest, until paid, but shall in no
case exceed the benefits to the property.
Section 70.   ASSESSMENTS FOR SERVICES.
   The council may provide by ordinance that the cost of printing, snow, or
rubbish removal, or of any other service to streets, sidewalks, or other public
property, or the costs of any services to other property undertaken by the city
may be assessed against the property benefited and collected in like manner as
are special assessments.
Section 71.   LOCAL IMPROVEMENTS REGULATIONS.
   After this charter takes effect local improvements commenced prior thereto
shall be completed and assessment may be levied and securities issued for the
financing thereof as prescribed by the law (or charter provisions) applicable
thereto. The council may prepare and adopt a comprehensive ordinance
prescribing the procedure which shall be followed thereafter in making all
local improvements and levying assessments therefor. Such ordinance shall
supersede all other provisions of the law on the same subject and may be
amended only by an affirmative vote of a majority of all the members of the
council. In the absence of such ordinance all local improvements may be made
and assessments levied therefor as prescribed by any applicable law.

in taking land for public use by right of eminent domain according to the laws
of this state, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.

   The word “franchise” as used in this chapter shall be construed to mean any
special privilege granted to any person, co-partnership or corporation, in,

such places.
Section 77.   PUBLICATION OF FRANCHISE.
   Every ordinance granting or extending any franchise shall contain all the
terms and conditions of the franchise. A franchise shall be without any
validity whatever until it has been accepted by the grantee, and until it has
been given adequate publicity, either by the publication of the franchise
verbatim in the official paper of the city at least once a week for four
successive weeks after its passage, or by the posting of authentic copies -of
the franchise upon bulletin boards in at least ten of the most public places in
the city for a period of thirty days after its passage. Nothing herein

A reasonable rate shall be construed to be one which will, with efficient
management, normally yield, above all operating expenses and depreciation, a
fair return upon all money honestly and efficiently invested in the plant and
equipment used by the company in the public service within the city. This shall
not be construed as a guarantee of a return and in no case shall there be any
return upon the franchise value. Within those limits, the determination of the
maximum price or rate to be charged by any company for service rendered to the
city or to any person within the city shall, be made, if possible, by direct
negotiations between the company and the council at public hearings. In case of
failure to reach an agreement by this method, the council shall, not less than
thirty days before the expiration of any existing rate schedule or agreement,
appoint some expert as its representative; the company shall appoint a
representative; and these two shall by mutual agreement select a third person,
preferably an expert in valuation and rate-making, who shall together
constitute a board of arbitration. This board shall report its findings as soon
as possible and the rate which it shall agree upon by a majority vote shall be
the legal rate, subject to revision by any court of competent jurisdiction.
Schedules of rates thus fixed shall be as flexible as may be, and shall in no
case fix a definite rate for a period of more than five years. The city and the
company, may, by mutual agreement, revise existing schedules of rates at any
time, proceeding in each case as provided for the original fixing of the rates.

the terms of this charter.
   (b)   That the grantee shall in no case claim or pretend to exercise any
power to fix fares, rates, and charges; but that such fares, rates, and charges
shall at all times be just, fair, and reasonable for the services rendered, and
shall in all cases be fixed and from time to time changed in the manner
provided in this charter.
   (c)   That the council shall have the right to require reasonable extensions
of any public service system from time to time, and to make such rules and
regulations as may be required to secure adequate and proper service and to
provide sufficient accomodations for the public.
   (d)   That the grantee shall not issue any capital stock on account of the
franchise or the value thereof, and that the grantee shall have no right to
receive, upon condemnation proceedings brought by the city to acquire the
public utility exercising such franchise, any return on account of the
franchise or its value.
   (e)   That no sale or lease of said franchise shall be effective until the
assignee or lessee shall have filed in the office of the city administrator or
city clerk an instrument, duly executed, reciting the fact of such sale or
lease, accepting the terms of the franchise, and agreeing to perform all the
conditions required of the grantee thereunder. The Assignee or Lessee shall

require, which bond shall run to the city as obligee, with sureties
satisfactory to the council and shall obligate the Assignee or Lessee to
discharge all obligations and liabilities imposed by said franchise.

or other public places of any permanent or semi-permanent fixtures whatsoever,
shall be subject to the conditions that the council shall have the power to
require such alteration therein, or relocation or rerouting thereof, as the
council may at any time deem necessary for the safety, health, or convenience
of the public, and particularly that it shall have the power to require the
removal of poles, masts and other fixtures bearing wires and the placing
underground of all wires for whatsoever purpose used.
   (g)   Every franchise and every extension or renewal of such franchise,
shall contain a provision for its acceptance in writing by the grantee within
thirty days after its passage by the council and before its submission to a
vote of the people in case of a referendum. No such franchise shall be binding
upon the city until its acceptance by the grantee. Such acceptance shall be
construed to be an acceptance of, and consent to, all the terms, conditions,
and limitations contained in the ordinance granting the franchise as well as
the provisions of this charter. The violation by the holder of any franchise of
any of the express provisions prescribed by this section shall be sufficient
cause for the forfeiture of the franchise by a resolution of the council.
Section 82.   FURTHER PROVISIONS OF FRANCHISE.
   The enumeration and specification of particular matters which must be
included in every franchise or renewal or extension thereof, shall not be
construed as impairing the right of the city to insert in any such franchise or
renewal or extension thereof such other and further conditions and restrictions
as the council may deem proper to protect the city’s interests, nor shall
anything contained in this charter limit any right or power possessed by the
city over existing franchises.

welfare.

      (1)   Findings and Purpose. The purpose of this division for the city
code is to establish a procedure for administrative enforcement of violations
of this code. The City Council finds that criminal or civil legal action is not
an appropriate remedy for certain violations of this code. The City Council
establishes this administrative enforcement process as an informal, cost-
effective, and more efficient alternative to traditional criminal charges for
violations of certain code provisions.

         (a)   A violation of any provision of this code, other than a traffic
offense, is an administrative offense subject to a citation and civil penalties
pursuant to this division.
         (b)   Each day a violation exists constitutes a separate offense.
         (c)   Each administrative offense may be subject to a civil penalty
not to exceed $1,000. The City Council shall adopt a schedule of civil
penalties for offenses subject to administrative enforcement.
         (d)   Civil penalties may be doubled for repeat violations that occur
within a 12 month period.
         (e)   The City Administrator or designee is authorized to promulgate
rules and forms to facilitate the execution of this division.
         (f)   In its sole discretion, the city may elect to pursue criminal
charges, civil action, or other remedies allowed under the city code or
otherwise by laws for conduct also covered by this division.
      (3)   Administrative citation.
         (a)   Individuals authorized to enforce the city code. The following
individuals may issue administrative citations on behalf of the city:
            1.   Any Officer of the Police Department;
            2.   City Administrator; or
            3.   Any other employee or agent of the city designated in writing
by the City Administrator.
         (b)   Notice of violation. Upon determining that a violation of city
code has occurred, any individual authorized under this division may give
written notice of the violation to the violator. Such notice shall be in
writing and include the nature, date, and time of the violation, the name and
title of the official issuing the notice, and the amount of the scheduled
penalty. In the case of a vehicular violation, notice may be attached to the
vehicle.
      (4)   Payment or hearing request required. For violations other than
violations of the city's Zoning and Subdivision Codes, within ten days of
issuance of the written notice of violation, the person issued such notice must
either pay the civil penalty or request an administrative hearing in writing.
The civil penalty may be paid in person or by mail. Payment is deemed an
admission of the violation. For violations of the Zoning or Subdivision Codes,
the property owner shall have 30 days from the issuance of the written notice
of violation to request an administrative hearing in writing, modify the
property to adhere to zoning requirements, or provide the City Administrator
with satisfactory written evidence of efforts toward compliance. By way of
example, but without limitation, satisfactory written evidence may include a
contract with an individual or entity to perform the necessary work to bring
the property into compliance with zoning requirements within a limited period
of time. During the 30 days from the issuance of the written notice, the
property owner will not incur a civil penalty. If the property owner does not
request a hearing, bring the property into compliance, or provide the City
Administrator with satisfactory written evidence of efforts toward compliance
within 30 days of issuance of the written notice, the property owner will incur
a civil penalty on the 31st day after issuance of the written notice, and each
day the violation continues, as provided in the city's schedule of civil
penalties. Civil penalties will continue to accrue until the property owner
notifies the City Administrator that the property has been brought into
compliance and the City Administrator or designee has verified the property is
compliant.
      (5)   Administrative hearing.
         (a)   Any person contesting an administrative citation pursuant to
this division may request a hearing. The request must be in writing and include
the violator's name and contact information, citation number, date of offense,
and a brief description of the reason(s) for requesting a hearing. Any request
for hearing other than a hearing on a Zoning or Subdivision Code violation must
be addressed to the City Administrator and received at City Hall within ten
days of issuance of the citation. A request for a hearing on a Zoning or
Subdivision Code violation must be addressed to the City Administrator and
received at City Hall within 30 days of the issuance of the notice of
violation.
         (b)   The city will determine the hearing date. The hearing shall be
conducted within 60 days from the date the request is received.
         (c)   The City Council shall conduct an informal hearing during an
open meeting of the Council consisting of a quorum of Council members to
determine, by a preponderance of the evidence, whether a violation has occurred
by the cited person. Any person contesting a citation shall have the right to
address the Council during this hearing and to present any relevant and
credible evidence to the Council. The Council, by majority vote, shall have
authority to sustain or dismiss the violation on the basis of the record
established at the hearing and, if sustained, reduce, or waive the civil
penalty.
         (d)   The civil penalty must be paid within seven days of the hearing
decision.
      (6)   Hearing body. The hearing shall be before a quorum of City Council
at an open meeting of the Council. The City Council is authorized to hear and
decide any controversy relating to administrative offenses covered by this
division.

         (a)   Except for violations of the Zoning and Subdivision Codes, the
civil penalty must be paid within ten days of issuance of an administrative
citation, or seven days of the Hearing Officer's decision. A 10% late fee will
be added beginning on the eleventh day, and for each day thereafter until the
penalty is paid in full. The City Administrator may agree to a one-time
extension to pay, up to an additional 14 days.
         (b)   The city will periodically send invoices regarding outstanding
civil penalties and late fees. Where a violation affects property within the
city, no permits or land use approvals will be granted for the property at
issue until all civil penalties are paid.
         (c)   If an individual fails to timely pay the civil penalty or
request a hearing, the city may request a misdemeanor or petty misdemeanor
charge to be filed in accordance with applicable statutes, or the city may use
traditional debt collection methods or any other method prescribed by law,
including assessing the unpaid fines against property owned by the violator, to
collect the fine amount and any associated fees.
         (d)   If the penalty is paid or if an individual is found not to have
committed the administrative offense by the hearing officer, no such criminal
charge may be brought by the city for the same violation.
         (e)   During the time any civil penalty remains unpaid, no city
approval will be granted for a license, permit, or other city approval sought
by the violator or for property under the violator's ownership or control.
      (8)   Disposition of penalties. All civil penalties and late fees shall
be paid to the city and deposited into the general fund.

city and by allowing the destruction or defacement of such buildings and
structures. Accordingly, the purposes of this chapter are to:

which reflect elements of the city's cultural, social, economic, political,

rehabilitation heritage landmarks and heritage landmark districts and to
participate in federal or state programs to do the same;

residents and visitors;
   (D)   Strengthen the local economy through the protection and promotion of
Gaylord's unique historic character;
   (E)   Foster knowledge and civic pride in the beauty and noble
accomplishments of the past;

and sites;

with the existing historic buildings and neighborhoods but will not necessarily
be of the same architectural style.

§ 31.22 REGULATION OF DEMOLITION AND MOVING.
   (A)    The demolition or moving of heritage landmarks shall be discouraged.
The Commission may, however, after careful consideration of the effect of the
move on the heritage landmark in question and on the entire heritage landmark
district, issue a certificate of appropriateness for moving or demolition of a
heritage landmark or contributing structure of a heritage landmark district.
   (B)   In applications involving the demolition or relocation of a heritage
landmark, provision shall be made for a public hearing as set forth in this
chapter.
   (C)   Upon receiving an application concerning the demolition or relocation
of a heritage landmark or a contributing site located in an heritage landmark
district, the Commission within 90 days after receipt of the application shall
either approve or deny such application, or find that the preservation and
protection of heritage landmarks and the public interest will best be served by
postponing the demolition or relocation for a designated period, which shall
not exceed 180 days from the receipt of the application, and notify the
applicant of such postponement.
   (D)   Within the period of postponement of such demolition of any heritage
landmark or contributing site, the Commission shall take steps to ascertain
what the City Council can or may do to preserve such building, including
consultation with private civic groups and interested private citizens and
including investigation of the potential use of the power of eminent domain
when the preservation of a given building is clearly in the interest of the
general welfare of the community and of certain historic and architectural
significance. The Commission may also request a reuse study be completed to
determine potential reuses of the building proposed to be demolished.
   (E)   For review of a certificate of appropriateness for relocating or
demolition, the Commission shall use the following general criteria. In order
for the Commission to approve relocating or demolition of a heritage landmark
or contributing site, at least one of the following requirements must be met:
      (1)   Despite evidence of the owner's efforts to properly maintain the
structure, retention of the resource constitutes a hazard to public safety that
cannot be eliminated by economic means available to the owner, including the
sale of the structure on its present site to any purchaser willing to preserve
the structure.
      (2)   Preservation of the resource is a deterrent to a major improvement
program that will be of substantial benefit to the community.
      (3)   Retaining the resource will cause an undue and unreasonable
financial hardship to the owner, taking into account the financial resources
available to the owner including the sale of the structure to any purchaser
willing to preserve the building. The applicant shall provide proof of
financial hardship as required and defined by the Commission.
   (F)   In determining whether reasonable alternatives exist, the Commission
shall consider, but not be limited to, the integrity of the property and the
economic value or usefulness of the existing structure, including its current
use, costs of renovation and feasible alternative uses.
   (G)   In addition to the general criteria listed in division (E) the
applicant must also demonstrate:
      (1)   If requesting demolition, that the structure cannot be practically
moved to another site in Gaylord.
      (2)   If requesting relocation, that structure can be moved without
significant damage to its physical integrity and the applicant can show the
relocation activity is the best preservation method for the character and
integrity of the structure.
   (H)   Prior to issuance of a certificate of appropriateness for demolition
or relocation of a building or structure, a plan for the use of the property
being vacated by the proposed demolition or relocation shall be submitted and
approved by the commission. The approval of a certificate of appropriateness
for demolition or relocation may be conditioned on issuance of a certificate of
appropriateness for the new construction on the site.

the City Administrator. All appeals shall be filed within ten working days of
the date of the Commission's order and decision. A copy of the notice of appeal
and statement setting forth the grounds for the appeal shall be transmitted to
City Council and a copy sent to the Commission. City Council may overturn the
Commission's order and decision by a majority vote of all members of the City
Council. The Commission, in any written order denying a Certificate of
Appropriateness application, shall advise the applicant of the applicant's
right to appeal to the City Council and shall include this section in all such
orders.

site within a heritage landmark district is threatened with demolition by
neglect, the Commission may do one of the following:
   (A)   Request the owner of the heritage landmark or contributing site to
repair all conditions contributing to demolition by neglect.
   (B)   In the event that efforts by the Commission to preserve the heritage
landmark or contributing site fail, the Commission may recommend to the City

structure and for the property if a landmark was moved or demolished without an
approved certificate of appropriateness.
   (B)   Work which proceeds in violation of this subchapter, in contravention
of a stop work order, or in disregard of a court ordered injunction shall be a
public nuisance.
   (C)   A person, individual, partnership, firm, corporation, organization,
institution or agency of government that violates this subchapter may be
ordered by the court to pay the cost to restore or replicate a resource
unlawfully constructed, altered, repaired, converted, moved, or subjected to
demolition.

§ 31.28 SECRETARY OF INTERIOR STANDARDS.
   (A)   A property will be used as it was historically or be given a new use
that requires minimal change to its distinctive materials, features, spaces,
and spatial relationships.

The removal of distinctive materials or alteration of features, spaces, and
spatial relationships that characterize a property will be avoided.
   (C)   Each property will be recognized as a physical record of its time,
place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development,
such as adding conjectural features or elements from other historic properties,
will not be undertaken.
   (D)   Changes to a property that have acquired historic significance in
their own right will be retained and preserved.
   (E)   Distinctive materials, features, finishes, and construction techniques
or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property will be preserved.
   (F)   Deteriorated historic features will be repaired rather than replaced.
Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive
feature, the new feature will match the old in design, color, texture, and,
where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features will be
substantiated by documentary and physical evidence.
   (G)   Chemical or physical treatments, if appropriate, will be undertaken
using the gentlest means possible. Treatments that cause damage to historic
materials will not be used.
   (H)   Archeological resources will be protected and preserved in place. If
such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures will be undertaken.
   (I)   New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction will

proportion, and massing to protect the integrity of the property and its
environment.

programming of those emergency activities as will involve the utilization of
the facilities of the department or agency.
   (F)   The Director shall, in cooperation with those city departments and
agencies affected, assist in the organizing, recruiting, and training of
emergency management personnel, which may be required on a volunteer basis to
carry out the Emergency Plans of the city and state. To the extent that

§ 32.06 EMERGENCY REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Whenever necessary to meet a declared emergency or to prepare for an
emergency for which adequate regulations have not been adopted by the Governor
or the Council, the Council may, by resolution, promulgate regulations,
consistent with applicable federal or state law or regulation, respecting: the
conduct of persons and the use of property during emergencies; the repair,
maintenance and safeguarding of essential public services, emergency health,
fire and safety regulations, drills or practice periods required for
preliminary training, and all other matters which are required to protect
public safety, health and welfare in declared emergencies.
   (B)   Every resolution of emergency regulations shall be in writing; shall
be dated; shall refer to the particular emergency to which it pertains, if so
limited, and shall be filed in the office of the City Clerk. A copy shall be
kept posted and available for public inspection during business hours. Notice
of the existence of these regulations and their availability for inspection at
the City Clerk’s office shall be conspicuously posted at the front of the City
Hall or other headquarters of the city or at other places in the affected area
as the Council shall designate in the resolution. By resolution, the Council
may modify or rescind a regulation.
   (C)   The Council may rescind any regulation by resolution at any time. If
not sooner rescinded, every regulation shall expire at the end of 30 days after
its effective date or at the end of the emergency to which it relates,
whichever comes first. Any resolution, rule or regulation inconsistent with an
emergency regulation promulgated by the Council shall be suspended during the
period of time and to the extent conflict exists.
   (D)   During a declared emergency, the city is, under the provisions of M.S.
§ 12.31, as it may be amended from time to time, and notwithstanding any
statutory or Charter provision to the contrary, empowered, through its Council,
acting within or without the corporate limits of the city, to enter into
contracts and incur obligations necessary to combat the disaster by protecting
the health and safety of persons and property and providing emergency
assistance to the victims of a disaster. The city may exercise these powers in
the light of the exigencies of the disaster without compliance with the time-
consuming procedures and formalities prescribed by law pertaining to the
performance of public work, entering rental equipment agreements, purchase of
supplies and materials, limitations upon tax levies and the appropriation and
expenditure of public funds, including, but not limited to, publication of
resolutions, publication of calls for bids, provisions of personnel laws and
rules, provisions relating to low bids and requirement for bids.
Penalty, see §

   (A)   False alarms. Any person, defined as any individual, or any business
entity or corporation or any agents or employees thereof, will not be billed

alarms are given in the reasonable and good faith belief that at emergency does
exist. A third false alarm in a 12 month period from the same person, including
the same business entity or corporation or any agents or employees thereof,
shall incur a flat charge a $500 for the call, regardless of whether the third
false alarm is in good faith or not. Any person, to include any business entity

bad faith, meaning they knew or should have known that the alarm was false,
shall be charged a flat call charge of $500 in all cases.
   (B)   Non-emergency activity. The City Council, at the recommendation of the

recommendation of the Fire Department, shall have the right to pass on to the
emergency call property owner any fees or costs charged by the other government
agency or private entity for their assistance.
(Ord. 291, passed 3-21-2012)
§ 34.11 BILLING AND COLLECTION; APPLICATION OF COLLECTIONS TO BUDGET.
   (A)   Billing and collection.
      (1)   Parties requesting and receiving fire services may be billed
directly by the city. Additionally, if the party receiving fire services did
not request services but a fire or other situation exists, which at the
discretion of the Fire Department personnel in charge requires fire service,
the party will be charged and billed. All parties will be billed whether or not
the fire service is covered by insurance. Any billable amount of the fire
charge not covered by a party’s insurance remains a debt of the party or
property owner receiving the fire service.
      (2)   Parties billed for fire service will have 90 days to pay. If the
fire service charge is not paid by that time, it will be considered delinquent
and the city will send a notice of delinquency.
      (3)   If the fire service charge remains unpaid for 90 days after this
notice of delinquency is sent, the city will use all practical and reasonable
legal means to collect the fire service charge. The party receiving fire
service shall be liable for all collection costs incurred by the city
including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney fees and court costs.
      (4)   If the fire service charge remains unpaid for 90 days after the
notice of delinquency is sent, the City Council by formal resolution, after due
consideration, may also, on or before October 15 of each year, certify the
unpaid fire service charge to the County Auditor in which the recipient of the
services owns real property for collection with property taxes.
   The County Auditor is responsible for remitting to the city all charges
collected on behalf of the city. The city must give the property owner notice
of its intent to certify the unpaid fire service charge by September 15.
      (5)   False alarms will be billed as specified in § 34.08(A).
   (B)   Application of collections to budget. All collected fire charges will
be city funds used to offset the expenses of the Fire Department in providing
fire services.

Payment of monthly utility services shall be made at the office of the city's

§ 50.03 PAYMENTS FOR UTILITY SERVICES; DELINQUENCY.
   Payments for utility services shall be considered delinquent if not paid in
full on or within 30 days after the initial billing notice has been mailed. If
the situation occurs, a second billing notice for utility services will be
mailed to the property owner to include billing charges in full for the initial
billing period previously mailed along with any and all additional utility
service charges accumulated in the 30 days following the initial billing
notice. A “shut-off” notice will also be included in this mailing containing

   (B)   Date, time, and place of the next scheduled City Council meeting to

bill and shut-off notice;
   (E)   A copy of this chapter shall be sent with the shut-off notice;
   (F)   Notification that if the total amount due is not paid in full within
30 days after the utility services bill became delinquent, water service will
be discontinued and not reinstated until payment of all charges has been made
in full; and
   (G)   Notification that if the shut-off of water services are conducted, a

(Ord. 258, passed - -)
§ 50.05 HEARING.
   The customer and/or property owner has the right to be heard by the City
Council before utility services are discontinued due to a delinquent utility
services bill. If the customer and/or property owner and the City Council come
to an agreement regarding payment of the total amount due, the agreement must
be followed explicitly or the utility services will be discontinued the first
business day after agreement violation without an additional chance to be
heard.
(Ord. 250, passed 8-18-2004)
§ 50.06 SPECIAL AGREEMENTS; PARTIAL PAYMENT.
   Partial payment of total amount due, less the shut-off notice fee, shown on

City Council, the total amount due must be paid by the shut-off notice due
date.
(Ord. 250, passed 8-18-2004)
§ 50.07 RESPONSIBILITY OF OWNER OF PROPERTY.
   All accounts shall be in the name of the owner of the property being
serviced by utility services and the owner shall be liable for utility services
to the owner's property whether the owner is occupying the property or not.
   (A)   Property owners. The total amount due shown on the shut-off notice
must be paid even though the utility services have been discontinued. If the
total amount due shown on the shut-off notice is not paid in full in ten
consecutive calendar days after shut-off notice due date, then the account
shall be put on the "collection as taxes list".
   (B)   Collection as taxes list. If an account is paid in full before this
list is certified to the county's Auditor, then that account shall be removed
from the "collection as taxes list". All accounts shall be removed from the
"collection as taxes list" once the list is certified to the county's Auditor.
   (C)   Certify to county's Auditor. The city's Administrator of the city
shall on a quarterly basis each year certify the "collection as taxes list" to
the county's Auditor and shall thereupon become and be alien upon the property
on which the total amount due was incurred and shall be added to and become and
form part of the taxes next to be assessed and levied upon the lot or any part
thereof and shall bear interest at the same rate as taxes and shall be
collected and enforced by the same officer and in the same manner as taxes.

§ 50.08 DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICE; CONTINUED RESPONSIBILITY FOR CHARGES.
   Having the utility services discontinued, voluntarily or involuntarily, does
not relieve utility service customers of utility service charges. If the
utility services are discontinued and sewer is connected to the city sanitary
sewer, a sewer service charge of 125% of the previous month’s average
residential sewer charge of all residential sewer charges in the city, shall be
billed monthly except where the City Council of the city feels that the sewage
volume is excessive then the City Council of the city shall establish a certain
rate at that time. This section does not apply to unoccupied property or to
property used solely for storage use.

   By accepting utility services from the city, each customer consents that the
city may enter in and upon private property at all times reasonable under the
circumstances for the purpose of reading, inspecting, and repairing meters or
the utility system, and for the purpose of connecting and disconnecting
service. If the city is denied access to the property for purposes consistent
with this division, the city may take any and all actions available to it under
Minnesota state and federal law to enforce its right to access, including legal
action. Any customer who wrongfully denies access under this division will also
be responsible for the costs, including attorney fees, associated with the city
enforcing its rights. These costs will be billed to the customer and, if they
remain unpaid after 90 days, will be assessed as tax against the property upon
which the utility is located, provided sufficient notice of such assessment is
given to the customer and landowner.

(Ord. 201, passed 12-7-1988)
§ 54.171 PROHIBITED DISCHARGES FROM SUMP PUMPS AND OTHER SOURCES INTO THE
SANITARY SEWER SYSTEM.
   (A)   Purpose. The City Council finds that the discharge of water from roof,
surface, groundwater, sump pump, footing tile, or swimming pool, or other
natural precipitation of the city sanitary sewage system will, and has on
numerous occasions in the past, flooded and overloaded the sanitary sewage
system to such an extent as to cause significant and grave damage to the waste
treatment plant and sanitary sewer trunk system. Such damage is caused by the
backup of sewage into the plant, private properties, and pressure damage to
trunk lines. The City Council, therefore, finds it essential to the
minimization of damage to property and to meet state Pollution Control Agency
and city code requirements that the provisions of this section be strictly
enforced to avoid emergencies in the future.
   (B)   Prohibition against discharges into sanitary sewer system. No water
from any roof, surface, groundwater, sump pump, footing tile, swimming pool, or
other natural precipitation shall be discharged into the sanitary sewer system.
Dwellings and other buildings and structures which require, because of
infiltration of water into basements, crawl spaces, and the like, a sump pump
discharge system shall have a permanently installed discharge line which shall
not at any time discharge water into the sanitary sewer system, except as
provided herein. A “permanently installed discharge line” shall be one which
provides for year around discharge capability to either the outside of the
dwelling, building, or structure, or is connected to the city storm sewer, or
discharges through the curb and gutter to the street. It shall consist of a
rigid discharge line, without valving or quick connections for altering the
path of discharge. It shall not be capable of connection or reconnection to the
sanitary sewer system.
   (C)   Disconnection. Before May 2014, any person, firm, or corporation
having a roof surface, groundwater, sump pump, footing tile, or swimming pool
now connected and/or discharging into the sanitary sewer system shall
disconnect and/or remove same. Any disconnects or openings in the sanitary
sewer shall be closed in an effective, workmanlike manner, as approved by the
city.
   (D)   Inspection. No later than August 1, 2014, every person owning improved
real estate that discharges into the city’s sanitary sewer system shall obtain
an inspection of each building located on such property by an inspector
designated by the city. The purpose of this inspection shall be to confirm that
there is no sump pump or other prohibited discharge into the sanitary sewer
system. In lieu of having the city inspect such property, the owner may, no
later than August 1, 2014, furnish a certificate from a licensed plumber, in a
form acceptable to the city, certifying that the property is in compliance with
this section.
   (E)   Future inspections. Any building may be reinspected on a yearly basis
in conjunction with yearly water meter or other inspections.
   (F)   New home inspections. All new homes will be required to have their
sump pump system inspected and be in compliance with this section prior to
issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
   (G)   Waivers.
      (1)   The City Council shall have the power and duty of hearing and
deciding requests for waivers from the applicability of the provisions of this
section where strict enforcement would cause undue hardship because of
circumstances unique to the individual property under consideration or cause a
safety problem. This would also include cases that would not be practical or
feasible to correct the clear water discharge problem.
      (2)   Application for waivers pursuant to this section shall be addressed
in writing to the City Administrator. The applications shall at a minimum
identify the property for which the waiver is being applied for, the name of
the property owner/applicant, and describe in detail what characteristics of
the subject property create an undue hardship. Within reasonable time the City
Council shall make its decision on the matter and send a copy of such decision
to the applicant by regular mail. Upon approval of an application for a waiver,
a property owner shall be allowed to discharge directly into the sanitary sewer
system for the time specified in the City Council’s written decision. The
applicant will be required to agree to pay an additional fee for the additional
sewer service, along with the regular monthly charge. Fees for this service
will be based on estimated yearly average amounts discharged to the sanitary
sewer.
   (H)   Surcharge and penalties. A surcharge of $100 per month will be added
to every sewer bill mailed after August 1, 2014, to property owners who have
not obtained a property inspection by that date and to property owners who are
not in compliance with this section. The surcharge shall be added every month
to be included in monthly bills for properties not complying with this section.
All properties found during yearly inspection to have violated this section
will be subject to the $100 per month charge for all months between the two
most recent inspections, and for each month thereafter until the property owner
submits proof to the city that the property is brought into full compliance. In
addition to the $100 per month charge, a property owner or other person who is
not in compliance this section may be mailed, by regular mail, with a notice
that such violation shall cease and desist within a time limit provided by the
City Council. If such violation does not cease and desist by the established
time limit, the owner of the property or other person violating this section
shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

collection and treatment facilities) and a debt retirement component (to meet
facility construction costs).
   (B)   As an equitable share of the expenses incurred by the city in the
construction, administration, operation, maintenance and replacement of the
sewerage works, each user will pay to the city a monthly amount based upon the
following formula:
A = V(F) + Q + I
   Where:   A = Service charge to user, with units of $ per month
      V = Average city unit cost of waste water collection and treatment, with
units of $ per 1,000 gallons of normal domestic strength waste water
      F = Volume of waste water from user with units of 1,000 gallons per month
(according to the method set forth herein)
      Q = Monthly administrative cost
      I = Monthly charge for I/I and administrative costs.
   (C)   Average city unit costs shall be computed annually, and shall include
operation and maintenance costs (including replacement costs) and annual
construction costs. Costs shall be distributed in the manner demonstrated in
the “Sewer Service Charge Outline,” for the city.
      (1)   Initial unit cost figures for the service charge will be
established by City Council resolution. Computations supporting unit cost
figures (f, b and SS) and service charges shall be revised annually. All users
discharging normal strength domestic waste water shall be billed a fixed rate
per 1,000 gallons of metered water used.
      (2)   Industrial users that discharge above normal domestic strength
waste water shall be billed monthly based upon the volume of waste water, the
pounds of BOD, and the pounds of suspended solids discharged. Monthly bills
shall be computed as follows:
Service charge =   f (Monthly flow) + b (lb BOD/month) + SS (lb SS/month)
   Where:   f = Average city unit cost of waste water treatment chargeable to
flow, with units of $ per 1,000 gallons
      b = Average city unit cost of waste water treatment chargeable to BOD,
with units of $ per pound of BOD
      SS= Average city unit cost of waste water treatment chargeable to
suspended solids, with units of $ per pound of suspended solids
      (3)   Each user of the city sewer system that does not have a metered
source of water must install an accurate water or waste water flow metering
device that will serve as a basis for estimating the volume of waste water
discharged, and determining the sewer service charge. The city will furnish a
residential size metering device to the user; user shall be responsible for
installing the meter.
      (4)   All users of city water that is not discharged to the city sanitary
sewer system may install a separate water system and meter (one only in the
same building as the main meter) to isolate and meter non-sewered water for
which no sewer charge is required. If at any time after this independent system
is installed, water from this system enters the sanitary sewer system, the user
will be subject to the penalties of §
54.99 and shall be ordered to eliminate the independent system if this
violation is continued.
(Ord. 201, passed 12-7-1988)
§ 54.51 ANNUAL REVIEW OF CASH FLOW.
   To insure the required financial surveillance, the City Clerk Administrator
shall annually review the cash flows associated with providing waste water
treatment service for the city, and shall report the findings to the City
Council at the regular April meeting of each year. Any iniquities and/or
shortages of revenue caused by unforeseen changes in the cost revenue pattern
of the waste water treatment facilities shall be remedied immediately by a City
Council resolution adjusting the unit cost figures. Adjusted unit figures shall
be computed in accordance with the principles of this subchapter.
(Ord. 201, passed 12-7-1988)
§ 54.52 BILLING.
   Waste water service charges provided for in this subchapter shall be
included as a separate item on the regular bill for water. Charges shall be
paid at the same time that the water charges of the person become due. The city
shall annually make available to all users, information showing what portion of
the service charge is necessary to meet the operation, maintenance and
replacement costs (user charge) and what portion is necessary to meet long term
debt (debt service charge).
(Ord. 201, passed 12-7-1988)
§ 54.53 SEWER SERVICE FUND.

other income dedicated to the administration, operation, maintenance,
replacement and construction of the waste water treatment works, including
taxes, special charges, fees and assessments intended to retire construction
debt.
   (B)   The city also establishes the following accounts as income and
expenditure accounts within the Sewer Service Fund:
      (1)   Administration, Operation and Maintenance Account;
      (2)   Equipment Replacement Account; and
      (3)   Debt Retirement Account.
   (C)   All revenue generated by the sewer service charge system, and all
other income pertinent to the treatment system, including taxes and special
assessments dedicated to retire construction debt, shall be held by the Clerk
Administrator separate and apart from all other funds of the city. Funds
received by the Sewer Service Fund shall be transferred to the Administration,
Operation and Maintenance Account, the Equipment Replacement Account and the
Debt Retirement Account in accordance with state and federal regulations and
the provisions of this chapter.
   (D)   Revenue generated by the sewer service charge system sufficient to
insure adequate replacement throughout the design or useful life, which ever is
longer, of the waste water facility shall be held separate and apart in the
Equipment Replacement Account and dedicated to effecting replacement costs.
Interest income generated by the Equipment Replacement Account shall remain in
the Equipment Replacement Account.
   (E)   Revenue generated by the sewer service charge system sufficient for

§ 56.001 FINDINGS, PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   To provide for the health, safety and welfare of its citizens, and to
ensure the integrity of its streets and the appropriate use of the rights-of-
way, the city strives to keep its rights-of-way in a state of good repair and
free from unnecessary encumbrances.
   (B)   Accordingly, the city enacts this new subchapter relating to right-of-
way permits and administration. This subchapter imposes reasonable regulation
on the placement and maintenance of facilities and equipment currently within
the city’s rights-of-way or to be placed therein at some future time. It is
intended to complement the regulatory roles of state and federal agencies.
Under this subchapter, persons excavating and obstructing the rights-of-way
will bear financial responsibility for their work through the recovery of out-
of-pocket and projected costs from persons using the public rights-of-way.
   (C)   This subchapter shall be interpreted consistently with 1997 Session
Laws, Chapter 123, substantially codified in M.S. §§ 237.16, 237.162, 237.163,
237.79, 237.81 and 238.086 (the “Act”), as amended from time to time, and the
other laws governing applicable rights of the city and users of the right-of-
way. This subchapter shall also be interpreted consistent with Minn. Rules
7819.0050 through 7819.9950, as amended from time to time, where possible. To
the extent that any provision of this subchapter cannot be interpreted
consistently with the Minnesota Rules, the interpretation most consistent with
the Act and other applicable statutory and case law is intended.

(Ord. 235, passed 10-4-2000)
§ 56.013 RIGHT-OF-WAY PATCHING AND RESTORATION.
   (A)   Timing. The work to be done under the excavation permit, and the
patching and restoration of the right-of-way as required herein, must be
completed within the dates specified in the permit, increased by as many days
as work could not be done because of circumstances beyond the control of the
permittee or when work was prohibited as unseasonal or unreasonable under §
56.016.
   (B)   Patch and restoration. Permittee must patch its own work. The city may
choose either to have the permittee restore the surface and subgrading portions
of right-of-way or to restore the surface portion of right-of-way itself.
       (1)   City restoration. If the city restores the surface portion of
right-of-way, permittee shall pay the costs thereof within 30 days of billing.
lf, following the restoration, the pavement settles due to permittee’s improper
backfilling, the permittee shall pay to the city, within 30 days of billing,
all costs associated with correcting the defective work.
      (2)   Permittee restoration. If the permittee restores the right-of-way
itself, it shall at the time of application for an excavation permit post a
construction performance bond in accordance with the provisions of Minn. Rules
part 7819.3000, as amended from time to time.
      (3)   Degradation fee in lieu of restoration. In lieu of right-of-way
restoration, a right-of-way user may elect to pay a degradation fee. However,
the right-of-way user shall remain responsible for replacing and compacting the
subgrade and aggregate based material in the excavation and the degradation fee
shall not include the cost to accomplish these responsibilities.
   (C)   Standards. The permittee shall perform patching and restoration
according to the standards and with the materials specified by the city and
shall comply with Minn. Rules part 7819.1100, as amended from time to time.
   (D)   Duty to correct defects. The permittee shall correct defects in
patching, or restoration performed by permittee or its agents. Upon
notification from the city, permittee shall correct all restoration work to the
extent necessary, using the method required by the city. Unless otherwise
agreed to by the Superintendent of Streets, the work shall be completed within
five calendar days of receipt of the notice from the city, not including days
during which work cannot be done because of circumstances constituting force
majeure or days when work is prohibited as unseasonal or unreasonable under §
56.016.
   (E)   Failure to restore. If the permittee fails to restore the right-of-way
in the manner and to the condition required by the city, or fails to
satisfactorily and timely complete all restoration required by the city, the
city shall notify the permittee in writing of the specific alleged failure or
failures and shall allow the permittee ten days from receipt of the written
notice to cure the failure or failures, unless otherwise extended by the
Superintendent of Streets. In the event the permittee fails to cure, the city
may, at its option, perform the necessary work and permittee shall pay to the
city, within 30 days of billing, the cost of restoring the right-of-way. If
permittee fails to pay as required, the city may exercise its rights under the
construction performance bond.

excavate or obstruct the right-of-way at the same place and time.
   (B)   Shared fees. Registrants who apply for permits for the same
obstruction or excavation, which the city does not perform, may share in the
payment of the obstruction or excavation permit fee. In order to obtain a joint
permit, registrants must agree among themselves as to the portion each will pay
and indicate the same on their applications.
   (C)   With city projects. Registrants who join in a scheduled obstruction or
excavation performed by the city, whether or not it is a joint application by
two or more registrants or a single application, are not required to pay the
excavation or obstruction and degradation portions of the permit fee, but a
permit would still be required.
(Ord. 235, passed 10-4-2000)
§ 56.015 SUPPLEMENTARY APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   Limitation on area. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the area
of the right-of-way specified in the permit. No permittee may do any work
outside the area specified in the permit, except as provided herein. Any
permittee which determines that an area greater than that specified in the
permit must be obstructed or excavated must before working in that greater area
make application for a permit extension and pay any additional fees required
thereby, and be granted a new permit or permit extension.
   (B)   Limitation on dates. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the dates
specified in the permit. No permittee may begin its work before the permit
start date or, except as provided herein, continue working after the end date.
If a permittee does not finish the work by the permit end date, it must apply
for a new permit for the additional time it needs, and receive the new permit
or an extension of the old permit before working after the end date of the
previous permit. This supplementary application must be submitted before the
permit end date.
(Ord. 235, passed 10-4-2000)
§ 56.016 OTHER OBLIGATIONS.
   (A)   Compliance with other laws. Obtaining a right-of-way permit does not
relieve permittee of its duty to obtain all other necessary permits, licenses
and authority and to pay all fees required by the city or other applicable
rule, law or regulation. A permittee shall comply with all requirements of
local, state and federal laws, including M.S. §§ 216D.01 through 216D.09, as
amended from time to time (Gopher One Call excavation notice system). A
permittee shall perform all work in conformance with all applicable codes and
established rules and regulations, and is responsible for all work done in the
right-of-way pursuant to its permit, regardless of who does the work.
   (B)   Prohibited work. Except in an emergency, and with the approval of the
city, no right-of-way obstruction or excavation may be done when seasonally
prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable for the work.
   (C)   Interference with right-of-way.
      (1)   A permittee shall not so obstruct a right-of-way that the natural
free and clear passage of water through the gutters or other waterways shall be
interfered with, unless otherwise approved by the Superintendent of Streets.
      (2)   Private vehicles of those doing work in the right-of-way may not be
parked within or next to a permit area, unless parked in conformance with city
parking regulations. The loading or unloading of trucks must be done solely
within the defined permit area unless specifically authorized by the permit.
   (D)   Traffic control. A permittee shall implement traffic control measures
in the area of the work and shall use traffic control procedures in accordance
with the most recent manuals on uniform traffic control, traffic control
devices and traffic zone layouts published by the state.
(Ord. 235, passed 10-4-2000)
§ 56.017 DENIAL OF PERMIT.

the city and to all others as authorized by law for inspection at all
reasonable times during the execution of and upon completion of the work.
   (C)   Authority of Superintendent of Streets.
      (1)   At the time of inspection, the Superintendent of Streets may order
the immediate cessation of any work, which poses a serious threat to the life,
health, safety or well-being of the public.
      (2)   The Superintendent of Streets may issue an order to the permittee
to correct any work that does not conform to the terms of the permit or other
applicable standards, conditions, or code. If the work failure is a
“substantial breach” within the meaning of M.S.§ 237.163, Subd. 4(c), as
amended from time to time, the order shall state that failure to correct the
violation will be cause for revocation of the permit after a specified period
determined by the Superintendent of Streets. The permittee shall present proof
to the Superintendent of Streets that the violation has been corrected within
the time period set forth by the Superintendent of Streets in the order. The
proof shall be provided no later than the next business day following the day
of completion. If the proof has not been presented within the required time,
the Superintendent of Streets may revoke the permit pursuant hereto.
(Ord. 235, passed 10-4-2000)
§ 56.020 WORK DONE WITHOUT A PERMIT.
   (A)   Emergency situations.
      (1)   Each registrant shall immediately notify the Superintendent of
Streets of any event regarding its facilities that the registrant considers to
be an emergency. The registrant may proceed to take whatever actions are
necessary to respond to the emergency. Within two business days after the
occurrence of the emergency the registrant shall apply for the necessary
permits, pay the fees associated therewith and fulfill the rest of the
requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with this subchapter for
the actions it took in response to the emergency.
      (2)   If the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding a registrant’s
facilities, the city will attempt to contact the local representative of each
registrant affected, or potentially affected, by the emergency. In any event,
the city may take whatever action it deems necessary to respond to the
emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the registrant whose facilities
occasioned the emergency.
   (B)   Non-emergency situations. Except in an emergency, any person who,
without first having obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or excavates a
right-of-way must subsequently obtain a permit, pay an unauthorized work permit
fee in an amount established from time to time by the City Council, deposit
with the city the fees necessary to correct any damage to the right-of-way and
comply with all of the requirements of this subchapter.
(Ord. 235, passed 10-4-2000)
§ 56.021 SUPPLEMENTARY NOTIFICATION.
   If the obstruction or excavation of the right-of-way begins later or ends
sooner than the date given on the permit, the permittee shall notify the city
of the accurate information as soon as this information is known.
(Ord. 235, passed 10-4-2000)
§ 56.022 REVOCATION OF PERMITS.
   (A)   Substantial breach. The city reserves its right to revoke any right-
of-way permit, without a fee refund, if there is a substantial breach of the
terms and conditions of any statute, chapter, rule or regulation, or any
material condition of the permit. A substantial breach by permittee shall
include, but shall not be limited to, the following:
      (1)   The violation of any material provision of the right-of-way permit;
      (2)   An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the right-
of-way permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit
upon the city or its citizens;
      (3)   Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a
right-of-way permit;
      (4)   The failure to complete the work in a timely manner; unless a
permit extension is obtained or unless the failure to complete work is due to
reasons beyond the permittee’s control; or
      (5)   The failure to correct, in a timely manner, work that does not
conform to a condition indicated on an order issued pursuant to §
56.019(C)(2) of this subchapter.
   (B)   Written notice of breach. If the city determines that the permittee
has committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any statute,
chapter, rule, regulation or any condition of the permit the city shall make a
written demand upon the permittee to remedy the violation. The demand shall
state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. A
substantial breach, as stated above, will allow the city to place additional or
revised conditions on the permit to mitigate and remedy the breach.
   (C)   Response to notice of breach. Within a time established by the
Superintendent of Streets following permittee’s receipt of notification of the
breach, permittee shall provide the city with a plan to cure the breach,
acceptable to the city. The permittee’s failure to submit a timely and
acceptable plan, or permittee’s failure to timely implement the approved plan,
shall be cause for immediate revocation of the permit. Further, the permittee’s
failure to contact the city, or permittee’s failure to submit an acceptable
plan, or permittee’s failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, may
result in probation for up to one full year.
   (D)   Cause for probation. The city may establish a list of conditions of
the permit that if breached will be grounds to place the permittee on
probation. The city shall not enforce a probation program unless and until it
has established the conditions, which it may amend from time to time.
   (E)   Reimbursement of city costs. If a permit is revoked, the permittee
shall also reimburse the city for the city’s reasonable costs, including
restoration costs and the costs of collection and reasonable attorneys’ fees
incurred in connection with the revocation.

§ 56.024 UNDERGROUNDING.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to promote the health, safety
and general welfare of the public and is intended to foster safe travel over
the right-of-way; non-travel related safety around homes and buildings where
overhead feeds are connected; and orderly development in the city. Location and
relocation, installation and reinstallation of facilities in the right-of-way
must be made in accordance with this division. This section intended to be
enforced consistently with state and federal law regulating right-of-way users,
specifically including but not limited to M.S. §§ 161.45, 237.162, 237.163,
301B.01, 222.37, 238.084 and 216B.36, as amended from time to time, and the
Telecommunications Act of 1996, 47 U.S.C. § 253.
   (B)   Undergrounding of facilities. Facilities newly installed, constructed
or otherwise placed in the public right-of-way or in other public property held
in common for public use must be located and maintained underground pursuant to
the terms and conditions of this subchapter and in accordance with applicable
construction standards, subject to the exceptions below. Above-ground
installation, construction, modification or replacement of meters, gauges,
transformers, street lighting, pad mount switches, capacitor banks, re-closers
and service connection pedestals shall be allowed. The requirements of this
section shall apply equally outside of the corporate limits of the city
coincident with city jurisdiction of platting, subdivision regulation or
comprehensive planning as may now or in the future be allowed by law.
   (C)   Exceptions to undergrounding. The following exceptions to the strict
application of this section shall be allowed upon the conditions stated.
      (1)   Transmission lines. Above-ground installation, construction or
placement of those facilities commonly referred to as “high voltage
transmission lines” upon which a conductor’s normal operating voltage equals or
exceeds 23,000 volts (phase to phase) shall be allowed only by prior approval
of the Council; provided, however, that, 60 days prior to commencement of
construction of the project, the city shall be furnished notice of the proposed
project and, upon request, the right-of-way user involved shall furnish all
relevant information regarding the project to the city. This provision shall
not be construed as waiving the requirements of any other chapter or regulation
of the city as the same may apply to the proposed project.
      (2)   Technical and economic feasibility. Above-ground installation,
construction, or placement of facilities shall be allowed in residential,
commercial and industrial areas where the Council, following consideration and
recommendation by the Planning and Zoning Commission, finds that:
         (a)   Underground placement would place an undue financial burden upon
the landowner, ratepayers or right-of-way user or would deprive the landowner
of the preservation and enjoyment of substantial property rights; or
         (b)   Underground placement is impractical or not technically feasible
due to topographical, subsoil or other existing conditions which adversely
affect underground facilities placement.
      (3)   Temporary service. Above-ground installation, construction or
placement of temporary service lines shall only be allowed:
         (a)   During new construction of any project for a period not to
exceed 24 months;
         (b)   During an emergency in order to safeguard lives or property
within the city; and
         (c)   For a period of not more than seven months when soil conditions
make excavation impractical.
   (D)   Undergrounding of permanent replacement, relocated or reconstructed
facilities. If the city finds that one or more of the purposes set forth in
division (A) above would be promoted, the city may require a permanent
replacement, relocation or reconstruction of a facility of more than 300 feet
to be located, and maintained underground, with due regard for seasonal working
conditions. For purposes of this subchapter, reconstruction means any
substantial repair of or any improvement to existing facilities. Undergrounding
may be required whether a replacement, relocation or reconstruction is
initiated by the right-of-way user owning or operating the facilities, or by
the city in connection with the present or future use by the city or other
local government unit of the right-of-way or other public ground for a public
project; the public health or safety; or the safety and convenience of travel
over the right-of-way.
   (E)   Retirement of overhead facilities. The City Council may determine
whether it is in the public interest that all facilities within the city, or
facilities within certain districts designated by the city, be permanently
placed and maintained underground by a date certain or target date,
independently of undergrounding required pursuant to divisions (B) and (D) of
this section. The decision to underground must be preceded by a public hearing,
after published notice and written notice to the utilities affected. (Two weeks
published: 30 days written.) At the hearing, the Council must consider
divisions (G)(1) through (4) in this section and make findings. Undergrounding
may not take place until City Council has, after hearing and notice, adopted a
plan containing items in divisions (H)(1) through (6) of this section.
   (F)   Public hearings. A hearing must be open to the public and may be
continued from time to time. At each hearing any person interested must be
given an opportunity to be heard. The subject of the public hearings shall be
the issue of whether facilities in the right-of-way in the city, or located
within a certain district, shall all be located underground by a date certain.
Hearings are not necessary for the undergrounding required under divisions (B)
and (D) of this section.
   (G)   Public hearing issues. The issues to be addressed at the public
hearings include, but are not limited to:
      (1)   The costs and benefits to the public of requiring the
undergrounding of all facilities in the right-of-way;
      (2)   The feasibility and cost of undergrounding all facilities by a date
certain as determined by the city and the affected utilities;
      (3)   The tariff requirements, procedure and rate design for recovery or
intended recovery of incremental costs for undergrounding by the utilities from
ratepayers within the city;
      (4)   Alternative financing options available if the city deems it in the
public interest to require undergrounding by a date certain and deems it
appropriate to participate in the cost otherwise borne by the ratepayers; and
      (5)   Upon completion of the hearing or hearings, the City Council must
make written findings on whether it is in the public interest to establish a
plan under which all facilities will be underground, either citywide or within
districts designated by the city.
   (H)   Undergrounding plan. If the Council finds that it is in the public
interest to underground all or substantially all facilities in the public right
of way or in non-right-of-way public ground, the Council must establish a plan
for the undergrounding. The plan for undergrounding must include at least the
following elements:
      (1)   Timetable for the undergrounding;
      (2)   Designation of districts for the undergrounding unless the
undergrounding plan is citywide;
      (3)   Exceptions to the undergrounding requirement and procedure for
establishing the exceptions;
      (4)   Procedures for the undergrounding process, including, but not
limited to, coordination with city projects and provisions to ensure compliance
with non-discrimination requirements under the law;
      (5)   A financing plan for funding of the incremental costs if the city
determines that it will finance some of the undergrounding costs, and a
determination and verification of the claimed additional costs to underground
incurred by the utility; and
      (6)   Penalties or other remedies for failure to comply with the
undergrounding.
   (I)   Facilities location.
      (1)   In addition to complying with the requirements of M.S. §§ 216D.01

system), before the start date of any right-of-way excavation, each registrant
who has facilities located in the area to be excavated shall mark the
horizontal placement of all the facilities. To the extent its records contain
the information, each registrant shall provide information regarding the
approximate vertical location of its facilities to excavators upon request.
Nothing in this division is meant to limit the rights, duties, and obligations
of facility owners or excavators as set forth in M.S. §§ 216D.01 through
216D.09, as amended from time to time. Any right-of-way user whose facility is
less than 20 inches below a concrete or asphalt surface shall notify and work
closely with the excavation contractor in an effort to establish and mark the
exact horizontal and vertical location of its facility and the best procedure
for excavation.
      (2)   All facilities shall be placed in appropriate portions of right-of-
way so as to cause minimum conflict with other underground facilities. When
technically appropriate, all utilities shall be installed, constructed or
placed within the same trench.
   (J)   Developer responsibility. All owners, platters or developers are
responsible for complying with the requirements of this section, and prior to
final approval of any plat or development plan, shall submit to the
Superintendent of Streets written instruments from the appropriate right-of-way
users showing that all necessary arrangements with the users for installation
of the facilities have been made.

   A right-of-way user shall promptly and at its own expense, with due regard
for seasonal working conditions, permanently remove and relocate its facilities
in the right-of-way when it is necessary to prevent interference, and not
merely for the convenience of the city, in connection with a present or future
city use of the right-of-way for a public project; the public health or safety;
or the safety and convenience of travel over the right-of-way.
(Ord. 235, passed 10-4-2000)
§ 56.026 INTERFERENCE BY OTHER FACILITIES.
   When the city does work in the right-of-way in its governmental right-of-way
management function and finds it necessary to maintain, support, or move a
registrant’s facilities to carry out the work without damaging registrant’s
facilities, the city shall notify the local representative as early as is
reasonably possible. The city costs associated therewith will be billed to that
registrant and must be paid within 30 days from the date of billing. Each
registrant shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any facilities in the
right-of-way which it or its facilities damages.

by another registrant.
   (B)   Removal. Any registrant who has abandoned facilities in any right-of-
way shall remove it from that right-of-way if required in conjunction with
other right-of-way repair, excavation or construction, unless this requirement
is waived by the city.

permit; has had permit revoked; or believes that the fees imposed are not in
conformity with M.S. § 237.163, Subd. 6, as amended from time to time, may have
the denial, revocation, or fee imposition reviewed, upon written request, by

§ 56.032 SEVERABILITY.
   If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this
subchapter is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court or
administrative agency of competent jurisdiction, the portion shall be deemed a
separate distinct, and independent provision and the holding shall not affect
the validity of the remaining portions thereof. If a regulatory body or a court
of competent jurisdiction should determine by a final, non-appealable order
that any such permit, right or registration issued under this charter or any
portions of this subchapter illegal or unenforceable, then the permit, right or
registration granted or deemed to exist hereunder shall be considered as a
revocable permit with a mutual right in either party to terminate without cause
upon giving 60 days’ written notice to the other. The requirements and
conditions of a revocable permit shall be the same requirements and conditions
as set forth in the permit, right or registration, respectively, except for
conditions relating to the term of the permit and the right of termination.

large and shall give notice of the impounding to the owner of the dog or other
animal, if known. The Animal Control Officer or police officer shall not enter

an unlicensed animal unless the officer has first obtained the permission of
the owner to do so or has obtained a warrant issued by a court of competent
jurisdiction, as provided for in §
10.20, to search for and seize the animal. In case the owner is unknown, the
officer shall post notice at the city office that if the dog or other animal is
not claimed within the time specified in division (C) of this section, it will
be sold or otherwise disposed of. Except as otherwise provided in this section,
it shall be unlawful to kill, destroy, or otherwise cause injury to any animal,
including dogs and cats running at large.
   (B)   Biting animals. Any animal that has not been inoculated by a live
modified rabies vaccine and which has bitten any person, wherein the skin has

the city pound for a period of not less than ten days, at the expense of the
owner. The animal may be released at the end of the time if healthy and free

if the owner of the animal shall elect immediately upon receipt of notice of
need for the confinement by the officer to voluntarily and immediately confine
the animal for the required period of time in a veterinary hospital of the
owner’s choosing, not outside of the county in which this city is located, and
provide immediate proof of confinement in the manner as may be required, the
owner may do so. If, however, the animal has been inoculated with a live
modified rabies vaccine and the owner has proof of the vaccination by a
certificate from a licensed veterinarian, the owner may confine the dog or
other animal to the owner’s property.
   (C)   Reclaiming. All animals conveyed to the pound shall be kept, with
humane treatment and sufficient food and water for their comfort, at least five
regular business days, unless the animal is a dangerous animal as defined under

times specified in §
90.11, and except if the animal is a cruelly-treated animal in which case it
shall be kept for ten regular business days, unless sooner reclaimed by their
owners or keepers as provided by this section. In case the owner or keeper
shall desire to reclaim the animal from the pound, the following shall be
required, unless otherwise provided for in this code or established from time
to time by resolution of the City Council:
      (1)   Payment of the release fee and receipt of a release permit as

premises, whether owned by the same person or not and for whatever purpose
kept, shall constitute a KENNEL; except that a fresh litter of pups may be kept
for a period of three months before that keeping shall be deemed to be a
KENNEL.
   (B)   Kennel as a nuisance. Because the keeping of six or more dogs on the
same premises is subject to great abuse, causing discomfort to persons in the
area by way of smell, noise, hazard, and general aesthetic depreciation, the

police officer, an animal presents an immediate danger to the health and safety
of any person, or the animal is threatening imminent harm to any person, or the

presenting a threat to the health and safety of the public, may be apprehended
and confined in the pound by any person, the Animal Control Officer or a police
officer. The officer shall have a qualified veterinarian examine the animal. If
the animal is found to be diseased in a manner so as to be a danger to the

abated within that time, the city may cause the weeds, grasses or other rank
growths to be cut, sprayed or otherwise removed and may recover the expenses
thereof, either by civil action against the owner or by ordering the Clerk to
extend such sum as a special assessment against such lot, to be collected with
other city taxes. The city shall mail the property owner notice of the amount
of such expenses. The property owner shall have 30 days from the date of such
notice to appeal to the City Council. After the first notice as to the
existence of a nuisance, no further notice in that calendar year shall be

to send one notice per calendar year containing the total expenses proposed to
be recovered by the city for such recurring nuisance.

official shall prepare a bill for the cost and mail it to the owner. Thereupon
the amount shall be immediately due and payable at the office of the City
Clerk.
   (B)   Assessment. After notice and hearing as provided in M.S. § 429.061, as
it may be amended from time to time, if the nuisance is a public health or
safety hazard on private property, the accumulation of snow and ice on public
sidewalks, the growth of weeds on private property or outside the traveled

spread the charges against the property under that statute and any other
pertinent statutes for certification to the County Auditor and collection along
with current taxes the following year or in annual installments, not exceeding
ten, as the City Council may determine in each case.

public. It is declared to be the intention of the Council to control and
prevent the spread of this disease and this chapter is enacted for that
purpose.

Inspector.

The Tree Inspector may remove or cause to be removed any tree or part thereof
which is in an unsafe condition or which by reason of its location or nature is
injurious to or infringes upon any public utility or public improvement, or is
affected with any injurious fungus, insect, or other pest. Every tree
overhanging any street or right-of-way within the city shall be pruned so that

the standards set forth in this subchapter.
   (G)   Adjacent landowner responsibility.  Owners of property adjacent to

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 110.01 PURPOSE.
   This chapter is not intended to, in any way, hinder, delay or interfere with
legitimate business or organizational activities. The Council finds, however,
that solicitors have used public streets and its direct contact with residents
of the city for the illegitimate solicitation practices of harassment,
nuisance, theft, deceit or menacing, troublesome or unlawful activities. This
chapter is intended to ferret out and control businesses and organizations
using solicitation as a means of concealing unlawful activities; businesses and
organizations which, though its activities be lawful or even commendable, use
the illegitimate practices in solicitation; and individual persons who, though
they represent lawful businesses and organizations, use the illegitimate
solicitation practices. The Council further finds that a large number of the
residents of the city are employed as their livelihood and means of support by
manufacturing plants and other businesses on shifts rotating between night and
day, and to disturb them during their sleeping hours for the purpose of
solicitation is a source of nuisance or even harassment and should be subject
to control.

GENERAL PROVISIONS; FINDINGS
§ 112.01 FINDINGS OF CITY COUNCIL.
   (A)   Studies conducted by the Minnesota Attorney General, the American
Planning Association and cities such as St. Paul, Minnesota; Indianapolis;
Alexandria, Minnesota; Rochester, Minnesota; Phoenix, Arizona; Los Angeles,
California; Seattle, Washington; have studied the impacts that adult
establishments have in those communities. These studies have concluded that
adult establishments have an adverse impact on the surrounding neighborhoods.
Those impacts include increased crime rates, lower property values, increased
transiency, neighborhood blight and potential health risks. Based on these
studies and findings, the City Council concludes:
      (1)   Adult establishments have adverse secondary impacts of the types
set forth above;
      (2)   The adverse impacts caused by adult establishments tend to diminish
if adult establishments are governed by locational requirements, licensing
requirements and health requirements;
      (3)   It is not the intent of the City Council to prohibit adult
establishments from having a reasonable opportunity to locate in the city;
      (4)   M.S. § 462.357, as amended from time to time, allows the city to
adopt regulations to promote the public health, safety, morals and general
welfare; and
      (5)   The public health, safety, morals and general welfare will be
promoted by the city adopting regulations governing adult establishments.
   (B)   The City Council makes the following findings regarding the need to
license sexually-oriented businesses. The findings are based upon the
experiences of other cities where the businesses have located, as studied by
city staff.
      (1)   Sexually-oriented businesses can contribute to an increase in
criminal activity in the area in which the businesses are located, taxing city
crime-prevention programs and law enforcement services.
      (2)   Sexually-oriented businesses can be used as fronts for prostitution
and other criminal activity. The experience of other cities indicates that the
proper management and operation of the businesses can, however, minimize this
risk; provided, the owners and operators of the facilities are regulated by
licensing or other procedures.
      (3)   Sexually-oriented businesses can increase the risk of exposure to
communicable diseases including, but not limited to, Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome (AIDS) for which currently there is no cure. Experiences of other
cities indicate that the businesses can facilitate the spread of communicable
diseases by virtue of the design and use of the premises, thereby endangering
not only the patrons of the establishments but also the general public.
      (4)   Sexually-oriented businesses can cause or contribute to public
health problems by the presence of live adult entertainment in conjunction with
food and/or drink on the same premises.
      (5)   The risk of criminal activity and/or public health problems can be
minimized through a licensing and regulatory scheme as prescribed herein.
(Ord. 246, passed 11-7-2001)
§ 112.02 PURPOSE.
   (A)   It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate adult-oriented
businesses to promote the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the
citizens of the city and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to:
      (1)   Prevent additional criminal activity within the city;
      (2)   Prevent deterioration of neighborhoods and its consequent adverse
effect on real estate values of properties within the neighborhood;
      (3)   To locate adult-oriented businesses away from residential areas,
schools, churches and parks and playgrounds; and
      (4)   Prevent concentration of adult-oriented businesses within certain
areas of the city.
   (B)   The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of
imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative
materials, including adult-oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent
nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to adult-
oriented materials protected by the first amendment or to deny access by
distributors and exhibitors of adult-oriented entertainment to their intended
market.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 113.01 ADOPTION OF STATE LAW BY REFERENCE.
    The provisions of M.S. Chapter 340A, as they may be amended from time to
time, with reference to the definition of terms, conditions of operation,
restrictions on consumption, provisions relating to sales, hours of sale, and
all other matters pertaining to the retail sale, distribution, and consumption
of intoxicating liquor and 3.2 percent malt liquor are hereby adopted by
reference and are made a part of this chapter as if set out in full. It is the
intention of the City Council that all future amendments to M.S. Chapter 340A
are hereby adopted by reference or referenced as if they had been in existence
at the time this chapter is adopted.
§ 113.02 CITY MAY BE MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN STATE LAW.
   The City Council is authorized by the provisions of M.S. § 340A.509, as it
may be amended from time to time, to impose, and has imposed in this chapter,
additional restrictions on the sale and possession of alcoholic beverages
within its limits beyond those contained in M.S. Chapter 340A, as it may be
amended from time to time.
§ 113.03 DEFINITIONS.
   In addition to the definitions contained in M.S. § 340A.101, as it may be
amended from time to time, the following terms are defined for purposes of this
chapter:
   LIQUOR. As used in this chapter, without modification by the words
“intoxicating” or “3.2 percent malt,” includes both intoxicating liquor and 3.2
percent malt liquor.
   RESTAURANT. An eating facility, other than a hotel, under the control of a
single proprietor or manager, where meals are regularly prepared on the
premises, where full waitress/waiter table service is provided, where a
customer orders food from printed menus and where the main food course is
served and consumed while seated at a single location. To be a RESTAURANT as
defined by this section, an establishment shall have a license from the state
as required by M.S. § 157.16, as it may be amended from time to time, and meet
the definition of either a “small establishment,” “medium establishment” or
“large establishment” as defined in M.S. § 157.16, Subd. 3d, as it may be
amended from time to time. An establishment which serves prepackaged food that
receives heat treatment and is served in the package or frozen pizza that is
heated and served, shall not be considered to be a restaurant for purposes of
this chapter unless it meets the definitions of “small establishment”, “medium
establishment” or “large establishment.”
§ 113.04 NUDITY ON THE PREMISES OF LICENSED ESTABLISHMENTS PROHIBITED.
   (A)   The City Council finds that it is in the best interests of the public
health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the city that nudity is
prohibited as provided in this section on the premises of any establishment
licensed under this chapter. This is to protect and assist the owners,
operators, and employees of the establishment, as well as patrons and the
public in general, from harm stemming from the physical immediacy and
combination of alcohol, nudity, and sex. The City Council especially intends to
prevent any subliminal endorsement of sexual harassment or activities likely to
lead to the possibility of various criminal conduct, including prostitution,
sexual assault, and disorderly conduct. The City Council also finds that the
prohibition of nudity on the premises of any establishment licensed under this
chapter, as set forth in this section, reflects the prevailing community
standards of the city.
   (B)   It is unlawful for any licensee to permit or allow any person or
persons on the licensed premises when the person does not have his or her
buttocks, anus, breasts, and genitals covered with a non-transparent material.
It is unlawful for any person to be on the licensed premises when the person
does not have his or her buttocks, anus, breasts, and genitals covered with a
non-transparent material.
   (C)   A violation of this section is a misdemeanor punishable as provided by
law, and is justification for revocation or suspension of any liquor, wine, or
3.2 percent malt liquor license or the imposition of a civil penalty under the
provisions of §
113.99(B).
Penalty, see §
113.99
§ 113.05 CONSUMPTION IN PUBLIC PLACES.
   No person shall consume intoxicating liquor or 3.2 percent malt liquor in a
public park, on any public street, sidewalk, parking lot or alley, or in any
public place other than on the premises of an establishment licensed under this
chapter, in a municipal liquor dispensary if one exists in the city, or where
the consumption and display of liquor is lawfully permitted.
Penalty, see §
113.99
LICENSING
§ 113.20 NUMBER OF LICENSES WHICH MAY BE ISSUED.
   State law establishes the number of liquor licenses that a city may issue.
However, the number of licenses which may be granted under this chapter is
limited to the number of license which were issued as of the effective date of
this chapter, even if a larger number of licenses are authorized by law or
election. The City Council in its sound discretion may provide by ordinance
that a larger number of licenses may be issued up to the number of licenses
authorized by M.S. Chapter 340A, as it may be amended from time to time. If a
larger number of licenses in a particular category has been authorized by a
referendum held under the provisions of M.S. § 340A.413, Subd. 3, as it may be
amended from time to time, but not all of them have been issued, the larger
number of licenses is no longer in effect until the City Council by ordinance
determines that any or all of the licenses may be issued. The City Council is
not required to issue the full number of licenses that it has available.
§ 113.21 TERM AND EXPIRATION OF LICENSES.
   Each license shall be issued for a maximum period of one year. All licenses,
except temporary licenses, shall expire on December 31 of each year unless
another date is provided by ordinance. All licenses shall expire on the same
date. Temporary licenses expire according to their terms. Consumption and
display permits issued by the Commissioner of Public Safety, and the
accompanying city consent to the permit, shall expire on March 31 of each year.

the Commissioner of Public Safety. The fee for club licenses established by the
City Council under §

as it may be amended from time to time. The City Council may in its sound
discretion authorize a retail on-sale licensee to dispense intoxicating liquor
off the licensed premises at a community festival held within the city under
the provisions of M.S. § 340A.404, Subd. 4b, as it may be amended from time to
time. The City Council may in its sound discretion authorize a retail on-sale
licensee to dispense intoxicating liquor off the licensed premises at any
convention, banquet, conference, meeting, or social affair conducted on the
premises of a sports, convention, or cultural facility owned by the city, under
the provisions of M.S. § 340A.404, Subd. 4a, as it may be amended from time to
time; however, the licensee is prohibited from dispensing intoxicating liquor
to any person attending or participating in an amateur athletic event being

M.S. § 340A.401, Subd. 1, as it may be amended from time to time. The fee for
an on-sale wine license established by the City Council under the provisions of
§
113.23 shall not exceed one-half of the license fee charged for an on-sale
intoxicating liquor license. The holder of an on-sale wine license who also

increased without providing mailed notice of a hearing on the proposed increase
to all affected licensees at least 30 days before the hearing.
   (C)   The fee for all licenses, except temporary licenses, granted after the
commencement of the license year shall be prorated on a quarterly basis.
   (D)   All license fees shall be paid in full at the time the application is
filed with the city. If the application is denied, the license fee shall be
returned to the applicant.
   (E)   A refund of a pro rata share of an annual license fee may occur only

§ 113.24 CITY COUNCIL DISCRETION TO GRANT OR DENY A LICENSE.
   The City Council in its sound discretion may either grant or deny the
application for any license or for the transfer or renewal of any license. No
applicant has a right to a license under this chapter.
§ 113.25 APPLICATION FOR LICENSE.
   (A)   Form. Every application for a license issued under this chapter shall
be on a form provided by the city. Every application shall state the name of
the applicant, the applicant’s age, representations as to the applicant’s
character, with references as the City Council may require, the type of license
applied for, the business in connection with which the proposed license will
operate and its location, a description of the premises, whether the applicant
is owner and operator of the business, how long the applicant has been in that
business at that place, and other information as the City Council may require
from time to time. An application for an on-sale intoxicating liquor license
shall be in the form prescribed by the Commissioner of Public Safety and shall
also contain the information required in this section. The form shall be
verified and filed with the city. No person shall make a false statement in an
application.
   (B)   Financial responsibility. Prior to the issuance of any license under
this chapter, the applicant shall demonstrate proof of financial responsibility
as defined in M.S. § 340A.409, as it may be amended from time to time, with
regard to liability under M.S. § 340A.801, as it may be amended from time to
time. This proof will be filed with the city and the Commissioner of Public
Safety. Any liability insurance policy filed as proof of financial
responsibility under this section shall conform to M.S. § 340A.409, as it may
be amended from time to time. Operation of a business which is required to be
licensed by this chapter without having on file with the city at all times
effective proof of financial responsibility is a cause for revocation of the
license.
Penalty, see §
113.99
§ 113.26 DESCRIPTION OF PREMISES.
   The application shall specifically describe the compact and contiguous
premises within which liquor may be dispensed and consumed. The description may

whether or not to renew a license rests within the sound discretion of the City
Council. No licensee has a right to have the license renewed.
§ 113.28 TRANSFER OF LICENSE.
   No license issued under this chapter may be transferred without the approval
of the City Council. Any transfer of stock of a corporate licensee is deemed to
be a transfer of the license, and a transfer of stock without prior City
Council approval is a ground for revocation of the license. An application to
transfer a license shall be treated the same as an application for a new
license, and all of the provisions of this code applying to applications for a
license shall apply.
Penalty, see §
113.99
§ 113.29 INVESTIGATION.
   (A)   Preliminary background and financial investigation. On an initial
application for a license, on an application for transfer of a license and, in
the sound discretion of the City Council that it is in the public interest to
do so, on an application for renewal of a license, the city shall conduct a
preliminary background and financial investigation of the applicant or it may
contract with the Commissioner of Public Safety for the investigation. The
applicant shall pay with the application an investigation fee of $500 which
shall be in addition to any license fee. If the cost of the preliminary
investigation is less than $500, the unused balance shall be returned to the
applicant. The results of the preliminary investigation shall be sent to the
Commissioner of Public Safety if the application is for an on-sale intoxicating
liquor license or an on-sale wine license.
   (B)   Comprehensive background and financial investigation. If the results
of a preliminary investigation warrant, in the sound discretion of the City
Council, a comprehensive background and financial investigation, the City
Council may either conduct the investigation itself or contract with the
Commissioner of Public Safety for the investigation. The investigation fee for
this comprehensive background and financial investigation to be paid by the
applicant shall be $500, less any amount paid for the initial investigation if
the investigation is to be conducted within the state, and $10,000, less any
amount paid for the initial investigation, if the investigation is required
outside the state. The unused balance of the fee shall be returned to the
applicant whether or not the application is denied. The fee shall be paid in
advance of any investigation and the amount actually expended on the
investigation shall not be refundable in the event the application is denied.
The results of the comprehensive investigation shall be sent to the
Commissioner of Public Safety if the application is for an on-sale intoxicating
liquor license or an on-sale wine license.
§ 113.30 HEARING AND ISSUANCE.
   The City Council shall investigate all facts set out in the application and
not investigated in the preliminary or comprehensive background and financial
investigations. Opportunity shall be given to any person to be heard for or
against the granting of the license. After the investigation and hearing, the
City Council shall in its sound discretion grant or deny the application. No
license shall become effective until the proof of financial security has been
approved by the Commissioner of Public Safety.

an existing license.
   (F)   No license shall be granted within 500 feet of any school or church.
The distance is to be measured from the closest side of the church to the

with the employee.
   (C)   Every licensee shall allow any peace officer, health officer, city
employee, or any other person designated by the City Council to conduct

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
§ 152.001 PURPOSE.
   Land subdivision is the first step in the process of community development.
Once land has been divided into streets, blocks, lots and open spaces, a
pattern has been established which determines how well community needs for
residence, business and industry will be met. It also determines, to a great
extent, how well the community will be able to handle its traffic circulation
problems, how well it will be able to meet the demand for more home sites and
how efficiently and economically it will be able to provide the many services
that are required. These subdivision regulations are designed to provide the
many services that are required. These subdivision regulations are designed to
provide for harmonious development of a subdivided area; for a coordinated
layout; for the proper arrangement of streets; for adequate and convenient
spaces for traffic, utilities, recreation, light, air and access for
firefighting equipment; and for adequate provision for water, drainage, sewer
and other sanitary facilities. These regulations shall not apply to land used
only for agricultural purposes.

         (b)   Zoning Districts R-2. A land dedication of 12% of the
undeveloped site or its fair market land value;
         (c)   Zoning District Commercial and I/C-1. A negotiated percentage of
land dedication of the undeveloped site or its fair market land value; and
         (d)   Business park or industrial zoned subdivision. None required,
with exception of comprehensively planned bike/pedestrian paths shall be by
easement.
      (2)   Infrastructure assessment costs. Infrastructure assessment costs
incurred with any of the land dedication above shall be calculated and levied
against the bike/pedestrian paths, park or open space by lineal foot of
frontage. In no case shall the assessment cost levied against the park or bike/
pedestrian path exceed 60% of the value of the land dedicated.
      (3)   Definition. For purposes of this division, FAIR MARKET LAND VALUE
is defined as the market value of the land within the plat or subdivision as of
the date presented to the Council for preliminary approval, as determined by
the City Assessor or the sale price, whichever is higher, in the same manner as
they shall determine the estimated market value of land for tax purposes,
excluding from the determination any value added to the land by improvements
serving the land, but including in the determination the highest and best force
at the time of the platting.
      (4)   Payment in lieu of dedication. The city shall have the option of
requiring a cash contribution in lieu of the land dedication set forth in
division (A) above. Cash contribution shall be based on the following schedule.
         (a)   Zoning District R-1. A cash contribution of $215 per unit;
         (b)   Zoning District R-2. A cash contribution of $175 per unit;
         (c)   Zoning District Commercial and I/C-1. A negotiated cash
contribution based on its fair market land value; and
         (d)   Business park or industrial zoned subdivision. None required.
      (5)   Partial dedication and partial payment. The city may permit or
require the subdivider to provide a partial dedication and a partial payment in
accordance with the requirements as set forth above.
      (6)   Review. The cash and land dedication value set forth above shall be
reviewed by the Park Board on an annual basis and a revised schedule, if any,
shall be set forth by the Council.
   (B)   When structures are constructed on property which has been previously
platted and on which plat no park or bike/pedestrian path dedication on record
in cash or land was given to the city, a park or bike/pedestrian path
dedication fee in accordance with the schedules hereinafter set forth shall be
paid at the time of the subdivision agreement or when the building permit is
issued. If the park or bike/pedestrian path as indicated on record has been
previously satisfied at the time of platting in accordance with the
requirements then in existence, then no further fee shall be levied. If a
partial payment has been made, then the balance of the development shall be
charged the rate set forth in division (A)(1) of this section.
   (C)   When building permits are issued on property which is not platted and
is not required to be platted prior to receiving a building permit, a fee shall
be paid at the time of building permit issuance in accordance with the above
schedule.
   (D)   Sums of money so received by the city shall be placed in a special
account to be known as the Public Sites and Equipment Fund and allocated by the
Council solely for the acquisition of land or purchase of equipment for public
parks, recreation areas or open spaces, bike/pedestrian path development of
existing parks and recreational areas or debt retirement in connection with the
land or equipment previously acquired for parks, bike/pedestrian paths,
recreational areas or open areas.
   (E)   Pursuant to state statute, the following may be required: The
subdivider shall be responsible for providing site development plans with
provisions for the control of drainage, erosion, and siltation if the plans are
considered necessary by the City Engineer or by law, for the purpose of soil
and water conservation.
   (F)   In high density zoning districts, the Council may require developments
of 24 units or more to create a private entity to maintain some form of on site
recreation for use by the site residents; specifically preschool children.
(Ord. 232, passed 11-1-2000)
§ 152.067 STREET, BICYCLE/PEDESTRIAN PATHS AND BLOCK LAYOUT.
   The following requirements are applicable to all subdivisions within the
city.
   (A)   The subdivision shall be so designed as to be in harmony with adjacent
subdivisions and provide for the continuation of existing streets and bicycle/
pedestrian paths. Provisions shall be made for streets and bicycle/pedestrian
paths through the subdivision for the platting of contiguous property.
   (B)   The street layout shall provide access adequate for emergency and
public service vehicles to all lots and parcels of land within the subdivision.
   (C)   Where appropriate to the design, streets shall be established to avoid
jogs at intersections and to promote continuity of local streets and those of
higher classifications. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125
feet shall be discouraged.
   (D)   Streets shall be established to take advantage of the contour of the
land so as to produce usable lots, cause a minimum of cutting and filling, and
to produce streets with reasonable grades as defined in §
152.070.
   (E)   Certain proposed streets, where appropriate, shall be extended to the
boundary line of the tract to provide for adequate circulation of traffic
within the vicinity.
   (F)   Streets shall intersect other streets as near to a 90-degree angle as
topography and other factors permit. Intersections of streets and arterial or
collector streets shall be limited to a minimum angle of 70 degrees unless
specifically approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
   (G)   Whenever there exists a dedicated or platted portion of a street,
alley or bicycle/pedestrian path adjacent to the proposed subdivision which
conforms to the official map, if so adopted, the remainder of the street or
alley shall be platted to the prescribed width within the proposed subdivision.
   (H)   Half-width streets shall be prohibited except where essential to the
reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other
requirements of these regulations. Where an existing half-width street adjoins
a portion of the boundary of a proposed subdivision, street dedication in a
width needed to make this a full-width street may be required.
   (I)   Street and right-of-way widths shall conform to those required by the
city. Where the widths are not prescribed, the widths shall not be less than
the minimum stated in §
152.068.
   (J)   Alleys shall be platted in the rear of all lots to be used for
commercial or industrial purposes. Alleys will not be approved in residential
areas, unless required by unusual topography or other exceptional conditions.
   (K)   Lands abutting arterial or collector streets shall be platted with the
view of making the lots, if for residential use, desirable for the use by
cushioning the impact of heavy traffic on the trafficways; and with the view
also of minimizing interference with traffic on the trafficways as well as the
accident hazard. This may be accomplished in several ways:
      (1)   By not fronting the lots on the highway or thoroughfare but on a
parallel local street at a distance of a generous lot depth, in which case
private driveways shall connect with the local street; and/or
      (2)   By a collector street platted more or less parallel with the
highway or thoroughfares, 600 to 1,000 feet distance therefrom, from which loop
streets or dead end streets would extend toward the highway, the ends of which
provide access to the lots abutting the highway to their rear.
   (L)   Dead end streets will be approved if limited to 500 feet long provided
a permanently designed turn around area having a minimum radius to the edge of
the finished street or curb line of not less than 53 feet and a minimum right-
of-way radius of 60 feet, is constructed.
   (M)   Closed subdivisions (with one exit) shall not be permitted.
   (N)   Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots of
appropriate depth, unless, in the opinion of the Planning and Zoning
Commission, prevented by unusual topography or other physical conditions.
   (O)   The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks, and lots with blocks, shall
be determined with due regard to:
      (1)   Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs
of the principal and all required accessory uses;
      (2)   Zoning requirements as to lot sizes and dimensions, and provisions
regulating off-street parking and loading spaces;
      (3)   Needs for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of
street traffic;
      (4)   Limitations and opportunities of topography; and
      (5)   Generally, blocks shall not exceed 1,320 feet nor be less than 300
feet high in length measured along the greatest dimension of the block.
   (P)   Residential blocks shall normally be of sufficient width for two tiers
of lots. Block lengths shall be determined by circulation and other needs.
Where residential blocks with lots deeper than 200 feet are proposed, a
reservation for a future street through the middle of the block,
longitudinally, may be required.
   (Q)   Pedestrian crosswalks, not less than ten feet wide, shall be required
where deemed essential to provide circulation or access to schools,
playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation and other community facilities.
   (R)   Bicycle and pedestrian paths shall be designed in accordance with the
Finnra Standards and laid out in accordance with the requirements of the City
Council, and shall be dedicated by easement.
   (S)   The number of intersecting streets along arterial and collector
streets shall be held to a minimum, and where practicable, blocks along the
trafficways shall not be less than 670 feet in length.
(Ord. 232, passed 11-1-2000)
§ 152.068 MINIMUM WIDTHS FOR STREETS AND ALLEY RIGHT-OF-WAY.
   (A)   For all public ways hereafter dedicated and accepted, the minimum
right-of-way widths for streets and thoroughfares shall be known in the
Comprehensive Plan and where not shown therein, the minimum right-of-way width
for streets, arterial highways or pedestrian ways included in any subdivision
shall not be less than the minimum dimensions for each classification as
follows:
Classification Desirable Acceptable
Classification                     Desirable      Acceptable
Principal arterial highway         150 feet       100 feet

Cul-de-sac                         60 feet radius 60 feet radius
 
   (B)   Where existing or anticipated traffic on principal and minor arterial
highways warrants greater widths of right-of-ways, these shall be required.
(Ord. 232, passed 11-1-2000)
§ 152.069 MINIMUM PAVEMENT WIDTHS AND SURFACE TYPES.
   The following requirements are applicable to all subdivisions within the
jurisdiction of the Planning and Zoning Commission.
   (A)   Pavement widths for arterial and collector streets will be designated
by the City Council. Where required to be provided as part of the subdivision,
the subdivider will be responsible for 37 feet. The difference, if any, between
the cost of the portion to be provided at the expense of the subdivider
including the cost of curb and gutter, if any, and that of the total width
designated by the City Council shall be borne by the city, the county or by the
state’s Department of Transportation where applicable, unless it is determined
by the Council that the greater width will benefit the subdivider in proportion
to its cost.
   (B)   Local streets and dead end streets shall have minimum widths of 37
feet. Where curb and gutter is required the total width, back-to-back of curb
shall be 37 feet. The pavement of a turning circle at the end of a dead end
street shall have a minimum paved outside diameter of 53 feet to back of curb.
   (C)   Alleys shall have minimum paved widths of 16 feet.
   (D)   Alleys, where permitted, will be constructed with a concrete pavement
of a minimum thickness of six inches or of asphaltic concrete of a minimum
thickness of four inches mat and ten inches base. This requirement may be
varied by the Council if, in their opinion, the requirement imposes too severe
a restriction when related to the projected use of the alley.
   (E)   The subdivider shall grade all streets from property line to property
line prior to installation of water and sewer facilities. Centerline street
grades are to be established by the subdivider subject to approval of the City
Engineer.
   (F)   The subdivider shall, after grading streets and after sanitary sewer,
storm sewer and watermains are in, construct a minimum of six-inch compacted
gravel street 37 feet in width. The grading and graveling of the street
includes installation of culverts necessary for over the ground drainage until
curb and gutter is installed.
   (G)   Streets shall be graded full width and fully constructed with a
concrete pavement of a minimum thickness of six inches or of asphaltic concrete
of a minimum thickness of four inches mat and ten inches base or of a
construction standard and material approved by the City Engineer, in writing.
If the classification of the street justifies the construction of a thicker
section, the additional cost thereof shall be borne by the city, the county or
the state’s Department of Transportation depending upon the agency having
jurisdiction.
   (H)   The subdivider shall within one year provide for the construction of
curb and gutter within the confines of the platted area; provided, however, the
Council may extend this period where unusual drainage problems exist and the
drainage cannot be installed prior to or with the curb and gutter construction,
as outlined in a subdivision agreement.
   (I)   The subdivider shall within two years provide for the construction of
the street surface within the confines of the platted area, provided, however,
the Council may extend this period, as outlined in the subdivision agreement.
(Ord. 232, passed 11-1-2000)
§ 152.070 STREET GRADE, CURVES AND SITE DISTANCES.
   The following requirements are applicable to all subdivisions within the
city.
   (A)   The grades of any street or alley shall not be less than 0.4%. Where
specifically approved by the City Engineer, alleys may be designed with a
twenty-five-one-hundredths grade when constructed with concrete pavement.
   (B)   The grades in all streets, arterial highways, collector streets, minor
streets and alleys in any subdivision shall not be greater than the maximum
grades for each classification as follows:
 
Principal arterial highway 6%
Minor arterial highway     6%
Collector street           6%
Local street               8%
Alley                      8%
Pedestrian way             20% (may be increased if steps of an acceptable
                           design are provided)
 
   (C)   All changes in street grade of 1% or more shall be connected by
vertical curves. The length of the vertical curve will be determined on the
basis of providing stop sign distances for each road classification where
design speed for arterial and collector streets is 40 mph and local streets is
25 mph. In no case shall the length required vertical curve be less than 15
times the algebraic difference in rate of grades for arterial and collector
streets or one-half of this minimum for all other streets.
   (D)   The radius of curvature on the center line of the street shall not be
less than that required to produce stop sign distance as defined in division
(C) of this section. In no case, however, shall the radius or curvature for
arterial and collector streets be less than 300 feet or for local streets,
service drives and alleys be less than 100 feet.
(Ord. 232, passed 11-1-2000)
§ 152.071 INTERSECTIONS.
   The following requirements are applicable to all subdivisions within the
city.
   (A)   At a street intersection, the street curb intersection shall be
rounded by a radius of at least 15 feet.
   (B)   Where, in the opinion of the Engineer, the center line profiles of
streets presented as part of the preliminary plat do not clearly indicate that
adequate intersection design will be accomplished, the Planning and Zoning
Commission may request an intersection detail at a scale not to exceed one inch
equals 20 feet, which detail will clearly represent the construction details
for the intersection.
   (C)   Intersections shall be designed so as to avoid abrupt changes in
longitudinal or transverse slope.
(Ord. 232, passed 11-1-2000)
§ 152.072 LOTS.
   The following requirements are applicable to all subdivisions within the
city.
   (A)   The size, shape and orientation of lots shall be appropriate for the
location of the proposed subdivision and for the type of development
contemplated. Lot dimensions shall conform to the requirements of the Zoning
Code.
   (B)   Excessive depth in relation to widths shall be avoided. A proportion
of not more than three to one normally shall be considered appropriate.
   (C)   Every lot shall abut on a street. Lots for residential purposes shall
meet the size requirements of the Zoning Code, and also the requirements
relative to building setback and side yard requirements.
   (D)   Residential lots fronting on arterial and collector streets should
have extra depths to permit deep setbacks for the buildings.
   (E)   Double frontage lots and reversed frontage lots shall not be platted
except as herein before permitted under §
152.067.
   (F)   Side lot lines shall be approximately at right angles to the right-of-
way line of the street on which the lot fronts.
   (G)   Narrow, triangular lots, unusual shapes, and lots not permitting at
least a 26-foot width house with side yards and driveway, rear yards and front
yards are prohibited. No plat will be accepted that contains lots undesirable
for building, property subject to recurrent flooding, property at grades
greater than 8% or other factors that may cause the properties to be marginal
in building operations and cause the property to be returned for property
taxes.
(Ord. 232, passed 11-1-2000)
§ 152.073 UTILITIES AND DRAINAGE.
   The following requirements are applicable to all subdivisions within the
city.
   (A)   Water lines. Where an approved public water supply is within
reasonable access to the subdivision as determined by the number of lots,
distance from and capacity of existing mains, water lines shall be placed
within the right-of-way of each street. Water lines shall have a minimum
diameter of six inches. Fire hydrants shall be installed at intervals of not
less than 400 feet. The minimum size water main shall be six inches in diameter
and all water mains shall be looped so that water is available from two
directions to any point. Water mains, fire hydrants, gate valves and
appurtenances shall be installed in accordance with acceptable engineering
practice. Each lot shall be provided with a connection to the watermain. In
general, in new residential areas, water main services with a shutoff shall be
installed to appropriate public recreational areas with the water main
construction.
   (B)   Sanitary sewers. Sanitary sewers shall be constructed in accordance
with a connection to a sanitary sewer. The city may accept an area for platting
where the service cannot be provided when the lots are of sufficient size and
soil is suitable for private systems in accordance with city and state Health
Department recommendations. No private disposal systems shall be interconnected
or run to a common private or public drain. The minimum size public sanitary
sewer shall be eight inches in diameter. In general in new residential areas
sanitary sewer services shall be installed to appropriate public recreational
areas with the sewer construction. Sewage lift stations will be constructed if
necessary to serve an area, provided a lift station will be constructed on an
assessment basis. The lift station cost beyond the area immediately assessable
will be held for future assessment to the future area to be served.
   (C)   Storm drainage. All necessary facilities including underground pipe,
manholes, inlets, catch basins and other appurtenances necessary to provide
adequate drainage for the property or to maintain any natural drainage course
shall be the responsibility of the developer. Open drainage ditches will not be
allowed unless specifically directed by the City Engineer. Platting of property
is prohibited unless it is possible to drain the property by gravity drainage
to the natural drainage course for the area. At a minimum no property plat will
be accepted unless street grades are at least five feet above lake elevation so
as to drain into the streets. The meeting of this requirement does not obligate
the Council to accept the plat if there are substantial obstructions to the
drainage of the property contained therein and the Council may require that the
subdivider install pumping facilities for storm drainage prior to plat
acceptance if the facilities are necessary. Storm drainage and retention ponds
shall be required and designed in accordance with state statutes.
   (D)   Extensions not in platted area. In some cases, the proposed area to be
platted will not be served at its borders by water mains or sanitary sewer. The
Council may require a petition for the creation of an assessment district to
extend the facilities to the platted area; or may require the subdivider to pay
the cost of the extension; or may accept the plat with a separate water or
sewer system; or may pay the cost thereof and hold the amount for future
assessment; or may refuse acceptance of the plat.
   (E)   Building permit. No building permit shall be issued in the platted
area until sewer and water mains are designed, approved and the contract for
installation awarded with a satisfactory completion date. No building shall be
occupied in the platted area until provided with sanitary sewer and water
service and until the street is graveled and the graveling accepted as adequate
by the City Engineer to serve the building. The occupancy of a building in
violation of this division shall not relieve the subdivider of any
responsibility for street improvement. The transfer of property in the plat
from the original subdivider to other parties shall not relieve the subdivider
of his or her responsibility for initial street work as defined herein.
   (F)   Design of improvements. The City Engineer will design only the
improvements to be installed by the city. A subdivider desiring to contract and
install their own improvements shall have plans and specifications prepared by
a state-registered engineer, which have been approved by the City Engineer and
state agencies before constructing begins. All street, sanitary sewer, storm
sewer and watermain improvements installed by the subdivider shall be inspected
by the City Engineer and the Engineer shall furnish a written statement to the
subdivider of city acceptance of the utility improvements or street as part of
the city system. Any corrections to the improvements found necessary by the
City Engineer shall be done by and at the expense of the subdivider before the
acceptance is made.
(Ord. 232, passed 11-1-2000)
§ 152.074 OTHER REQUIREMENTS.
   The following requirements are applicable to all subdivisions within the
jurisdiction of the city.
   (A)   Sidewalks. Sidewalks at least five feet wide, constructed of concrete
pavement with a minimum thickness of four inches shall be constructed on both
sides of every street where the average width of lots is less than 60 feet.
Sidewalks shall be constructed on one or both sides of collector and arterial
streets irrespective of the width of lots where, in the opinion of the Planning
and Zoning Commission, these are necessary to protect the safety of
pedestrians.
   (B)   Driveways. The subdivider shall install driveways, driveway approaches
and curb returns for each connection to the street.
   (C)   Screen planting. The installation of trees and shrubs to form a tight
screen effective at all times shall be required along the rear line of any lot
in the subdivision which backs onto an arterial or collector street.
   (D)   Street names. All streets are to be named. A proposed street which is
in alignment with and which joins an existing and named street shall be given
the name of the existing street. The name of a proposed street shall not
duplicate the name of an existing street to which it does not connect or with
which it is not in alignment.
   (E)   Street name signs. Reflectorized street name signs shall be provided
at all street intersections or where a change of direction of a street requires
a change of street name. The signs shall be of the size and type approved for
use by the city. Normally, one sign will be required at each residential
intersection; however, more may be required dependent upon the character and/or
width of the streets.
   (F)   Tree removal and conservation of vegetation.
      (1)   Existing and healthy trees and native vegetation shall be preserved
to the maximum extent feasible and shall be protected by adequate means during
construction.
      (2)   Unless already on site, at least one suitable tree shall be planted
in the front yard setback on every lot. The type or species of trees planted
shall be approved by the city.
      (3)   Consistent with approved grading plans; existing trees shall be

plat is executed by the city. The agreement shall be recorded by the subdivider
in the office of the County Recorder within 30 days of final approval.
(Ord. 232, passed 11-1-2000)
§ 152.076 EASEMENTS.
   (A)   (1)   An easement for utilities, at least six feet wide, shall be
provided along each side of a side line of lots and/or the rear line of lots
where necessary to form a continuous right-of-way, at least ten feet in width.
      (2)   The easements to be dedicated and provide for utility service from
street to street. The intent of the easements is to furnish utility service
from the rear of the lots to the buildings.
      (3)   If necessary for the extension of main water or sewer lines,
electrical transformer pads or similar utilities, easements of greater width
may be required along lot lines or across lots. Utility easements of at least
10% in width shall be provided along the front lines adjacent to street right-
of-way.
   (B)   Utility easements shall connect with easements established in
adjoining properties. These easements, when approved, shall not thereafter be
changed without the approval of the Council, by ordinance, upon the
recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Commission.
   (C)   Additional easements for pole guys should be provided at the outside
of turns. Where possible, lot lines shall be arranged to bisect the exterior
angle so that pole guys will fall along side lot lines.
   (D)   (1)   Where a subdivision is traversed by a water course, drainage
way, channel or stream, a storm water easement, drainage right-of-way or park
dedication, whichever the Planning and Zoning Commission may deem the most
adequate, conforming substantially with the lines of the water course shall be
provided, together with the further width or construction or both, as will be
adequate for the storm water drainage of the area.
      (2)   The width of the easements shall be determined by the Planning and
Zoning Commission.
(Ord. 232, passed 11-1-2000)
§ 152.077 PUBLIC UTILITIES.
   (A)   All new electric distribution lines (excluding main line feeders and
high voltage transmission lines), telephone service lines, cable television and
services constructed within the confines of and providing service to customers
in a newly platted residential area shall be buried underground; unless the
Council specifically shall find, after study and recommendation by the Planning
and Zoning Commission, that:
      (1)   The placing of utilities underground would not be compatible with
the development planned;
      (2)   The additional cost of burying the utilities would create an undue
financial hardship; or
      (3)   Topographical, soil or any other conditions make the underground
installation unreasonable or impractical.
   (B)   All utility lines for telephone and electrical service shall be placed
in rear line easements when carried on overhead poles. The Planning and Zoning
Commission may recommend, and the Council require, that the type of overhead
pole used, be of a quality and durability aesthetically in conformance with the
nature of the residential development.
   (C)   Where telephone, electric and/or gas service lines are to be placed
underground entirely, conduits or cables shall be placed within easements or
dedicated public ways in such a manner so as not to conflict with other
underground services.
   (D)   All drainage and other underground utility installations which
traverse privately owned property shall be protected by easements.
   (E)   The subdivider is responsible for complying with the requirements of
this section and shall submit to the Planning and Zoning Commission a written
record from the utilities showing that the necessary arrangements with the
utility involved for the installation of the facilities have been made.

   The general principles of design and minimum requirements for the layout of
subdivisions set forth in §§
152.060 through
152.077 may be varied by the Council in the case of a subdivision large enough
to constitute a more or less self-contained neighborhood which is to be
developed in accordance with a comprehensive plan safeguarded by appropriate
restrictions, and which, in the judgment of the Council, makes adequate
provision for all essential community requirements; provided, however, that no
modification shall be granted by the Council which would conflict with the
proposals of the official map or with the other features of the Comprehensive
Plan, is so adopted or with the intent and purposes of the general principles
of design and minimum requirements.

complete submission unless extended by the city pursuant to statute or a time
waiver is granted by the applicant.
      (2)   Filing of request. Request for site plan approval shall be filed
with the Zoning Administrator. An application shall be considered as being
officially submitted and complete when the applicant has complied with all
specified information requirements. In cases where an application is judged to
be incomplete, the Zoning Administrator or designee shall notify the applicant,
in writing, of what information must be provided for the application to be
deemed complete within 15 business days of the date of submission.
      (3)   Technical reports. The Zoning Administrator or designee shall

request.
      (4)   Additional information. City staff shall have the authority to
request additional information from the applicant concerning operational
factors or to retain expert assistance with the consent and at the expense of
the applicant concerning operations factors. Said information is to be declared
necessary to evaluate the request and/or to establish performance conditions in
relation to all pertinent sections the code. Failure on the part of the
applicant to supply all necessary supportive information may be grounds for
denial of the request.
      (5)   Meeting with Zoning Administrator and/ or staff. The applicant and/
or applicant representative(s) shall meet with the Zoning Administrator and/or
staff as requested by the Zoning Administrator or designee to present
information and answer questions concerning the proposed site plan.
      (6)   In considering applications for site plan approval under this
section, the Zoning Administrator, and, where applicable, the Design Review

         (a)   How the site plan relates to conditions both on and off the
site.
         (b)   Conformance with the Belle Plaine Comprehensive Plan.
         (c)   The impact of the site plan on the existing and anticipated

Zoning Commission shall review and make recommendation to the City Council who
may approve the site plan, deny the site plan, or approve the site plan with
specific reasonable conditions.
   (E)   Developer's/builder's agreement. Prior to issuing a building permit,
the Zoning Administrator may require the developer/builder to sign an agreement
with the city which assures that particular elements of the site plan approval
application, either proposed by the applicant or imposed by the City Council,
shall be carried out. The City Council may require the applicant to provide a
performance bond or irrevocable letter of credit to ensure that certain
improvements are implemented.
   (F)   Certification of taxes paid. Prior to approving an application for a
site plan review, the applicant shall provide evidence to the city that there
are no delinquent property taxes, special assessments, interest, or city
utility fees due upon the parcel of land to which the site plan review
application relates.
   (G)   Plan agreements. All site and construction plans officially submitted
to the city shall be treated as a formal agreement between the applicant and
the city. Once approved, no changes, modifications, or alterations shall be

(Ord. 366, passed 8-7-2024)
§ 153.16 NON-CONFORMING LOTS, USES AND STRUCTURES.
   (A)   Intent.
      (1)   As required by M.S. § 462.357, as it may be amended from time to
time, any nonconformity, including the lawful use or occupation of land or
premises existing at the time of the adoption of these zoning regulations, may
be continued, including through repair, replacement, restoration, maintenance
or improvement, but not including expansion, unless the non-conformity or
occupancy is discontinued for a period of more than one year, or any non-
conforming use is destroyed by fire or other peril to the extent of greater
than 50% of its market value, and no building permit has been applied for
within 180 days of when the property is damaged. In this case, the City Council
may impose reasonable conditions upon a building permit in order to mitigate
any newly created impact on adjacent property. A subsequent use or occupancy of
the land or premises shall be a conforming use or occupancy.
      (2)   Notwithstanding division (A)(1), the city may regulate the repair,
replacement, maintenance, improvement, or expansion of non- conforming uses and
structures in floodplain areas to the extent necessary to maintain eligibility
in the National Flood Insurance Program and not increase flood damage potential
or increase the degree of obstruction of flood flows in the floodway.
      (3)   Non-conforming shoreland lots of record are subject to the
provisions of M.S. § 462.357, as it may be amended from time to time.
      (4)   Lots, structures, and uses of land which were lawful when
established, but which would be prohibited under the terms of this chapter, or
future amendments shall be deemed legal non-conforming and regulated in
accordance with this section. It is the intent of this chapter to phase out
such non-conforming uses within a reasonable time period while retaining full
economic value. It is further the intent of this chapter that non-conformities
shall not be enlarged upon, expanded, or extended, and not be used as grounds
for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district,
except in compliance with provisions of this section.
      (5)   A non-conforming use of a structure, a non-conforming use of land
or a non-conforming use of a structure and land may only be extended or
expanded, including by expansion of a building or structure, attachment or
placement of additional signs or display devices to a building, or on the land
outside the building, upon issuance of an expansion permit. The additional uses
which would be prohibited generally in the district involved may not be allowed
by an expansion permit. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall
be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of
any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun and upon which
actual building construction has been diligently continued. Actual construction
is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent
position and fastened in a permanent manner, and demolition, elimination, and
removal of an existing structure in connection with such construction, provided
that actual construction work shall be diligently continued until the
completion of the building involved.
   (B)   Non-conformities. Any non-conformity, including the lawful use or
occupation of land or premises legally existing at the time of establishment
may be continued, including through repair, replacement, restoration,
maintenance, or improvement, but not including expansion, unless:
      (1)   The non-conformity or occupancy is discontinued for a period of
more than one year; or
      (2)   The non-conformity is destroyed by fire or other peril to the
extent of greater than 50% of its market value, and no building permit has been
applied for with 180 days of when the property is damaged. In this case, the
city may impose reasonable conditions upon a building permit to mitigate any
newly created impact on adjacent property. The city may impose upon non-
conformities reasonable regulations to prevent and abate nuisances and to
protect the public health, welfare, or safety. Any subsequent use or occupancy
of the land or premises shall be a conforming use or occupancy.
   (C)   Expansion permit, non-conforming use or structure. An expansion of a
non-conforming use may not be done without first obtaining a variance or an
expansion permit.
      (1)   A variance is required if the expansion will intrude into one or
more setback areas beyond the distance of the existing structure or will exceed
the height or size limitations in this section by a distance or amount greater
than the existing structure. Otherwise, an expansion permit is required. For
example, if the building currently has a front setback of 25 feet when 30 feet
is required, and the expansion would reduce the setback to 24 feet, then a
variance is required. In contrast, if only a portion of the building has a
front setback of 25 feet when 30 feet is required, and the expansion brings the
rest of the building to the same setback of 25 feet, then an expansion permit
is required rather than a variance.
      (2)   An expansion permit is also required if:
         (a)   The proposed expansion will occupy any space within a non-
conforming area that was previously not occupied both vertically and
horizontally. For example, an expansion permit would be required if a second-
floor area is expanded into the non-conforming setback over an existing non-
conforming first-floor even though the non-conformity of the first-floor
setback dimension stays the same or is reduced; or
         (b)   The non-conforming aspect of a use or structure is reduced but
still does not comply with current ordinance standards.
   (D)   Procedure.
      (1)   Application. Application for a non-conforming use or structure
expansion permit must be made to the Zoning Administrator. The application must
be on forms provided by the city and must be accompanied by the following:
         (a)   A survey of the property which shows, at a minimum, all lot
lines, existing and proposed structures, driveways, and parking areas,
significant topographical features, and mature trees:
         (b)   Evidence of ownership or an interest in the property;
         (c)   The fee set by the annual fee schedule; and
         (d)   Such other information as may be required by the city.
      (2)   Public hearing. Upon receipt of a completed application, a date
will be set for a public hearing before the Planning and Zoning Commission. The
variance procedures shall be followed as identified in §
153.21.
      (3)   Decisions.
         (a)   An expansion permit for a non-conforming use or structure may be
granted, but is not mandated, when the applicant meets the burden of proving
that the proposed expansion is a reasonable use of the property, considering
such things as:
            1.   Functional and aesthetic justifications for the expansion;
            2.   Adequacy of off-street parking for the expansion;
            3.   Absence of adverse off-site impacts such as traffic, noise,
dust, odors, and parking;
            4.   Improvement to the appearance and stability of the property
and neighborhood;
            5.   Will not endanger public safety;
            6.   Will not interfere with adopted city plans or regulations
requiring additional right-of-way width; and
            7.   Is not an expansion of a non-conformity previously allowed
through the non-conformance variance process.
         (b)   The City Council may impose conditions in granting an expansion
permit to affect the intent of this chapter and to protect adjacent properties.
The City Council must accompany its decision to approve or deny an expansion
permit with a statement of its findings and must serve a copy of its decision
upon the applicant.
      (4)   Term of expansion permit. An expansion permit granted by the city
will run with the land and will be perpetual unless no building permit has been
issued or substantial work performed within one year following the approval, in
which case the permit will be null and void. The City Council may extend the
period for construction upon finding that the interest of the owners of
neighboring properties will not be adversely affected by such extension. If the
expansion permit is part of an approved site and building plan, extension of
the time period for construction will be contingent upon similar extension of
the time period for the site and building plan by the Planning and Zoning
Commission. Once the project is completed as approved, the expansion permit
becomes perpetual.
      (5)   Specific period. An expansion permit is valid only for the project
for which it was granted. Construction of any project must be in substantial
compliance with the building plans and specifications reviewed and approved by
the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council.
   (E)   Recording. A certified copy of the approved expansion permit will be
filed with the Sibley County Recorder. The expansion permit must contain a full
legal description of the property affected.
   (F)   Violations. A person who violates, fails to comply with or assists,
directs, or permits the violation of the terms or conditions of an expansion
permit is guilty of a misdemeanor. A violation of the expansion permit renders
the permit null and void. A violation also constitutes a public nuisance that
may be abated in accordance with city code.
(Ord. 366, passed 8-7-2024)
§ 153.17 PUBLIC HEARINGS.
   (A)   Setting of hearings. For all requests brought before the Planning and
Zoning Commission for which a public hearing is required by this chapter, the
public hearing shall be held at a reasonable time as set by the city in the
City Council Chambers, or such other designated site.
   (B)   Notice of hearings.
      (1)   Notice of public hearings shall be given not more than 30 days and
not less than ten days before the hearing by publication at least once in the
official newspaper of the city. Such notice shall include the time and place of
the hearing, a description of the contents of the request to be heard and the
address or location of the property to which the request applies.
      (2)   In addition to the general notice to the public, separate notice by
letter shall be required for all property owners residing within an area
distance of 350 feet from the boundaries of the applicant's property. Such
notices shall be sent by the city and addresses taken from current Sibley
County Records shall be deemed sufficient for such notification.
      (3)   Failure of a property owner to receive said notice shall not
invalidate any such proceedings as set forth within this chapter.
   (C)   Conduct of hearing. Any person may appear and testify at a public
hearing, either in person or by a duly authorized agent or attorney, or by a
written, signed letter.
   (D)   Referral back to the Planning and Zoning Commission. If, upon
receiving facts and findings, and a recommendation of the Planning and Zoning
Commission, the City Council finds that specific inconsistencies exist in the
review process and thus the final recommendation of the City Council will
differ from that of the Planning and Zoning Commission, the City Council may
before taking final action, refer the matter back to the Planning and Zoning
Commission for further consideration. The City Council shall provide the
Planning and Zoning Commission with a written statement detailing the specific
reasons for referral.

§ 153.21 VARIANCES.
   (A)   General provisions.
      (1)   Board of Adjustments. The City Council shall be the Board of
Adjustments for the city, and as provided by M.S. § 462.354, Subd. 2, shall
have the powers granted under M.S. § 462.357, Subd. 6 as they may be amended
from time to time.
      (2)   Variances.
         (a)   Pursuant to M.S. § 462.357, Subd. 6, as it may be amended from
time to time, the City Council, acting as the Board of Adjustments, may issue
variances from the provisions of the zoning code. A variance is a modification
or variation of the provisions of this zoning code as applied to a specific
piece of property.
         (b)   Variances shall only be permitted:
            1.   When they are in harmony with the general purposes and intent
of the zoning code:
            2.   When the variance is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan:
            3.   When the applicant for the variance establishes that there are
practical difficulties in complying with the zoning code. Practical
difficulties, as used in connection with the granting of a variance, mean that:
               a.   The property owner proposes to use the property in a
reasonable manner not permitted by the zoning code;
               b.   The plight of the landowner is due to circumstances unique
to the property not created by the landowner;
               c.   The variance, if granted, will not alter the essential
character of the locality; and
               d.   Economic considerations alone do not constitute practical
difficulties. Practical difficulties include, but are not limited to,
inadequate access to direct sunlight for solar energy systems.
         (c)    Use variances prohibited. The City Council may not permit as a
variance any use that is not permitted under the zoning code for property in
the district where the affected person's land is located. The City Council may
permit as a variance the temporary use of a one family dwelling as a two-family
dwelling. The City Council may impose conditions in the granting of a variance
to ensure compliance and to protect adjacent properties. Conditions must be
directly related to and must bear a rough proportionality to the impact created
by the variance.
   (B)   Procedures.
      (1)   An application for a variance shall be filed with the Zoning
Administrator. A non- refundable application fee, established from time to time
by the City Council to cover the administrative costs and costs of the hearing,
shall accompany each application. The application shall contain the following
information, as well as such additional information as may be required by the
Zoning Administrator.
      (2)    The Zoning Administrator, upon receipt of a proper application for
a variance, shall set a time and place for a public hearing before the Planning
and
Zoning Commission. At least ten days in advance of any such hearing, notice of
the time, place and purpose of the hearing shall be published in the official
newspaper of the city.
      (3)   Written notices for the public hearing on a variance shall be sent
to all property owners or residents within 350 feet of the property. The public
hearing notice shall be given not more than 30 days nor less than ten days in
advance by publishing a notice in the official newspaper of the city. The
notice shall describe the particular variance and shall contain a description
thereof. Assessor tax records, warranty deed, and street addresses shall be
deemed sufficient for location or certification of ownership of the adjacent
properties. Failure of a property owner to receive the notice shall not
invalidate any such proceedings.
      (4)   For a variance in the Shoreland Overlay District, the Zoning
Administrator shall submit to the Commissioner of Natural Resources a copy of
the application for the proposed variance sufficiently in advance so that the
Commissioner will receive at least ten days notice of the hearing.
      (5)   For a variance adjacent to Minnesota Trunk Highways 5, 19, or 22,
or Sibley County right-of-way, the Zoning Administrator shall submit to the
appropriate office a copy of the application for the proposed variance located
in the highway right-of-way sufficiently in advance so that the Commissioner or
Sibley County Official will receive at least ten days notice of the hearing.
      (6)   The applicant or representative shall appear before the Planning
and Zoning Commission and City Council to answer questions concerning the
proposed variance.
      (7)   Within the time frame established by M.S. § 15.99, following
receipt of the completed application, the City Council shall render its
decision granting or denying the variance. Such decision shall be accompanied
by findings of fact and shall refer to any exhibits containing plans and
specifications for the proposed variance. Such plans and specifications shall
remain a part of the permanent records of the City Council. The findings of
fact shall specify the reason(s) for granting or denying the variance. The
terms of relief granted shall be specifically set forth in conclusion or
statement separate from the findings of fact.
      (8)   The City Council should not grant or deny a variance until they
receive a report and recommendation from the Planning and Zoning Commission.
      (9)   Whenever an application for a variance has been considered and
denied by the City Council, a similar application and proposal for the variance
affecting the same property shall not be considered again by the Planning and
Zoning Commission and City Council for at least six months from the date of its
denial, unless a decision to reconsider such matter is made by not less than
two-thirds vote of the full City Council.
   (C)   Lapse of variance. If within one year after granting a variance the
use, as allowed by the variance, has not been initiated or utilized, then such
a variance shall become null and void unless a petition for an extension of
time in which to complete or utilize the use has been granted by the City
Council. Such extension shall be requested in writing and filed with the Zoning
Administrator at least 30 days before the expiration of the original variance.
There shall be no charge for the filing of such petition. The request for
extension shall state facts showing a good faith attempt to complete the use
permitted in the variance. Such petition shall be presented to the Council for
decision.
   (D)   Fees. To defray administrative costs of processing requests for
variances, a fee shall be paid by the applicant. The fee shall be established
by the City Council annually.

§ 153.35 PD PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT.
   (A)   Purpose. This section is established to provide comprehensive
procedures and standards designed to allow greater flexibility in the
development of neighborhoods or areas by incorporating a mixture of densities/
intensities or use types when applied to a Planned Unit Development (PUD)
District. The PUD process, by allowing deviation from the strict provisions of
this chapter related to setbacks, height, lot area, width and depth, yards,
etc., and by mix of uses by PUD zoning, is intended to encourage:
      (1)   Innovations in development that address the growing demands for all
styles of economic expansion may be met by greater variety in type, design and
siting of structures and by the conservation and more efficient use of land in
such developments.
      (2)   Higher standards of site and building design through the use of
trained and experienced land planners, architects and landscape architects.
      (3)   More convenience in location and design of development of service
facilities.
      (4)   The preservation and enhancement of desirable site characteristics
such as natural topography and geologic features and the prevention of soil
erosion.
      (5)   A creative use of land and related physical development which
allows a phased and orderly transition of land from rural to urban uses.
      (6)   An efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities
and streets thereby lower development costs and public investments.
      (7)   A development pattern in harmony with the objectives of the
Comprehensive Plan. (PUD is not intended to vary applicable planning and zoning
principles).
      (8)   A more desirable and creative environment than might be possible
through the strict application on zoning and subdivision regulations of the
city.
      (9)   Clustered developments that respect the overall planned density for
the area and that minimize the impact of development of the environment and
significant natural features.
   (B)   General requirements and standards.
      (1)   Ownership. An application for PUD must be filed by the landowner or
jointly by all landowners of the property included in a project. The
application and all submissions must be directed to the development of the
property as a unified whole. In the case of multiple ownership, the approved
final plan shall be binding on all owners.
      (2)   Comprehensive plan consistency. The proposed PUD shall be
consistent with the City Comprehensive Plan.
      (3)   Standards for common open space. No open area may be accepted as
common open space under the provisions of this chapter unless it meets the
following standards:
         (a)   The location, shape, size and character of the common open space
must be suitable for the planned development.
         (b)   Common open space must be used for amenity or recreational
purposes. The uses authorized for the common open space must be appropriate to
the scale and character of the planned development, considering the size,
density, expected population, topography and the number and type of dwellings
to be provided.
         (c)   Common open space must be suitably improved for its intended
use, but common open space containing natural features worthy of preservation
may be left unimproved. The buildings, structures and improvements which are
permitted in the common open space must be appropriate to the uses which are
authorized for the common open space and must conserve and enhance the
amenities of the common open space having regard to its topography and
unimproved condition.
         (d)   Wetlands, flood plains and other such lands designated as
undevelopable shall not be considered as common open space.
      (4)   Conveyance and maintenance of common open space.
         (a)   All land shown on the final development plan as common open
space must be conveyed under one of the following methods at the discretion of
the city:
            1.    It may be conveyed to a public agency which will agree to
maintain the common open space and any buildings structures or improvements
which have been placed on it.
            2.   It may be conveyed to a corporation, developer, homeowner
association (incorporated or non-incorporated) or trustee provided in an
indenture establishing association or similar organization for the maintenance
of the planned development. The common open space must be conveyed to the party
involved subject to covenants approved by the City Council which restrict the
common open space to the uses specified on the final development plan, and
which provide for the maintenance of the common open space in a manner which
assures its continuing use for its intended space.
         (b)   If the common open space is conveyed to a private party and is
not maintained properly to standards established by the city, the city shall
have the authority to maintain the property and assess the costs incurred back
to the land benefitted by the improvement.
      (5)   Density. The maximum allowable density in a PUD Zoning District
shall be determined by standards negotiated and agreed upon between the
applicant and the city. In all cases the negotiated standards shall be

list with sizes and species indicated as part of the final plan. In assessing
the landscaping plan, the Council shall consider the natural features of the
particular site, the architectural characteristics of the proposed structures
and the overall scheme of the PUD plan.
      (9)   Urban/rural servicing requirements. All development will be
carefully phased so as to ensure that all developable land will be accorded a
present vested right to develop at such time as services and facilities are
available. Lands which have the necessary available municipal facilities and
services may be granted approval in accordance with existing city code
provisions and development techniques. Lands which lack the available public
facilities and services may be granted approval for development, provided that
all applicable provisions of this chapter, the city code, and state regulations
are complied with.

be damaged or destroyed by fire, it may be re-established if elsewhere
permitted in this chapter, except that in doing so, any off-street parking or
loading space which existed before shall be retained.
      (4)   Change of use or occupancy of land. No change of use or occupancy

space.
         (b)   In stadiums, sports arenas, churches, and other places of public
assembly in which patrons or spectators occupy benches, pews, or other similar
seating facilities, each 22 inches of such seating facilities shall be counted
as one seat for the purpose of determining requirements.
