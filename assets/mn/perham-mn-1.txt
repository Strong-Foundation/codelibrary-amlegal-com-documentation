§ 32.01 PURPOSE.
   Administrative offense procedures established pursuant to this chapter are
intended to provide the public and the City of Perham with an informal, cost
effective and expeditious alternative to traditional criminal charges for
violations of certain city code provisions. The procedures are intended to be
voluntary on the part of those who have been charged with administrative
offenses. At any time prior to the payment of the administrative penalty as is
provided for thereafter, the individual may withdraw from participation in the
procedures, in which event the city may bring criminal charges in accordance
with law. Likewise, the City of Perham in its discretion may choose not to
initiate an administrative offense and may bring criminal charges in the first
instance. In the event a party participates in the administrative offense
procedures but does not pay the monetary penalty before the ten day deadline,
the administrative offense agreement becomes null and void and the citation
will be forwarded to Otter Tail Court Administration to be processed through
the appropriate methods.
(Ord. 228, passed 9-8-03; Am. Ord. 430, passed 4-10-23)

city ordinances, shall upon determining that there has been a violation, notify
the violator, or in the case of a vehicular violation, attach to the vehicle a
notice of the violation. Said notice shall set forth the nature, date and time

   (A)   Once such notice is given, the alleged violator may, within ten days
of the time of issuance of the notice, pay the amount set forth on the schedule
of penalties for the violation or may request a hearing in writing, as is
provided hereafter. The penalty may be paid in person, or by mail, and payment
shall be deemed to be an admission of the violation.
   (B)   Payment of the administrative penalty shall not relieve the violator
of their obligations or prevent the city from taking such actions as may be
necessary to correct immediate threats to health and safety or abate nuisances.
Any such actions shall be taken in accordance with applicable ordinances and
statutes.
(Ord. 228, passed 9-8-03; Am. Ord. 430, passed 4-10-23)

to dismiss the violation or reduce or waive the penalty. If the violation is
sustained by the Hearing Officer, the violator shall pay the penalty imposed.

§ 32.06 HEARING OFFICER.
   A city employee designated in writing by the City Manager shall be the

controversy relating to administrative offenses provided for in this chapter.
(Ord. 228, passed 9-8-03; Am. Ord. 430, passed 4-10-23)
§ 32.07 FAILURE TO PAY.
   In the event a party charged with an administrative offense fails to pay the
penalty, a misdemeanor or petty misdemeanor charge may be brought against the
alleged violator in accordance with applicable statutes. If the penalty is paid
before the ten day deadline expires or if an individual is found not to have
committed the administrative offense by the Hearing Officer, no such charge may
be brought by the City of Perham for the same violation.
(Ord. 228, passed 9-8-03; Am. Ord. 430, passed 4-10-23)

§ 51.122 ESTABLISHMENT OF SEWER SERVICE CHARGE SYSTEM.
   (A)   The city establishes a sewer service charge system whereby all revenue
collected from users of the wastewater treatment facilities will be used to
affect all expenditures incurred for annual operation, maintenance, and
replacement and for debt service on capital expenditure incurred in
constructing the wastewater treatment works.
   (B)   Each user shall pay its proportionate share of operation, maintenance,
and replacement costs of the treatment works, based on the users proportionate
contribution to the total wastewater loading from all users.
   (C)   Each user shall pay debt service charges to retire local capital costs
as determined by the City Council.
   (D)   Sewer service rates and charges to users of the wastewater treatment
facility shall be determined and fixed in the sewer service charge system
developed according to the provisions of this subchapter. The sewer service
charge system developed with the assistance of the consulting engineer shall be
adopted by resolution upon enactment of this subchapter, shall be published in
the local newspaper, and shall be effective upon publication. Subsequent
changes in the sewer service rates and charges shall be adopted by Council
resolution and shall be published in the local newspaper.
   (E)   Revenues collected for sewer service shall be deposited in a separate
fund known as the Sewer Service Fund. Income from revenues collected will be
expended to offset the cost of operation, maintenance, and equipment
replacement for the facility and to retire the debt for capital expenditure.
   (F)   Sewer service charges and the Sewer Service Fund will be administrated
in accordance with the provisions of §
51.129.
(Ord. 150, passed 7-26-90)
§ 51.123 DETERMINATION OF SEWER SERVICE CHARGES.
   (A)   (1)   Users of the city wastewater treatment works shall be identified
as belonging to one of the following user classes:
         (a)   Residential;
         (b)   Commercial;
         (c)   Institutional/Governmental; or
         (d)   Industrial.
      (2)   The allocation of users to these categories for the purpose of
assessing user charges and debt service charges shall be the responsibility of
the City Manager. Allocation of users to user classes shall be based on the
substantive intent of the definitions of these classes contained herein.
   (B)   (1)   Each user shall pay operation, maintenance, and replacement
costs in proportion to the user’s proportionate contribution of wastewater
flows and loadings to the treatment plant, with the minimum rate for loadings
of BOD and TSS being the rate established for concentrations of 250 mg/l BOD
and 300 mg/l TSS (for example, normal domestic strength wastewater) as defined
in §
51.121.
      (2)   Those industrial users discharging segregated normal domestic
strength wastewater only can be classified as commercial users for the purpose
of rate determination.
(Ord. 150, passed 7-26-90)
§ 51.124 DETERMINATION OF UNIT COSTS.
   (A)   Annual base rate. The base rate shall include the following items:
      (1)   Determine the annual OM&R budget.
      (2)   Allocate total annual OM&R costs to flow, BOD, and TSS
proportionately, according to the costs of collection and treatment of flow,
BOD, and TSS.
      (3)   Proportion the flow costs between infiltration/inflow and billable
volume. OM&R costs for infiltration and inflow shall be divided equally among
all users of the system.
      (4)   The OM&R costs for administrative and billing shall be divided
equally among all users of the system.
      Where:         Br =   Base Rate recovery of costs from infiltration/
inflow and administrative services.
      (5)   The City Council may at their discretion add a sinking fund cost
for collection system replacement.
   (B)   Debt service charge. Debt retirement costs shall be allocated to all
users. Two options for the debt service charge are presented in Appendix B.
   (C)   Calculation of unit costs for treatment of flow, BOD, and TSS. For
purposes of determining the proportionate charges, unit costs for treatment of
flow, BOD, and TSS shall be determined and fixed annually in the sewer service
charge system according to the following procedure. Divide the OM&R costs
attributable to billable flow, BOD, and TSS respectively by the total annual
billable volume and loadings of flow, BOD, and TSS to arrive at unit costs.
      (1)   For purposes of determining charges, the following definitions of
unit costs shall apply:
         Uf      =      Unit cost for treatment of billable flow in $/CCF.
         Ubod      =       Unit cost for treatment of BOD in $/lb.
         Utss      =       Unit cost for treatment of TSS In $/lb.
         (CCF       =       100 cubic feet = 748 gallons.)
      (2)   Unit costs are provided in Appendix A of the sewer service charge
system developed with the assistance of the consulting engineer. Subsequent
calculations of unit costs shall be according to the substantive intent of this
SSCS.

§ 51.125 SEWER SERVICE CHARGE FOR NORMAL DOMESTIC STRENGTH USERS.
   (A)   Calculating billable flows and loading.
      (1)   Measurement of wastewater volume. The charges assessed residential
users and those users of other classes discharging normal domestic strength
wastewater shall be established proportionately according to billable
wastewater volume. Billable wastewater volume shall be calculated as follows:
         (a)   Residential users. Billable wastewater volume for residential
users shall be calculated on the basis of metered water usage. The wastewater
will be billed monthly based off of actual water usage for the months of
November through April. May through October the wastewater shall be calculated
by an average water usage from the prior November through April months. The
city may require residential users to install water meters for the purpose of
determining billable wastewater volume.
         (b)   Nonresidential users.  
            1.   The billable wastewater volume of nonresidential users may be
determined in the same manner as for residential users, except that if the city
determines that there are significant seasonal variations in the metered water
usage of nonresidential users resulting in a proportionate increase (or
decrease) in wastewater volume, then billable wastewater volume shall be:
               a.   Calculated on the basis of quarterly metered water usage as
recorded throughout the year, or
               b.   Calculated on the basis of wastewater flow meters.
            2.   The city may, at its discretion, require nonresidential users
to install such additional water meters or wastewater flow meters as may be
necessary to determine billable wastewater volume.
      (2)   Determination of loadings from metered water usage. The billable
amounts of BOD and TSS will be calculated from the volume of metered water
usage, as determined above, where the billable quantities will be those
attributable to wastewater at a concentration of 250 mg/l BOD and 300 mg/l TSS
(normal domestic strength wastewater).
   (B)   Determination of sewer service charges for normal domestic strength
users. User charges for normal domestic strength users shall be determined as
follows:
      (1)   Calculation of unit costs for treatment of normal domestic strength
wastewater:
            Un = Uf + [(Ubod)(1.560)] + [(Utss)(1.871)]
         Where:      Un      =      Unit cost of operation, maintenance, and
replacement to treat normal domestic strength, in $/CCf.
               Uf      =      Unit cost for treatment of billable flow in $/
CCF.
               Ubod       =      Unit cost for treatment of BOD in $/lb.
               Utss      =      Unit cost for treatment of TSS in $/lb.
               1.560      =      Lbs. of BOD in 1 CCF of normal domestic
strength wastewater.
               1.871      =      Lbs. of TSS in 1 CCF of normal domestic
strength wastewater.
      (2)   Calculation of sewer service charge for normal domestic strength
wastewater:
            SSC   =   Br + DSC + (Un x Bwv)
         Where:      SSC   =   Sewer service charge
               Br   =   Base rate
               DSC   =   Debt service charge
               Un   =   Unit cost for operation, maintenance, and replacement
to treat normal domestic strength, in $/CCF.
               Bwv   =   Billable wastewater volume of the particular user in
CCF.

GREATER THAN NORMAL DOMESTIC STRENGTH.
   (A)   Calculating billable flows and loadings.
      (1)   Calculation of billable flows. The billable amount of flow will be
calculated from the volume of metered water usage, or at the discretion of the
city, from the measurement of effluent flow at user’s point of discharge.
Measurements shall be according to a regular program prescribed by the city.
      (2)   Calculation of billable loadings.  
         (a)   The billable amounts of BOD and TSS will be calculated by the
measurement of these wastes according to a program prescribed by the city in
keeping with the latest edition of “Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater” and in accordance with this chapter.
         (b)   To insure compliance with §
51.122, the following procedures shall be followed in determining average
loadings per billing period for industrial users:
            1.   When a particular reading indicates concentrations greater
than or equal to normal domestic strength, the actual reading shall be entered
into the average for billing purposes.
            2.   When a particular reading indicates concentrations less than
normal domestic strength, normal domestic strength shall be entered into the
average for billing purposes.
   (B)   Determination of sewer service charge for greater than normal domestic
strength users.
      SSC   =   Br + DSC + [Un x Bwv] + [Ubod x k x Bwv(Cbod-Nbod)]
               + [Utss x k x Bwv(Ctss-Ntss)]
               SSC   =   Sewer service charge
               Br   =   Base rate
               DSC   =   Debt service charge
               Un   =   Unit cost for the treatment of normal domestic strength
wastewater.
               Bwv   =   Billable wastewater volume of the particular user, in
CCF.
               Ubod   =   Unit cost for treatment of BOD in $/lb.
               k   =   .00624 (conversion factor)
               Cbod   =   Users concentration of BOD, in mg/l.
               Nbod   =   250 mg/l [Concentration of BOD in normal domestic
strength wastes]
               Utss   =   Unit cost for treatment of TSS in $/lb.
               Ctss   =   User concentration of TSS, in mg/l.
               Ntss   =   300 mg/l [Concentration of TSS in normal domestic
strength wastes]
(Ord. 150, passed 7-26-90)

WATER REGULATIONS
§ 52.25 SUPPLY FROM ONE SERVICE.
   No more than one housing unit or building shall be supplied from one service
connection except by permission of the City Council. Each unit served shall
have a separate water meter.
Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 52.26 TAPPING OF MAINS RESTRICTED.
   No person, except persons authorized by the Public Works Supervisor shall
tap any distributing main or pipe of the water supply system or insert
stopcocks or ferrules therein.
Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 52.27 REPAIRS.
   (A)   Determination of need for repairs. Based on the information supplied
by the property owners or available to the city, the city will make a
determination whether a problem exists in the water main which is the city’s
responsibility. If the problem appears to exist in the service line for which
the city has no responsibility, the private owners will be responsible for
correction of the problem.
   (B)   Thawing of water services. The city will not attempt to thaw water
services on request of the resident. If the problem is found within the service
line for which the private owner is responsible, the private owner will be
responsible for thawing the service and correction of the problem.
   (C)   Excavation or repair of water service.
      (1)   The city will arrange for the investigative digging up and repair
of any water service where the problem apparently exists within the public
right-of-way.
      (2)   Unless it is clearly evident, however, that the problem is the
responsibility of the city, the excavation and repair will not be made until
the property owner requests the city in writing to excavate or repair the
service and agrees to pay the cost.
      (3)   The owner further agrees to waive public hearing and be special
assessed the cost of the excavation and repair if the problem is found to be
other than the city’s responsibility. The city will make the determination for
responsibility of the cost of investigation or repair.
      (4)   The matter of whether the dig up is done by city forces or
contracted would depend on the urgency or need of repair and the availability
of city forces to do the work. Recovery by the city for faulty construction
will depend upon the circumstances and the decision of the City Attorney on the
likelihood of recovery.
   (D)   Failure to repair. In case of failure upon the part of any consumer or
owner to repair any leak occurring in his or her service pipe within 24 hours
after verbal or written notice thereof, the water may be turned off by the city
and shall not be turned on until the leak has been repaired and a fee pursuant
to §
52.51 has been paid to the city.
Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 52.28 ABANDONED OR UNUSED SERVICES.
   (A)   If the premises served by water have been abandoned, or if the service
has not been used for one year, then the service shall be shut off at the curb
stop box by the city and the water meter will be removed.
   (B)   When new buildings are erected on the site of old ones, and it is
desired to increase or change the old water service, no connections with the
mains shall be made until all the old service has been removed and the main
taps plugged or yoked connections installed by the city at the owner’s expense.
Penalty, see § 10.99

§ 53.01 ESTABLISHMENT.
   Pursuant to M.S. § 444.075, the City establishes a Storm Drainage Utility
and authorizes the imposition of just and reasonable charges for the use and
availability of storm drainage facilities. The Storm Drainage Utility
operations shall be a part of the Public Works Department and under the
administration of the City Manager.
(Ord. 261, passed 12-10-07)
§ 53.02 FINDING AND DETERMINATION.
   (A)   In the exercise of its governmental authority and in order to promote
the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare, the City has
constructed, operated and maintained a storm drainage system. This chapter is
adopted in the further exercise of such authority and for the same purposes.
   (B)   The system, as constructed heretofore, has been financed and paid for
through the imposition of special assessments and ad valorem taxes. It is now
necessary and desirable to provide an alternative method of recovering some or
all of the future costs of improving, establishing, enlarging, replacing,
repairing maintaining and operating the system through the imposition of
charges as provided in this chapter.
   (C)   In imposing charges, it is necessary to establish a methodology that
undertakes to make them just and equitable. Taking into account the status of
completion of the system, past methods of recovering system costs, the
topography of the City and other relevant factors, it is determined that it
would be just and equitable to assign responsibility for some or all of the
future costs of improving, establishing, enlarging, replacing, repairing,
maintaining and operating the system on the basis of the expected storm water
runoff from the various parcels of land within the City during a standard
rainfall event.
(Ord. 261, passed 12-10-07)
§ 53.03 STORM DRAINAGE UTILITY FUND.
   There is hereby created a Storm Drainage Utility Fund into which all
charges, when collected, and all monies received from the sale of any
facilities or equipment or any by-products shall be placed. Such monies shall
be used first to pay normal, reasonable and current costs of operating and
maintaining the facilities.
(Ord. 261, passed 12-10-07)
§ 53.04 RESIDENTIAL EQUIVALENT FACTOR (REF) DEFINED.
   For the purpose of this chapter, one residential equivalent factor (REF) is
defined as the ratio of the average volume of surface water runoff generated by
one acre of a given land use to the average volume of runoff generated by one
acre of typical single family residential land, during a standard one-year
rainfall event.
(Ord. 261, passed 12-10-07)
§ 53.05 STORM WATER DRAINAGE CHARGES.
   In determining charges, the City Council shall, by resolution, establish a
basic system rate to be charged monthly against one standardized drainage unit
having an REF of one. The charge to be made against each parcel of land shall
then be determined by multiplying the REF for the parcel's land use
classification times the parcel's drainage unit times the basic system rate.
The REF values for various land uses are as follows:
 
Classification Land Use           REF
1.             Small Residential  1.00
2.             Medium Residential 2.00
3.             Small Commercial   3.00
 
 
Classification Land Use                                              REF
4.             Medium Commercial, Multiple Residential Institutions, 4.00
               Churches, and the like
5.             Large Commercial, Industrial                          5.00
6.             Major Industrial                                      10.00
 
(Ord. 261, passed 12-10-07)
§ 53.06 STANDARDIZED DRAINAGE UNITS.
   (A)   Classification 1. For the purpose of calculating storm water drainage
charges, all Classification 1 land use parcels shall be considered to have one
drainage unit per residence (maximum parcel size=1/2 acre).
   (B)   Classification 2. For the purpose of calculating storm water drainage
charges, all Classification 2 land use parcels shall be considered to have one
drainage unit per residence (parcel size between 1/2 and one acre).
   (C)   Classification 3. For the purpose of calculating storm water drainage
charges, all Classification 3 land use parcels shall be considered to have one
drainage unit per business (maximum parcel size=1/2 acre).
   (D)   Classification 4. For the purpose of calculating storm water drainage
charges, all Classification 4 land use parcels shall be considered to have one
drainage unit per business or apartment building (parcel size between 1/2 and
one acre).
   (E)   Classification 5. For the purpose of calculating storm water drainage
charges, all Classification 5 land use parcels shall be considered to have one
drainage unit per parcel (parcel size greater than one acre).
   (F)   Classification 6. For the purpose of calculating storm water drainage
charges, all Classification 6 land use parcels shall be considered to have one
drainage unit for each major industrial facility.
(Ord. 261, passed 12-10-07)
§ 53.07 OTHER LAND USES.
   Other land uses not listed in the foregoing table shall be classified by the
City Manager by assigning them to classes most nearly like the listed uses,
from the standpoint of runoff volume for the standard rainfall event. An appeal
of such classifications from the determination of the City Manager may be made
to the City Council.
(Ord. 261, passed 12-10-07)
§ 53.08 ADJUSTMENT OF CHARGES.
   The City Council may, by resolution, adopt policies providing for the
adjustment of charges for parcels based upon land use data supplied by affected
property owners which demonstrates a runoff volume for a standard rainfall
event substantially different from the REF being used for such parcels. Such
adjustments for storm water drainage charges shall not be made retroactively.
(Ord. 261, passed 12-10-07)
§ 53.09 EXEMPTIONS.
   Public street rights-of-way, cemeteries, parks, and vacant unimproved land
with ground cover are exempt from storm water drainage charges.
(Ord. 261, passed 12-10-07)
§ 53.10 PAYMENT OF CHARGES.
   Statements for storm water drainage charges shall be made a part of the
present utility billing system invoiced through the City Manager's Office on a
monthly basis. All charges shall be subject to established procedures for
determining and collecting customer charges.
(Ord. 261, passed 12-10-07)
§ 53.11 LATE PAYMENT PENALTY.
   Each billing for storm water drainage charges which are not paid when due

as work could not be done because of circumstances beyond the control of the
permittee or when work was prohibited as unseasonal or unreasonable under §
90.52.
   (B)   Patch and restoration. The permittee shall patch its own work. The
city may choose either to have the permittee restore the right-of-way or to
restore the right-of-way itself.
      (1)   City restoration. If the city restores the right-of-way, the
permittee shall pay the costs thereof within 30 days of billing. If following

days during which work cannot be done because of circumstances constituting

under § 90.52.
   (E)   Failure to restore. If the permittee fails to restore the right-of-way
in the manner and to the condition required by the Public Works Supervisor, or
fails to satisfactorily and timely complete all restoration required by the
Public Works Supervisor, the Public Works Supervisor at its option may do the
work. In that event the permittee shall pay to the city, within 30 days of
billing, the cost of restoring the right-of-way. If the permittee fails to pay
as required, the city may exercise its right under the construction performance
bond.
   (F)   Degradation fee in lieu of restoration. In lieu of right-of-way
restoration, a right-of-way user may elect to pay a degradation fee as
established from time to time by Council resolution, as it may be amended from

patching and the degradation fee shall not include the cost to accomplish these
responsibilities.
§ 90.45 SUPPLEMENTARY APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   Limitation on area. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the area
of the right-of-way specified in the permit. No permittee may do any work

permit must be obstructed or excavated must before working in that greater area
make application for a permit extension and pay any additional fees required
thereby, and be granted a new permit or permit extension.
   (B)   Limitation on dates. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the dates
specified in the permit. No permittee may begin its work before the permit
start date or, except as provided herein, continue working after the end date.
If a permittee does not finish the work by the permit end date, it must apply
for a new permit for the additional time it needs, and receive the new permit
or an extension of the old permit before working after the end date of the
previous permit. This supplementary application must be submitted before the
permit end date.
§ 90.46 DENIAL OF PERMIT.
   The city may deny a permit for failure to meet the requirements and

necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare or when necessary to
protect the right-of-way and its current use.

the immediate cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the life,
health, safety or well-being of the public.
      (2)   The Public Works Supervisor may issue an order to the permittee for
any work which does not conform to the terms of the permit or other applicable
standards, conditions, or codes. The order shall state that failure to correct
the violation will be cause for revocation of the permit. Within ten days after
issuance of the order, the permittee shall present proof to the Public Works
Supervisor that the violation has been corrected. If proof has not been
presented within the required time, the Public Works Supervisor may revoke the
permit pursuant to §
90.58.
§ 90.49 WORK DONE WITHOUT A PERMIT.
   (A)   Emergency situations.
      (1)   Each person with facilities in the right-of-way shall immediately
notify the city of any event regarding its facilities which it considers to be
an emergency. The owner of the facilities may proceed to take whatever actions
are necessary to respond to the emergency. Within two business days after the
occurrence of the emergency, the owner shall apply for the necessary permits,
pay the fees associated therewith and fulfill the rest of the requirements
necessary to bring itself into compliance with this chapter for the actions it
took in response to the emergency.
      (2)   If the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding facilities, the
city will attempt to contact the local representative of each facility owner
affected, or potentially affected, by the emergency. In any event, the city may
take whatever action it deems necessary to respond to the emergency, the cost
of which shall be borne by the person whose facilities occasioned the
emergency.
   (B)   Non-emergency situations. Except in an emergency, any person who,
without first having obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or excavates a
right-of-way must subsequently obtain a permit, and as a penalty pay double the
normal fee for the permit, pay double all the other fees required by this code,
deposit with the city the fees to correct any damage to the right-of-way and
comply with all of the requirements of this chapter.
§ 90.50 SUPPLEMENTARY NOTIFICATION.
   If the obstruction or excavation of the right-of-way begins later or ends
sooner than the date given on the permit, the permittee shall notify the Public
Works Supervisor of the accurate information as soon as this information is

§ 90.51 REVOCATION OF PERMITS.
   (A)   Substantial breach. The city reserves its right, as provided herein,
to revoke any right-of-way permit, without a fee refund if there is a
substantial breach of the terms and conditions of any statute, ordinance, rule
or regulation, or any material condition of the permit. A substantial breach by
the permittee shall include, but shall not be limited to the following;
      (1)   The violation of any material provision of the right-of-way permit;
      (2)   An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the right-
of-way permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit
upon the city or its citizens;
      (3)   Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a
right-of-way permit;
      (4)   The failure to complete the work in a timely manner; unless a
permit extension is obtained or unless the failure to complete work is due to
reasons beyond the permittees control; or
      (5)   The failure to correct, in a timely manner, work that does not
conform to a condition indicated on an order issued pursuant to §
90.55.
   (B)   Written notice of breach. If the city determines that the permittee
has committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any statute,
ordinance, rule, regulation or any condition of the permit the city shall make
a written demand upon the permittee to remedy that violation. The demand shall
state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. A
substantial breach, as stated above, will allow the city, at its discretion, to
place additional or revised conditions on the permit to mitigate and remedy the
breach.
   (C)   Response to notice of breach. Within 24 hours of receiving
notification of the breach, the permittee shall provide the city with a plan,
acceptable to the city, that will cure the breach. The permittee’s failure to
so contact the city, or the permittee’s failure to submit an acceptable plan,
or the permittee’s failure to reasonable implement the approved plan, shall be
cause for immediate revocation of the permit.
   (D)   Reimbursement of city cost. If a permit is revoked, the permittee
shall also reimburse the city for the city’s reasonable costs, including

applicable laws, and with Minn. Rules parts 7819.3100, 7819.5000 and 7819.5100,
as they may be amended from time to time, to the extent the rules do not limit

way, or any particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of
facilities that is or, pursuant to current technology, the city expects will
someday be located within the right-of-way. All excavation, obstruction, or
other permits issued by the city involving the installation or replacement of
facilities shall designate the proper corridor for the facilities at issue.
   (C)   Limitation of space. To protect the health, safety, and welfare or
when necessary to protect the right-of-way and its current use, the Public
Works Supervisor shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new
or additional facilities within the right-of-way. In making those decisions,
the Public Works Supervisor shall strive to the extent possible to accommodate
all existing and potential users of the right-of-way, but shall be guided
primarily by considerations of the public interest, the public’s needs for the
particular utility service, the condition of the right-of-way, the time of year
with respect to essential utilities, the protection of existing facilities in
the right-of-way, the future city plans for public improvements and development
projects which have been determined to be in the public interest.
§ 90.54 DAMAGE TO OTHER FACILITIES.

to that registrant and must be paid within 30 days from the date of billing.
Each facility owner shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any
facilities in the right-of-way which it or its facilities damages. Each
facility owner shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any damage to the
facilities of another registrant caused during the city’s response to an
emergency occasioned by the owner’s facilities.
§ 90.55 RIGHT-OF-WAY VACATION.
   If the city vacates a right-of-way which contains the facilities of a

nuisance and proceed to abate the nuisance as provided for in §§
92.15 through

an order from a court of competent jurisdiction authorizing the removal and
impoundment of the vehicle and, after the order has been granted, the city may

§ 91.05 SALE; WAITING PERIODS.
   (A)   Sale after 15 days. An impounded vehicle is eligible for disposal or
sale under §
91.09, 15 days after notice to the owner, if the vehicle is determined to be:

registration plate and still be eligible for disposal or sale under this
subdivision; or
      (2)   An abandoned vehicle.
   (B)   Sale after 45 days. An impounded vehicle is eligible for disposal or
sale under §
91.09, 45 days after notice to the owner, if the vehicle is determined to be an
unauthorized vehicle.
§ 91.06 NOTICE OF TAKING AND SALE.
   (A)   Contents; notice given within five days. When an impounded vehicle is
taken into custody, the city or impound lot operator taking it into custody
shall give notice of the taking within five days. The notice shall:

and serial number of the impounded motor vehicle if the information can be
reasonably obtained; and the place where the vehicle is being held;
      (2)   Inform the owner and any lienholders of their right to reclaim the
vehicle under §
91.07; and
      (3)   State that failure of the owner or lienholders to exercise their
right to reclaim the vehicle and contents within the appropriate time allowed
under §
91.05 shall be deemed a waiver by them of all right, title and interest in the
vehicle and contents and a consent to the transfer of title to and disposal or
sale of the vehicle and contents pursuant to §
91.09.
   (B)   Notice by mail or publication. The notice shall be sent by mail to the

a newspaper of general circulation in the area where the motor vehicle was
towed from or abandoned. Published notices may be grouped together for
convenience and economy.
   (C)   Unauthorized vehicles; notice. If an unauthorized vehicle remains
unclaimed after 30 days from the date the notice was sent under division (B) of

applicable under §
91.05, after the date of the notice required by §
91.06.

storage facility, or an operator of an establishment for the servicing, repair

      (1)   If an abandoned or unauthorized vehicle and contents taken into

to §§
91.06 and
91.07.
      (2)   The purchaser shall be given a receipt in a form prescribed by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles which shall be sufficient title to dispose of the
vehicle. The receipt shall also entitle the purchaser to register the vehicle
and receive a certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and claims of
ownership. Before a vehicle is issued a new certificate of title, it must
receive a motor vehicle safety check.
   (B)   Unsold vehicles. Abandoned or junk vehicles not sold by the city or
public impound lots pursuant to division (A) of this section shall be disposed
of in accordance with §

section by the city or public impound lot of an abandoned or unauthorized motor
vehicle, the city shall reimburse itself for the cost of towing, preserving and
storing the vehicle, and all administrative, notice and publication costs
incurred in handling the vehicle pursuant to this chapter. Any remainder from
the proceeds of a sale shall be held for the owner of the vehicle or entitled
lienholder for 90 days and then shall be deposited in the treasury of the city.
   (D)   Sale proceeds; nonpublic impound lots. The operator of a nonpublic
impound lot may retain any proceeds derived from a sale conducted under the
authority of division (A) of this section. The operator may retain all proceeds
from sale of any personal belongings and contents in the vehicle that were not
claimed by the owner or the owner’s agent before the sale, except that any
suspected contraband or other items that likely would be subject to forfeiture
in a criminal trial must be turned over to the appropriate law enforcement
agency.
§ 91.10 DISPOSAL AUTHORITY.
   The city may contract with others or may utilize its own equipment and
personnel for the inventory of impounded motor vehicles and abandoned scrap
metal and may utilize its own equipment and personnel for the collection,
storage and transportation of these vehicles and abandoned scrap metal. The
city may utilize its own equipment and personnel only for the collection and
storage of not more than five abandoned or unauthorized vehicles without
advertising for or receiving bids in any 120-day period.
§ 91.11 CONTRACTS; REIMBURSEMENT BY MPCA.
   (A)   MPCA review and approval. If the city proposes to enter into a
contract with a person licensed by the MPCA pursuant to this section or a
contract pursuant to §
91.10, the MPCA may review the proposed contract before it is entered into by
the city, to determine whether it conforms to the MPCA’s plan for solid waste
management and is in compliance with MPCA rules. A contract that does so
conform may be approved by the MPCA and entered into by the city. Where a
contract has been approved, the MPCA may reimburse the city for the costs
incurred under the contract that have not been reimbursed under §
91.09. Except as otherwise provided in §
91.10, the MPCA shall not approve any contract that has been entered into
without prior notice to and request for bids from all persons duly licensed by
the MPCA to be a party to a disposal contract pursuant to M.S. § 116.07, as it
may be amended from time to time; does not provide for a full performance bond;
or does not provide for total collection and transportation of abandoned motor
vehicles, except that the MPCA may approve a contract covering solely
collection or transportation of abandoned motor vehicles where the MPCA
determines total collection and transportation to be impracticable and where
all other requirements herein have been met and the unit of government, after
proper notice and request for bids, has not received any bid for total
collection and transportation of abandoned motor vehicles.
   (B)    The city may perform work. If the city utilizes its own equipment and
personnel pursuant to its authority under §
91.10, and the use of the equipment and personnel conforms to the MPCA’s plan
for solid waste management and is in compliance with MPCA rules, the city may
be reimbursed by the MPCA for reasonable costs incurred which are not
reimbursed under §
91.09.
   (C)   The city required to contract work. The MPCA may demand that the city
contract for the disposal of abandoned motor vehicles and other scrap metal
pursuant to the MPCA’s plan for solid waste disposal. If the city fails to
contract within 180 days of the demand, the MPCA, through the Department of
Administration and on behalf of the city, may contract with any person duly
licensed by the MPCA for the disposal.

§ 92.19 DUTIES OF CITY OFFICERS.
   The Police Department shall enforce the provisions relating to nuisances.
Any peace officer shall have the power to inspect private premises and take all
reasonable precautions to prevent the commission and maintenance of public
nuisances.
§ 92.20 ABATEMENT.
   (A)   Notice. Written notice of violation; notice of the time, date, place,
and subject of any hearing before the City Council; notice of City Council
order; and notice of motion for summary enforcement hearing shall be given as
set forth in this section.
      (1)   Notice of violation. Written notice of violation shall be served by
a peace officer on the owner of record or occupant of the premises either in
person or by certified or registered mail. If the premises is not occupied, the
owner of record is unknown, or the owner of record or occupant refuses to
accept notice of violation, notice of violation shall be served by posting it
on the premises.
      (2)   Notice of City Council hearing. Written notice of any City Council
hearing to determine or abate a nuisance shall be served on the owner of record
and occupant of the premises either in person or by certified or registered
mail. If the premises is not occupied, the owner of record is unknown, or the
owner of record or occupant refuses to accept notice of the City Council
hearing, notice of City Council hearing shall be served by posting it on the
premises.
      (3)   Notice of City Council order. Except for those cases determined by
the city to require summary enforcement, written notice of any City Council
order shall be made as provided in M.S. § 463.17 (Hazardous and Substandard
Building Act), as it may be amended from time to time.
      (4)   Notice of motion for summary enforcement. Written notice of any
motion for summary enforcement shall be made as provided for in M.S. § 463.17
(Hazardous and Substandard Building Act), as it may be amended from time to

is being maintained or exists on the premises in the city, the officer shall
notify in writing the owner of record or occupant of the premises of such fact
and order that the nuisance be terminated or abated. The notice of violation
shall specify the steps to be taken to abate the nuisance and the time within
which the nuisance is to be abated. If the notice of violation is not complied
with within the time specified, the officer shall report that fact forthwith to
the City Council. Thereafter, the City Council may, after notice to the owner
or occupant and an opportunity to be heard, determine that the condition
identified in the notice of violation is a nuisance and further order that if
the nuisance is not abated within the time prescribed by the City Council, the
city may seek injunctive relief by serving a copy of the City Council order and
notice of motion for summary enforcement.
   (C)   Emergency procedure; summary enforcement. In cases of emergency, where
delay in abatement required to complete the notice and procedure requirements
set forth in divisions (A) and (B) of this section will permit a continuing
nuisance to unreasonably endanger public health safety or welfare, the City
Council may order summary enforcement and abate the nuisance. To proceed with
summary enforcement, the officer shall determine that a public nuisance exists
or is being maintained on premises in the city and that delay in abatement of
the nuisance will unreasonably endanger public health, safety, or welfare. The
officer shall notify in writing the occupant or owner of the premises of the
nature of the nuisance and of the city’s intention to seek summary enforcement
and the time and place of the City Council meeting to consider the question of
summary enforcement. The City Council shall determine whether or not the
condition identified in the notice to the owner or occupant is a nuisance,
whether public health, safety, or welfare will be unreasonably endangered by
delay in abatement required to complete the procedure set forth in division (A)
of this section, and may order that the nuisance be immediately terminated or
abated. If the nuisance is not immediately terminated or abated, the City
Council may order summary enforcement and abate the nuisance.

Department that if the dog or other animal is not claimed within the time
specified in §
93.80, it will be sold or otherwise disposed of. Except as otherwise provided
in this chapter, it shall be unlawful to kill, destroy, or otherwise cause
injury to any animal, including dogs and cats running at large.
   (B)   Biting animals. Any animal that has not been inoculated by a live
modified rabies vaccine and which has bitten any person wherein the skin has
been punctured or the services of a doctor are required shall be confined in a
pound designated by the city for a period of not less than ten days at the
expense of the owner. The animal may be released at the end of such time if
healthy and free from symptoms of rabies and by the payment of all costs by the
owner. However, if the owner of the animal shall elect immediately upon receipt
of notice of need for such confinement by the officer to voluntarily and
immediately confine the animal for the required period of time in a veterinary
hospital of the owner’s choosing not outside of Otter Tail County and provide
immediate proof of such confinement in such manner as may be required, the
owner may do so. If, however, the animal has been inoculated with a live
modified rabies vaccine and the owner has proof of the vaccination by a
certificate from a licensed veterinarian, the owner may confine the dog or
other animal to the owner’s property.

Ch. 114
TOBACCO IN CITY PARKS
§ 97.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   The city is committed to providing safe and healthy environments.
Tobacco use is a major cause of preventable disease and death. Smoking, tobacco
use, and exposure to second-hand smoke have been found to cause heart disease,
cancer, asthma, bronchitis, and other respiratory problems. Electronic delivery
devices, more commonly referred to as electronic cigarettes or e-cigarettes,
closely resemble and purposefully mimic the act of smoking. They produce a
vapor of undetermined and potentially harmful substances and typically contain
nicotine derived from tobacco, which is a highly addictive substance. Their use
in locations where smoking is prohibited creates concern and confusion.
   (B)   The city believes the use of tobacco products, including electronic
delivery devices, in its parks is detrimental to the health and safety of its
community.
(Ord. 376, passed 11-9-15)
§ 97.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless context indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ELECTRONIC DELIVERY DEVICE. Any product containing or delivering nicotine,
lobelia, or any other substance intended for human consumption that can be used
by a person to simulate smoking in the delivery of nicotine or any other
substance through inhalation of vapor from the product. The term includes any
such devices, whether they are manufactured, distributed, marketed or sold as
e-cigarettes, e-cigars, e-pipes, or under any other product name or descriptor.
   PARK PROPERTY. All facilities, parks, trails, open space, and other property
owned, leased, rented, contracted, used, or controlled by the city for parks
and recreational purposes, with the exception of properties whereby the city
leases such property to other private or nonprofit organizations.
   SMOKING. Inhaling or exhaling from any lighted or heated cigar, cigarette,
pipe, or any other tobacco or plant product, or inhaling or exhaling aerosol or
vapor from any electronic delivery device. SMOKING shall include being in
possession a lighted or heated cigar, cigarette, pipe, or any other lighted or
heated tobacco or plant product intended for inhalation, or an electronic
delivery device that is turned on or is otherwise activated.
   TOBACCO PRODUCT(S). Any product containing, made, derived from tobacco that
is intended for human consumption, whether chewed, smoked, absorbed, dissolved,
inhaled, snorted, sniffed, or ingested by any other means, or any component,
part, or accessory of a tobacco product, including but not limited to
cigarettes, cigars and other smoking tobacco; snuff and other chewing tobaccos;
and any other kinds and forms of tobacco.
(Ord. 376, passed 11-9-15)
§ 97.03 PROHIBITION.
   The sale and use of tobacco products and electronic delivery devices is
prohibited at all times in or on all park property the city has the authority
to control regardless of location.
(Ord. 376, passed 11-9-15)
§ 97.04 APPLICABILITY.
   This policy applies to all visitors and users on park property, at all
times. Organizers and attendees at public or private events on park property
are required to abide by this policy. Event organizers are also responsible for
communicating and enforcing this policy.
(Ord. 376, passed 11-9-15)
§ 97.05 EXCEPTIONS.
   (A)   It is not a violation of this policy to use a product that has been
approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for sale as a
tobacco cessation product, as a tobacco dependence product, or for other
medical purposes, and is being marketed and sold solely for such an approved
purpose.
   (B)   It is not a violation of this policy for a Native American to use
tobacco on park property as part of a traditional Native American spiritual or
cultural ceremony. Approval from City Council must be requested and received
prior to the ceremony.
(Ord. 376, passed 11-9-15)
ELECTRONIC DELIVERY DEVICES
§ 97.20 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   Unregulated electronic delivery devices, commonly referred to as electronic
cigarettes, or e-cigarettes, closely resemble and purposefully mimic the act of
smoking by having users inhale vaporized liquid nicotine or other substances
created by heat through an electronic ignition system. E-cigarettes produce a
vapor of undetermined and potentially harmful substances, which may appear
similar to smoke emitted by traditional tobacco products. Their use in
workplaces and public places where smoking of traditional tobacco products is
prohibited creates concern and confusion and leads to difficulties in enforcing
the smoking prohibitions.
(Ord. 377, passed 11-9-15)
§ 97.21 DEFINITIONS.
   Except as may otherwise be provided or clearly implied by context, all terms
shall be given their commonly accepted definitions. For the purpose of this
subchapter, the following definitions shall apply:
   ELECTRONIC DELIVERY DEVICE. Any product containing or delivering nicotine,
lobelia, or any other substance intended for human consumption that can be used
by a person to simulate smoking in the delivery of nicotine or any other
substance through inhalation of vapor from the product. The term includes any
such devices, whether they are manufactured, distributed, marketed or sold as
e-cigarettes, e-cigars, e-pipes, or under any other product name or descriptor.
   USE. The inhaling or exhaling of aerosol or vapor from any electronic
delivery device. USE shall also mean being in possession of an electronic
delivery device that is turned on or otherwise activated.
(Ord. 377, passed 11-9-15)
§ 97.22 PROHIBITION.
   The use of any electronic delivery device is prohibited anywhere smoking is
prohibited by the Minnesota Clean Indoor Act, as it may be amended from time to
time.
(Ord. 377, passed 11-9-15)
§ 97.23 OTHER APPLICABLE LAWS.
   This subchapter is intended to complement the Minnesota Clean Indoor Air
Act, M.S. §§ 144.411 through 144.417, as it may be amended from time to time.
Nothing in this subchapter authorizes smoking or the use of an electronic
delivery device in any location that is regulated by other applicable laws or
regulations.
(Ord. 377, passed 11-9-15)
§ 97.99 VIOLATION AND PENALTIES.
   (A)   A person who violates any provision of §§
97.01 et seq. is guilty of a petty misdemeanor. Each day of violation

prohibition of nudity on the premises of any establishment licensed under this
chapter, as set forth in this section, reflects the prevailing community
standards of the city.

persons on the licensed premises when the person does not have his or her
buttocks, anus, breasts, and genitals covered with a non-transparent material.

establishment not otherwise eligible for an on-sale intoxicating liquor license

license holders are allowed Sunday off-sale of growlers of malt liquor produced
and packaged by the brewer on the licensed premises. No Sunday sales are
allowed before 8:00 a.m. or after 10:00 p.m. For all other days, the hours of

The on-sale of malt liquor may only be sold Monday through Saturday, unless a
Sunday sales license is attained, and during the hours that “on-sale” of liquor
may be made. A brewer must demonstrate compliance with all zoning ordinance

operate a restaurant at the taproom location.
   (P)   Brewer taproom off-sale malt liquor licenses may be issued only to
individuals, entities and other organizations holding a valid brewer’s license

time. All malt liquor sold under this license shall be packaged in the manner
required by M.S. § 340A.285, as it may be amended from time to time. A brewer

establishing fees and charges the fee for any of the liquor licenses it is

§ 113.29 COUNCIL DISCRETION TO GRANT OR DENY A LICENSE.
   The Council, in its sound discretion, may either grant or deny the
application for any license or for the transfer or renewal of any license. The
Council may, among other things, consider the proposed site and its proximity
to schools, churches, day cares and other similar facilities in determining if
a license will be issued. No applicant has a right to a license under this
chapter.
(Ord. 253, passed 3-12-07; Am. Ord. 337, passed 5-14-12)
§ 113.30 APPLICATION FOR LICENSE.
   (A)   Form. Every application for a license issued under this chapter shall
be on a form provided by the city. Every application shall state the name of
the applicant, the applicant’s age, representations as to the applicant’s
character, with references as the Council may require, the type of license
applied for, the business in connection with which the proposed license will
operate and its location, the style and manner in which the applicant intends
to conduct the business, a description of the premises, whether the applicant
is owner and operator of the business, how long the applicant has been in that
business at that place, and other information as the Council may require from
time to time. An application for an on-sale intoxicating liquor license shall
be in the form prescribed by the Commissioner of Public Safety and shall also
contain the information required in this section. The form shall be verified
and filed with the city. No person shall make a false statement in an
application.
   (B)   Financial responsibility. Prior to the issuance of any license under
this chapter, the applicant shall demonstrate proof of financial responsibility
as defined in M.S. § 340A.409, as it may be amended from time to time, with
regard to liability under M.S. § 340A.801, as it may be amended from time to
time. This proof will be filed with the city and the Commissioner of Public
Safety. Any liability insurance policy filed as proof of financial
responsibility under this section shall conform to M.S. § 340A.409, as it may
be amended from time to time. Operation of a business which is required to be
licensed by this chapter without having on file with the city at all times
effective proof of financial responsibility is a cause for revocation of the
license.
(Ord. 253, passed 3-12-07; Am. Ord. 337, passed 5-14-12)
§ 113.31 DESCRIPTION OF PREMISES.
   The application shall specifically describe the compact and contiguous
premises within which liquor may be dispensed and consumed. The description may
not include any parking lot or sidewalk. The building and any permanently
constructed and physically attached deck or patio is recognized as a part of
the compact and contiguous licensed premises. The area must be included as part
of the licensed premises on the applicant’s liquor license application in the
section that describes the licensed premises and must be covered by liquor
liability insurance. Storage of alcoholic beverages is not allowed on the
attached deck or patio.
(Ord. 253, passed 3-12-07; Am. Ord. 337, passed 5-14-12)
§ 113.32 APPLICATIONS FOR RENEWAL.
   At least 90 days before a license issued under this chapter is to be
renewed, an application for renewal shall be filed with the city. The decision
whether or not to renew a license rests within the sound discretion of the
Council. No licensee has a right to have the license renewed.
(Ord. 253, passed 3-12-07; Am. Ord. 337, passed 5-14-12)
§ 113.33 TRANSFER OF LICENSE.
   No license issued under this chapter may be transferred without the approval
of the Council. Any transfer of stock of a corporate licensee is deemed to be a
transfer of the license, and a transfer of stock without prior Council approval
is a ground for revocation of the license. An application to transfer a license
shall be treated the same as an application for a new license, and all of the
provisions of this code applying to applications for a license shall apply.
(Ord. 253, passed 3-12-07; Am. Ord. 337, passed 5-14-12)
§ 113.34 INVESTIGATION.
   (A)   Preliminary background and financial investigation. On an initial
application for a license, on an application for transfer of a license and, in
the sound discretion of the Council that it is in the public interest to do so,
on an application for renewal of a license, the city shall conduct a
preliminary background and financial investigation of the applicant or it may
contract with the Commissioner of Public Safety for the investigation. The
applicant shall pay with the application an investigation fee of $500 which
shall be in addition to any license fee. If the cost of the preliminary
investigation is less than $500, the unused balance shall be returned to the
applicant. The results of the preliminary investigation shall be sent to the
Commissioner of Public Safety if the application is for an on-sale intoxicating
liquor license or an on-sale wine license.
   (B)   Comprehensive background and financial investigation. If the results
of a preliminary investigation warrant, in the sound discretion of the Council,
a comprehensive background and financial investigation, the Council may either
conduct the investigation itself or contract with the Commissioner of Public
Safety for the investigation. The investigation fee for this comprehensive
background and financial investigation to be paid by the applicant shall be
$500, less any amount paid for the initial investigation if the investigation
is to be conducted within the state, and $10,000, less any amount paid for the
initial investigation, if the investigation is required outside the state. The
unused balance of the fee shall be returned to the applicant whether or not the
application is denied. The fee shall be paid in advance of any investigation
and the amount actually expended on the investigation shall not be refundable
in the event the application is denied. The results of the comprehensive
investigation shall be sent to the Commissioner of Public Safety if the
application is for an on-sale intoxicating liquor license or an on-sale wine
license.
(Ord. 253, passed 3-12-07; Am. Ord. 337, passed 5-14-12)
§ 113.35 HEARING AND ISSUANCE.

investigations. Opportunity shall be given to any person to be heard for or
against the granting of all new liquor licenses with exception to a 3.2% malt

sound discretion, grant or deny the application. No license shall become
effective until the proof of financial security has been approved by the
Commissioner of Public Safety.

for a license under state law.

§ 114.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
    Because the city recognizes that many persons under the age of 21 years
purchase or otherwise obtain, possess, and use tobacco, tobacco products, and
tobacco related devices, and the sales, possession, and use are violations of
both state and federal laws; and because studies, which the city hereby accepts
and adopts, have shown that most smokers begin smoking before they have reached
the age of 21 years and that those persons who reach the age of 21 years
without having started smoking are significantly less likely to begin smoking;
and because smoking has been shown to be the cause of several serious health
problems which subsequently place a financial burden on all levels of
government; this chapter shall be intended to regulate the sale, possession,
and use of tobacco, tobacco products, and tobacco related devices for the
purpose of enforcing and furthering existing laws, to protect minors against
the serious effects associated with the illegal use of tobacco, tobacco
products, and tobacco related devices, and to further the official public
policy of the state in regard to preventing young people from starting to smoke
as stated in M.S. § 144.391, as it may be amended from time to time.
(Ord. 375, passed 1-11-16; Am. Ord. 416, passed 9-14-20)

§ 116.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually oriented
businesses to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the
citizens of the city, to guard against the inception and transmission of
disease, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations. The provisions of
this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or
restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually
oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this chapter
to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected
by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of
sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market.
   (B)   The City Council further finds that experience from other cities
demonstrates that sexually oriented businesses conducted in private by members
of the same or the opposite sex, and employing personnel with no specialized
training, are susceptible to operation in a manner contravening, subverting or
endangering the health, safety and welfare of members of the community by being
the sites of acts of prostitution, illicit sex, and occasions of violent
crimes, thus requiring close inspection, licensing, and regulation.

At the conclusion of the hearing, the City Council shall make a final decision.
If a response is not received by the city in the time stated or, if after the
hearing, the city finds that grounds as specified in this chapter exist for
denial, suspension, or revocation, then such denial suspension, or revocation
shall become final five days after the city sends, by certified mail, written
notice that the license has been denied, suspended, or revoked. Such notice
shall include a statement advising the applicant or licensee of the right to
appeal such decision to a court of competent jurisdiction.
      (2)   If the City Council finds that no grounds exist for denial,

decision of the City Council requiring, denying, suspending or revoking a

court of competent jurisdiction. If the aggrieved party appeals the City
Council’s decision within the 60 days provided, the stay shall be extended

allow the aggrieved party to continue operation of the sexually oriented
business or to continue employment as a sexually oriented employee, as the case
may be, and will expire upon the court’s entry of a judgment on the aggrieved
party’s action to appeal, challenge, restrain, or otherwise enjoin the city’s
enforcement.

suspension, revocation, or non-renewal of a license upon appropriate terms and
conditions.

§ 117.07 PROCESSING RETURNS.
   The City Manager shall, after a return is filed, examine the same and make

information as the City Manager can obtain, and assess the lodging tax due on
the basis thereof, which said lodging tax shall be paid within ten days of the

containing tetrahydrocannabinol ("THC"). The purpose of this chapter is to
regulate the sale of products that contain THC and are intended for human or
animal consumption, excluding "medical cannabis" as defined by M.S. § 152.22,
subd. 6, as the same may be amended from time to time, ("THC Product" or
"licensed product") for the following reasons:
   (A)   The city recognizes that, based on the most reliable and up-to-date
scientific evidence, the rapid introduction of newly legalized adult-use THC
products presents a significant potential threat to the public health, safety,
and welfare of the residents of Perham, and particularly to youth.
   (B)   The city has the opportunity to be proactive and make decisions that
will mitigate this threat and reduce exposure of young people to the products
or to the marketing of these products and improve compliance among THC product
retailers with laws prohibiting the sale or marketing of THC products to
minors.
   (C)   A local regulatory system for THC product retailers is appropriate to
ensure that retailers comply with THC product laws and business standards of
the city to protect the health, safety, and welfare of our youth and most
vulnerable residents.
   (D)   State law requires THC product retailers to check the identification
of purchasers to verify that they are at least 21 years of age, comply with
certain packaging and labeling requirements to protect children and youth, and
meet certain potency and serving size requirements.
   (E)   State law authorizes the Board of Pharmacy to adopt product and
testing standards in part to curb the illegal sale and distribution of THC
products and ensure the safety and compliance of commercially available THC
products in the state of Minnesota.
   (F)   State law does not preempt the authority of a local jurisdiction to
adopt and enforce local ordinances to regulate THC product businesses
including, but not limited to, local zoning and land use requirements and
business license requirements.
   (G)   A requirement for a THC product retailer license will not unduly
burden legitimate business activities of retailers who sell or distribute THC
products to adults but will allow the city to regulate the operation of lawful
businesses to discourage violations of state and local THC product-related
laws.
   (H)   In making these findings and enacting this chapter, the Perham City
Council intends to ensure responsible THC product retailing, allow legal sale
and access without promoting increases in use, and discourage violations of THC
product-related laws, especially those which prohibit or discourage the
marketing, sale, distribution, possession, and use of THC products to or by
youth under 21 years of age.

stability in zoning for now and in the future, and that the proposed provisions
are in the public interest and for the public good.
   (B)   Authority and jurisdiction. The City of Perham has the authority to
adopt this chapter pursuant to:
      (1)   M.S. § 342.13(c), regarding the authority of a local unit of

the operation of a cannabis business provided that such restrictions do not

requirements of state-licensed cannabis retail businesses and lower-potency
hemp edible retail businesses.

regulated activity listed in this chapter.

(Ord. 338, passed 5-14-12)
§ 130.05 SOCIAL HOST LIABILITY.
   (A)   Purpose and findings. The city intends to discourage underage
possession and consumption of alcohol, even if done within the confines of a
private residence, and intends to hold persons criminally responsible who host
events or gatherings where persons under 21 years of age possess or consume
alcohol regardless of whether the person hosting the event or gathering
supplied the alcohol. The city finds that:
      (1)   Events and gatherings held on private or public property where
alcohol is possessed or consumed by persons under the age of 21 are harmful to
those persons and constitute a potential threat to public health requiring
prevention or abatement.
      (2)   Prohibiting underage consumption acts to protect underage persons,
as well as the general public, from injuries related to alcohol consumption,
such as alcohol overdose or alcohol-related traffic collisions.
      (3)   Alcohol is an addictive drug which, if used irresponsibly, could
have drastic effects on those who use it as well as those who are affected by
the actions of an irresponsible user.
      (4)   Often, events or gatherings involving underage possession and
consumption occur outside the presence of parents. However, there are times
when the parent(s) is/are present and, condone the activity, and in some
circumstances provide the alcohol.
      (5)   Even though giving or furnishing alcohol to an underage person is a
crime, it is difficult to prove, and an ordinance is necessary to help further
combat underage consumption.
      (6)   A deterrent effect will be created by holding a person criminally
responsible for hosting an event or gathering where underage possession or
consumption occurs.

      (2)   A person is criminally responsible for violating division (D)(1)
above if the person intentionally aids, advises, hires, counsels, or conspires
with or otherwise procures another to commit the prohibited act.
      (3)   A person who hosts an event or gathering does not have to be
present at the event or gathering to be criminally responsible.
   (E)   Exceptions.

person and his or her parents while present in the parent's household.

Perham and Gorman Townships, pursuant to the provisions and authority of M.S. §
360.063, as it may be amended from time to time, hereby finds and declares
that:
   (A)   An airport hazard endangers the lives and property of users of the
Perham Municipal Airport and property or occupants of land in its vicinity and
also, if of the obstructive type, in effect reduces the size of the area
available for the landing, take-off, and maneuvering of aircraft, thus tending
to destroy or impair the utility of the Perham Municipal Airport and the public
investment therein.
   (B)   The creation or establishment of an airport hazard is a public
nuisance and an injury to the region served by the Perham Municipal Airport.
   (C)   For the protection of the public health, safety, order, convenience,
prosperity, and general welfare, and for the promotion of the most appropriate
use of land, it is necessary to prevent the creation or establishment of
airport hazards.
   (D)   The prevention of these airport hazards should be accomplished, to the
extent legally possible, by the exercise of the police power without
compensation.
   (E)   The prevention of the creation or establishment of airport hazards and
the elimination, removal, alteration, mitigation, or marking and lighting of
existing airport hazards are public purposes for which political subdivisions
may raise and expend public funds.

amendments thereto, or than it is when the application for a permit is made.
Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted.
(Ord. 195, passed 6-22-95)
§ 152.22 NONCONFORMING USES ABANDONED OR DESTROYED.
   Whenever the Building Official determines that a nonconforming structure or
tree has been abandoned or more than 80% torn down, physically deteriorated, or
decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to
exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning
regulations. Whether application is made for a permit under this section or
not, the Zoning Administrator may order the owner of the abandoned or partially
destroyed nonconforming structure, at his or her own expense, to lower, remove,
reconstruct, or equip the same in the manner necessary to conform to the
provisions of this chapter. In the event the owner of the nonconforming
structure shall neglect or refuse to comply with such order for ten days after
receipt of written notice of such order, the Zoning Administrator may, by
appropriate legal action, proceed to have the abandoned or partially destroyed
nonconforming structure lowered, removed, reconstructed, or equipped and assess
the cost and expense thereof against the land on which the structure is or was
located. Unless such an assessment is paid within 90 days from the service of
notice thereof on the owner of the land, the sum shall bear interest at the
rate of 8% per annum from the date the cost and expense is incurred until paid
and shall be collected in the same manner as are general taxes.

with the regulations prescribed in this chapter may apply to the Board of
Adjustment, hereinafter provided for, for a variance from such regulations. If
a person submits an application for a variance by certified mail to the members
of the Board and the Board fails to grant or deny the variance within four
months after the last member receives the application, the variance shall be
deemed to be granted by the Board. When the variance is granted by reason of
the failure of the Board to act on the variance, the person receiving the
variance shall notify the Board and the Commissioner of Transportation by
certified mail that the variance has been granted. The applicant shall include
a copy of the original application for the variance with this notice to the
Commissioner. The variance shall be effective 60 days after this notice is

pursuant to M.S. § 360.063, subdivision 6.A, as it may be amended from time to
time.
   (B)   Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal
application or enforcement of the regulations would result in practical
difficulty or unnecessary hardship and relief granted would not be contrary to
the public interest, but do substantial justice and be in accordance with the
spirit of this chapter, provided any variance so allowed may be subject to any
reasonable conditions that the Board of Adjustment or Commissioner may deem
necessary to effectuate the purpose of this chapter.

installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the city.
   (B)   Permits and variances. Any permit or variance granted by the City
Manager or Board of Adjustment as the case may be may, if such action is deemed
advisable to effectuate the purpose of this chapter and be reasonable in the
circumstances, so condition such permit or variance as to require the owner of
the structure or tree in question at his or her own expense to install,
operate, and maintain there such markers and lights as may be necessary to
indicate to pilots the presence of an airport hazard.
(Ord. 195, passed 6-22-95)
§ 152.99 PENALTY.
   Every person who shall construct, establish, substantially change, alter, or
repair any existing structure or use, permit the growth of any tree without
having complied with the provisions of this chapter or who, having been granted
a permit or variance under the provisions of this chapter, shall construct,
establish, substantially change, or substantially alter or repair any existing
growth or structure or permit the growth of any tree, except as permitted by
such permit or variance, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished
by a fine of not more than $1,000, imprisonment for not more than 90 days, or
by both. Each day a violation continues to exist shall constitute a separate
offense. The City Manager may enforce all provisions of this chapter through
such proceedings for injunctive relief and other relief as may be proper under
the laws of M.S. § 360.073, as it may be amended from time to time, and other
applicable law.
