In the case of a business establishment which, as a regular part of its

of large assemblies, entertainment events, amusement events, or social events
for which an admission charge is collected, the owner may, upon application to
the City Council, be granted an annual license. Such an annual license shall be
considered, issued, and used within the following conditions, restrictions, and
guidelines:
   A.   An annual license of this type shall be available only under Article II
of this chapter, and Article III is specifically excluded from the provision
for an annual license.
   B.   All of the provisions of Article I and of Article II shall apply to
annual licenses, except where special provisions are made in this Section.
   C.   For the issuance of an annual license, §
4-204.A is modified: the application must be submitted to the Zoning
Administrator at least forty-five (45) days prior to the date upon which the
applicant intends to conduct the first scheduled event.
   D.   For the issuance of an annual license, §
4-205.C is modified: the application must also state the predicted number of
events and the predicted dates of the events which the applicant expects to
conduct during the term of the annual license. It is recommended that
applicants include all of the possible and foreseeable events in the
application since the use of the annual license will be restricted to the
number and kinds of events listed in the application. The holder of an annual
license may not use the license to conduct an event which was not contemplated
by the annual license application, but rather must seek an additional one-time
event license. Each predicted event contemplated by the annual license
application should be presented in the application as a sub-part, including all
of the information required by §
4-205 and §
4-206 for each predicted event.
   E.   For the issuance of an annual license, §

part of the annual license is refundable, even if the predicted events are not
conducted.
   F.   At the time the annual license is issued by the City Clerk, the
applicant shall deposit with the Zoning Administrator a current certificate of
insurance or a duplicate original insurance policy which insurance must comply
with the provisions of §
4-208. The insurance certificate or policy must state that the duration of the
coverage extends to the date after the last day of the last event predicted and
licensed in the annual license.
   G.   The holder of an annual license may delay the cash deposit required by
§
4-209 until the last Wednesday preceding the date of a scheduled event.
   H.   If the holder of an annual license wishes to use a temporary structure,
as contemplated by §
4-206, the license holder must coordinate a construction and inspection
schedule for each temporary structure with the building inspector. It is the
license holder’s responsibility to coordinate this schedule with the building
inspector and to pay the appropriate inspection fees as set forth in the
building code. Failure to pay the inspection fees or failure to obtain a timely
inspection shall not necessarily invalidate the event license but shall
prohibit the licensee’s use of the temporary structure.

ARTICLE IX
TOBACCO
SECTION 4-900.   FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
The Columbus City Council makes the following Findings in support of this
section intended to regulate the sale, possession, and use of tobacco and
related devices and products and to protect young people against the serious
effects associated with the use of tobacco. The City Council recognizes that
the sale of tobacco, tobacco related devices, electronic delivery devices and
nicotine or lobelia delivery products to persons under the age of 21 violates
both state and federal laws. Studies which the City hereby accepts and adopts,
have shown that 90% of people who smoke begin smoking before they have reached
the age of 18 years, and that almost no one starts smoking after 25. There is
evidence to suggest that enforcement of possession, use, or purchase (PUP) laws
against youth detract from the enforcement of penalties against retailers. This
section is intended to regulate the sale of tobacco, tobacco related devices,
electronic delivery devices, and nicotine or lobelia delivery products for the
purpose of enforcing and furthering existing laws, to protect minors and young
adults against the serious effects associated with use and initiation and to
further the official public policy of the state in regard to preventing young
people from staring to smoke as stated in Minn. Stat. § 144.391, as it may be
amended from time to time.
[CHAPTER 4, ARTICLE IX, Section
4-900,added by Ord. No .22-06, effective August 4, 2022.]
SECTION 4-901.   STUDIES.

recommendations of: the Institute of Medicine’s report, “Public Health
Implications of Raising the Minimum Age of Legal Access to Tobacco Products”
(2015), the U.S. Surgeon General reports, “E-cigarette Use Among Youth and
Young Adults” (2016), “The Health Consequences of Smoking-50 Years of Progress”

ARTICLE XI
SEXUAL OFFDENDERS AND SEXUAL PREDATORS
SECTION 5-1101.   FINDINGS AND INTENT.
   A.   Repeat sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence,
and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual predators who present a
substantial threat to the public safety. Current information indicates that
sexual offenders are proven more likely to use physical violence and to repeat
their offenses, and most sexual offenders commit many offenses, have many more
victims than are reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their
crimes. This makes the cost of sexual offender victimization to society at
large and specifically to the City of Columbus ("City"), while incalculable,
clearly exorbitant.
   B.   It is the intent of this section to serve the City's compelling
interest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety and welfare of the
citizens of the City by creating areas around locations where children
regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain sexual offenders
and sexual predators are prohibited from establishing temporary or permanent
residence.
SECTION 5-1102.   DEFINITIONS.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have
the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly
indicates a different meaning.

sexual offense, regardless of whether adjudication has been withheld, in which

categorized as a Level III sex offender under Minnesota Statutes 244.052 or
successor or amended statute.

successor or amended statute, or a similar offense from another state.
   C.   Permanent Residence. A place where the person abides, lodges, or
resides for fourteen (14) or more consecutive days. Permanent residence does
not require an ownership interest by the person in such residence.
   D.   Temporary Residence. A place where the person abides, lodges, or
resides for a period of fourteen (14) or more days in the aggregate during any
calendar year and which is not the person's permanent address, or a place where
the person routinely abides, lodges, or resides for a period of four (4) or

the parent or guardian of the children involved, and no non-familiar children
are present, are exempt from this paragraph
   C.   Measurement of Distance.
      1.   For purposes of determining the minimum distance separation, the
requirement shall be measured by following a straight line from the outer
property line of the permanent residence or temporary residence to nearest
outer property line of a school, playground, licensed daycare, public park,
place of worship, or school.
      2.   The City Clerk shall maintain an official map showing prohibited
locations as defined by this Ordinance. The City Clerk shall update the map at

      5.   The residence is also the primary residence of the person's parents,
grandparents, siblings, spouse, or children.
      6.   The residence is a property owned or leased by the Minnesota
Department of Corrections.
SECTION 5-1104.   PROPERTY OWNERS PROHIBITED FROM RENTING REAL PROPERTY TO
CERTAIN SEXUAL OFFENDERS AND SEXUAL PREDATORS; PENALTIES:

   B.   Nonconforming Structures;
   C.   Nonconforming Uses of land;
   D.   Nonconforming Uses of land and Structures in combination; and

restricted under the terms of this Ordinance* or future amendments thereto.
“Nonconforming” shall include in its definition any legal use, Structure, or
parcel of land already in existence, recorded, or authorized before the
effective date* of this Zoning Ordinance* or any amendment hereto, that would
not have been permitted to become established under the terms of this Zoning
Ordinance as now written, if the Ordinance had been in effect at the time of
the establishment of the use. It is the intent of this Article to regulate
nonconformities and to provide for their gradual elimination.
[§ 7A-400, amended by Ord. No. 90-1, effective May 18, 1990.]
[*Clerk’s note: References in the text of the Code to “...the effective date of

development on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the
effective date* of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance and upon which
actual Building construction has been carried on diligently. Where demolition
or removal of an existing Building has been substantially begun preparatory to
rebuilding, such demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual

requirements concerning the Structure, such Structure may be continued so long
as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:

County Assessor) at the time of said damage, then such Structure shall not be
repaired, restored, or reconstructed, except in conformity with the provisions
of this Ordinance.
      3.   Should any nonconforming Structure or nonconforming portion of a
Structure be damaged by any means (e.g., fire, windstorm, flood) to an extent
that repair and restoration costs are less than 50% of the assessed value of

space shall not be increased from the predamaged sizes;
         c.   Bearing walls shall be reconstructed in their original locations,
unless the current Building Code requires a safer placement of bearing walls;
         d.   All reconstruction, restoration, and repair work shall be done
according to the current Building Code, Fire Code, Life Safety Code, and other
applicable codes adopted elsewhere in this City Code, meaning that, in some
cases, restoration of the damaged portions may require rewiring of the entire
Structure to conform to the State Electrical Code, or that restoration of an
exterior wall may require installation of a larger window or installation of a
door where one did not exist before in order to comply with the Life Safety
Code or Fire Code; and,
         e.   The architectural style of the reconstruction shall match, as
closely as possible, that of the nondamaged portion of the Structure.

reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the
regulations for this District in which it is located after it is moved.

SECTION 7A-522.   DUTIES OF THE BOARD OF ADJUSTMENTS AND APPEALS.
For the purpose of this Chapter, the Board of Adjustments and Appeals has the
following specific responsibilities:

order requirement, decision, interpretation, or determination made by the
Zoning Administrator in the enforcement of this Chapter;
   B.   To hear and consider requests for variances from the literal provisions
of this Chapter where their strict enforcement would result in undue hardship
there are practical difficulties in complying with the Ordinance because of
circumstances unique to the property under consideration and to grant such
variances only when it is demonstrated that such actions will be in harmony
with the general purposes and intent of this Chapter and consistent with the
Comprehensive Plan.

nature of the variance requested and a narrative statement addressing the
following standards:
   A.   That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to
the land, structure, or building involved and which are not applicable to other
lands, structures, or buildings in the same District; and

SECTION 7A-525.   FINDINGS AND DECISIONS OF THE BOARD OF ADJUSTMENTS AND
APPEALS.
The City Council acting as the Board of Adjustments and Appeals must make all
of the following findings in order to grant a variance:
   A.   That the landowner proposes to use the property in a reasonable manner.
   B.   That the practical difficulty or plight of the landowner is unique to
the subject property and is not created by the landowner.
   C.   That the variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character
of the neighborhood or City.
   D.   That the terms of the variance are consistent with the Comprehensive
Plan.
   E.   That the variance, if granted, is in harmony with the purpose and
intent of the Zoning Ordinance.
   F.   That the practical difficulty is not created solely by economic
considerations.
In making its determination on whether to grant or deny a variance, the Board
of Adjustments and Appeals shall follow the following non-exclusive factors:
   A.   If applicable, variances shall be granted for earth-sheltered
construction as defined in Minnesota Statutes 216C.06., Subdivision 14, as
amended when in harmony with this Ordinance.
   B.   If applicable, the Board of Adjustment may consider the inability to
use solar energy systems a hardship in the granting of variances.
   C.   Economic considerations alone cannot constitute a hardship if a
reasonable use for the property exists under the terms of this Ordinance.
   D.   No variance may be granted that would allow any use that is prohibited
in the zoning district in which the subject property is located.
The Board of Adjustments and Appeals shall make appropriate findings for the
record in any decisions regarding an appeal. Decisions by the Board of
Adjustments and Appeals for variances or appeals shall require a simple
majority of a quorum of the members.

SECTION 7A-530.   INTERIM USE PERMIT PROCESS.
Interim Use Permits granted in this section shall be temporary in nature, valid
in accordance with Section
7A-532. Interim Use Permits shall be granted to a designated person or entity,
and are not transferable to other persons or entities.
   A.   Applications for Interim Use Permits shall be filed with the Zoning
Administrator, together with a filing fee established by the City Council by
ordinance. The application shall be forwarded to the Planning Commission for a
public hearing. Notice of the hearing shall be published in the official
newspaper at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing. Notification of the
hearing shall be mailed to all owners of property within 350 feet of the
affected property. The failure to give mailed notice to individual property
owners, or defects in the notice shall not invalidate the proceeds, provided a
bona fide attempt to comply with these procedures has been made. Following the
public hearing, the Planning Commission shall make its findings and forward its
recommendations to the City Council for final action on the application for an
Interim Use Permit. The City Council shall consider the recommendations of the
Planning Commission, and may consult with the Zoning Administrator, City
Planner, and City Building Official where the City Council finds it beneficial
to the deliberation of the Interim Use Permit.
   B.   Upon the expiration of Interim Use Permit term, an Applicant may
reapply for an Interim Use Permit in the same manner as an initial application.
Prior granting of an Interim Use Permit does not give an Applicant any vested
right to a subsequent Interim Use Permit. Interim Use Permits shall conform to
restrictions or conditions applicable to all uses in the district, and other
conditions the City Council may determine are necessary to avoid conflict with
surrounding land usage.
   C.   Findings. The City Council shall make the following findings when
issuing an Interim Use Permit:
      1.   That the use is allowed in the District and conforms to the
regulations of this Section;
      2.   That the date or event that will terminate the use can be identified
with certainty;
      3.   That permission of the use will not impose additional costs on the
public if it is necessary for the public to take the property in the future;
and
      4.   That the user agrees to any conditions that the City Council deems
appropriate for permission of the use.

[§ 7A-532 added by Ord. No. 04-04A, effective June 3, 2004]
SECTION 7A-540.   PROCEDURES AND REQUIREMENTS FOR APPROVAL OF CONDITIONAL USE.
Conditional Uses shall conform to the procedures and requirements of Section
7A-541 through
7A-547 of this Chapter.
[§ 7A-540, amended by Ord. No. 89-1, effective July 21, 1989, amended by Ord.
No. 04-04A, effective June 3, 2004]
SECTION 7A-541.   GENERAL.
It is recognized that land uses evolve and new uses are established, and that
many of these and some other more conventional uses possess characteristics of
such unique and special nature relative to location, design, size, method of
operation, circulation, and public facilities that each specific use must be
considered individually. Conditional Uses are designed to allow certain land
use activities while requiring special conditions that preclude such uses from
being incompatible with other existing or planned conventional uses. If the
Planning Commission feels that, because of the unusual nature of the requested
Conditional Use Permit, employment of consultants is needed, any such resulting
consulting fees shall be paid by the applicant.
   A.   All conditional Use Permits shall be probationally issued. Each permit
shall be reviewed by the Zoning Administrator one (1) year following the date
upon which the permit was issued for a determination that the property is being
used in compliance with the conditions stated on the permit. The Zoning
Administrator shall report the probationary review to the Planning Commission.
Upon such report, the Planning Commission shall make one of the following
findings:
      1.   That the property has not been placed into the use for which the
permit was issued, then the permit shall be declared expired in the same manner
as in Section
7A-547; or
      2.   That the property has been placed into the use for which the permit
was issued and that all conditions of the permit are being met, and the permit
shall no longer be deemed probationary and shall thereafter be reviewed only in
response to inquiry or complaint; or
      3.   That the property has been placed into the use for which the permit
was issued, but that some or all of conditions of the permit are being
violated, and the Planning Commission shall direct the property owner to
correct the conditions. Failing voluntary correction of the conditions, the
Planning Commission shall conduct proceedings and a public hearing to determine
if the permit should be revoked. The record of the revocation proceedings and
the Planning Commission’s recommendation shall be reported to the City Council
for final decision.
If a probational Conditional Use has been found to be in violation of some or
all of the conditions, and the violations are corrected, the permit shall
continue in probationary status for one (1) year following the date upon which
corrections were finally made. If a permit is revoked and the permit was
recorded with the Anoka County Recorder, then the revocation order shall also
be recorded..
   B.   After successful probationary compliance, all Conditional Use Permits
shall remain in effect as long as the conditions attached to the permit are
observed. A Conditional Use Permit shall be recorded with the Anoka County
Recorder and deemed to run with the land and to be transferable from one owner
of the land to the next owner. The burdens or benefits of the conditions shall
not be deemed to be vested rights, and therefore the City reserves the right to
amend, modify and alter the conditions attached to any permit, as changed
circumstances or City Code performance standards may warrant.

SECTION 7A-542.   CONTENTS OF APPLICATION FOR A CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT.
An application and payment of established fees for Conditional Use Permit shall
be filed with the Zoning Administrator by at least one owner or lessee of
property for which such Conditional Use is proposed. At a minimum, the
application shall contain the following information:
   A.   Name, address, and phone number of applicant;
   B.   Legal description of property and a survey if the description is other
than either a regular platted lot or a simple fractional share of a land
section;
   C.   Description of existing use;
   D.   Zoning District;
   E.   Description of proposed Conditional Use;
   F.   A plan of the proposed site for the Conditional Use showing the
location of all buildings, parking and loading areas, traffic access and
traffic circulation, open space, landscaping, refuse and service areas,
utilities, signs, yards, and such other information as the Planning Commission
may require to determine if the proposed conditional use meets the intent, and
requirements of this Ordinance;
   G.   A narrative statement evaluating the effect of such elements as noise,
glare, odor, fumes, and vibration on adjoining property; a discussion of the
general compatibility with adjacent and other properties in the District; and
the relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan; and
   H.   Such other information as may recommended by the Zoning Administrator.
[§ 7A-542 amended by Ord. No. 04-04A, effective June 3, 2004]
SECTION 7A-543.   GENERAL STANDARD APPLICABLE TO ALL CONDITIONAL USES.
In addition to the specific requirements for conditionally permitted uses, the
Planning Commission shall review the particular facts and circumstances of each
proposed use in terms of the following standards and shall find adequate
evidence showing that such use at the proposed location:
   A.   Will be harmonious with and in accordance with the general objectives,
or with any specific objective of the City Comprehensive Plan and the Zoning
Ordinance; and
   B.   Will be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained so as to be
harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the existing or intended
character of the general vicinity and that such use will not change the
essential character of the same area; and
   C.   Will not be hazardous or disturbing to existing or future neighboring
uses; and
   D.   Will be served adequately by essential public facilities and services
such as highways, streets, police and fire protection, drainage structures,
refuse disposal, and schools; or that the persons or agencies responsible for
the establishment of the proposed use shall be able to provide adequately any
such services; and
   E.   Will not create excessive additional requirements at public cost for
public facilities and services and will not be detrimental to the economic
welfare of the community; and
   F.   Will not involve uses, activities, processes, materials, equipment and
conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any persons, property or
general welfare by reason of excessive production of traffic, noise, smoke
fumes, glare, or orders; and
   G.   Will have vehicular approaches to the property which shall be designed
as not to create an interference in traffic on surrounding public
thoroughfares; and
   H.   Will not result in the destruction, loss or damage of a natural,
scenic, or historic feature of major importance.

SECTION 7A-544.   CONDITIONS AND SAFEGUARDS.
   A.   Planning Commission may recommend conditions. In granting any
Conditional Use the Planning Commission may recommend appropriate conditions
and safeguards in conformity with this Ordinance. Violations of such conditions
and safeguards, when made a part of the terms which the Conditional Use is
granted, shall be deemed a violation of this Ordinance and punishable under
Section
7A-350 of this Ordinance.
   B.   Review of conditions. Under the direction of the City Zoning
Administrator, the Planning Commission may act as the fact finder in reviewing
compliance with approved conditions to a Conditional Use Permit.

Use Permit specified in Section

SECTION 7A-650.   MIXED USE LOW DENSITY RESIDENTIAL (MU-L) DISTRICT DEFINED.
The purpose of the MU-L District is to establish a placeholder for mixed use
live-work opportunities when public utilities become available or if city-
approved alternative sewer systems are appropriate for low density residential
uses that are clearly accessory to principal business uses. The maximum
residential density shall be one unit per acre and any mixed use development
shall be reviewed as a planned unit development through the Conditional Use
Permit (CUP) procedures. The MU-L District also allows Permitted Uses,
Conditional Uses and Interim Uses listed in the Commercial/Industrial (C/I)
District. The C/I District Design Standards apply to all uses within the MU-
L District. All other relevant performance standards listed in Article VIII of
Chapter 7 of the City Code apply to the MU-L District.
[§ 7A-650, added by Ord. No. 21-09, effective December 8, 2021.]
SECTION 7A-660.   MIXED USE MEDIUM DENSITY RESIDENTIAL (MU-M) DISTRICT DEFINED.
The purpose of the Mixed Use Medium Density Residential (MU-M) District is to
allow a variety of residential housing styles and opportunities at varying
levels of residential densities, interspersed with commercial land uses.
Allowing mixed uses requires a conscious effort to minimize land use conflicts
by establishing performance standards, including compatible development
requirements, cohesive building and landscaping design standards, and
complementary pedestrian and traffic circulation requirements. The goal of
establishing the MU-M District is to allow flexibility in land use development
patterns, controlled through the planned unit development procedures for both
residential and commercial land uses, whether projects are individually
developed or part of a multiple use development concept. The City may require
additional performance standards, such as late-night operating and lighting
restrictions, to minimize conflicts between different land uses. Because of the
mixed land use concept, all uses in the MU-M District shall meet higher design
standards. All uses in the MU-M District require connection to public sewer and
water.
[§ 7A-660, added by Ord. No. 21-09, effective December 8, 2021.]

SECTION 7A-670.   MIXED USE HIGH DENSITY RESIDENTIAL (MU-H) DISTRICT DEFINED.
The purpose of the Mixed Use High Density Residential District is to allow a
variety of residential housing styles and opportunities at higher levels of
residential density, interspersed with commercial land uses. Allowing mixed
uses requires a conscious effort to minimize land use conflicts by establishing
performance standards, including compatible development requirements, cohesive
building and landscaping design standards, and complementary pedestrian and
traffic circulation requirements. The MU-H District may include standalone
residential and commercial uses, adjacent to each other, or residential uses
located on separate floor(s) above commercial uses. The goal of establishing
the MU-H District is to allow flexibility in land use development patterns,
controlled through Planned Unit Development procedures for both residential and
commercial land uses, whether projects are individually developed or part of a
multiple use development concept. The City may require additional performance
standards, such as late-night operating and lighting restrictions, to minimize
conflicts between different land uses. The high visibility and accessibility of
this district will support the highest building and site design standards in
the I-35 Freeway Corridor, with no intention to serve extensive land users or
uses with prominent outdoor display. All uses in the MU-H District require
connection to public sewer and water.
[§ 7A-670, added by Ord. No. 21-09, effective December 8, 2021.]
SECTION 7A-671.   MIXED USE HIGH DENSITY RESIDENTIAL (MU-H) DISTRICT DESCRIBED.

SECTION 7A-740.   COMMERCIAL/INDUSTRIAL (C/I) DISTRICT DEFINED.
The purpose of the Commercial/Industrial District is to encourage the
establishment of areas for general commerce and business, retail sales,
wholesale sales, and light Manufacturing. Activities would include retail
outlets, service stations, eating and drinking establishments, and
Manufacturing activities commonly located in an serving the local market. The
overall character of the District is intended to be transitional in nature,
thus industrial uses allowed in this district shall be limited to those which
can compatibly exist adjacent to commercial and lower density activities. Due
to the high volumes of traffic which usually accompany these business
activities, it is absolutely necessary that C/I Districts be located on a
collector or arterial as specified by the City of Columbus Comprehensive Plan.

SECTION 7A-743.   COMMERCIAL/INDUSTRIAL (C/I) DISTRICT CONDITIONAL USES.
As evidenced by the Comprehensive Plan, most lands in the City of Columbus are
limited in their• capacity to be developed because of poor soil conditions,
relatively high water table, lack of municipal water supply, lack of municipal
sanitary sewer, and lack of municipal storm sewer. Until these municipal
facilities become available, it will be necessary for nearly all C/I uses to be
administered as Conditional Uses. The principal conditions employed to address
these concerns are environmental and include such things as (i.) non-
contamination of the groundwater system through utilization of containment
systems for off-site waste disposal and lawful on-site sewage disposal systems;
(ii.) installation of lawful wells for on-site water supply; and, (iii.)
installation of on-site or acquisition and installation of off-site surface
water retention areas to nullify the impact of construction of impervious
surfaces on the site. Environmental conditions are not the only conditions
which may be placed upon a C/I use. Other conditions, intended to make the C/
I use as harmonious as possible with it surrounding lawful uses, may be imposed
by the City Council. The following uses shall be conditional in the C/
I District:
   A.   Artisan Shops.
   B.   Brewery, Craft/Micro.
   C.   Contractor Shops with accessory Contractor Yard-Limited.
   D.   Contractor Shop with accessory Contractor Yard operating pursuant to an

addition to the principal dwelling unit allowed by this Section, following
receipt of an application for an Interim Use Permit. A temporary family care
dwelling unit shall meet all the requirements of the City Code, but a temporary
family care dwelling unit shall not be allowed in a detached accessory
structure. Approval of an Interim Use Permit for a temporary family care
dwelling unit also requires a finding that no reasonable alternative is
available for assisted living arrangements for immediate family members of the
owner(s) of such principal dwelling unit.

SECTION 7A-802.   BUILDABLE AREA.
   A.   General Requirement. Every Lot without public wastewater treatment
shall have at least one (1) buildable area. All buildings, garages, accessory
buildings, and individual on-site sewage disposal systems shall be constructed
within a buildable area. All drain field sites for Subsurface Treatment Systems
(SSTS) shall be staked, fenced, barricaded or otherwise isolated from the site
of any construction so that soils in the drain field site are not disturbed or
compacted during construction. Accessory buildings constructed on a buildable
area separate from the buildable area upon which the principal structure is
constructed shall have a buildable area which is two times (2x) the square
footage of the lowest floor(s) of the accessory buildings if there is no SSTS
needed for the accessory buildings. If there is plumbing in the accessory
building, the buildable area shall be increased by 2,000 square feet to
accommodate a 20’ x 100’ drainfield.
   B.   Survey Elevations. Semi-permanent elevation markings are required to be
placed on the construction site to aid city officials in their determination
that the elevation requirements of this Code have been met. It is advisable for
the surveyor to place durable markers, e.g., 6 feet or 8 feet steel fence
posts, with finish elevations marked on each post, at each corner of the
buildable area(s), at two opposite corners or ends of the drain field area(s),
and at least one post adjacent to each segment of the driveway(s). If the
elevation markings are not present upon the completion of construction, either
the Building Inspector or the Zoning Administrator shall have the authority to
require an additional survey to verify that the construction elevation
requirements of this Code have been met.
   C.   Penalty. Construction elevations in the City of Columbus are critical
measurements. During the time period between the placement of the elevation
markers by a surveyor and the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy, any
person who moves, alters, or otherwise tampers with construction elevation
markers shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be
punished by a fine or by imprisonment in accordance with the provisions of the
City Code.

21-09, effective December 8, 2021.]
SECTION 7A-803.   MINIMUM CONSTRUCTION ELEVATIONS ABOVE KNOWN HIGH WATER AND
DRIVEWAY DESIGN REQUIREMENTS.
All new construction in all districts shall be constructed at a reasonably safe
elevation above the high water table in order to avoid water seepage problems
and in order to provide adequate drainage from the structure to the SSTS.
   A.   Optimum Elevation For New Construction. The optimum elevation for new
construction is six (6.0) feet above the level of the high water table as
measured to the top of the lowest footing (= bottom of the lowest floor).
Construction at or above six (6.0) feet above the high water table is strongly
advised. The optimal elevation is shown in Illustration No. 4, Appendix A to
Chapter 7A.
   B.   Acceptable Minimum Elevation For New Construction.  
      1.   Except for accessory buildings, the acceptable minimum elevation for
new construction is three (3.0) feet above the level of the high water table as
measured to the top of the lowest footing (= bottom of the lowest floor), or
two (2.0) feet above the designated or designed 100-year flood elevation,
whichever is higher, unless evidence is submitted and certified by a
geotechnical engineer, at the expense of the developer or property owner, that
a lesser separation can be achieved and is warranted, and that evidence is
verified by the City Engineer. Where any such geotechnical engineering report
is based on piezometer data, the acceptable minimum elevation for new
construction shall be four (4.0) feet above the level of the high water table,
and said piezometers must be installed on each individual proposed lot for a
minimum of twelve (12) months. Any construction below the optimum elevation of
six (6.0) feet above the high water table shall require installation of: not
less than one sump; one sump pump; and drain tiles either inside or outside all
of the footings. The sump pump shall not be connected to the septic system in
any manner. Caution: Although a three (3.0) foot minimum separation is
acceptable under this Section, current FHA and VA construction standards
require not less than four (4.0) feet minimum elevation as measured from the
high water table to the top of the lowest footing. The three (3.0) feet minimum
elevation required by this Section will meet or exceed the requirements of the
Rice Creek Watershed District Regulations as of July 1, 1990. Coon Creek
Watershed District and Sunrise River Watershed District do not have independent
regulations for minimum construction elevations. The acceptable minimum
elevation, sump, and drain tile are shown at Illustration No. 3, Appendix A to
Chapter 7A.
      2.   Accessory buildings which have no need for an on-site sewage
treatment system and which are constructed on a buildable area which is
separate from the Buildable Area upon which the principal structure is built,
are not required to have a sump, sump pump, or drain tiles if built at less
than the optimum elevation. The acceptable minimum elevation for accessory
buildings is two (2) feet above the high water table as measured to the top of
the lowest footing.
      3.   Applicants may seek relief from strict application of Section 7A-803
(B)(1) by filing an application for an administrative variance following the
procedures and criteria of this subsection.
         a.   Criteria. Applicants may request an administrative variance from
minimum floor elevation requirements provided that the property is zoned Rural
Residential (RR) and the proposed construction meets all the following
requirements:
            i.   The minimum elevation of new construction does not result in a
minimum elevation less than 18” above mottled soil as determined by at least
two soil borings in the immediate area of the proposed construction.
            ii.   The new construction is an addition to or expansion of an
existing residential dwelling constructed before 1990; and
            iii.   The applicant agrees to install additional drain tile, as
needed, and as approved by the City Engineer.
         b.   Review Procedures. The City Administrator and City Engineer will
review administrative variance requests and the City Administrator will make a
decision on the application. In order for an administrative variance to be
approved, the following findings must be made:
            i.   Practical difficulties exist in complying with the
requirements of Section 
7A-803(B)(1) based on circumstances unique to the property which were not
created by the applicant.
            ii.   The applicant proposes to use the property in a reasonable
manner.
            iii.   Granting the variance is in harmony with the purpose and
intent of the Zoning Ordinance and consistent with the City’s Comprehensive
Plan.
            iv.   The variance, if granted, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or City.
         c.   Denial and appeals. If the City Administrator denies the request
for an administrative variance, the City Administrator will provide a written
notice to the applicant. Any aggrieve person may file an appeal of the decision
of the City Administrator regarding an administrative variance application
following the procedures as outlined in Section
4-104 of the City Code.
      4.   Fees. Administrative variances fees are set according to the City’s
approved fee schedule.
   C.   Driveway Design Requirements. The City Council finds that it is in the
public interest to adopt uniform driveway construction specifications. These
uniform driveway specifications recognize that most sites for new construction
in the City of Columbus will have a high water table lying relatively close to
the native surface. It is the intent of the City Council to address public
safety concerns by adopting uniform driveway specifications which should allow
access to the buildable area by emergency services vehicles (police, fire,
ambulance, etc.). It is the further intent of the City Council to address
property value concerns by adopting high quality driveway specifications which
should foster construction of durable and safe driveways, thereby protecting
property values.
      1.   Driveway Required. Every buildable area shall be connected to a
public road by a driveway which meets or exceeds the requirements of this City
Code. A second buildable area on a lot, e.g., one used for construction of an
accessory building, may be connected by a driveway to either the public right-
of-way or to the first buildable area on the lot, and such driveway shall meet
or exceed the minimum specifications of this Section.
      2.   If a commercial use and residential use share a common driveway, the
driveway shall be constructed at the optimum width, not the minimum width, as
shown in Illustration No. 5, Appendix “A” of this
Chapter 7A.
      3.   Apron. Every driveway shall be connected to a public right-of-way by
an apron which meets the design requirements shown at Illustration No. 4,
Appendix “A” to this
Chapter 7A. Driveway width and the variation in elevation between the road and
the lot are factors which determine the length of the culvert which is required
under the apron. Exact culvert requirements must be obtained from the City
Public Works Department.
      4.   Buildable Area Contiguous with Front Setback. Where the buildable
area is contiguous with the front setback, the driveway shall be constructed at
a uniform grade from the elevation at the juncture with the apron to the
elevation at the front setback.
      5.   Buildable Area Not Contiguous with Front Setback. Where the
buildable area is not contiguous with the front setback, the driveway shall be
constructed to meet or exceed the minimum specifications of this Section and of
Illustration No. 5, Appendix “A” to this
Chapter 7A. If the driveway is built at less than the optimum specifications,
then the driveway shall include a “turn-around” area in front of the house or
principal structure on the lot of not less than 24 feet by 24 feet, constructed
and surfaced in the same manner as the driveway.
      6.   Subsurface Correction. The requirement to provide subsurface
correction during driveway construction (removal of unsuitable material or
placement of fabric mat) shall be determined by the City Engineer exercising
professional judgment on a case by case basis.
      7.   Surfacing. If the elevation of the native soils prior to driveway
construction is 3.0 feet or more above the high water table, and if the
composition of the soils in the driveway area is free of organic soils, then
sand or sand-unspecified gravel aggregate is required for surfacing. If the
elevation of the native soils prior to driveway construction is less than 3.0
feet above the high water table, then bituminous, concrete or 4 inches of Class
V aggregate surfacing is required.
      8.   Illustrations. The illustrations of aprons and driveways,
Illustrations Nos. 4 and 5, Appendix “A” to this
Chapter 7A, contain additional design requirements and specifications which are
incorporated herein by reference. These Illustrations and their design
requirements may be modified by City Council resolutions upon the advice of the
City Engineer.
      9.   Inspections. Driveway construction shall be monitored and inspected
by the Building Inspector. The Building Inspector shall have the discretion to
call for additional elevation measurements, soil tests, or other on-site
measurements as are necessary to ensure that driveways are constructed
according to the standards established by this City Code. In difficult
topography or soil conditions, the Building Inspector may consult directly with
the City Engineer for professional assistance.
      10.   Variation from Strict Compliance. The City Engineer may exercise
professional judgment and authorize some variation from strict compliance with
these driveway design requirements for conditions found at the site, provided
that the variations result in the construction of a driveway which meets the
spirit and intent of this Section.

SECTION 7A-805.   RESIDENTIAL ACCESSORY BUILDINGS.
Accessory buildings are permitted, subject to the following general
restrictions affecting all accessory buildings on any lot size:
   A.   All accessory buildings subject to the State Building Code shall
conform to the Building Code as contained in
Chapter 13 of this City Code. Accessory building construction shall consist of
either: pole building construction; slab construction; or footing-foundation
construction. The walls and roof of any accessory building shall be constructed
of durable building materials including wood, metal, stone, brick, or similar
material. Accessory structures shall not be constructed with fabric, plastic or
vinyl, except as provided in subsection L. below. No vehicle, trailer or
manufactured home shall be used as an accessory building.
   B.   Restrictions in this Chapter on the size and placement on the lot of
accessory buildings shall not apply on any parcel of twenty (20) acres or
larger that is classified as agricultural land for tax purposes and is used for
agriculture purposes.
   C.   All accessory buildings shall be same or similar with the dwelling in
terms of color.
   D.   Accessory buildings shall be located no closer than 75 feet from any
road easement or road right-of-way and no closer than the height of the
building or 20 feet from any side lot line, whichever is greater, or the height
of the building or 20 feet from any rear lot line, whichever is greater. The
placement of an accessory building shall meet the following additional
requirements.
      1.   Interior lot. No accessory building shall be located in the required
front yard area nor located closer to the road easement line or road right-of-
way than the front of the principal structure.
      2.   Corner lot. No accessory building shall be located in the required
front yard area nor located closer to the road easement line or road right-of-
way line than the front of the principal structure not located closer to the
road easement line or road right-of-way line, from which primary access to the
principal structure is gained, than the rear of the principal structure. The
accessory building shall be located no closer than the required front yard
setback line from the road easement line or road right-of-way line, from which
no access is gained or from which secondary access to the principal structure
is gained.
      3.   Septic System Subsurface Treatment System (SSTS) Area. No accessory
structure shall be located within a primary or alternative SSTS Area.
      4.   Garage Placement. All garages must be located within fifty (50) feet
of the principal building and must be used as defined in the City Code. Garages
will not be included in the total square footage limitations listed in
Subsection G of this Section.
   E.   Setback Exception. The setback from the front lot line (measured at the
edge of the public right-of-way) may be reduced for an accessory building upon
the review and recommendation of the Building Official and City Administrator
and based upon compliance with the following criteria:
      1.   The lot size and width are consistent with the standards in the City
Code.
      2.   Accessory buildings shall not be placed within the front yard
setback (seventy-five (75) feet from the edge of the public right-of-way).
      3.   Fencing, landscaping, or natural vegetation is present between the
street and the accessory building, and must be effectively obstructed from
views from adjacent residential properties or the right-of-way. “Effectively
obstructed” shall mean 80% opaque throughout the year. Screening must be
maintained continually and shall be replaced or repaired if destroyed or
damaged.
      4.   The placement of the accessory building complies with the minimum
well and septic requirements pursuant to
Chapter 14.
      5.   The proposed accessory building is designed to be harmonious with
the dwelling. The proposed accessory building is constructed with the exterior
building materials that are the same or similar style and color of the siding
and roofing of the dwelling.
   F.   The size of accessory buildings shall be regulated as follows:
      1.   The maximum square footage of accessory buildings on parcels of less
than one acre shall be 1,800 square feet;
      2.   The maximum square footage of accessory buildings on parcels of at
least one acre, but less than five acres, shall be 2,700 square feet for the
first acre, plus 600 square feet per acre for the remaining acreage or portion
thereof. (For example, a parcel that is 1.75 acres in size would be allowed a
maximum building floor area of 3,150 square feet based upon the following
calculation: 2,700 square feet + (600 square feet x .75) = 3,150.)
      3.   The maximum square footage of accessory buildings on parcels of at
least five acres shall be 6,800 square feet for the first five acres, plus 700
square feet per acre for the remaining acreage or portion thereof. (For
example, a parcel that is 7.5 acres in size would be allowed a maximum building
floor area of 8,550 square feet based upon the following calculation: 6,800
square feet + (700 square feet x 2.5 = 8,550.)1
   G.   All accessory buildings shall have side walls a minimum of eight (8)
feet in height and a maximum of sixteen (16) feet in height as measured from
the finished floor. For example height shall be measured from the concrete,
dirt or gravel along the base of the wall to the bottom of the roof truss.
Accessory buildings with taller sidewalls may require structural engineering
plans and specifications.
   H.   The square footage of accessory buildings is measured from the
footings, outer walls, or support posts, and includes lean-to’s, and car ports.
Gazebos, wood sheds, potting sheds, saunas, playhouses, dog houses, and similar

SECTION 7A-815.   FEEDLOT PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   A.   Findings. The City Council finds that:
      1.   The state of Minnesota requires environmental review by the
Minnesota Pollution Control Agency of feedlots having more than one thousand
(1,000) animal units or more than five hundred (500) animal units in shoreland
or floodplain areas, as provided under Minn. Rules § 4410.4300, subpart 29a and
29b, as amended;
      2.   The City’s soils are vulnerable to rapid contamination and spread of
pollutants through groundwater; the City’s dominant geographical
characteristics are wetland and open water; and the City has a relatively high
water table and is topographically level, so that there are very few large
tracts where the water table is well below the soil surface;
      3.   Public wildlife space and public waters are a dominant land use;
these uses and the wildlife they support contribute significantly to the City’s
identity and quality of life;
      4.   The City is, and will continue to be, subject to pressure to
urbanize through residential and commercial development;
      5.   Feedlots and other large-scale agriculture have historically not
been an integral part of the City’s economy;
      6.   Odor is a natural and unavoidable by-product of feedlots, which has
a potential for negative effects on the City’s residents and businesses, and
which has the potential to negatively impact the City’s plans for land use and
development;
      7.   The City is authorized to adopt land use controls to encourage and
regulate the development of property, to mitigate potentially harmful effects
on residents and businesses, to protect the public interest, and to promote the
health, safety, and welfare of the community;
      8.   Because state law treats feedlots differently from other similar
uses of land, it is appropriate and desirable to regulate the use of land by
feedlots separately from other land uses that may be sources of odor.
   B.   Feedlot Administration. The Building Inspector shall administer the
City feedlot permit program, including the following duties and powers:
      1.   Receive and forward applications for State-administered certificates
of compliance and permits together with City recommendations and City-imposed
conditions to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency;
      2.   Oversee the inspection of feedlot operations to ensure compliance
with the standards of this Ordinance;
      3.   Consult with County departments, State and Federal agencies, and
private consultants as needed to discharge these duties.
   C.   Conditional Use Permits Required.  A Conditional Use Permit shall be
required for any person owning or operating a proposed or existing animal
feedlot having ninety-nine (99) or more animal units if:
      1.   A new feedlot is proposed; or
      2.   A change in operation of an existing feedlot is proposed; a change
in operation includes:
         (a)   An increase beyond the permitted maximum number of animal units.
The total number of animal units within a feedlot shall be based upon the
animal numbers currently within the feedlot plus the animal numbers that will
be added through expansion; or
         (b)   An increase in the number of animal units which are confined at
an unpermitted feedlot; or
         (c)   A change in the construction or operation of a feedlot that
would affect the storage, handling, utilization, or disposal of animal manure;
or
      3.   Ownership of an existing feedlot changes;
         (a)   A change in title to animals, animal buildings, or land
constitutes a change in ownership; or
         (b)   Lessees operating on leased land shall be considered owners; or
      4.   A National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit
application is required under state or federal rules and regulations; or
      5.   An inspection by MPCA staff or the City determines that the Feedlot
creates or maintains a potential pollution hazard; or
      6.   A permit is required by the MPCA for land application of manure.
   D.   Permit application.  A permit application shall include the following:
      1.   Owner’s and operator’s name and address;
      2.   Proposed location of the feedlot including quarter section, range,
and city;
      3.   Animal types and maximum number of animals of each type which will
be confined at the feedlot;
      4.   A sketch clearly indicating the dimensions of the feedlot and
showing all existing homes, buildings, existing manure storage areas and/or
structures, lakes, ponds, water courses, wetlands, dry-runs, rock outcroppings,
roads, private sewer systems, and wells within one thousand five hundred
(1,500) feet of the proposed feedlot;
      5.   Descriptions of the geological conditions, soil types, groundwater
elevations, topography, and drainage pattern of the site and surrounding area;
      6.   Plans for buildings and structures as required by this Ordinance or
other County and State ordinances and regulations.
      7.   A Manure Utilization Plan including:
         (a)   Manure handling and application techniques;
         (b)   Acreage available for manure application;
         (c)   Run-off potential;
         (d)   Plans for proposed manure storage or pollution abatement
structures;
         (e)   Plans for the proper disposal of dead livestock;
      8.   Leases or agreements allowing the applicant to dispose of manure on
land other than his own.
   E.   Feedlot Acreage and Setback Requirements.
      1.   Minimum Area. A minimum area of twenty (20) acres or such greater
area required to meet all setbacks set forth by the City Code shall be required
for feedlot operations.
      2.   Additional Land. The Conditional Use Permit holder shall own or have
sufficient additional land under contract to meet the manure utilization
requirement for spreading of manure produced in his or her feedlot. The City
shall retain copies of all written agreements between the feedlot operators and
lessors or any person who permits land manure application and such agreement
shall be a condition of the Conditional Use Permit. Each parcel of land subject
to agreement shall be limited to one agreement per parcel for a term of not
less than three years.
      3.   Building, Holding Basin, Lagoon, and Manure Storage Area Setbacks.
Livestock buildings, manure holding basins, lagoons, and manure storage areas
shall be constructed, operated, and maintained so as to minimize the aesthetic,
health, and odor concerns associated with neighboring properties and land uses.
The following setbacks shall apply:
         (a)   Property Lines
            (i)   Rear yard – 100 feet
            (ii)   Side yard – 100 feet
            (iii)   Front yard – 100 feet
         (b)   Neighboring Properties
            (i)   Residence – 1,200 feet. The modifications and/or expansion of
existing animal feedlots located within 1,200 feet of an existing dwelling unit
shall be allowed if they do not further encroach on the established setback or
if a variance for the modification and/or expansion is applied for and
approved.
         No permits for a new dwelling unit shall be issued within 1,200 feet
of an existing permitted animal feedlot unless the deed for the property
clearly states and the owner of the property is informed via Certified Mail
that the animal feedlot was in existence prior to the residential property and
may continue to operate in accordance with the terms of this Ordinance.
         No permits shall be issued for the construction and/or creation of a
new feedlot that is located within 1,200 feet of an existing dwelling other

            (vii)   Cemetery: 1,200 feet
            (viii)   Minimum standards: The standards set above are minimum
standards that may be increased by the City Council during the permit issuance
process due to concerns or circumstances in a specific Conditional Use Permit
application.
      4.   Wetland Setback. No new feedlot shall be permitted within two
hundred (200) feet of a wetland as defined in Minnesota Rules Chapter
6120.2500.
      5.   Well Head Protection Areas. Feedlot and manure management practices
may be further regulated within Well Head Protection Zones if such zones are

Applications to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency for application of
manure on land in the City of Columbus or from feedlots in the City of
Columbus, shall be submitted to the City Building Inspector. The City Building
Inspector shall forward the application and comments to the MPCA. The following
additional local regulations on land application of manure shall apply:
      1.   Soil Loss in Shoreland Areas. Land application of manure shall not
be allowed on soils within shoreland that exceed allowable soil loss as set by
the National Resource Conservation Service of the USDA (NRCS) unless a
conservation plan that will reduce soil loss to the allowable level is
developed and is showing progress towards implementation within one (1) year of
issuance of a Conditional Use Permit.
      2.   Slopes In Shoreland Areas. During the period of December 1 to March
31, manure shall not be applied to soils with a slope of greater than twelve
(12) percent that are within three hundred (300) feet of a protected water.
      3.   Right-of-Way. Manure shall not be applied to the right-of-way of
public roads.
      4.   Lakes. If no potential pollution hazard exists, a minimum distance

SECTION 7A-816.   PERFORMANCE STANDARDS FOR THE LOCATION, CONSTRUCTION AND USE
OF COMMUNICATIONS TOWERS AND ANTENNA.
   A.   Purpose. In order to accommodate the communication needs of residents
and business while protecting the public health, safety, and general welfare of
the community, the City Council finds that these regulations are necessary in
order to:
      1.   Facilitate the provision of wireless telecommunication services to
the residents and businesses of the City;
      2.   Minimize adverse visual effects of towers through careful design and
siting standards;
      3.   Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure
through structural standards and setback requirements; and
      4.   Maximize the use of existing and approved towers and buildings to
accommodate new wireless telecommunication antennae in order to reduce the
number of towers needed to serve the community.
   B.   Interim Use Permit Required. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm,
or corporation to erect, construct in place, place or re-erect, or replace any
tower without first making application to the City and securing an interim use
permit therefore as hereinafter provided. The applicant shall provide at the
time of application sufficient information to indicate that construction,
installation, and maintenance of the antenna and tower will not create a safety
hazard or damage to the property of other persons. Routine maintenance of
towers and related structures shall not require the issuance of an interim use
permit.
   C.   Co-Location Requirements. All commercial wireless telecommunication
towers erected, constructed, or located within the City shall comply with the
following requirements:
      1.   A proposal for a new commercial wireless telecommunication service
tower shall not be approved unless it can be documented by the applicant that
the telecommunications equipment planned for the proposed tower cannot be
accommodated on an existing or approved tower or building within a one-half (1/
2) mile search radius of the proposed tower due to one or more of the following
reasons:
         (a)   The planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity of
the existing or approved tower or building, as documented by a qualified
professional engineer licensed by the state of Minnesota, and the existing or
approved tower cannot be reinforced, modified, or replaced to accommodate
planned or equivalent equipment at cost less than one hundred twenty-five
percent (125%) of the cost of a new tower.
         (b)   The planned equipment would cause interference materially
impacting the usability of other existing or planned equipment at the tower or
building as documented by a qualified electrical engineer licensed by the state
of Minnesota and the interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost.
         (c)   Existing or approved towers and buildings within the search
radius cannot accommodate the planned equipment at a height necessary to
function reasonably as documented by a qualified professional engineer licensed
by the state of Minnesota.
         (d)   Other reasons affecting technical performance, system coverage,
and system capacity which make it impractical to place or locate the planned
telecommunications equipment upon an existing or approved tower or building as
determined by the City Council during its review of an application for approval
of an interim use permit.
      2.   Any proposed commercial wireless telecommunication service tower
shall be designed, structurally, electrically, and in all respects, to
accommodate both the applicant’s antennae and comparable antennae for at least
one additional user. Towers must be designed to allow for future rearrangement
of antennae upon the tower and to accept antennae mounted at varying heights.
   D.   Tower and Antenna Design Requirements. Proposed or modified towers and
antennae shall meet the following design requirements:
      1.   Towers and antennae shall be designed to blend into the surrounding
environment to the maximum extent possible through the use of color and
camouflaging architectural treatment, except in instances where the color is
dictated by federal or state authorities such as the Federal Aviation
Administration.
      2.   Commercial wireless telecommunication service towers shall be of a
monopole design unless determined that an alternative design would better blend
into the surrounding environment.
   E.   Tower Setbacks. Towers shall conform with each of the following minimum
setback requirements:
      1.   At a minimum, towers shall meet the setbacks of the underlying
zoning district provided the setback is consistent with the requirements in
subsection 3(b) below.
      2.   Towers shall be set back from any property line a minimum distance
equal to the height of the tower, except that, upon certification of a
professional engineer licensed by the state of Minnesota, the setback may be
reduced to the height of the portion of the structure that will remain standing
after an event of high winds or similar event because the tower is designed to
collapse, fold on itself or curl in such event.
[§ 7A-817E 1-2, formerly § 7A-834, Paragraph 5(a) and (b), amended by Ord. No.
97-4, effective Aug. 29, 1997.]
      3.   Towers shall not be located between a principal structure and a
public street, with the following exceptions:
         (a.)   In industrial zoning districts, towers may be placed within a
side yard abutting an internal industrial street.
         (b.)   On sites adjacent to public streets on all sides, towers may be
placed within a side yard abutting a local street.
      4.   A tower’s setback may be reduced or its location in relation to a
public street varied, at the sole discretion of the City Council, to allow the
integration of a tower into an existing or proposed structure such as a church
steeple, light standard, power line support device, or similar structure.
   F.   Tower Height. The maximum height of towers shall not exceed one hundred
seventy-five (175) feet in height. Antennae attached to towers may project
above the maximum tower height a maximum of ten (10) feet.
   G.   Tower Lighting. Towers shall not be illuminated by artificial means and
shall not display strobe lights unless such lighting is specifically required
by the Federal Aviation Administration or other federal or state authority for
a particular tower. Notwithstanding this provision, the City Council may, in
its sole discretion, approve the placement of an antenna on existing or
proposed lighting provided that the antenna is integrated with such lighting in
a manner which substantially camouflages the antenna array and related
facilities.
   H.   Signs and Advertising. The use of any portion of a tower for signs
other than warning or equipment information signs is prohibited.
   I.   Accessory Utility Buildings. All utility buildings and structures
accessory to a tower shall be architecturally designed to blend in with the
surrounding environment and shall meet the minimum setback requirements of the
underlying zoning district. Ground mounted equipment shall be screened from
view by suitable vegetation, except where a design of non-vegetative screening
better reflects and complements the architectural character of the surrounding
neighborhood. Accessory buildings shall not be more than two thousand (2,000)
square feet in size.
   J.   Abandoned or Unused Towers or Portions of Towers. Abandoned or unused
towers or portions of towers shall be removed as follows:
      1.   All abandoned or unused towers and associated facilities shall be
removed within twelve (12) months of the cessation of operations at the site
unless a time extension is approved by the City Council. A copy of the relevant
portions of a signed lease which requires the applicant to remove the tower and
associated facilities upon cessation of operations at the site shall be
submitted at the time of application. In the event that a tower is not removed
within twelve (12) months of the cessation of operations at a site, the tower
and associated facilities may be removed by the City and the costs of removal
assessed against the property.
      2.   Unused portions of towers above a manufactured connection shall be
removed within six (6) months of the time of antenna relocation.
   K.   Antennae Mounted on Roofs, Walls, and Existing Towers. The placement of
wireless telecommunication antennae on roofs, walls, and existing towers shall
be approved by issuance of an interim use permit in the same manner as approval
of new towers.
   L.   Interference with Telecommunications. No new or existing
telecommunications service shall interfere with public safety
telecommunications, or private telecommunications, including without
limitation, radio, television, and personal communications, in accordance with
rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission.
   M.   Additional Submittal Requirements. In addition to the information
required elsewhere in this Code, development applications for towers and
antennae shall include the following supplemental information:
      1.    A report from a qualified professional engineer licensed by the
State of Minnesota which (a) describes the tower and antennae height and design
including a cross section and elevation; (b) documents the height above grade
for all potential mounting positions for co-located antennae and the minimum
separation distances between antennae; (c) describes the tower’s capacity,
including the number and type of antennae that it can accommodate; and (d)
includes an engineer’s stamp and registration number.
      2.   For all commercial wireless telecommunication service towers, a
letter of intent committing the tower owner and his or her successors to allow
the shared use of the tower if an additional user agrees in writing to meet
reasonable terms and conditions for shared use, including without limitation,
reasonable rental rates for such shared use.
      3.   Before the issuance of a building permit, the following supplemental
information shall be submitted: (a) a written statement from the applicant that
the proposed tower and antenna comply with regulations administered by Federal
Aviation Administration.
      4.   A written statement from a qualified electrical engineer licensed by
the State of Minnesota stating that use of the proposed tower and antenna will
not interfere with established telecommunications.

January 1, 1996, which do not conform to or comply with this Section are
subject to the following provisions:
      1.   Towers may continue in use for the purpose now used and as now
existing but may not be replaced or structurally altered without complying in
all respects with this Section.
      2.   If such towers are hereafter damaged or destroyed due to any reason
or cause whatsoever, the tower may be repaired and restored to its former use,
location, and physical dimensions upon obtaining a building permit therefore,
but without otherwise complying with this Section; however, if the cost of
repairing the tower to the former use, physical dimensions, and location would
be fifty (50) percent or more of the cost of a new tower of like kind and
quality, then the tower may not be repaired or restored except in full
compliance with this section.
   P.   Lights and Other Attachments. No antenna or tower adjacent to any
residential zoning district shall have affixed or attached to it in any way
except during time of repair or installation any lights, reflectors, flashers,

association documents, if applicable. Such documents shall include provisions
governing the maintenance of common areas, including, if applicable, private
streets.
         c.   When necessary, the application shall be accompanied by a
Preliminary Plat of the proposed development, consistent with the application
requirements of the Subdivision Regulations (
Chapter 8, Columbus City Code).
         d.   The application shall be presented at a City staff meeting to
review preliminary PUD eligibility and consistency with City Code requirements
and provide comments to the application.
         e.   The PUD application and Preliminary Plat shall be reviewed
concurrently at a City Planning Commission hearing, consistent with the
procedures for a review of a conditional use permit.
         f.   If the PUD is approved by the City Council, the City shall issue
a conditional use permit to the applicant, including conditions of approval,
and record it with the Anoka County Recorder.
         g.   When a plat is required, after approval of a Preliminary Plat and
PUD, application shall be made for a Final Plat, consistent with the PUD,
Preliminary Plat, and documentation required in the Subdivision Regulations.
         h.   Review and approval of the Final Plat does not require review and
recommendation by the Planning Commission, unless the Final Plat is not
consistent with the approved PUD and Preliminary Plat.
   B.   General PUD Standards. The following will apply to all PUD
applications:
      1.   Uses. The uses allowed in a PUD in the Mixed Use Medium Density (MU-
M) District, Mixed Use High Density (MU-H) District, Community (CC) District,

[Chapter 7A, Article IX, Section 7A-900 amended by Ord. No. 09-03, effective
March 5, 2009.]
SECTION 7A-901.   PURPOSE.
The City Council finds it necessary to provide for the regulation of businesses
or commercial enterprises which operate as massage parlors, saunas, rap
parlors, conversation parlors, adult sensitivity groups, adult encounter
groups, escort services, dancing services, hostess services, and similar adult
uses operating under different names in order to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare, and to guard against the inception and transmission of
disease. The City Council further finds that commercial enterprises such as the
type described above, and all other similar establishments whose services
include sessions offered to adults, conducted in private by members of the same
or the opposite sex, and employing personnel with no specialized training, are
susceptible to operating in a manner contravening, subverting, or endangering
the morals of the community by being sites of acts of prostitution, illicit
sex, and occurrences of violent crimes, thus requiring close inspection,
licensing and regulation.
   The City Council finds that control and regulation of commercial enterprises
of these types, in view of the abuses often perpetrated, require intensive
police and public health efforts by the City and local governmental units
contracting with the City to provide such services. As a consequent, the
concentrated use of such services in such control detracts from and reduces the
level of services available to the rest of the community and thereby diminishes
the ability of the City to promote the general health, welfare, morals, and
safety of the community. The City Council finds that the regulations of this
Ordinance will protect property values, eliminate or reduce blight, prevent
deterioration of neighborhoods, prevent the exodus of residents and businesses
from City neighborhoods, and prevent the increase of crime and juvenile
delinquency.
[§ 7A-901 amended by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007.]
SECTION 7A-902.   ADULT USES.
   A.   Purpose. The nature of adult uses is such that they are recognized as
having adverse secondary characteristics, particularly when they are accessible
to minors and located near residential property or related residential uses
such as schools, day care centers, libraries or parks. Furthermore, the nature
of adult uses requires that they not be allowed within certain zoning
districts, or within minimum distances from each other or residential uses.
Special regulation of adult uses is necessary to ensure that the adverse
secondary effects do not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the
surrounding property and lessening of its value.
   B.   General. Adult uses as defined in this Chapter shall be subject to the
following general provisions:
      1.   Adult uses, either principal or accessory, shall be prohibited from
locating in any building which is also utilized for residential purposes.
      2.   Adult uses, either principal or accessory, shall be prohibited from
locating in any place which is also used to dispense or consume alcoholic
beverages.
      3.   An adult use which does not qualify as an accessory use pursuant to
subsection C of this Ordinance, shall be classified as an adult use -
principal.
SECTION 7A-903.   ADULT USES - PRINCIPAL.
   A.   Adult use-principal shall be located at least 1,000 feet, as measured
in a straight line from the closest point of the property line of the building
upon which the adult use-principal is located, from the property line of:

Permit in Commercial/Industrial as specified in the Comprehensive Plan and
implemented by the City Zoning Ordinance.
   C.   Adult use-principal activities, as defined by this Ordinance, shall be
classified as one use. No two adult uses-principal shall be located in the same
building or upon the same property and each use shall be subject to this
Section.
   D.   Adult use-principal shall adhere to the following signing regulations.
      1.   Sign messages shall be generic, not graphic in nature and shall only
identify the type of business which is being conducted.
      2.   Sign messages shall not contain material classified as advertising.
      3.   Signs shall comply with the requirements of size and number for the
district in which they are located.
   E.   Adult use-principal shall be limited to 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. for its
hours of operation. A differing time schedule may be approved by the City
Council if it can be satisfactorily demonstrated by the operator to the City
that extended operational hours:
      1.   Will not adversely impact or affect uses or activities within 1,000
feet.
      2.   Will not result in increased policing and related service calls.
      3.   Are critical to the operation of the business.
[§ 7A-903 amended by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007.]
SECTION 7A-904.   ADULT USES - ACCESSORY.

establishment in which it is located.

business operation.
      3.   Not involve or include any activity except the sale or rental of
merchandise.
   B.   Adult use-accessory shall be located at least 1,000 feet, as measured
in a straight line from the closest point of the property line of the building
upon which the adult use-principal is located, from the property line of:

with the intent of this Section, subject to the approval of the City Council.

SECTION 7A-905.   VIOLATION.
The City may enforce any provision of this Ordinance by mandamus, injunction or
any other appropriate civil remedy in any court of competent jurisdiction.

original applications for a Zoning Permit and a Building Permit.
LIMITED EXCEPTIONS TO THE GENERAL RULE: For Building Permits for additions,
accessory buildings, swimming pools, decks, patios, and similar secondary
construction, on property where there is an existing building, dwelling or
principal structure, some or all of the survey requirements may be waived by
the joint action of the Zoning Administrator and the Building Inspector, if, in
their judgment, it can be ascertained by reference to date already on file with
the City and/or by a inspection of the property that the proposed construction
will comply with the elevation requirements, construction requirements, site
plan requirements, individual sewage treatment system requirements, and setback
requirements of this City Code.
The survey must contain complete depictions, descriptions, and data for all of
the following items.
      1.   The record legal description of the Lot.
      2.   The acreage of the Lot and the acreage of any public road
transversing it.

recorded or unrecorded (pipeline easement, electric transmission easement,
private driveway easement, etc.).
      4.   The Lot’s frontage on a public road.
      5.   The exact size, area, location and elevation of the Buildable Area
(s) and Driveway(s), with sufficient supporting data and cross-section drawings
to show the elevation relationships of the Buildable Area(s) and Driveway(s),
the footings and lowest floor to the High Water Table and to the 100-Year Flood
Plain (as those terms are defined in the City Code). (NOTE: See the note below
regarding elevation markers.)
      6.   The setback lines described in the City Code.
      7.   The exact size and location of existing Buildings on the Lot, if
any.

elevation requirements of this Code have been met. It is advisable for the
surveyor to place durable markers, e.g., 6 feet or 8 feet of steel fence posts,
with finish elevations market on each post, at each corner of the Buildable
Areas(s), at two opposite corners or ends of the drain field area(s), and at
least one post adjacent to each segment of the Driveway(s). If the elevation
markings are not present upon the completion of construction, either the
Building Inspector or the Zoning Administrator shall have the authority to
require an additional survey to verify that the construction elevation
requirements of this Code have been met. (From Code Section

ARTICLE I
TITLE AND PURPOSE
SECTION 7B-100.   TITLE.
This Chapter of the Columbus City Code shall be known and may be cited as the
“Sign Ordinance” of the City of Columbus, Minnesota, and as referred to herein
as “this Ordinance.” The Sign Ordinance regulates the type, number, size,
structure, height, lighting, erection, repair, location and maintenance of all
outdoor signs within the City of Columbus; provides for the issuance of
permits; and provides penalties for noncompliance and violation thereof.
[§ 7B-100, formerly § 10-100, amended by Ord No. 89-1, effective July 21, 1989,
and amended by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007, and amended by Ord. No.
10-06, effective May 6, 2010.]
SECTION 7B-101.   PURPOSE.
It is the purpose of this Ordinance to protect the public health, safety, and
welfare through the establishment of comprehensive and balanced regulations for
signage in the City of Columbus. The City Council finds that unregulated
signage may be detrimental to community aesthetics and public safety. The City
Council finds that sign sizes, heights, and lighting have different aesthetic
impacts within different zoning districts, such as residential districts and
business districts, and that varying sign standards, based upon development
density and highway traffic capacity, are appropriate to protect the public
health, safety, and welfare. In establishing these sign regulations, the City
Council makes the following additional findings to support the purpose of these
regulations:
   A.   General advertising signs are necessary to allow for business identity
and promotion and to allow consumers to locate and access businesses in the
City.
   B.   Public information signage and traffic signage is necessary to promote
public health, safety and welfare.
   C.   There is a need to balance the purpose of adequate advertising
opportunities with proper design controls and uniform standards that promote
aesthetic quality in the City, prevent public nuisance, and promote public
safety.
   D.   The Minnesota Department of Transportation has technical memoranda
identifying the distracting characteristics of flashing signs and dynamic
signs, which may have impact on vehicular safety.
   E.   The City Council believes that sign dimensions and controlling the
frequency of changes in dynamic sign messages correlates to the aesthetic
impact of such signs, particularly on county and local roadways, in residential
districts, and in business districts with higher standards for design and
architectural controls.
   F.   Uniform sign standards are appropriate in each zoning district to
create fair and equitable advertising opportunities for all businesses, to
protect property investments and to promote pedestrian and motorist welfare and
safety.
   G.   The varying land uses and development densities in different zoning
districts, in addition to different highway functions and capacities, suggest
that the magnitude and intensity of signs may have greater impact in one zoning
district than another.
   H.   Sign standards that are more restrictive in residential districts and
commercial districts with high site design and architectural standards are in
the public interest in order to minimize aesthetic impacts and public nuisance
and to protect private property investment.
   I.   Standards for the illumination of signs that are more restrictive in
residential districts and commercial districts with high site design and
architectural standards are in the public interest in order to minimize
aesthetic impacts and public nuisance and, to protect private property
investment.

outermost dimensions of the entire structure or the total area within a polygon
surrounding an irregular shaped sign.
   W.   Sign height is the distance between the average ground elevation within
30 feet of the sign and highest point of the sign structure.
Wall sign area is measured from the outermost dimensions of the sign frame or
the area within a polygon surrounding the message of individual lettering and/
or logos and emblems attached to a wall. Wall signs may be attached to door or
window awnings and shall be included in the maximum aggregate total sign area

minimum of 5 feet from the property line oriented toward the interstate highway
and 20 feet from the side yard property lines and be designated such that in
the event of a column failure the breakaway point causes the sign to fall on
vacant property and not cause harm or damage to human health or private/public
property. Illuminated signs and Dynamic signs are permitted.

   F.   Wall Signs on Accessory Buildings. Signage on accessory structures
shall be limited to wall signs providing identification or directional
information, such as “Tack Room,” “Veterinarian,” or “Racing Officials.” Such
signage shall not exceed 20 square feet in area or lettering exceeding 12
inches in height.
   G.   Directional and Public Information Signs. Small, freestanding signs
providing directional and other public information, such as “Horse Racers

         d.   Signs bearing the City’s name should be oval in shape, with black
lettering matching that of the new TH97 bridge with a tan/sandstone backdrop
visible from traffic on Interstate 35.
   F.   Interim Use Permit. Large off-premises signs shall only be erected or
maintained upon approval of an Interim Use Permit. Interim Use Permits granted
by this section shall be temporary in nature. Interim Use Permits for static
large off-premises signs shall be valid for a period of ten (10) years, but not
later than December 31, 2031, or until any governmental agency with authority
for construction of public roadways requires the underlying property for
roadway purposes. Interim Use Permits for dynamic large off-premises signs
shall be valid for a period of no more than twenty (20) years. Interim Use
Permits shall be granted to a designated person or entity, and are not
transferable to other persons or entities. An Interim Use Permit will terminate
upon: (1) a violation of the conditions or terms of the permit; (2) a change in
the zoning regulations that render the use nonconforming; (3) subdivision of
the property; or (4) establishment of any use other than a single-family
residence or agricultural use on the property after the effective date of this
ordinance. Upon termination of an off-premises sign Interim Use Permit, the
owner of the sign structure shall remove the structure and provide written
notice to the City Administrator of such removal within sixty (60) days of the
termination of the Interim Use Permit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
Interim Use Permit which was granted prior to the effective date of this
ordinance shall be allowed to continue under same conditions of approval until
its current Interim Use Permit term expires or until there is a violation of
the conditions of the permit, whichever occurs first.
      1.   Interim Use Permit Applications.  Applications for large off-
premises sign Interim Use Permits shall be filed with the City Administrator,
together with a filing fee established by City Council. The application shall
be forwarded to the Planning Commission for a public hearing. The Planning
Commission shall consult with and consider the recommendations of the City
Administrator, City Planner, City Engineer, and City Building Official in its
deliberations and recommendations to the City Council for the Interim Use
Permit. The procedure and requirements for the application and public hearing
for an Interim Use Permit are described in Sections 7A-530 and 7A-531 of the
Columbus City Code. The City Council shall consider the recommendations of the
Planning Commission and City Administrator, City Planner, City Engineer, and
City Building Official in its action on the Interim Use Permit application.
      2.   Interim Use Permit Renewal. Upon the expiration of the initial term
of an approved Interim Use Permit, an applicant may re-apply for renewal of an
Interim Use Permit for a large off-premises sign in the same manner as an
initial application. Prior granting of an Interim Use Permit does not give an
applicant any vested right to renewal. Interim Use Permits shall conform to
restrictions or conditions as the City Council may determine are necessary to
avoid conflict with surrounding land usage.
      3.   Dynamic sign conversion of existing Interim Use Permits for large
off-premises signs. Applicants with an existing Interim Use Permit for a large
off-premises sign may apply for an amendment to allow a dynamic sign.
Applications for amendments to an existing Interim Use Permit are made in the
same manner as an initial application under this Section. In considering the
application to amend the existing Interim Use Permit, the Planning Commission
and City Council shall consult with and consider the recommendations of the
City Administrator, City Planner, City Engineer and City Building Official.
Interim Use Permits shall conform to restrictions or conditions as the City
Council may determine are necessary, including the term of the amended Interim
Use Permit, to avoid conflict with surrounding land usage.
      4.   Dynamic sign conversion of existing legally nonconforming
Conditional Use Permits for large off-premises signs. Applicants with an
existing legally nonconforming Conditional Use Permit for a large off-premises
sign may apply for a dynamic off-premises sign by terminating the existing
nonconforming Conditional Use Permit and applying for an Interim Use Permit for
the dynamic off-premises sign. Applications for the Interim Use Permit are made
in the same manner as an application under this Section. In considering the
application to issue an Interim Use Permit, the Planning Commission and City
Council shall consult with and consider the recommendations of the City
Administrator, City Planner, City Engineer and City Building Official. Interim
Use Permits shall conform to restrictions or conditions as the City Council may
determine are necessary, including the term of the Interim Use Permit, to avoid
conflict with surrounding land usage.
   G.   Public Service Messages. In all new or amended Interim Use Permits for
dynamic large off-premises signs, the applicant shall be required to provide a
minimum number of public messaging opportunities, such as “Amber Alerts,”
traffic and weather advisories, community events, and similar public messages.
The number and sequencing of public messaging shall be comparable to the
average number and sequencing of public messaging opportunities on dynamic
large off-premises signs throughout the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area, or as
agreed upon by the City Council and applicant in the conditions of the Interim
Use Permit.
   H.   Findings. The City Council shall make the following findings when
issuing an Interim Use Permit for a large off-premises sign:
      a.   The structure and sign conform to the regulations of this Section
and other applicable provisions of the Columbus City Code;
      b.   The date or event that will terminate the use can be identified with
certainty;
      c.   Permission of the use will not impose additional costs on the public
if it is necessary for the public to take the property in the future; and
      d.   That the user agrees to any conditions that the City Council deems
appropriate for permission of the use.

SECTION 7B-401.   NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
   A.   Nonconforming Signs. Signs legally existing on the effective date of
this Ordinance which do not conform to the regulations set forth herein are
legal nonconforming signs. Legal nonconforming signs may not be expanded but
may be continued through repair, maintenance, restoration, or replacement,
unless:
      1.   the sign is discontinued for a period of more than one year
(discontinued shall mean the use or business associated with the sign has been
discontinued for a period of more than one year); or
      2.   the sign is destroyed by fire, neglect, or other peril to the extent
of greater than 50% of its market value, and no building permit has been
applied for within 180 days of when the sign was damaged.
   B.   Immediate Removal of Hazardous Signs. The City Council shall order the
removal of any sign found to be hazardous for any reason or found to be
hazardous because it is a "Hazardous Sign in a Right-of-Way." The City Council
shall send an Order to Remove Sign to the record owner of the subject real
property (if the sign is not on public property) and to the apparent owner and
to the advertiser shown on the sign. The Order shall direct removal of the sign
and its support structure within thirty (30) days of the date of mailing. The
Order shall disclose the potential criminal penalties and the costs that may be
imposed if it is necessary for the City to remove the Sign. No Sign shall be
deemed to be legally nonconforming because it is presently defined as hazardous
and was not defined hazardous under prior law, Ordinance, or regulation.

This Chapter may be cited as the “Wetlands Zoning Ordinance for the City of
Columbus.”
[§ 7C-100 amended by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007.]
SECTION 7C-101.   PURPOSE.
This Chapter regulates all filling, draining, burning, excavation, and
development within wetlands as the same are defined herein. The purposes of
this Chapter are:
   A.   To regulate wetlands in the City of Columbus pursuant to the Minnesota
Wetlands Conservation Act of 1991, (1991 Minn. Sess. Law Serv. {'{'}West{'}'},
Chapter 354, as amended by 1993 Minn. Sess. Law Serv. {'{'}West{'}'}, Chapter
175, and as amended by 1994 Minn. Sess. Law Serv. {'{'}West{'}'}, Chapter 627,
and as regulated by Board of Water and Soil Resources Wetland Conservation Act
Rules, Minn. Rules, Chapter 8420, current through July 19, 1993, hereinafter
collectively referred to as the “Act.”)(codified as Minn. Stat. §§ 84.085,
103A.201, 103B.155, 103B.231, 103B.311, 103E.701, 103F.161, 103F.515, 103F.516,
103G.005, 103G.141, 103G.221 through 103G.2373 inclusive, 103G.271, 272.02,
273.11, 282.018, 446A.12, and 645.44); and,
   B.   To preserve wetlands in a natural state, provide retention and
sedimentation control areas for surface water; to regulate the use of adjacent
areas to protect their natural function; to prevent or minimize soil erosion,
sedimentation or eutrophication; to prevent loss of aquatic organisms, wildlife
and vegetation; to protect surface and ground water supplies from the danger of
drought, pollution or mismanagement; to secure safety from local flooding; to
reduce the financial burdens associated with occupancy or use of areas subject
to periodic flooding; to enhance and preserve water quality and natural
drainageways as opposed to underground conveyance systems.
[§ 7C-101 amended by Ord. No. 94-1, effective September 9, 1994, amended by
Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007.]
ARTICLE II
GENERAL PROVISIONS
SECTION 7C-200.   JURISDICTION.
Pursuant to the Act:
   A.   The City has designated the Board of the Coon Creek Watershed District
as the Local Governmental Unit (“LGU”) (as that term is defined in the Act) for
all portions of the City lying within the Coon Creek Watershed;
   B.   The City has designated the Board of the Rice Creek Watershed District
as the LGU for all portions of the City lying within the Rice Creek Watershed
District; and,
   C.   The City has designated itself as the LGU for all other portions of the
City.
Jurisdiction for administration and enforcement of the Act shall lie
respectively with each of the three above-designated LGUs.
[§ 7C-200 amended by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007.]
SECTION 7C-201.   SUPERSEDING AFFECT.
Where this Chapter is in conflict with any other provision of this City Code,
this Chapter shall supersede. Where the Act is in conflict with other state
laws, the Act shall be deemed to supersede. These provisions are intended to
allow the respective LGUs sufficient time to investigate, identify, evaluate,
and delineate wetlands in any proposed development. Given that snow cover or
other natural conditions may impede the investigation, identification,
evaluation, and delineation of wetlands, these provisions shall be interpreted
to grant a reasonable extension of time to developers, to the LGUs, and to the
City from statutory or ordinance time limits for development approvals,
including, but not limited to, extending the time periods for approval of
subdivisions or other development applications. In no case shall these
provisions be deemed to extend any statutory or ordinance time limits more than
60 days beyond the disappearance of snow cover or beyond the removal of other
natural conditions which may impede the investigation, identification,
evaluation, and delineation of Wetlands.
[§ 7C-201 amended by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007.]
SECTION 7C-202.   DEFINITIONS.
All definitions shall be determined by reference to the Act, to state
regulations adopted pursuant to the Act, or to this City Code, and, otherwise,
words and phrases shall have the meaning customarily assigned to them as a
matter of general usage. All “Wetlands” shall be defined, investigated,
identified, evaluated, and delineated in accordance with the provisions of the
Act and any state regulations promulgated thereunder.
[§ 7C-202 amended by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007.]
ARTICLE III
WETLANDS ZONE
SECTION 7C-300.   WETLANDS ZONE DEFINED.
All Wetlands in the City of Columbus described and identified as Types 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 in “Wetlands of the United States,” U.S. Dept. of the Interior
Fish and Wildlife Circular No. 39, 1971 Edition, or described and identified
pursuant to “Classification of Wetlands and Deepwater Habitats of the United
States,” (FWS/OBS - 79/31, December, 1979, by Cowardin, et. al.) as shown on
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services National Wetlands Inventory Map of 1991,
are hereby designated as the Wetlands Zone. Because the Act defines Wetlands in
a manner which focuses on predominant hydric soils and prevalent hydrophytic
vegetation, the Act may go beyond the federal definitions shown above, and
therefore the Wetlands Zone definitions of this Section are the minimum
definitions of Wetlands for the City of Columbus and are not intended to be the
exclusive definitions or delineations of the Wetlands Zone. The Wetlands Zone
shall be increased and augmented with data specifically derived from the
investigation, identification, evaluation, and delineation of Wetlands on any
land for which development is proposed.
[§ 7C-300 amended by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007.]
SECTION 7C-301.   WETLANDS ZONE MAP.
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services National Wetlands Inventory Map of 1991 is
hereby designated as the Official Wetlands Zone Map for the City of Columbus.
The Wetlands Zone shall overlay all established zoning districts so that any
parcel of land lying in a Wetlands Zone shall also lie in one or more of the
established zoning districts. Lands lying within a Wetlands Zone shall be
subject to the requirements established by other applicable ordinances and
regulations of the City. Within each Wetlands Zone, all uses shall be permitted
in accordance with the regulations for the underlying zoning district, provided
that such uses must also satisfy the additional requirements of this ordinance.
[§ 7C-301 amended by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007.]
SECTION 7C-302.   WETLANDS ZONE BOUNDARY DETERMINATIONS.
If not established by a current survey, the boundaries of a Wetlands Zone shall
be determined by reference to the Act, using the interpretive rules of
Chapter 7A, §
7A-640.
SECTION 7C-303.   POSTING AND PUBLICATION OF THE OFFICIAL WETLANDS ZONE MAP.
    A good copy of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services National Wetlands
Inventory Map of 1991 (all sheets showing lands in the City of Columbus),
properly marked and certified as the Official Wetlands Zone Map, shall be
posted in the City Hall Meeting Room adjacent to the Official Zoning Map. The
Official Wetlands Zone Map shall be identified by certification and bear the
seal of the City under the following words, “This is to certify that this is
the Official Wetlands Zone Map referred to in Article III of
Chapter 7C of the City Code (Wetlands Zoning Regulations) of the City of
Columbus, State of Minnesota”, together with the date of adoption of this
Chapter. Certification should be by the signature of the Chairman of the City
Council and Council members and attested by the City Clerk. Two duplicate
originals of the Official Wetlands Zone Map shall be maintained, each bearing
an original certification and original signatures. The first original shall be
marked “ORIGINAL” and shall be posted at all times in the main meeting room of
the City Hall. The second original shall be marked “DUPLICATE ORIGINAL” and
shall be kept safe by the City Clerk with the originals of City Ordinances. The
Duplicate Original may be removed from the records by the Clerk for the purpose
of making certified copies or other official purpose. The City Clerk shall mark
the Wetlands Zone Map with an additional legend reading, “The Wetlands Zone is
an overlay zone. Any parcel of land lying in a Wetlands Zone also has an
underlying zoning classification which shall be determined by reference to the
Official Zoning Map and by reference to
Chapter 7A of the Columbus City Code.”
   Since the Official Wetlands Zone Map, all panels taken together, measures
approximately three (3.0) feet by six (6.0) feet and each square inch of the
map is filled with minute details, the map is therefore too large for
reprinting in its original size and too detailed to be meaningfully reduced for
reprinting in official newspaper publications of this Chapter, the City Clerk
is hereby authorized to publish and distribute original sized copies of the
Wetlands Zone Map and distribute them to the public. The Clerk is authorized to
collect a reasonable charge for the cost of each map reproduction to reimburse
the City for the printing costs. The Clerk shall post copies of the map and the
ordinance at such other public places that are customarily used for public
postings.
   The provisions of SECTION 7A-620., MAINTENANCE OF THE OFFICIAL ZONING MAP,
the provision of SECTION 7A-630., LOCATION OF OFFICIAL ZONING MAP, and the
provisions of SECTION 7A-631., PRODUCTION OF REVISIONS TO OFFICIAL ZONING MAP
AND PRESERVATION OF OUTDATED MAPS, shall all be deemed to include reference to
and shall be fully applicable to the Official Wetlands Zone Map.
[§ 7C-303 amended by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007.]
ARTICLE IV
DEVELOPMENT OF WETLANDS RESTRICTED
SECTION 7C-400.   GENERAL RESTRICTION.
No burning, filling, draining, excavation or development shall take place in a
Wetlands Zone unless permitted by the Act and this Chapter. A permit issued
pursuant to the Act and this Chapter shall not relieve the permittee of the
responsibility of complying with all other laws and ordinances.
SECTION 7C-401.   SETBACKS.
All structures, land disturbing activities, and improvements shall be set back
from the Wetlands Zone not less than one rod (16.5 feet). In accordance with §
7D-709 of this City Code, a protective buffer strip of undisturbed soil and
natural vegetation at least one rod (16.5 feet) in width shall surround all
wetlands.
[Section 7C-401 amended by Ord. No. 94-5, effective January 12, 1996, amended
by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007, amended by Ord. No. 14-02,
effective May 1, 2014.]
SECTION 7C-402.   NONCONFORMITIES.
Nonconforming lots, uses, structures or combinations thereof shall be
adjudicated according to the provisions of
Chapter 7A, Article IV.
ARTICLE V
ADMINISTRATION
SECTION 7C-500.   APPLICATION.
A proposal to engage in any activity in a Wetlands Zone which is regulated by
the Act or by this Chapter or by
Chapter 7D shall be included in the application for a Zoning Permit pursuant to
City Code § 7A-301. If the proposed activities in the Wetland Zone are
approved, the approval shall be delineated as an attachment to the Zoning
Permit. If the proposed activities are determined to have no impact on existing
Wetlands, the Exemption Certificate shall be attached to the Zoning Permit.
[Section 7C-500 amended by Ord. No. 94-5, effective January 12, 1996, amended
by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007.]
SECTION 7C-501.   APPLICATION FEE.
In addition to any other fees or cost charged to an applicant at the time that
application for a Zoning Permit and Building Permit is made, the Zoning
Administrator is authorized to collect a wetlands evaluation fee of $75.00 or
such other amount as the City Council may authorize.
[§ 7C-501 amended by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007.]
SECTION 7C-502.   REIMBURSEMENT BY APPLICANT OF OTHER CITY COSTS AND FEES.
If the development proposed in the application does not seek to avoid impact on
existing Wetlands, but instead contemplates filling, draining, excavation, or
modification of existing Wetlands, the City’s costs for administration and
adjudication of the application will be increased to an amount many times the
$75.00 fee charged as an application fee. Prior to issuance of a Zoning Permit
and Building Permit, the applicant shall reimburse the City for all wetlands
evaluation fees, wetlands engineering fees, civil engineering consulting fees,
environmental engineering consulting fees, planning consulting fees, inspection
fees, hearing and publication costs, fees for legal services, and
administrative or professional costs reasonably and necessarily incurred by the
City in processing an application for a Zoning Permit and Building Permit and/
or an application for subdivision approval under the terms of these regulations
and other provisions of the City Code. The Zoning Administrator is authorized
to bill an applicant for actual costs incurred during the pendency of
proceedings under this Chapter. Failure of the applicant to pay such billings
within 10 days of the billing date shall be grounds for the City Council to

[Ordinance No. 92-1, adding this Chapter 7C to the Town Code, contained the
following statement of purpose and findings:
“SECTION 1.   Purpose. This Ordinance is written to regulate development in
wetlands pursuant to the Minnesota Wetlands Conservation Act of 1991 (1991
Minn. Sess. Law Serv. [West], Chapter 354, hereinafter the “Act.”)
SECTION 2.   Findings.
   A.   The Town Board finds that it is the responsibility of the Township, as
a municipality lying within the seven-county metropolitan area, to act to
preserve wetlands pursuant to the Act.
   B.   The Town Board finds that wetlands within the Township, as part of the
natural ecosystem, are critical to the present and future healtSh, safety and
general welfare of the land, wildlife and people within the Township; that
these wetlands conserve surface waters, provide floodwater retention and
improve water quality for our lakes and streams. Further, these wetlands
improve subsoil moisture and serve to recharge the large aquifers critical to
the community.
   C.   The Town Board recognizes that wetlands and their natural functions, if
properly maintained, provide important ecological, educational and recreational
assets as well as enhancing property values and conserving the natural beauty
of the landscape.”]

TITLE AND PURPOSE
SECTION 7D-100.   TITLE.
This Chapter shall be known and may be cited as the “Storm Water Management
Regulations of the City of Columbus, Minnesota.”
[§ 7D-100 amended by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007.]
SECTION 7D-101.   PURPOSE.
The purpose of this Chapter is to promote, preserve and enhance the natural
resources within the City of Columbus and protect them from adverse effects
occasioned by poorly sited development or incompatible activities by regulating
land disturbing or development activities that would have an adverse and
potentially irreversible impact on water quality and unique and fragile
environmentally sensitive land; by minimizing conflicts and encouraging
compatibility between land disturbing and development activities and water
quality and environmentally sensitive lands; and by requiring detailed review
standards and procedures for land disturbing or development activities proposed
for such areas, thereby achieving a balance between urban growth and
development and protection of water quality and natural areas.
[§ 7D-101 amended by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007.]
ARTICLE II
FINDINGS
SECTION 7D-200.
The City Council hereby finds that uncontrolled and inadequately planned use of
wetlands, woodlands, natural habitat areas, areas subject to soil erosion and
areas containing restrictive soils adversely affect the public health, safety
and general welfare by impacting water quality and contributing to other
environmental problems, creating nuisances, impairing other beneficial uses of
environmental resources and hindering the ability of the City of Columbus to
provide adequate water, sewage, flood control, and other community services. In
addition, extraordinary public expenditures may be required for the protection
of persons and property in such areas and in areas which may be affected by
unplanned land usage.

Every applicant for a building permit, zoning permit, excavation permit,
filling permit, mining permit, sign permit, wetlands activities permit, plat
approval, minor subdivision approval, permit for construction of utilities
systems, or permit for any land disturbing activities must submit a storm water
management plan to the Zoning Administrator. No building permit, zoning permit,
excavation permit, filling permit, mining permit, sign permit, wetlands
activities permit, plat approval, minor subdivision approval, permit for
construction of utilities systems, or permit for any land disturbing activities
shall be issued until approval of the storm water management plan or a waiver
of the approval requirement has been obtained in strict conformance with the
provisions of this Chapter. The provisions of Article VIII of this Chapter
apply to all land in all zones, public or private, located within the City of
Columbus.
Compliance with these regulations is not a substitute for compliance with other
laws and regulations concerning substantially the same subject matter. All land
disturbing activities in the City shall comply with applicable jurisdictional
regulations and secure associated permitting, including but not limited to
permitting required by Rice Creek Watershed District and Coon Creek Watershed
District. If construction or development activities propose to disturb five or
more acres of land, then the developer must obtain a General Storm Water Permit

SECTION 7D-707.   STORM WATER MANAGEMENT POLICY AND REGULATION.
   A.   POLICY. It is the policy of the City of Columbus to manage stormwater
and snowmelt runoff on a local basis; to promote natural infiltration of runoff
throughout the City to preserve flood storage and enhance water quality; and to
address the unique nature of flooding issues within the Flood Management Zone,
through the following principles:
      a.   Maximize water quality and flood control on individual project sites
through Better Site Design practices and stormwater management.
      b.   Minimize land use impacts and improve operational an maintenance
efficiency by siting stormwater BMPs, when needed, regionally unless local
resources would be adversely affected.
      c.   Treat stormwater runoff before discharge to surface waterbodies and
wetlands, while considering the historic use of City water features.
      d.   Ensure that future peak rates of runoff are less than or equal to
exiting rates.
      e.   Preserve remaining floodplain storage volume to minimize flood
potential throughout the City.
   B.   REGULATION. A permit incorporating an approve stormwater management
plan is required under this rule for development, consistent with the
following:
      a.   A permit is required for subdivision of an area exceeding one acre.
This includes subdivision for single-family residential, multi-unit
residential, commercial, industrial, or institutional development.
      b.   A permit is required for development, other than Public Linear
Projects, that creates or reconstructs 10,000 square feet or more of impervious
surface. This threshold is cumulative of all impervious surface created or
reconstructed through multiple phases or connected actions of a single complete
project, as defined by the City, on a single parcel or contiguous parcels of
land under common ownership, development or use.
      c.   For Public Linear Projects, a permit is required when one acre or
more of impervious surface will be created or reconstructed through multiple
phases or connected actions of a single complete project, as defined by the
City.
[§ 7D-707 amended by Ord. No. 23-04, effective August 10, 2023.]
SECTION 7D-708.   DESIGN STANDARDS.
   A.   MODELING REQUIREMENTS FOR STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PLANS.
      a.   A hydrograph method or computer program based on NRCS Technical
Release #20 (TR- 20) and subsequent guidance must be used to analyze stormwater
runoff for the design or analysis of discharge and water levels within and off
the project site. The runoff from pervious and impervious areas within the
model shall be modeled separately.
      b.   In determining Curve Numbers for the post-development condition, the
Hydrologic Soil Group (HSG) of areas within construction limits shall be
shifted down one classification for HSG C (Curve Number 80) and HSG B (Curve
Number 74) and ½ classification for HSG A (Curve Number 49) to account for the
impacts of grading on soil structure unless the project specifications
incorporate soil amendments in accordance with available Soil Amendment
Guidelines, such as the MPCA Minnesota Stormwater Manual, or Rice Creek
Watershed District guidance. This requirement only applies to that part of a
site that has not been disturbed or compacted prior to the proposed project.
      c.   The Analysis of flood levels, storage volumes, and discharge rates
for waterbodies and stormwater management basins must include the NOAA Atlas 14
values, as amended, using a nested rainfall distribution (e.g., MSE 3), for the
2-year, 10-year and 100-year return period, 24-hour rainfall events and the 10-
day snowmelt event (Curve Number 100), in order to identify the critical
duration flood event. The City Engineer may require analysis of additional
precipitation durations to determine the critical duration flood event.
Analysis of the 10-day snowmelt event is not required for stormwater management
detention basins with a defined outlet elevation at or below the 100-year
return period, 24-hour rainfall event elevation.
   B.   STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN FRAMEWORK.
      a.   When an existing regional BMP is proposed to manage stormwater
runoff, the proposed total impervious surface area must be equal to or less
than the impervious surface allocated within the original approved stormwater
plan for that site. If an impervious surface area was not specified within the
original approved stormwater plan for the site, the applicant shall show that
the BMP was designed and constructed to manage the stormwater runoff from the
project site, the applicant has permission to utilize any remaining capacity in
the BMP, the BMP is subject to maintenance obligations enforceable by the City,
and it is being maintained to its original design.
      b.   Stormwater management plans, with the exception of those for single
family residential developments, must specify the proposed impervious surface
area draining to each BMP for each land parcel.
      c.   A combination of Stormwater BMPs may be used to meet the
requirements of paragraphs C, D, and E of this section.
      d.   The proposed project must not adversely affect off-site water levels
or resources supported by local recharge, or increase the potential for off-
site flooding, during or after construction.
      e.   A landlocked basin may be provided an outlet only if it:
         i.   Conforms with Section
7D-709 and all other wetland requirements, as applicable.
         ii.   Provides sufficient dead storage volume to retain the runoff
resulting from back-to-back 100-year, 24-hour rainfall events.
         iii.   Does not create adverse downstream flooding or water quality
conditions as a result of the change in the rate, volume or timing of runoff or
a change in drainage patterns.
   C.   WATER QUALITY TREATMENT.
      a.   Development creating or reconstructing impervious surface shall
apply Better Site Design (BSD) techniques as outlined in the MPCA Minnesota
Stormwater Manual as amended (www.stormwater.pca.state.mn.us).
      b.   Sediment shall be managed on-site to the maximum extent practicable
before runoff resulting from new or reconstructed impervious surface enters a
waterbody or flows off-site.
      c.   WATER QUALITY TREATMENT STANDARDS.
         i.   The required water quality treatment volume standards for all
projects, except Public Linear Projects, is determined as follows:
 
Required Water      Area of New or
Quality Treatment = Reconstructed  x 1.1 (in) ÷TP Removal Factor ÷12 (in/ft)
Volume (ft3)        Impervious                  from Table C1
                    Surface (ft2)
 
         ii.   The required water quality treatment volume standard for Public
Linear Projects is determined as follows:
 
Required Water Quality = {'{'}Greater of{'}'}
Treatment Volume (ft3)
                         Area of New Impervious Surface x 1.0 (in) ÷12 (in/ft)
                         (ft2)
                         {'{'}OR{'}'}
                         Sum Area of New and
                         Reconstructed Impervious       x 0.5 (in) ÷12 (in/ft)
                         Surface (ft2)
 
 
         iii.   For alternative Stormwater BMPs not found in Table C1 or to
deviate from TP Removal Factors found in Table C1, the applicant may submit a
TP Removal Factor, expressed as annual percentage removal efficiency, based on
supporting technical data, for City approval.
         iv.   Stormwater runoff treated by the BMP during a rain event will
not be credited towards the treatment requirement.

performance. Removal factors shown are average annual TP percentage removal
efficiencies intended solely for use in comparing the performance equivalence
of various BMPs.
**These BMPs reduce runoff volume.
***Stormwater ponds must also provide 2.5" of dead storage as required by
Section 7D-708(F)(d)(ii).
 
      d.   BMP LOCATIONAL SITING.
         i.   BMPS shall be located either on-site to treat runoff at the point
of generation, or regionally within the primary drainage area.
         ii.   If infiltration is feasible on site (see Table C2), on-site or
regional BMPs must provide volume control to meet the standard of Section 7D-
708(C)(c).
         iii.   If infiltrations is not feasible, any BMP may be used.
         iv.   Off-site and/or regional BMPs must be sited in the following
priority order:
            1.   In a downstream location that intercepts the runoff volume
leaving the project site prior to the Resource of Concern.
            2.   Anywhere within the same primary drainage area that results in
no greater mass of Total Phosphorus reaching the resource of concern than on-
site BMPs.

      e.   Stormwater runoff from all new and reconstructed impervious surface
must be captured be captured and treated for total phosphorus if feasible.
Notwithstanding, runoff from undisturbed impervious surface not otherwise being
treated prior to the Resource of Concern may be treated in lieu of treating new
or reconstructed impervious surface, provided the runoff from that surface
drains to the same surface water resource as the new/reconstructed surface not
being treated. Except for Public Linear projects, the area not treated for
phosphorus may not exceed 15 percent of all the new or reconstructed impervious
surface. For all untreated surface, TSS must be removed to the maximum extent
practicable. Total water quality treatment volume for the project must be
provided in aggregate pursuant to Section 7D-708(C)(c) Section 7D-708(C)(d)
except that for a Public Linear Project, water quality treatment volume for
reconstructed impervious surface, if required by Section
7D-707(B)(c) must be provided only to the extent feasible.
      f.   For single-family residential development, the runoff from
impervious surface other than parking or driving surface that, in the City's
judgment. cannot reasonably be routed to a stormwater BMP is considered
effectively treated for water quality if:
         i.   The length of the flow path across the impervious surface is less
than the length of the flow path across the pervious surface to which it
discharges; and
         ii.   The pervious surface is vegetated and has an average slow of
five percent or less.
   D.   PEAK STORMWATER RUNOFF CONTROL.
      a.   Peak stormwater runoff rates for the proposed project at the project
site boundary, in aggregate, must not exceed existing peak runoff rates for the
2-year, 10-year and 100-year, 24-hour rainfall events, or a different critical
event duration at the discretion of the City Engineer. Notwithstanding, peak
runoff may be controlled to standard in a regional facility consistent with
paragraph (D)(b). Aggregate compliance for all site boundary discharge will be
determined with respect to runoff not managed in a regional facility.
      b.   Any increase in a critical duration flood event rate at a specific
point of discharge from the project site must be limited and cause no adverse
downstream impact. Table C3 shows the maximum curve numbers that may be
utilized for existing condition modeling of those project site areas not
covered by impervious surface.
      c.   Within the Flood Management Zone only (refer to FEMA Special Flood
Hazzard Areas and/or other local flood information), peak runoff rates for the
2-, 10- and 100-year 24-hour rainfall events shall be reduced to ?80% of the
existing condition. This requirement does not apply if the project is a Public
Linear Project.

      d.   Stormwater ponds must be designed to provide:
         i.   Water quality features consistent with NURP criteria and accepted
design standards for average and maximum depth;
         ii.   A permanent wet pool with dead storage at least equal to the
runoff volume from a 2.5-inch rainfall over the area tributary to the pond;
         iii.   An outlet structure capable of preventing migration of floating
debris and oils for at least the one-year storm;
         iv.   An identified emergency overflow spillway sufficiently
stabilized to convey flows greater than the 100-year critical storm event; and
         v.   An outlet structure to control the 2-year, 10-year and 100-year
frequency events.
      e.   Soil borings (utilizing ASTM D5921 and D2488, as amended) shall be
considered for design purposes, and provided to the City, for each proposed
BMP. The soil borings must be taken to a depth of at least 5 feet below the
bottom of the proposed feature.
      f.   An outfall structure discharging directly to a wetland, public water
or public water wetland must incorporate a stilling-basin, surge-basin, energy
dissipater, placement of ungrouted natural rock riprap or other feature to
minimize disturbance and erosion of natural shoreline and bed resulting from
stormwater discharges. Where feasible, outfall structures are to be located
outside of the natural feature.

      g.   All new residential commercial, industrial, and other habitable or
non-habitable structures, and all stormwater BMPs, must be constructed so that
the lowest floor and lowest entry elevations comply with Table C6. The low
entry freeboard criterion of Table C6 may be deemed met when the structure does
not have the required vertical separation but is protected from surface
flooding to the required elevation by a berm or other natural or constructed
topographic feature capable of providing flood protection.
      h.   Within a landlocked basin, minimum low floor elevations must be at
least one foot above the surveyed basin run out elevation. Where a structure is
proposed below the run out elevation of a land-locked basin, the low floor
elevation will be a minimum of two feet above the highest water level of either
the 10-day snowmelt event or back-to-back 100-year, 24- hour rainfalls. Aerial
photos, vegetation, soils, and topography may be used to derive a "normal"
water elevation for the purpose of computing the basin's 100-year elevation.
      i.   All stormwater management structures and facilities must be designed
for maintenance access and be properly operated and maintained in perpetuity to
assure that they continue to function as designed. The maintenance
responsibility must be memorialized in a document executed by the property
owner in a form acceptable to the City and filed for record on the deed.
Alternatively, a public permittee may meet its perpetual maintenance obligation
by executing a programmatic or project-specific maintenance agreement with the
City. Regional ponds owned by public entities that are only used to meet the
runoff rate requirements of the City Code do not need a maintenance agreement
with the City.
      j.   The permitee must use construction best practices so that the
facility as constructed will conform to design specifications and the soil and
surrounding conditions are not altered in a way adverse to facility
performance.
      k.   Before work under the permit is deemed complete, the permittee must
submit as-built plans demonstrating that at the time of final stabilization,
stormwater facilities conform to design specifications. If at any time the City
finds that the stormwater facility is not performing as designed, on City
request the permittee must undertake reasonable investigation to determine the
cause of inadequate performance.
   G.   EASEMENTS.
      a.   Before permit issuance, the permittee must, submit a copy of any
plat or easement required by the local land use authority establishing drainage
or flowage over stormwater management facilities, stormwater conveyances,
ponds, wetlands, on-site floodplain up to the 100-year flood elevation, or any
other hydrologic feature.
      b.   Before permit issuance, the permittee must convey to the City an
easement to the public drainage system specifying a City right of maintenance
access over the right of way of the public drainage system as identified within
the public drainage system record. If the right of way of the public drainage
system is not described within the record, then the easement shall be conveyed
with the following widths:
         i.   For tiled/piped systems, 40 feet wide perpendicular to the
direction of flow, centered on the tile line or pipe;
         ii.   For open channel systems, a width that includes the channel and
the area on each side of the channel within 20 feet of top of bank. For
adequate and safe access, where top of bank is irregular or obstruction exists,
the City may specify added width.
      c.   Public Linear Projects are exempt from the public drainage system
easement requirement of Section G(2).
      d.   Refer to local, state, and federal wetland rules for additional
easement requirements near wetlands.
   H.   REQUIRED EXHIBITS. The following exhibits must accompany the permit
application. The vertical datum must clearly be labeled on each plan set.
      a.   An erosion and sediment control plan and, for projects that require
an NPDES permit, a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan.
      b.   Property lines and delineation of lands under ownership of the
applicant.
      c.   Delineation of the sub watershed contributing runoff from off-site,
proposed and existing sub watersheds onsite, emergency overflows, and
drainageways.
      d.   Geotechnical analysis including soil borings at all proposed
stormwater management facility locations utilizing ASTM D5921 and D2488, as
amended.
      e.   Proposed and existing stormwater facilities location, alignment and
elevation.
      f.   Delineation of existing on-site wetland, marshes and floodplain
area.
      g.   Identification of existing and proposed normal, ordinary high and
100-year water elevation on-site.
      h.   Identification of existing and proposed contour elevations within
the project site.
      i.   Construction plans and specifications of all proposed stormwater
management facilities, including design details for outlet control structures.
      j.   Stormwater runoff volume and rate analyses for the 2- 10- and 100-
year critical events, existing and proposed conditions utilizing NOAA Atlas 14.
      k.   All hydrologic, water quality and hydraulic computations completed
to design the proposed stormwater management facilities.
      l.   Narrative including a project description, discussion of BMP
selection, and revegetation plan for the project site.
      m.   Other project site-specific submittal requirements as may be
required by the City.
   I.   EXCEPTIONS.
      a.   A permit is not required for single-family residential construction
on an individual lot of record, if the proposed impervious surface of the lot
is less than 10,000 square feet, excluding the driveway. If the lot is within a
development previously approved by the City, the construction must conform to
the previous approval.
      b.   Section
7D-707 requirements do not apply to sidewalks and trails 10 feet wide or less
that are bordered down-gradient by vegetated open space or vegetated filter
strip with minimum width of 5 feet.
      c.   Section
7D-707 requirements do not apply to Bridge Spans and Mill, Reclamation and
Overlay projects.
      d.   Section 7D-708(C) and Section 7D-708(D) requirements do not apply to
single family residential subdivisions creating seen or few lots that:
         i.   Establish no new public roadway; and
         ii.   Include no private roadway/driveway serving three or more lots.
      e.   Criteria of Section 7D-708(D) may be waived if the project site
discharges directly to a water body with large storage capacity (such as a
public water), the volume discharged from the project site does not contribute
to a downstream flood peak, and there are no downstream locations susceptible
to flooding.
      f.   Section 7D-708(C) and Section 7D-708(D) are waived for a portion of
a project that paves a gravel roadway if the right-of-way ditch is maintained
and does not discharge a concentrated flow directly to a wetland or another
sensitive waterbody.
   J.   EXTENDED PERMIT TERM AND REGIONAL FACILITIES FOR NON-RESIDENTIAL PHASED
DEVELOPMENT.
      a.   The following definitions apply to this section:
         i.   "Area Development Permit" (ADP) means a City stormwater
management permit for non-residential development that includes construction of
a stormwater management facility explicitly intended to serve compliance
requirements for a parcel other than that on which the facility is located.
         ii.   "Phased Development Permit" (PDP) means a City stormwater
management permit for non-residential development that includes construction of
a stormwater management facility explicitly intended to serve compliance
requirements not just for development under the permit, but also for subsequent
development on that parcel or a contiguous parcel under common ownership.
      b.   If an off-site stormwater management facility approved under a prior
ADP cannot be used for compliance due to a rule change occurring since the date
of ADP approval, the City nevertheless by permit will approve its use, subject
to the following:
         i.   The applicant must demonstrate that the facility was built in
compliance with the ADP, that the ADP identified the development site as one
that may use the facility, and that the requirements of Section 7D-708
subsection B(a) above, are met.
         ii.   If the current rule requires a level of peak flow or volume
control, or of water quality treatment, beyond that provided by the off-site
facility, the applicant must provide for the additional treatment. This does
not disallow use of an existing facility on the ground that it does not meet a
sequencing requirement with respect to the BMP location or type.
The protection against rule change provided by this subsection J(b) does not
apply if the City makes written findings, on the basis of new knowledge or
information, that use the facility would have a material adverse impact on
water quality, flood management or other specific public interest, or if the
approval date of the development permit is more than 10 years after the date of
ADP approval.
      c.   The City may issue a PDP with a permit term of up to 10 years.
         i.   During the permit term, development using the stormwater
management facilities approved under the PDP will not be subject to a rule
change occurring after the date of PDP approval, provided the PDP states the
design criteria to which subsequent development will conform and the proposed
development meets those criteria.
         ii.   This section does not apply to an ADP or a PDP approved before
December 1, 2004.

No. 23-04, effective August 10, 2023.]
SECTION 7D-709.   WETLAND ALTERATIONS.
   A.   DEFINITIONS AND STANDARDS. In the City of Columbus, a Wetlands Zone is
defined as:
      a.   All wetlands described and identified at Types 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 and 8
in the United State Department of the Interior Fish and Wildlife Circular No.
39, 1971 Edition, "Wetlands of the United States," or described and identified
pursuant to "Classification of Wetlands and Deepwater Habitats of the United
States," (FWS/OBS - 79/31, December, 1979, by Cowardin et al.) as shown on the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services National Wetlands Inventory Map of 1991.
         i.   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services National Wetlands Inventory
Map of 1991 is designated as the Official Wetlands Zone Map for the City of
Columbus. The Wetlands Zone shall overlay all established zoning districts so
that any parcel of land lying in a Wetlands Zone shall also lie in one or more
of the established zoning districts. Lands lying within a Wetlands Zone shall
be subject to the requirements established by other applicable ordinances and
regulations of the City. Within each Wetlands Zone, all uses shall be permitted
in accordance with the regulations for the underlying zoning district, provided
that such uses must also satisfy the additional requirements of this ordinance.
         ii.   The City reserves the right to go beyond the federal definitions
shown above, which focus on predominant hydric soils and prevalent hydrophytic
vegetation. The Wetlands Zone definitions of this section are the minimum
definitions of wetlands for the City of Columbus and are not intended to be the
exclusive definitions or delineations of the Wetlands Zone. The Wetlands Zone
shall be increased and augmented with data specifically derived from the
investigation, identification, evaluation, and delineation of wetlands on any
land for which development is proposed.
   B.   POLICY. It is the policy of the City of Columbus to:
      a.   Maintain no net loss in the quantity, quality, and biological
diversity of Minnesota's existing wetlands.
      b.   Increase the quantity, quality, and biological diversity of
Minnesota's wetlands by restoring or enhancing diminished or drained wetlands.
      c.   Avoid direct or indirect impacts from activities that destroy or
diminish the quantity, quality, and biological diversity of wetlands.
      d.   Replace wetland values where avoidance of activity is not feasible
or prudent.
      e.   Accomplish goals of the adopted wetland protection plans provided by
watershed districts and/or county.
   C.   REGULATION. No person may burn, fill, drain, excavate, develop, or
otherwise alter the hydrology of a Wetlands Zone without first obtaining a
permit from the City. A permit issued pursuant to this Ordinance shall not
relieve the permittee of the responsibility of complying with all other laws
and ordinances.
      a.   A proposal to engage in any activity in a Wetlands Zone which is
regulated under this ordinance shall be included in the application for a
Zoning Permit pursuant to City Code §
7A-301 as well as the following regulatory statutes.
         i.   The provisions of the Minnesota Wetland Conservation Act (WCA),
Minnesota Statutes
         ii.   §§103G.221 through 103G.2372, and its implementing rules,
Minnesota Rules 8420, apply under this section and govern implementation of WCA
as well as regulation of non-WCA wetland impacts, except where the City Code
provides otherwise.
      b.   Regulatory exceptions:
         i.   This section does not regulate alteration of incidental wetlands
as defined in Minnesota Rules chapter 8420, as amended. An applicant must
demonstrate that the subject wetlands are incidental.
         ii.   An activity for which a No-Loss decision has been issued under
Minnesota Rules chapter 8420 is subject to the applicable requirements of
chapter 8420 but not otherwise subject to this section.
         iii.   Clearing of vegetation, plowing, or pasturing in a Wetlands
Zone as part of an existing and ongoing farming operation is not subject to
this rule unless the activity results in draining or filling the wetland.
   D.   LOCAL GOVERNMENT UNIT. The City intends to serve as the "Local
Government Unit" (LGU) for administration of the Minnesota Wetland Conservation
Act (WCA) within the Sunrise River Watershed Management Organization. WCA shall
be administered by Rice Creek Watershed District and Coon Creek Watershed
District within their jurisdictional boundary. Pursuant to its regulatory
authority under both WCA and watershed law, when the City is serving as the LGU
it will require wetland alteration permits for wetland-altering activities both
as required by WCA and otherwise as required by this Rule.
      a.   CRITERIA.
         i.   When the City is serving as the LGU, it will regulate wetland
alterations that are not subject to WCA rules and do not qualify for an
exemption at Minnesota Rules 8420.0420 or do not meet the "no-loss" criteria of
Minnesota Rules 8420.0415 according to the rules and procedures of WCA, except
as specifically provided in this section. Alteration under this paragraph
requires replacement at a minimum ratio of 1:1 to ensure no loss of wetland
quantity, quality or biological diversity. Replacement activities will be
credited consistent with the actions eligible for credit in Minnesota Rules
8420.0526.
         ii.   The wetland replacement exemptions in Minnesota Rules 8420.0420
are applicable under this section, except as modified within Watershed District
3, as defined in the Rice Creek Watershed District Rule F, Section 6
Comprehensive Wetland Protection and Management Plans.
         iii.   Alterations in Wetlands Zones for the purposes of wildlife
enhancement must be certified by the local Soil and Water Conservation District
as compliant with the criteria described in Wildlife Habitat Improvements in
Wetlands: Guidance for Soil and Water Conservation Districts and Local
Government Units (8420.0420 Exemption Standards, Subp. 9. Wildlife Habitat).
   E.   ADDITIONAL CITY REQUIREMENTS. In addition to the wetland replacement
plan components and procedures in WCA, the following more specific requirements
will apply to the City's review of WCA and, except as indicated, non-WCA
wetland alterations:
      a.   Applicants must adequately explain and justify each individual
contiguous wetland alteration area in terms of impact avoidance and
minimization alternatives considered.
      b.   Where the wetland alteration is proposed in the context of land
subdivision, on-site replacement wetland and buffer areas must:
         i.   Be located within a platted outlot.
         ii.   Be protected from future encroachment by a barrier (i.e.,
stormwater pond, infiltration basin, existing wetland, tree line, fence, trail
or another durable physical feature).
         iii.   Have boundaries posted with signage approved by the City
identifying the wetland/buffer protected status. On installation, the applicant
must submit a GIS shapefile, or CADD file documenting sign locations.
         iv.   Comply with vegetated buffer guidelines as outlined in Section
7D-709(I).
      c.   The upland edge of any new wetland creation must have an irregular
and uneven slope. The slope must be no steeper than 8:1 over the initial 25
feet upslope from the projected wetland elevation contour along at least 50
percent of the upland/wetland boundary and no steeper than 5:1 along the
remaining 50 percent of the boundary.
      d.   The City will not allow excess replacement credits to be used for
replacement on a different project unless the credits were designated for
wetland banking purposes in the original application in accordance with WCA
rules and have been deposited into the WCA wetland banking system.
   F.   COMPREHENSIVE WETLAND PROTECTION AND MANAGEMENT PLANS. Governing
standards, regulations, and guidance documents from Watersheds 1, 2, and 3 are
incorporated into Section 7D-709. The specific terms of Section 7D-709 will
govern, but if a term of Section 7D-709 is susceptible to more than one
interpretation, the City will apply the interpretation that best carries out
the intent and purposes of the respective Watershed District document as
identified in Section
7D-300.
      a.   PRE-APPLICATION REVIEW.
         i.   In cases where wetland fill, excavation or draining, wholly or
partly, is contemplated, the applicant is encouraged to submit a preliminary
concept plan for review by the City before submitting a formal application. The
following will be examined during pre- application review:
            1.   Sequencing (in accordance with WCA and Federal Clean Water Act
requirements, reducing the size, scope or density of each individual proposed
action, and changing the type of project action to avoid and minimize wetland
impacts).
            2.   Wetland assessment.
            3.   Applying Better Site Design principles.
            4.   Integrating buffers and other barriers to protect wetland
resources from future impacts.
            5.   Exploring development code flexibility, including conditional
use permits, planned unit development, variances and code revisions.
            6.   Reviewing wetland stormwater susceptibility (see Section
7D-708 (E)) and coordinating with Watershed District 3 to establish a Wetland
Management Corridor (WMC) or work within existing WMCs.
         ii.   At the pre-application meeting, the applicant shall provide
documentation sufficient to assess project alternatives at a concept level and
other information as the City specifically requests.
         iii.   On receipt of a complete application, the City will review and
act on the application in accordance with its procedural rules and WCA
procedures.
         iv.   The City shall be consulted on decisions related to replacement
plans, exemptions, no-loss, wetland boundaries, and determination of the WMC.
   G.   WETLAND REPLACEMENT.
      a.   Replacement plans will be evaluated and implemented in accordance
with Minnesota Rules 8420.0325 through 8420.0335, 8420.0500 through 08420.0544
and 8420.0800 through 8420.0820, except that the provisions of this Rule will
apply in place of Minnesota Rules 8420.0522, and 8420.0526. The purpose of an
approved wetland replacement plan is to limit impact to, and encourage
enhancement of, high-priority wetlands and direct unavoidable impact to lower-
priority wetlands. In accordance with Minnesota Rules 8420.0515, subpart 10,
this principle will guide sequencing, replacement siting, and other elements of
replacement plan review. The City will use the methodology of Minnesota Rules
8420.0522, subpart 2 to determine wetland replacement requirements for
partially drained wetlands.
      b.   If not utilizing approved replacement credits, replacement methods
must be from the following actions:
         i.   Wetland Restoration: Hydrologic and vegetative restoration of
moderately and severely degraded wetlands, or hydrologic and vegetative
restoration of effectively drained, former wetlands.
         ii.   Wetland Creation: Upland to wetland conversion.
         iii.   Wetland Protection & Preservation: Protection via conservation
easement of wetland previously restored consistent with Minnesota Rules
8420.0526, subpart 6, or restoration or protection of wetland of exceptional
natural resource value consistent with Minnesota Rules 8420.0526, subpart 8.
            1.   Replacement credit for Wetland Protection and Preservation
requires that a perpetual Conservation Easement be conveyed to and accepted by
the City. The easement must encompass the entire replacement area and must
provide for preservation of the wetland's functions by the fee owner and
applicant. The applicant must provide a title insurance policy acceptable to
the City, naming the City as the insured. The fee owner and the applicant also
must grant an access easement in favor of the City, the local government unit
and any other state, local or federal regulatory authority that has authorized
use of credits from the mitigation site for wetland replacement. The fee owner
must record or register these easements on the title for the affected property.
         iv.   Buffers and/or Vegetative Restoration: Installation of non-
invasive dominated buffers around action eligible for credit consistent with
guidance provided in SECTION 7D-709(I), and/or a positive shift in the
Minnesota Routine Assessment Method (MnRAM) assessment score for "Vegetative
Integrity" from "Low" to "Medium" or "High".
            1.   Replacement credit for Vegetative Restoration may be granted
only for wetland communities scoring "Low" for Vegetative Integrity. The City
must find that there is a reasonable probability for restoration success.
      c.   The replacement plan must demonstrate that non-exempt impacts will
result in no net loss of wetland hydrological regime, water quality, or
wildlife habitat function through a wetland assessment methodology approved by
the Minnesota Board of Water & Soil Resources (BWSR) pursuant to the Wetland
Conservation Act, Minnesota Statutes §103G.2242.
         i.   The location and type of wetland replacement will conform as
closely as possible to the following standards:
            1.   No wetland plant community of high or exceptional wildlife
habitat function and high or exceptional vegetative integrity, as identified in
the required wetland assessment, may be disturbed.
            2.   No replacement credit will be given for excavation in an
upland natural community with Natural Heritage Program rank B or higher, or
with identified Endangered, Threatened or Special Concern species.
      d.   Unless a different standard is stated in the approved replacement or
banking plan, the performance standard for upland and wetland restored or
created to generate credit is establishment, by the end of the WCA monitoring
period, of a medium or high-quality plant community ranking with 80% vegetative
coverage consisting of a native, non-invasive species composition.
      e.   Notwithstanding any provision in this rule to the contrary, for
wetland impacts resulting from public drainage system repairs that are exempt
from Clean Water Act Section 404 permit requirements but are not exempt from
replacement under Section 7D-709(H)(a), replacement may occur subject to the
following priority of replacement site sequencing:
         i.   Within any watershed district whose management plan contains
wetland restoration as a means of implementation.
         ii.   Throughout the state in areas determined to possess less than
80% of pre-settlement wetland acres.
      f.   A variance from a requirement of Section 7D-709(H) may be granted if
the City concurs that the wetland protection afforded will not be less than
that resulting from application of standard WCA criteria.
   H.   WETLAND BANKING.
      a.   Replacement requirements under Section 7D-709(G) may be satisfied in
whole or part by replacement credits generated off-site provided the activity
occurred within the same Watershed District and barring any additional
restrictions imposed by that District.
      b.   The deposit of replacement credits created within Watershed
Districts 1, 2, and 3 for banking purposes and credit transactions for
replacement will occur in accordance with Minnesota Rules 8420.0700 through
8420.0745.
         i.   The City will calculate the amount of credit in accordance with
the standard terms of WCA. This measure of credit will appear in the BWSR
wetland banking account.
      c.   Credits generated under an approved wetland banking plan, inside a
contributing Watershed District or its contributing drainage area as specified
by that Watershed District, utilized to satisfy wetland replacement
requirements will be recognized in accordance with the approved banking plan.
   I.   VEGETATED BUFFERS. Vegetated buffers are required to be established
adjacent to wetlands as described below:
      a.   Wetland buffers will consist of non-invasive vegetated land; that is
not cultivated, cropped, pastured, mowed, fertilized, used as a location for
depositing snow removed from roads, driveways or parking lots, subject to the
placement of mulch or yard waste, or otherwise disturbed except for periodic
cutting or burning that promotes the health of the buffer, actions to address
disease or invasive species, or other actions to maintain or improve buffer or
habitat area quality, each as approved in writing by the City. The application
must include a vegetation management plan for City approval. For public road
authorities, the terms of this subsection will be modified as necessary to
accommodate safety and maintenance feasibility needs.
      b.   Buffer width for development and redevelopment projects must be at
least 16.5 feet. Future development projects must maintain a buffer of at least
50 feet of lateral distance from existing High Quality Wetland Zones and must
average 50 feet in width while maintaining a minimum of 25 feet in width at all
points of inflow for moderately or severely degraded wetlands. The City may
reduce the buffer width requirement based on compelling need if the applicant
can demonstrate that wetland protection afforded is reasonable given the
circumstances.
      c.   Buffers adjacent to wetlands that are restored, created or preserved
for replacement credit must meet the minimum width standards as described in
Minnesota Rules 8420.0522, subpart 6.
      d.   The area of buffer for which replacement credit is granted must not
exceed the area of the replacement wetland except and specific to when the
buffer is to meet the 50- foot requirement of Section 7D-709(I)(b).
      e.   No above- or below-ground structure or impervious surface may be
placed within a buffer area permanently or temporarily, except as follows:
         i.   A structure may extend or be suspended above the buffer if the
impact of any supports within the buffer or habitat area is negligible, the
design allows sufficient light to maintain the species shaded by the structure,
and the structure does not otherwise interfere with the function afforded by
the buffer.
         ii.   A public utility, or a structure associated with a public
utility, may be located within a buffer on a demonstration that there is no
reasonable alternative that avoids or reduces the proposed buffer intrusion.
The utility or structure shall minimize the area of permanent vegetative
disturbance.
         iii.   Buffers may enclose a linear surface for non-motorized travel
no more than 10 feet in width. The linear surface must be at least 25 feet from
the wetland edge. The area of the linear surface will not be eligible for
replacement credit. For projects proposing non- motorized travel no more than
10 feet in width, the linear surface may be reduced to less than 25 feet from
the wetland edge based on compelling need if the applicant can demonstrate that
wetland protection afforded is reasonable given the circumstances.
         iv.   A stormwater feature that is vegetated consistent with Section
7D-709(K), including Nationwide Urban Runoff Program (NURP) ponds, may be
located within buffer and count toward buffer width on site-specific approval.
      f.   Buffer area is to be indicated by permanent, freestanding markers at
the buffer's edge, with a design and text approved by the City. A marker shall
be placed at each lot line, with additional markers placed at an interval of no
more than 200 feet and as necessary to define variation in a meandering
boundary. If a City permit is sought for a subdivision, the monumentation
requirement will apply to each lot of record to be created. On public land or
right-of-way, the monumentation requirement may be satisfied by the use of
markers flush to the ground, breakaway markers of durable material, or a
vegetation maintenance plan approved by the City.
      g.   As a condition of permit issuance under this Rule, a property owner
must file on the deed a declaration in a form approved by the City establishing
approved vegetated buffer areas adjacent to the delineated wetland edge. The
declaration must state that on further subdivision of the property, each
subdivided lot of record shall meet the monumentation requirement of Section
7D-709(I)(f). On public land or right-of- way, in place of a recorded
declaration, the public owner may execute a written maintenance agreement with
the City. The agreement will state that if the land containing the buffer area
is conveyed to a private party, the seller must file on the deed a declaration
for maintenance in a form approved by the City.
      h.   Buffers may be disturbed to alter land contours or improve buffer
function if the following criteria are met:
         i.   An erosion control plan is submitted under which alterations are
designed and conducted to expose the smallest amount of disturbed ground for
the shortest time possible, fill or excavated material is not placed to create
an unstable slope, mulches or similar materials are used for temporary soil
coverage, and permanent vegetation is established as soon as possible after
disturbance is completed.
         ii.   Wooded buffers and native riparian canopy trees are left intact.
         iii.   When disturbance is completed, sheet flow characteristics
within the buffer area are improved; average slope is not steeper than
preexisting average slope or 5:1 (horizontal: vertical), whichever is less
steep; preexisting slopes steeper than 5:1 containing dense native vegetation
will not require regrading; the top 18 inches of the soil profile is not
compacted, has a permeability at least equal to the permeability of the
preexisting soil in an uncompacted state and has organic matter content of
between five and 15 percent; and habitat diversity and riparian shading are
maintained or improved. Any stormwater feature within the buffer will not have
exterior slopes greater than 5:1.
         iv.   A re-vegetation plan is submitted specifying removal of invasive
species and establishment of native vegetation suited to the location.
         v.   A recorded Declaration or, for a public entity, maintenance
agreement is submitted stating that, for three years after the project site is
stabilized, the property owner will correct erosion, maintain and replace
vegetation, and remove invasive species to establish permanent native
vegetation according to the re-vegetation plan.
         vi.   Disturbance is not likely to result in erosion, slope failure or
a failure to establish vegetation due to existing or proposed slope, soil type,
root structure or construction methods.
      i.   Material may not be excavated from or placed in a buffer, except for
temporary placement of fill or excavated material pursuant to duly-permitted
work in the associated wetland.
   J.   EASEMENT. The property owner must convey to the City and record or
register, in a form acceptable to the City, a perpetual, assignable easement
granting the City the authority to monitor, modify and maintain hydrologic and
vegetative conditions within the Wetlands Zone and buffer adjacent to Wetlands
Zones, including the authority to install and maintain structural elements
within those areas and reasonable access to those areas to perform authorized
activities. The WMC shall be identified and delineated as part of the recorded
easement.
   K.   PARTIAL ABANDONMENT. As a condition of permit issuance, the City may
require a property owner to petition the City for partial abandonment of a
public drainage system pursuant to Minnesota Statutes §103E.805. A partial
abandonment under this Section may not diminish a benefited property owner's
right to drainage without the owner's agreement.
   L.   REQUIRED EXHIBITS. The following exhibits must accompany a permit
application for both WCA and non-WCA wetland alterations:
      a.   SITE PLAN. An applicant must submit a site plan showing:
         i.   Property lines and delineation of lands under ownership of the
applicant.
         ii.   On-site location of all public and private ditch systems.
         iii.   Existing and proposed elevation contours, including the
existing run out elevation and flow capacity of the wetland outlet, and spoil
disposal areas.

wetland delineation report conforming to a methodology authorized for WCA use
and otherwise consistent with BWSR guidance. The following requirements and
clarifications apply to submittals of wetland delineation reports to the City
and supplement the approved methodology and guidance:
         i.   Wetland delineations should be conducted and reviewed during the
period of May 1 - October 15. The City may accept delineations performed
outside this time frame on a case-by-case basis. The City will determine if
there is sufficient information in the report and visible in the field at the
time to assess the three wetland parameters (hydrophytic vegetation, hydric
soils, hydrology) in relation to the placement of the wetland delineation line.
If proper assessment of the delineation is not possible, the City may consider
the application incomplete until appropriate field verification is possible.
         ii.   An applicant conducting short- or long-term wetland hydrology
monitoring for the purpose of wetland delineation/determination must coordinate
with the City prior to initiating the study.
         iii.   For a project site within row-cropped agricultural areas, the
wetland delineation report must include a review of Farm Service Agency aerial
slides (if available) for wetland signatures per Guidance for Offsite
Hydrology/Wetland Determinations (July 1, 2016), as amended, and Section 404
Clean Water Act or subsequent State-approved guidance. This review is to be
considered along with field data and other pertinent information and is not
necessarily the only or primary basis for a wetland determination in an
agricultural row-cropped area.
         iv.   The wetland delineation report must follow current BWSR/ACOE
Guidance for Submittal of Delineation Reports, and include:
            1.   Documentation consistent with the 1987 Corps of Engineers
Wetlands Delineation Manual and Northcentral and Northeast Regional Supplement.

systems:
               •   Classification of Wetlands and Deep Water Habitats of the
United States (Cowardin et al. 1979)
               •   Fish and Wildlife Service Circular No. 39 (Shaw and Fredine
1971)
               •   Wetland Plants and Plant Communities of Minnesota and
Wisconsin (Eggers & Reed, 3rd Edition, 2011).
            5.   As a condition of City approval of any wetland delineation,
applicants shall submit X/Y coordinates (NAD 83 state plane south coordinate
system) and a GIS shapefile of the delineated wetland boundaries. All data
shall be collected with a Trimble Geoexplorer or equivalent instrument with
sub-meter accuracy.
      c.   WETLAND REPLACEMENT PLAN APPLICATION. An applicant submitting a plan
involving a wetland alteration requiring replacement must submit five copies of
a replacement plan application and supporting materials conforming to WCA
replacement plan application submittal requirements and including the following
additional documents.
         i.   Plan sheet(s) clearly identifying, delineating, and denoting the
location and size of each wetland impact area and all replacement actions for
credit.
         ii.   Plan sheet(s) with profile views and construction specifications
of each replacement wetland including proposed/estimated normal water level,
proposed/estimated boundary of replacement wetland, topsoiling specifications
(if any), grading specifications, and wetland/buffer seeding specifications.
      d.   FUNCTIONS AND VALUES ASSESSMENT. An applicant must submit a before-
and-after wetland functions and values assessment using a WCA-accepted
methodology.
         i.   Erosion and sediment control plan in accordance with City
Ordinances.

      44.   Surface Water-Oriented Commercial Use. “Surface water-oriented
commercial use” means the use of land for commercial purposes, where access to
and use of a surface water feature is an integral part of the normal
conductance of business (e.g., marinas, resorts, and restaurants with transient
docking facilities).
      45.   Toe of The Bluff. “Toe of the bluff” means the lower point of a 50-
foot segment with an average slope exceeding 18 percent.
      46.   Top of The Bluff. “Top of the bluff” means the higher point of a
50-foot segment with an average slope exceeding 18 percent.
      47.    Variance. 
“Variance” means the same as that defined in Minnesota Statutes section 462.357 Subd. 6
(2).
      48.   Water-Oriented Accessory Structure or Facility.  “Water-oriented
accessory structure or facility” means a small, above ground building or other
improvement, except stairways, fences, docks, and retaining walls, which,
because of the relationship of its use to a surface water feature, reasonably
needs to be located closer to the public waters than the normal structure
setback. Examples of such structures and facilities include, watercraft and
watercraft equipment storage structures, gazebos, screen houses, fish houses,
pump houses, saunas, patios and detached decks. Boathouses and boat storage
structures given the meaning under Minnesota Statutes, Section 103G.245 are not
a water-oriented accessory structure.
      49.   Wetland. “Wetland” means a surface water feature classified as a
wetland in Minnesota Statutes and Minnesota Rules.

         c)   Limit the total number of vehicles allowed to be parked and the
total number of watercraft allowed to be continuously moored, docked, or stored
over water;
         d)   Require centralization of all common facilities and activities in
the most suitable locations on the lot to minimize topographic and vegetation
alterations; and
         e)   Require all parking areas, storage buildings, and other
facilities to be screened by vegetation or topography as much as practical from
view from the public water, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions.

[Amended by Ord. No. 22-02, effective August 23, 2023]
SECTION 7E-530   PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
   A.   Design Criteria for Structures.
      1.   Structures must be constructed in accordance with the provisions of
the Floodplain Management Ordinance (
Chapter 7F of the City Code). In those areas not covered by the Flood Plain
Management Ordinance, the elevation of flood proofing or the lowest floor,
including basement, shall comply with the following:
         (a)   The lowest floor shall be above the highest known ground water
level, three feet above the ordinary high water level, or one foot above the
flood of record, whichever is higher. In those instances where sufficient data
on known high water elevation are not available, the elevation of the line of
permanent shoreland vegetation shall be used as the estimated high water
elevation. The lowest floor shall also be three feet above any mottled or
saturated soil. When fill is required to meet this elevation, the fill shall be
allowed to stabilize, and construction shall not begin until the property has
been inspected and the stabilized fill elevation approved by the Zoning
Administrator.
         (b)   Water-oriented accessory structures may have the lowest floor
placed lower than the elevation determined in this item if the structure is
constructed of flood-resistant materials to the required flood protection
elevation, electrical and mechanical equipment is placed above this elevation
and, if long duration flooding is anticipated, the structure is built to
withstand ice action and wind-driven waves and debris.
      2.   Access up and down bluffs and steep slopes to shore areas shall be
by stairways and lifts. Stairways and lifts must meet the following design
requirements:
         (a)   Stairways and lifts must not exceed four feet in width on
residential lots. Wider stairways may be allowed by conditional use permit for
commercial properties, public and semi-public open-space recreational
properties, and planned unit developments.
         (b)   Landings for stairways and lifts on residential lots must not
exceed 32 square feet in areas. Landings larger than 32 square feet may be
allowed by conditional use permit for commercial properties, public and semi-
public open-space, recreational properties, and planned unit developments.
         (c)   Canopies or roofs are not allowed on stairways, lifts, or
landings. Stairways, lifts, and landings may be either constructed above the
ground on posts or pilings, or placed into the ground, provided they are
designed and built in a manner that ensures control of soil erosion.
         (d)   Stairways, lifts, and landings must be located in the most
visually inconspicuous portions of lots, as viewed from the surface of the
public water assuming summer, leaf-on conditions, whenever practical.
         (e)   Facilities such as ramp, lifts, or mobility paths for physically
handicapped persons are also allowed for achieving access to shore area, if
they are consistent with the dimensional and performance standards of this
ordinance and the requirements of Minnesota Rules, Chapter 1341.
      3.    Water Oriented Accessory Structures or Facilities. Each residential lot may have one
water-oriented accessory structure or facility if it complies with the
following provisions:
         (a)   The structure or facility must not exceed ten feet in height,
exclusive of
safety rails, and cannot occupy an area greater than 250 square feet. The
structure or facility may include detached decks not exceeding eight feet above
grade at any point or at-grade patios;
         (b)   The structure or facility is not in the Bluff Impact Zone;
         
(c)   The setback of the structure or facility from the ordinary high water level
must be at least ten feet;
         
(d)   The structure is not a boathouse or boat storage structure as defined under
Minnesota Statutes, Section 103G.245;
         (e)   The structure or facility must be treated to reduce
visibility as viewed from
public waters and adjacent shorelands by vegetation, topography, increased
setbacks or color, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions;
         
(f)   The room may be used as an open air deck with safety rails but must not be
enclosed with a roof or sidewalls or used as a storage area;
         
(g)   The structure or facility must not be designed or used for human habitation
and must not contain water supply or sewage treatment facilities;
         (h)   As an alternative for general development and recreational
development waterbodies, water-

      1.   When possible, existing natural drainageways, and vegetated soil
surfaces shall be used to convey, store, filter, and retain stormwater runoff
before discharge to public waters.
      2.   Development shall be planned and conducted in a manner that will
minimize the extent of disturbed areas, runoff velocities, erosion potential,
and reduce and delay runoff volumes. Disturbed areas shall be stabilized and
protected as soon as possible and facilities or methods used which will retain
sediment on the site.
      3.   When development density, topographic features, and soil and
vegetation conditions are not sufficient to adequately handle stormwater runoff
using natural features and vegetation, constructed facilities such as
diversions, settling basins, skimming devices, dikes, waterways, and ponds
shall be used. Preference shall be given to designs using surface drainage,
vegetation, and infiltration rather than buried pipes and man-made materials
and facilities.
      4.   Impervious surface coverage of lots must not exceed 25 percent of

semipublic uses with similar needs to have access to and use of public waters
may be located on parcels or lots with frontage on public waters and shall
comply with the following standards:
            (a)   The use must be designed to incorporate topographic and
vegetative screening of parking areas and structures.
            (b)   Uses that require short-term watercraft mooring for patrons
must be centralized and designed to avoid obstructions of navigation and to be
the minimum size necessary to meet the need.
            (c)   Uses that depend on patrons arriving by watercraft may use
signs and lighting to convey needed information to the public, subject to the
following general standards:
               (1)   No advertising signs or supporting facilities for signs
may be placed in or upon public waters. Signs conveying information or safety
messages may be placed in or on public waters by a public authority or under a
permit issued by the county sheriff.
               (2)   Signs may be placed, when necessary, within the shore
impact zone if they are designed and sized to be the minimum necessary to
convey needed information. They shall only convey the location and name of the
establishment and the general types of goods or services available. The signs
shall not contain other detailed information such as product brands and prices,
shall not be located higher than ten feet above the ground, and shall not
exceed 32 square feet in size. If illuminated by artificial lights, the lights
shall be shielded or directed to prevent illumination out across public waters.
               (3)   Other outside lighting may be located within the shore
impact zone or over public waters if it is used primarily to illuminate
potential safety hazards and is shielded or otherwise directed to prevent
direct illumination out across public waters. This does not preclude use of
navigational lights.
      2.   Uses without water-oriented needs shall be located on lots or
parcels without public water frontage, or, if located on lots or parcels with
public water frontage, shall either be set back double the normal ordinary high
water level setback or be substantially screened from view from the water by
topography or vegetation, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions.
   G.   Agriculture Use Standards.
      1.   General cultivation farming, grazing, nurseries, horticulture, truck
farming, sod farming, and wild crop harvesting are permitted uses if steep
slopes and shore and bluff impact zones are maintained in permanent vegetation
or operated under a conservation plan approved by the Zoning Administrator. The
shore impact zone for permitted agricultural land uses shall be 50 feet.
      2.   Animal feedlots shall meet the following standards:
            (a)   New feedlots shall not be located in the shoreland of
watercourses or in bluff impact zones and shall meet a minimum setback of 300
feet from the ordinary high water level of all public waters basins.
            (b)   Modifications or expansions to existing feedlots that are
located within 300 feet of the ordinary high water level or within a bluff
impact zone are allowed if they do not further encroach into the existing
ordinary high water level setback or encroach on bluff impact zones.
   H.   Extractive Use Standards.
      1.   An extractive use site development and reclamation plan shall be
developed, approved, and followed over the course of operation of the site. The
plan shall address, at a minimum, dust, noise, possible pollutant discharges,
hours and duration of operation, and anticipated vegetative and topographic
alterations. It shall all identify actions to be taken during operation to
mitigate adverse environmental impacts, particularly erosion, and shall clearly
explain how the site will be reclaimed after extractive activities are
terminated.

ARTICLE II
DEFINITIONS
SECTION 7F-200.   DEFINITIONS.
   The following words and phrases shall have the following meanings:
      1.   Accessory Use or Structure – a use or structure on the same lot
with, and of a nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal
use or structure.
      2.   Basement – means any area of a structure, including crawl spaces,
having its floor or base subgrade (below ground level) on all four sides,
regardless of the depth of excavation below ground level.
      3.   Conditional Use – means a specific type of structure or land use
listed in the official control that may be allowed but only after an in-depth
review procedure and with appropriate conditions or restrictions as provided in
the official zoning controls or building codes and upon a finding that:
            (a)   Certain conditions as detailed in the zoning ordinance exist.
            (b)   The structure and/or land use conform to the comprehensive
land use plan and are compatible with the existing neighborhood.
      4.   Equal Degree of Encroachment – a method of determining the location
of floodway boundaries so that floodplain lands on both sides of a stream are
capable of conveying a proportionate share of flood flows.
      5.   Flood – a temporary increase in the flow or stage of a stream or in
the stage of a wetland or lake that results in the inundation of normally dry
areas.
      6.   Flood Frequency – the frequency for which it is expected that a
specific flood state or discharge may be equaled or exceeded.
      7.   Floor Fringe – that portion of the floodplain outside of the
floodway. Flood fringe is synonymous with the term “floodway fringe” used in
the Flood Insurance Study for Anoka County.
      8.   Floodplain – the beds proper and the areas adjoining a wetland, lake
or watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regional
flood.
      9.   Flood Proofing – a combination of structural provisions, changes, or
adjustments to properties and structures subject to flooding, primarily for the
reduction or elimination of flood damages.
      10.   Floodway – the bed of a wetland or lake and the channel of a
watercourse and those portions of the adjoining floodplain which are reasonably
required to carry or store the regional flood discharge.
      11.   Lowest Floor – the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area,
including but not limited to unfinished floors, basement, crawl space, storage
space, and garage floor, but excepting allowable flood-proofed spaces
identified in Section
7F-450D. of this Ordinance.
      12.   Manufactured Home – a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The
term “manufactured home” does not include the term “recreational vehicle.”
      13.   Obstruction – any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile,
abutment, projection, excavation, channel modification, culvert, building,
wire, fence, stockpile, refuse, fill, structure, or matter in, along, across,
or projecting into any channel, watercourse, or regulatory floodplain which may
impede retard, or change the direction of the flow of water, either in itself
or by catching or collecting debris carried by such water.
      14.   Principal Use of Structure – means all uses or structures that are
not accessory uses or structures.
      15.   Reach – a hydraulic engineering term to describe a longitudinal
segment of a stream or river influenced by a natural or man-made obstruction.
In an urban area, the segment of a stream or river between two consecutive
bridge crossings would most typically constitute a reach.
      16.   Recreational Vehicle – a vehicle that is built on a single chassis,
is 400 square feet or less when measured at the larges projection, is designed
to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and is
designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living
quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. For the purposes
of this Ordinance, the term recreational vehicle shall be synonymous with the
term travel trailer/travel vehicle.
      17.   Regional Flood – a flood which is representative of large floods
knows to have occurred generally in Minnesota and reasonably characteristic of
what can be expected to occur on an average frequency in the magnitude of the
100-year recurrence interval. Regional flood is synonymous with the term “base
flood” used in a fixed insurance study.
      18.   Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation – the regulatory flood
protection elevation shall be an elevation no lower than two feet above the
elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation caused by
encroachments on the floodplain that result from designation of a floodway.
      19.   Structure – anything constructed or erected on the ground or
attached to the ground or on-site utilities, including, but not limited to,
buildings, factories, sheds, detached garages, cabins, manufactured homes,
recreational vehicles not meeting the exemption criteria specified in Article
VII of this Ordinance and other similar items.
      20.   Substantial Damage – means damage of any origin sustained by a
structure where the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged
condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
      21.   Substantial Improvement – within any consecutive 365-day period,
any reconstruction, rehabilitation (including normal maintenance and repair),
repair after damage, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of
which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the “start of construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures
which have incurred “substantial damage,” regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include either:
            (a)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct
existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code
specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement
official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
            (b)   Any alteration of an “historic structure,” provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an
“historic structure.” For the purpose of this Ordinance, “historic structure”
shall be as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 59.1.
      22.   Variance – means a modification of a specific permitted development
standard required in an official control including this Ordinance to allow an
alternative development standard not stated as acceptable in the official
control, but only as applied to a particular property for the purpose of
alleviating a practical difficulty as defined and elaborated upon in the City’s
planning and zoning enabling legislation.

ARTICLE IV
ESTABLISHMENT OF OVERLAY ZONING DISTRICTS
SECTION 7F-400.   FLOODPLAIN DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED.
The following zoning districts are established as overlay districts in
conjunction with the zoning districts established in
Chapter 7A (Columbus Zoning Ordinance) of the Columbus City Code:
FP   General Floodplain District
FW   Floodway District
FF   Flood Fringe District
   A.   The FP District includes those areas designated as unnumbered “A Zones”
(approximately 100-year flood frequency areas) on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
in the City of Columbus. The FP District contains both the FW District and the
FF District, that have yet to be determined, as required in Section
7F-420 and Section
7F-430, below.
   B.   The FW District includes the bed of wetlands and lakes, the channel of
a watercourse, and those portions of the adjoining floodplain which are
reasonably required to carry or store the regional flood discharge.
   C.   The FF District is the area outside of the FW District but within the
FP District that has been or may be subject to flooding.
SECTION 7F-410.   ZONING MAP.
   A.   The following maps together with the accompanying materials are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of the Official Zoning Map and
this ordinance. The accompanying materials include the Flood Insurance Study
for Anoka County, Minnesota, and Incorporated Areas and the Flood Insurance
Rate Map panels enumerated below, all dated December 16, 2015 and prepared by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency. These materials are on file in the
Office of the City Clerk and Zoning Administrator.
   27003C0210E
   27003C0220E
   27003C0230E
   27003C0235E
   27003C0240E
   27003C0245E
   27003C0335E
   27003C0355E
   27003C0360EB.
Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of
the floodplain districts as shown on the Official Zoning Map, all decisions
will be based on available elevations on the regional (100-year) flood profile,
the ground elevations that existed on the site on January 16, 1980,
determinations by watershed authorities, and other available technical data.
Persons contesting the location of the district boundaries shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to submit technical evidence and to present their case
to the Board of Adjustments and Appeals.
[§ 7F-410 is amended by Ord. NO. 15-05, effective December 10, 2015.]
SECTION 7F-420.   FLOODWAY AND FLOOD FRINGE AREA DETERMINATIONS.
   A.   Upon receipt of an application for a permit or other approval for a use
on property which appears to be located within the General Floodplain District,
other than those uses allowed in Section
7F-440A. and meeting the standards in Section
7F-440B., the applicant shall be required to furnish as much of the following
information as is deemed necessary by the Zoning Administrator for the
determination of the regulatory flood protection elevation and whether the
proposed uses is within the Floodway or Flood Fringe District.
      1.   A typical valley cross-section(s) showing the channel of the stream,
elevation of land areas adjoining each side of the channel, cross-sectional
areas to be occupied by the proposed development, and high water information.
      2.   Plan (surface view) showing elevations or contours of the ground,
pertinent structure, fill, or storage elevations, the size, location, and
spatial arrangement of all proposed and existing structures on the site, and
the location and elevations of streets.
      3.   Photographs showing existing land uses, vegetation upstream and
downstream, and soil types.
      4.   Profile showing the slope of the bottom of the channel or flow line
of the stream for at least 500 feet in either direction from the proposed
development.
   B.   The applicant shall be responsible to submit one copy of the above
information to a designated agency, engineer, or other expert person for
technical assistance in determining whether the proposed use is in the Floodway
or Flood Fringe district to determine the regulatory flood protection
elevation. If a 100-year flood elevation is provided in the Flood Insurance
Study adopted in Section
7F-410 of this Ordinance, then this elevation must be used in calculating the
regulatory flood protection elevation. Procedures consistent with Minnesota
Regulations 1983, Parts 6120.5000 – 6120.6200 and 44 Code of Federal
Regulations Part 65 shall be followed in this expert evaluation. The designated
engineer or expert is strongly encouraged to discuss the proposed technical
evaluation methodology with the respective Department of Natural Resources’
Area Hydrologist prior to commencing the analysis. The designated engineer or
expert shall:
      1.   Estimate the peak discharge of the regional flood.
      2.   Calculate the water surface profile of the regional flood based upon
a hydraulic analysis of the stream channel and overbank areas.
      3.   Compute the floodway necessary to convey or store the regional flood
without increasing flood stages more than 0.5 foot. A lesser stage increase
than .5’ shall be required if, as a result of the additional state increase,
increased flood damages would result. An equal degree of encroachment on both
sides of the stream within the reach shall be assumed in computing floodway
boundaries.
   C.   The Zoning Administrator shall present the technical evaluation and
findings of the designated engineer or expert to the City Council. The City
Council must formally accept the technical evaluation and the recommended
Floodway and/or Flood Fringe District boundary or deny the permit application.
The City Council, prior to official action, may submit the application and all
supporting data and analyses to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the
Department of Natural Resources or the Planning Commission for review and
comment. Once the Floodway and Flood Fringe District Boundaries have been
determined, the City Council shall refer the matter back to the Zoning
Administrator who shall process the permit application consistent with the
applicable provisions of this Ordinance.

      8.   Structural works for flood control such as levees, dikes and
floodwalls constructed to any height where the intent is to protect individual
structures and levees or dikes where the intent is to protect agricultural
crops for a frequency flood event equal to or less than the 10-year frequency
flood event.
   D.   Standards for Floodway Conditional Uses:
      1.   All Uses. No structure (temporary or permanent), fill (including
fill for roads and levees), deposit obstruction, storage of materials or
equipment, or other uses may be allowed as a conditional use that will cause
any increase in the stage of the 100-year or regional flood or cause an
increase in flood damages in the reach or reaches affected.
      2.   All Floodway conditional uses shall be subject to the procedures and
standards contained in this Ordinance and
Chapter 7A (Zoning Ordinance) of the City Code.
      3.   The conditional uses shall only be permissible if allowed in the
underlying zoning district.
      4.   Fill:
            (a)   Fill, dredge spoil, and all other similar materials deposited
or stored in the floodplain shall be protected from erosion by vegetative
cover, mulching, riprap or other acceptable method.
            (b)   Dredge spoil sites and sand and gravel operations shall not
be allowed in the floodway unless a long-term site development plan is
submitted which includes an erosion/sedimentation prevention element to the
plan.
            (c)   As an alternative, and consistent with subsection (b)
immediately above, dredge spoil disposal and sand and gravel operations may
allow temporary, on-site storage of fill or other materials which would have
caused an increase to the stage of the 100-year or regional flood but only
after the City Council has received an appropriate plan which assures the
removal of the materials from the floodway based upon the flood warning time
available. The conditional use permit must be title registered with the
property in the Office of the County Recorder.
      5.   Accessory Structures:
            (a)   Accessory structures shall not be designed for human
habitation.
            (b)   Accessory structures, if permitted, shall be constructed and
placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the flow
of flood waters:
               (1) Whenever possible, structures shall be constructed with the
longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow; and
               (2) So far as practicable, structures shall be placed
approximately on the same flood flow lines as those of adjoining structures.
            (c)   Accessory structures shall be elevated on fill or
structurally dry flood proofed in accordance with FP-1 or FP-2 flood proofing
classifications in the State Building Code. As an alternative, an accessory
structure may be flood proofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 flood proofing
classification in the State Building Code provided the accessory structure
constitutes a minimal investment, does not exceed 500 square feet in size at
its largest projections, and for a detached garage, the detached garage must be
used solely for parking of vehicles and limited storage. All flood proofed
accessory structures must meet the following additional standards:
               (1) The structure must be adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure and shall be designed
to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls;
               (2) Any mechanical and utility equipment in a structure must be
elevated to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or properly
flood proofed; and
               (3) To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there
must be a minimum of two “automatic” openings in the outside walls of the
structure having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every
square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. There must be openings on a
least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings must be no
higher than one foot above the lowest adjacent grade to the structure. Using
human intervention to open a garage door prior to flooding will not satisfy
this requirement for automatic openings
      6.   Storage of Materials and Equipment:
            (a)   The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of
flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or
plant life is prohibited.
            (b)   Storage of other materials or equipment, subject to the
provisions of the underlying zoning district established in
Chapter 7A (Zoning Ordinance) of the City Code, may be allowed if readily
removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning and in
accordance with a plan approved by the City Council.
      7.   Structural works for flood control that will change the course,
current or cross section of protected wetlands or public waters shall be
subject to the provisions of Minnesota Statute, Chapter 103G.
Community-wide structural works for flood control intended to remove areas from
the regulatory floodplain shall not be allowed in the floodway.
      8.   A levee, dike or floodwall constructed in the floodway shall not
cause an increase to the 100-year or regional flood and the technical analysis
must assume equal conveyance or storage loss on both sides of the a stream.
   E.   Interim Uses. (This section reserved for future use).
   F.   Standards for Interim Uses. The Standards for Floodway Conditional Uses
Section
7F-440D. apply to interim uses allowed in this section.
   G.   Dimensional Standards. Dimensional standards in the FW District shall
be consistent with those applicable in the underlying zoning district
established in
Chapter 7A (Zoning Ordinance) of the City Code, except as modified by this
Ordinance.
   H.   Other Applicable Provisions. All other provisions of this Ordinance and
Chapter 7A (Zoning Ordinance) shall apply to the FW District, including but not
limited to performance standards, general provision, administrative provisions,
and enforcement.
SECTION 7F-450.   FF FLOOD FRINGE DISTRICT
   A.   Permitted Uses. Permitted uses shall be those permissible uses of land
allowed in the underlying zoning district (permitted uses, conditional uses,
and interim uses) established in
Chapter 7A (Zoning Ordinance) of the City Code that comply with the underlying
zoning district requirements and the “Standards for Flood Fringe District
Permitted Uses” listed in Section
7F-450E.
   B.   Standards for Flood Fringe Permitted Uses.
      1.   All structures, accessory structures, and temporary construction
uses and structures, including but not limited to fuel tanks, transportable
construction offices, and portable toilets, must be elevated on fill so that
the lowest floor including basement floor is at or above the regulatory flood
protection elevation. The finished fill elevation for structures shall be not
lower than one (1) foot below the regulatory flood protection elevation and the
fill shall extend at such elevation at least fifteen (15) feet beyond the
outside limits of the structure erected thereon.
      2.   As an alternative to elevation on fill, accessory structures that
constitute a minimal investment and that do not exceed 500 square feet at its
largest projection may be internally flood proofed in accordance with Section
7F-440D.5(c) of this Ordinance.
      3.   The cumulative placement of fill where at any one time in excess of
one-thousand (1,000) cubic yards of fill is located on the parcel shall be
allowable only as a conditional use, unless said fill is specifically intended
to elevate a structure in accordance with this Ordinance.
      4.   The storage of any materials or equipment shall be elevated on fill
to the regulatory flood protection elevation.
      5.   The provisions of Section
7F-450E. of this ordinance shall apply.
   C.   Conditional Uses. Conditional uses shall be those uses of land allowed
in the underlying zoning district established in
Chapter 7A (Zoning Ordinance) of the City Code that do not comply with the
“Standards for Flood Fringe District Permitted Uses” listed in Section
7F-450B. All conditional uses shall comply with the “Standards for Flood Fringe
District Conditional Uses” listed in Section
7F-450D. and the “Standards for all Flood Fringe Uses” listed in Section
7F-450E. Any structure that is not elevated on fill or flood proofed in
accordance with Section
7F-450B. of This Ordinance shall only be allowable as a conditional use. All
Flood Fringe conditional uses shall be subject to the procedures and standards
contained in this Ordinance and
Chapter 7A (Zoning Ordinance) of the City Code.
   D.   Standards for Flood Fringe Conditional Uses.
      1.   Alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill may be
utilized to elevate a structure’s lowest floor above the regulatory flood
protection elevation. These alternative methods may include the use of stilts,
pilings, parallel walls, etc., or above-grade, enclosed areas such as crawl
spaces or tuck under garages. The base or floor of an enclosed area shall be
considered above-grade and not a structure’s basement or lowest floor if: 1)
the enclosed area is above-grade on at least one side of the structure; 2) it
is designed to internally flood and is constructed with flood resistant
materials; and 3) it is used solely for parking of vehicles, building access or
storage. The above-noted alternative elevation methods are subject to the
following additional standards:
            (a)   Design and Certification – The structure’s design and as-
built condition must be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect as being in compliance with the general design standards of the State
Building Code and, specifically, that all electrical, heating, ventilation,
plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities must be at
or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or be designed to prevent
flood water from entering or accumulating within these components during times
of flooding.
            (b)   Specific Standards for Above-grade, Enclosed Areas – Above-
grade, fully enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages must be
designed to internally flood and the design plans must stipulate:
               (1)   A minimum area of “Automatic” openings in the walls where
internal flooding is to be used as a flood proofing technique. There shall be a
minimum of two openings on at least two sides of the structure and the bottom
of all openings shall be no higher than one-foot above grade. The automatic
openings shall have a minimum net area of not less than one square inch for
every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding unless a registered
professional engineer or architect certifies that a smaller net area would
suffice. The automatic openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves,
or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exist of flood waters without any form of human intervention; and
               (2)   That the enclosed area will be designed of flood resistant
materials in accordance with the FP-3 or FP-4 classifications in the State
Building Code and shall be used solely for building access, parking of vehicles
or storage.
      2.   Basements, as defined in this Ordinance, shall be subject to the
following:
            (a)   Residential basement construction shall not be allowed below
the regulatory flood protection elevation.
            (b)   Non-residential basements may be allowed below the regulatory
flood protection elevation provided in the basement is structurally dry flood
proofed in accordance with this Ordinance.
      3.   All areas of non residential structures including basements to be
placed below the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be flood proofed
in accordance with the structurally dry flood proofing classifications in the
State Building Code. Structurally dry flood proofing must meet the FP-1 or FP-
2 flood proofing classification in the State Building Code and this shall
require making the structure watertight with the walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of
buoyancy. Structures flood proofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 classification shall not
be permitted.
      4.   When at any one time more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill or other
similar material is located on a parcel for such activities as on-site storage,
landscaping, sand and gravel operations, roads, or construction of flood
control works, an erosion/sedimentation control plan must be submitted unless
the community is enforcing a state approved shoreland management ordinance. In
the absence of a state approved shoreland ordinance, the plan must clearly
specify methods to be used to stabilize the fill on site for a flood event at a
minimum of the 100-year or regional flood event. The plan must be prepared and
certified by a registered professional engineer or other qualified individual
acceptable to the City Council. The plan may incorporate alternative procedures
for removal of the material from the floodplain if adequate flood warning time
exists.
      5.   Storage of Materials and Equipment:
            (a)   The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of
flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or
plant life is prohibited.
            (b)   Storage of other materials or equipment, subject to the
provisions of the underlying zoning district established in
Chapter 7A (Zoning Ordinance) of the City Code, may be allowed if readily
removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning and in
accordance with a plan approved by the City Council.
      6.   The provisions of subsection E. Below shall also apply.
   E.   Standards for All Flood Fringe Uses.
      1.   All new principal structures must have vehicular access at or above
an elevation not more than two (2) feet below the regulatory flood protection
elevation. If a variance to this requirement is granted, the Board of
Adjustments and Appeals must specify limitations on the period of use or
occupancy of the structure for times of flooding and only after determining
that adequate flood warning time and local flood emergency response procedures
exist.
      2.   Commercial Uses – accessory land uses, such as yards, railroad
tracks, and parking lots may be at elevations lower that the regulatory flood
protection elevation. However, a permit for such facilities to be used by the
employees or the general public shall not be granted in the absence of a flood
warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area would be
inundated to a depth and velocity such that when multiplying the depth (in
feet) times the velocity (in feet per second) the product number exceeds four
(4) upon occurrence of the regional flood.
      3.   Manufacturing and Industrial Uses – measures shall be taken to
minimize interference with normal plan operations especially along streams
having protracted flood durations. Certain accessory land uses such as yards
and parking lots maybe at lower elevations subject to requirements set out in
this Section. In considering permit applications, due consideration shall be
given to needs of an industry whose business requires that it be located in
floodplain areas.
      4.   Fill shall be property compacted and the slopes shall be properly
protected by the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable method.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for
removing the special flood hazard area designation for certain structures
properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevations – FEMA’s
requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection
standards for multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should
be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of
special flood hazard area designation will be requested.
      5.   Floodplain developments shall not adversely affect the hydraulic
capacity of the channel and adjoining floodplain of any tributary watercourse
or drainage system where a floodway or other encroachment limit has not been
specified in the Official Zoning Map.
      6.    Standards for recreational vehicles are contained in Article VII.
      7.    Temporary construction uses and structures, including but not
limited to fuel tanks, transportable construction offices, and portable
toilets, shall not be located in the FF District unless the standards in
Section
7F-450B.1. re met.
   F.   Interim Uses. Interim uses shall be those interim uses of land allowed
in the underlying zoning district established in
Chapter 7A (Zoning Ordinance) of the City Code, and as allowed in this Section.
   G.   Standards for Interim Uses. The “Standards for Flood Fringe Conditional
Uses,” Section
7F-450D, and the “Standards for All Flood Fringe Uses,” Section
7F-450E, apply to interim uses allowed in this Section.
   H.   Dimensional Standards. Dimensional standards in the FF District shall
be consistent with those applicable in the underlying zoning district
established in
Chapter 7A (Zoning Ordinance) of the City Code, except as modified by this
Ordinance.
   I.   Other Applicable Provisions. All other provisions of this Ordinance and
Chapter 7A (Zoning Ordinance) shall apply to the FF District, including but not
limited to performance standards, general provisions, administrative
provisions, and enforcement.

SECTION 7F-520.   REMOVAL OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA DESIGNATION.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for
removing the special flood hazard area designation for certain structures
properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation. FEMA’s
requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection
standards for multi-lot developments. These standards should be investigated
prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of special flood hazard
area designation will be requested.
ARTICLE VI

SECTION 8-502.   PRELIMINARY PLAT APPROVAL.
   A.   The Planning Commission may recommend and the City Council may require
such changes or revisions as deemed necessary for the health, safety, general
welfare and convenience of the City. The City Council may deny a subdivision
application if it has been determined that the property does not comply with
the requirements of this ordinance, is not consistent with the Comprehensive
Plan, or is not consistent with the Zoning Ordinance or other parts of the City
Code.
   B.   Approval of a preliminary plat by the City Council means that the
general layout of the plat is acceptable. Subsequent approval will be required
of the engineering proposals, pertaining to water supply, storm drainage, and
sewage disposal, sidewalks, gas and electric service, minimum finished floor
elevations, minimum finished grade elevations, grading, stormwater management,
gradients and roadway widths and surfacing of streets.
   C.   The approval of a preliminary plat shall be null and void unless a
final plat or plats, that is prepared in accordance with the conditions of the
preliminary plat approval that was granted by the City Council, is submitted to
the Zoning Administrator one year from the date of the last required approval
of the preliminary plat.
   D.   No plan will be approved for a subdivision which covers an area subject
to periodic flooding or which has a relatively high water table (evidenced by
water or mottled soil) or which contains extremely poor drainage facilities and
which would make adequate drainage of the streets and lots impossible, unless
the applicant agrees to make improvements which will, in the opinion of the
City Engineer, make the area completely safe for occupancy, and provide
adequate street and lot drainage.
   E.   No lot, parcel or tract of resubdivision land shall be subdivided by
the proposed plat boundary to create a residue parcel of metes-and-bounds
description lying outside the proposed plat boundary.
   F.   If the preliminary plat is not approved by the City Council, the
reasons for such action shall be recorded in the proceedings of the City
Council and transmitted in writing to the applicant, together with notification
to the applicant that he/she has thirty days from the date of the City
Council's decision to apply for an extension of time in which to correct the
preliminary plat.

SECTION 8-503.   ENVIRONMENTAL EVALUATION OF AREAS TO BE DEDICATED TO THE
PUBLIC.
Land areas to be dedicated to the City may be required to have an environmental
evaluation completed prior to transfer of title as determined by the Zoning
Administrator or City Council. This section applies to land areas to be
dedicated to the City in either fee title or easement title, whether by
dedication of the whole parcel or a fractional part (e.g., easement corridors)
and all fill material placed on land areas to be dedicated to the City, such as
streets, alleys, drainage and utility easements, and parkland or conservation
areas shall be environmentally tested and evaluated according to the
requirements of this section.
   A.   Evaluation Requirements.
      1.   All environmental evaluations, studies, inspections, and tests shall
be conducted at the expense of the applicant.
      2.   The applicant shall reimburse the City, when billed, for the
services of the City Environmental Engineer, if the City Environmental Engineer
has been utilized.
      3.   At the applicant's expense, the applicant's surveyor shall place and
maintain either permanent or temporary staking sufficient to identify the
location of all proposed dedications for the purposes of environmental
evaluation.
      4.   The environmental testing and evaluation required by this shall be
conducted in such detail as is required by the City Council, in its sole and
absolute discretion, to provide necessary protections from environmental
liability arising under all federal, state, and local laws, regulations, rules,
or ordinances.
      5.   The Environmental Engineer who conducts the environmental evaluation
shall submit an original signed report or opinion letter, addressed to the
applicant and the City Council, containing data, findings and conclusions in a
form which complies with the requirements of the City Council.
      6.   Samples of fill material to be placed in the dedications shall be
laboratory tested according to the standards established by the Minnesota
Pollution Control Agency.
      7.   All environmental evaluations, studies, inspections, and tests shall
be conducted with the purpose of disclosing the presence of, the release of, or
the threatened release of "Hazardous Substances" as defined in Section 8-201
(A).
   B.   During Preliminary Plat Proceedings.
      1.   If the applicant is confident that the proposed preliminary plat
complies with the design requirements of the City Code, then the applicant is
advised to arrange environmental evaluation of the dedications with the
Environmental Engineer at the earliest possible date. If the applicant is not
confident that the proposed preliminary plat complies with the design
requirements of the City Code, then the applicant is advised to wait until the
plat design is approved before proceeding with environmental testing of the
dedications. In any case, the applicant is advised to refrain from placing fill
in the dedications prior to environmental testing to not increase the
difficulty and the costs of the testing.
      2.   Notwithstanding any of the time periods stated elsewhere in the City
Code or in Minnesota Statutes, the preliminary plat shall not receive approval
by the Planning Commission until complete reports of environmental testing of
the dedications have been submitted to the City in a form satisfactory to the
City Engineer and the City Attorney. If satisfactory environmental reports have
not been received and approved by the City within 180 days after the Zoning
Administrator's receipt of a completed application [§8-500(2) above], then the
Planning Commission shall advise the City Council to deny approval of the
preliminary plat.
      3.   If satisfactory environmental reports are received and all platting
requirements are met, the Planning Commission shall then recommend approval of
the preliminary plat. If the environmental reports indicate that a hazardous or
toxic material, as defined by state or federal law, has been released into the
soil or groundwater, then the Planning Commission shall advise the City
Council:
         a)   to deny approval of the plat, or
         b)   by written agreement with the applicant, to indefinitely suspend
further City proceedings in consideration of the plat until on-site remediation
and satisfactory reinspection can occur.
   C.   During Final Plat Proceedings. The environmental evaluations required
during preliminary plat procedures (B., above) are presumed to be sufficient to
disclose any pre-existing environmental problems. However, after the
preliminary plat has been approved, new environmental problems may be disclosed
through additional testing of the dedications or through testing of the fill
material. In the event that such later testing indicates that a hazardous or
toxic material, as defined by state or federal law, has been released or is
likely to be released into the soil or groundwater, then the City Council shall
either deny approval of the final plat or by written agreement with the
applicant, indefinitely suspend further City proceedings in consideration of
the plat until on-site remediation and satisfactory reinspection can occur.

SECTION 8-713.   LOTS.
   A.   Location. All lots shall abut and take primary access from a publicly
dedicated street or a street that has received legal status as such, by their
full frontage, except where specifically allowed under
Chapter 7A.
   B.   Size and Dimensions. All lot sizes and dimensions shall comply with the
provisions of the zoning district in which they are located as established in
Chapter 7A Zoning Ordinance. Lot sizes may be reduced in proportion to the area
within the subdivision dedicated to right-of-way for streets, provided the
overall lot density within the subdivision is not increased and the minimum lot
size, after deducting the area allocated to the street right-of-way, is not
less than four and one-half (4 1/2) acres.

be less than the required minimum, but in no case less than 60 feet, if, at the
building set-back line, there is a width equal to the required minimum frontage
and the lot has the required number of square feet.
   F.   Water Courses. Lots abutting upon a water course, drainage way, channel
or stream shall have an additional depth or width, as required, to assure house
sites that are not subject to flooding, inadequate drainage, or ground water
which interferes with water supply or sanitary sewer.
   G.   Natural Features. In the subdividing of any land, due regard shall be
shown for all natural features, such as tree growth, water courses, marshes,
historic spots or similar conditions, which if preserved will add
attractiveness and stability to the proposed development.
   H.   Remnants. All remnants of lots below minimum size, left over after
subdividing of a larger tract, must be added to adjacent lots.

SECTION 8-714.   DEDICATIONS OF PUBLIC LANDS.
Dedication or Cash Payment. The following provisions have been established and
are applicable to all subdivisions to conserve and preserve areas of natural
beauty such as marshes, wetlands, woods, streams and ponds, and to establish
public parks, public trails, playgrounds, and open spaces within appropriate
areas of the City:
   A.   An area equal to not more than 10% of all subdivisions located within
SR zoning districts, 5% of all subdivisions located within RR zoning districts
and 2.5% of subdivisions located within CR, HR, CS, LI, and C/I zoning
districts shall be dedicated for public uses including parks, trails,
playgrounds, woodlands, and open spaces in locations to be determined by the
City Council. Dedicated lands shall be suitable for public use as determined by
the City Council. The City may accept cash in lieu of land dedication. The City
shall not be required to accept land that is not suitable for the desired
public use or would require extensive public investment to accommodate such
public use. Nothing shall prevent the City from accepting more than the minimum
percentage of dedicated land prescribed in this Section. Any land to be
publicly dedicated shall be designated as an "Outlot" on the subdivision plat
and ultimately conveyed to the City by warranty deed. The costs of such
conveyance and title review shall be that of the subdivider. The boundaries of
all lands so dedicated shall be properly marked by monuments as required by
this Chapter and the City Engineer.
   B.   The City shall have the option to require a cash contribution in lieu
of dedication pursuant to the preceding paragraph or to require a portion of
the land and a cash contribution in lieu of the balance thereof. Any such cash
contribution shall be allocated on a per lot basis, based upon the estimated
market value of the same or similar lands as determined annually by the City
Council in consultation with the Anoka County Assessor. Such cash payment must
be received by the City Clerk prior to final approval of the subdivision.

City Roadway Specifications and Construction and Inspection Requirements as
amended from time to time by the City Council and available at the City Hall.
      3.   All streets, roadways and alleys within subdivisions shall be paved
except that the City Council may permit a gravel surface if it finds that:
         a)   The proposed new road will meet an existing gravel road;
         b)   The length of the proposed new road is too short to be desirable
for city maintenance purposes;
         c)   The length of the proposed new road is too short to be
economically justified; or
         d)   The proposed new road will provide public access to only one
historically landlocked parcel and the proposed new road will terminate at the

any required improvement, then the subdivider or owner of property subdivided
shall deposit funds sufficient to complete the improvement as part of a future
public improvement project based upon the estimate of the City Engineer. The
deposit will be held in an interest bearing account for the benefit of the
owners of the property subdivided. At such time as the improvement is ordered,
the deposit, together with any interest on the deposit, will be credited
against any special assessments levied to fund the public improvement project.

individual sewage treatment systems shall be constructed in accordance with the
provisions of
Chapter 14 of this Code for lots where tests have indicated that individual
sewage treatment systems can function effectively.
[§ 8-800 F., formerly §8-900-6, amended June 11, 1982, by Ord. No. 82-2,
effective June 11, 1982.]

public sewage and utility systems. Where a new subdivision is designed so that
public health, safety, and welfare require connection of proposed new roads,
new water supplies and new sewage and utility systems to the stub or dead end
systems existing on adjacent lands, the applicant shall be required to obtain
easement rights for the benefit of the public over the adjacent lands. The
applicant shall also be required to pay for the installation of the connections
from existing roads and other public services. In lieu of the applicant's
acquisition of these easements, the applicant shall agree to reimburse the City
for the City's exercise of eminent domain in acquiring the easement(s)
necessary to facilitate the applicant's new plat.

SECTIONS 8-801 to 8-803. (Intentionally left blank).
SECTION 8-804.   CONSTRUCTION PLANS.
Construction plans for the required improvements shall be prepared at the
applicant’s expense, conform to general engineering standards and the
ordinances of the City, and be at a scale of no smaller than 1 inch = 50 feet.
The plans shall be prepared by a professional engineer who is licensed in the
State of Minnesota and shall contain his/her seal. The plans together with the
quantities of construction items shall be submitted to the City Engineer for
approval and estimate of the total cost of the required improvements. A
reproducible mylar (22 inches by 34 inches) of the construction plans approved
by the City Engineer and two paper prints shall be furnished to the City Clerk
before construction begins. Upon completion of the project, as-built drawings
of all improvements meeting City standards shall be submitted within 120 days
to the City and shall show the date of construction.

No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007.]
SECTION 8-806.   PAYMENT FOR INSTALLATION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
The required improvements shall be furnished and installed at the sole expense
of the applicant. However, in cases where the City Council would by general
policy only assess a part of the improvement cost to the improved property with
the remaining cost paid out of general tax levy, the City Council may make
provision for payment of a portion of the cost by the applicant and the
remaining portion of the cost by the City; and provide further, that if any
improvement installed within the subdivision will be of substantial benefit to
lands beyond the boundaries of the subdivision, the City Council may make
provision for causing a portion of the cost of the improvement, representing
the benefit of such lands, to be assessed against the same and in such case the
applicant will be required only to pay for such portion of the whole cost of
said improvement as will represent the benefit to the property within the
subdivision.
[§ 8-806, amended by Ord. No. 01-08, effective January 17, 2002, amended by
Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007.]
SECTION 8-807.   DEVELOPMENT CONTRACT REQUIRED.
A development contract is required if the applicant will be performing work on
behalf of the City. The development contract shall contain statutory guarantees
and other guarantees as required by the City Council. The development contract
shall be in form approved by the City Attorney. The development contract shall
be executed by the applicant, by the owners, by the encumbrances, and by any
other party having a record interest in the lands to be subdivided.
   A.   General Provisions. The approval of the final plat shall be conditioned
upon applicant entering into a written development contract with the City
requiring the applicant to furnish and construct the required improvements at
her/his sole cost and in accordance with plans and specifications and other
contract conditions approved by the City Council. The applicant shall enter
into a development contract prior to constructing any such improvements, which
includes the following provisions:
      1.   Authority of City Engineer. The contract shall include provisions
for supervision of construction details by the City Engineer and shall grant
authority to the City Engineer to coordinate the work to be done under the
contract by any subcontractors authorized to proceed thereunder and with any
other work being done or contracted by the City in the vicinity of the
subdivision.
      2.   Performance Deposit. The agreement shall require the applicant to
make a cash deposit or deliver an irrevocable bank letter of credit as security
for applicant's performance under the agreement. In the agreement, applicant
shall guarantee performance of the development contract and shall guarantee
payment to all persons who supply labor or materials to the work contemplated
by the contract. These guarantees shall be separately secured and funded or
bonded. The amount of the contract for the purposes of the financial guarantees
shall be 125% of the City Engineer's estimate of the total cost of the
improvements to be furnished under the contract, including the cost of
inspection by the City Engineer, and expenses or damages incurred by the City
incurred by the City for completion of the work in case of default of the
applicant. The guarantee for the payment of all persons who may supply labor
and material to the development shall be 100% of the contract amount, as
estimated by the City Engineer.
      3.   Completion. On request of the applicant, the contract may provide
provisions for completion of part or all of the improvements prior to
acceptance of the plat by the City Council. This provision shall allow for a
reduction in the amount of guarantees to a sum equal to the estimated cost of
the improvements completed prior to acceptance of the plat. This provision
shall require the amount of the guarantees to be equal to the estimated cost of
the improvements to be completed after the acceptance of the plat by the City
Council and an amount sufficient to guarantee completion of the contract. The
time for completion of the work and the several parts shall be determined by
the City Council upon recommendation of the City Engineer, after consultation
with the applicant. The time for completion shall be reasonable in relation to
the work to be done, the seasons of the year, and proper coordination with
constructive activities in the subdivision.
      4.   Inspections. The development contract shall include a provision
requiring all improvements to be inspected by the City Engineer during
construction at the expense of the applicant. The City Engineer shall provide a
completion report to the City Council and the City Council shall either note
its preliminary acceptance or rejection of the improvements. The performance
guarantee may be reduced by the City Council after preliminary acceptance to an
amount determined by the City Engineer to be sufficient to repair any required
improvements which fail after the first winter and spring thaw following the
completion report and which will guarantee completion of any unperformed
obligations.
      5.   Wetland Banking. The development contract shall require that all
deeds and other instruments conveying interests in all or a portion of the
property included within the subdivision (including the conveyance of each
individual lot) shall include such conditions and covenants as the City Council
deems necessary to put the grantees of such interests on notice of material
restrictions or encumbrances against the property (e.g. wetland restrictions,
ditch maintenance, drainage easements, etc.).
   B.   Hazardous Waste Indemnity. The development contract for a plat shall
include the landowner's and applicant's indemnification of the City for
hazardous waste liability occurring on the lands described in the plat. The
indemnification shall be substantially in the form of the Hazardous Waste
Indemnity Agreement included within the contract forms shown in appendix D1 to
this
Chapter 8 of the City Code, incorporated by reference. The development contract
shall be accompanied by an Owner's Affidavit (and by an Applicant's Affidavit
if the Applicant is not the same as the Owner) substantially in the form shown
at appendix D2 to this
Chapter 8 of the City Code, incorporated by reference. The form of the
Hazardous Waste Indemnity Agreement may be modified by resolution of the City
Council.
   C.   Other Required Plans or Work. The development contract and the
financial guarantees shall also serve to guarantee compliance with approved
plans and construction of required elements such as a Wetlands Mitigation or
Replacement Plan or Stormwater Management Plan or a similar environmental plan
which may be required by this City Code or by the regulations of any other
government agency having jurisdiction over the land affected by the
development.

SECTION 8-808.   IMPROVEMENTS COMPLETED PRIOR TO APPROVAL OF FINAL PLAT.
Approval of the final plat shall be conditioned upon applicant entering into a
development contract for construction of improvements. Improvements within a
subdivision which have been completed prior to application for approval of the
final plat or execution of the contract for installation of the required
improvements shall be accepted as equivalent improvements in compliance with
the requirements of these regulations only if the City Engineer shall certify
that the existing improvements conform to applicable City Standards. The City
Engineer shall certify the improvements only if he/she has been able to inspect
the construction of the improvements at all relevant stages and only if the
improvements have been constructed to City specifications.
[§ 8-808, amended by Ord. No. 01-08, effective January 17, 2002, amended by
Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007.]
SECTION 8-809.   REIMBURSEMENT TO CITY FOR FEES INCURRED.

planning consulting fees, wetlands evaluation fees, fees charged for evaluation
of stormwater management plans, environmental engineer fees, inspection fees
and fees for legal services reasonably incurred by the City in processing a
subdivision application under the terms of these regulations. The development
contract shall guarantee payment of these charges.

MINOR SUBDIVISIONS
SECTION 8-900.   RESERVED.
[§ 8-900, formerly § 8-1000, amended by Ord. No. 01-08, effective January 17,

marked Reserved by Ord. No. 08-02, effective March 6, 2008.]
SECTION 8-901.   LIMITATION ON CERTIFICATION AND RECORDING OF “ANCIENT” MINOR
SUBDIVISIONS.
By Resolution 82-8, dated September 8, 1982, filed with the Anoka County
Auditor and recorded with the Anoka County Recorder on September 24, 1982, as
Document No. 598119, the City Council adopted state laws which give the City
Council effective control over the recording of documents which cause the
subdividing of land. Prior to September 24, 1982, the City of Columbus had
ordinances which regulated the subdividing of land, but the City lacked
effective enforcement and monitoring laws. Since September 24, 1982, the City
Council has been presented a number of cases in which landowners have alleged
that a minor subdivision approval was granted to them prior to September 24,
1982, but that no deed or other document was recorded to consummate the minor
subdivision. Each of these cases involving “ancient” minor subdivisions has
been difficult and costly for the City to administer because of the quality of
records and the changes made to the City’s Subdivision Regulations (now
Chapter 8 of the City Code).
From the effective date of the ordinance incorporating this §8-901 into the
City Code, landowners who allege an “ancient” approval (i.e., before September
24, 1982) shall have until 5:00 p.m., Friday, September 23, 1988, to obtain the
City Clerk’s “Approved Subdivision” stamp (or similar City Clerk certification)
upon the instrument(s) of conveyance for a minor subdivision. A party alleging
an “ancient” approval of a minor subdivision must prove to the City Council by
a preponderance of the evidence that the minor subdivision was granted by a
past City Council. City Council minutes indicating approval are the best
evidence. Other forms of evidence may be considered by the City Council.
[§ 8-901, amended by Ord. No. 86-5, effective October 31, 1986, and Ord. No.

ARTICLE X.
LOT RECONFIGURATIONS.
SECTION 8-1001.   Intent.
The lot reconfiguration process is an administrative procedure to adjust a
common lot line affecting existing parcels. The city retains discretion to
require that any lot line reconfiguration occur through the subdivision
platting requirements of this chapter.
SECTION 8-1002.   Criteria for Lot Reconfiguration.
The lot reconfiguration procedure is subject to the following requirements and
criteria:
   A.   Lots must be existing lots of record;
   B.   Lots resulting from this procedure must be consistent with all
applicable zoning requirements, except a lot that is nonconforming prior to the
lot reconfiguration will have its nonconforming characteristics reduced or
eliminated through the reconfiguration;
   C.   The lot reconfiguration will not create a new lot, but will change the
shape, configuration, and legal description of the affected lots;
   D.   The proposed lot reconfiguration must be between two (2) or three (3)
contiguous lots;
   E.   The proposed lot reconfiguration will not result in the movement of a
lot line more than three hundred and fifty (350) feet;
   F.   If roadway, drainage and utility easements have not been previously
dedicated to the public, the landowners will grant an easement for such
purposes.
[§ 8-1002, amended by Ord. No. 20-04, effective September 3, 2020.]
SECTION 8-1003.   Procedure.
The following requirements will govern the lot reconfiguration process:
   A.   Requests for reconfiguration will be signed by the applicant and filed
with the Zoning Administrator. Additionally, if the applicant is not the fee
owner of the property, the fee owner's signature(s) will also be provided on
the application, or the applicant will provide separate written and signed
authorization for the application from the fee owner(s). Such application will
be accompanied by: (1) a fee as set forth by the City's adopted fee schedule;
and (2) detailed written and graphic materials fully explaining the request.
The application will be considered as being officially submitted and complete
when the applicant has provided the required materials as specified in this
Article.
   B.   The Zoning Administrator will review the application and required
information to determine conformance with the Comprehensive Plan, Zoning Code
and all other provisions of the City Code. The Zoning Administrator will make a
final determination to approve or deny the application. In reviewing the
application, the Zoning Administrator may request comments from its consultants
and may refer the matter to the Planning Commission, if necessary.
   C.   Approval or denial of a lot reconfiguration application under this
Article may be appealed to the City Council. If an appeal of the Zoning
Administrator is filed, a public hearing will be scheduled before the City
Council following publication of notice.
   D.   After the City approves the lot reconfiguration, each of the
reconfigured lots must be approved by the Anoka County auditor for a single
property tax identification number.
SECTION 8-1004.   Required Materials.
The following information will be submitted with the application for lot
reconfiguration. The applicant will submit a minimum of 3 large scale copies
and 2 reduced scale (11” x 17”) copies of all graphics, which include the
following:
   A.   A certificate of survey prepared by a registered land surveyor which
includes:
      1.   Graphical scale not more than 1 inch equals 100 feet.
      2.   North point indication.
      3.   Original and proposed lot boundaries.
      4.   Existing and resulting parcel legal descriptions.
      5.   The location of existing structures on the site(s).
      6.   Existing and proposed driveway locations.
      7.   Existing and proposed easement locations.
      8.   Delineated wetlands and water bodies including ordinary high water
elevations and floodplain boundaries as applicable.
      9.   Individual sewage treatment systems and well locations.
   B.   A title commitment showing ownership of the property and any existing
deed restrictions.
   C.   Any additional information deemed necessary and required by the zoning
Administrator. The Zoning Administrator may waive for good cause certain
information requirements not pertinent to the particular lot reconfiguration
request.

MODIFICATIONS, EXCEPTIONS AND VARIANCES
SECTION 8-1100.   STANDARDS FOR VARIANCES.
The Planning Commission may recommend, and the City Council may grant variances
from the substantive requirements of these regulations but not the procedural
provisions. Variances to these regulations shall be requested by the applicant
of a subdivision in writing at the time of the application for preliminary plat
approval and the grounds for the requested variances shall be stated by the
applicant. A variance may be granted only if the City Council finds that the
following factors apply to the request:
   A.   There are special circumstances or conditions affecting the property
that are not common to other properties in the area.
   B.   That the variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of
substantial property rights enjoyed by other properties of the same vicinity,
and that extraordinary hardship would result from strict compliance with these
regulations because of circumstances or conditions affecting the property.
   C.   That the special conditions and circumstances causing the need for the
variance have not been created by any persons presently or formerly having an
interest in the land.
   D.   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
health, safety or public welfare nor injurious to other land or improvements in
the vicinity where the property is located.

      5.   Developer’s Performance Guarantee and Payment Guarantee.
         a.   Performance Guarantee. To guarantee to the City that the
Developer will comply with the Columbus City Code and that Developer will fully
perform this Contract, Developer has, contemporaneously with the signing of
this Contract, deposited with the Columbus Treasurer a performance security in
the amount of $__________. The $__________ represents 125% of the amount of the
contracted public work, as estimated by the City Engineer, and this is the
amount which the City Engineer recommends as an amount sufficient to guarantee
the Developer’s performance, as an amount which should be sufficient for the
City to provide substitute performance of the contract in the event of a
default by Developer, and as an amount sufficient to guarantee the durability
of the improvements installed by the Developer, including inspections and
reimbursement for professional services [and including delivery to the Town of
the easements described on the attached Exhibit “B”]. This deposit of a
performance security further guarantees that the Developer will produce the
copies of the plat, as stated above. The performance security shall also serve
to guarantee that the Developer: timely provides environmental testing; timely
submits reports to the City Engineer according to the City Code; performs all
work required by a wetlands mitigation or replacement plan; performs all work
required by a stormwater management plan; and performs all other elements of
this agreement and all work required by the City Code. In the event that the
Developer later submits a request to withdraw part or all of the performance
security and to substitute a performance security in a smaller amount pursuant
to an amendment to this agreement, the effective dates of the substituted
performance security (commencement and termination) shall be determined by the
City Council at the time that the substituted performance security is
submitted. The performance security will need to be effective through
____________, 20___. The City is under no obligation to accept a later
substitution of the performance security, but if the City considers the
request, the Developer shall reimburse the City for all of its administrative
and legal costs incurred in effecting such substitution. The Developer’s
obligations, covenants and liabilities under this agreement are not limited by
the value of the performance security required by the City Council.
         b.   Payment Guarantee. To guarantee to the City that the Developer
will pay all persons who may furnish labor and material to the public work
which is the subject of this agreement, the Developer has, contemporaneously
with the signing of this Contract, deposited with the City Treasurer a payment
security in the amount of $_________________. The payment security of
$_______________ represents 100% of the City Engineer’s estimate of the amount
of the contracted public work and represents an amount which should be
sufficient to pay all claims for labor and material. The payment security shall
be reduced or released unless the City Council has received the Developer’s
Sworn Construction Statement (Interim or Final) and supporting Waivers of Bond
Claims, as required by the City Code. If the Developer submits a request to
withdraw part or all of the payment security and to substitute a payment
security in a smaller amount pursuant to an amendment to this agreement, the
effective dates of the substituted payment security (commencement and
termination) shall be determined by the City Council at the time that the
substituted payment security is submitted. The payment security will need to be
effective through ____________, 20___. The City is under no obligation to
accept a later substitution of the payment security, but if the City considers
the request, the Developer shall reimburse the City for all of its
administrative and legal costs incurred in effecting such substitution. The
Developer shall be liable for all of the City’s costs in administering,
defending, or enforcing any claim by any party who has provided labor and
material to the public work under this contract The Developer’s obligations,
covenants and liabilities under this agreement are not limited by the value of
the payment security required by the City Council.
         c.   Acceptable Forms of Performance Securities and Payment
Securities. All performance securities and payment securities shall be in the
forms and amounts as prescribed by Minn. Stat. § 574.26 (1994) and as
prescribed by the City Code. This applies to cash deposits, letters of credit,
performance bonds and payment bonds. All cash deposits shall be deposited with
the City Treasurer and pooled with other City funds. Any interest accruing on
cash deposits shall accrue to benefit of the City and not to the Developer.
         d.   It is the intent of the parties hereto that all performance
securities, payment securities, and rights and remedies attendant thereto shall
comply with the Minnesota Public Contractors’ Performance and Payment Bond Act,
Minn. Stat. §§ 574.26 through 574.32 (1994), inclusive. Any provision of this
agreement or of any performance security or of any payment security which
conflicts with said Act shall be deemed revised to conform to the Act and shall
be incorporated herein. It is the further intent of the parties hereto that all
performance securities and payment securities shall on deposit and in full
force and effect until the subdivider has been released from further obligation
under the terms of this agreement, including guarantees concerning durability
of installed improvements. Upon request, after all of Developer’s obligations
herein have been performed and satisfied, Developer or Developer’s Surety may
obtain a written release of the performance security and/or payment security
from the City.
      6.   Guarantee Retention. The parties agree that, after completion by the
Developer of the required work, the performance guarantee and payment guarantee
shall remain the same until their termination dates unless this agreement is
amended. The portion of the performance guarantee to be retained, shall be a
dollar amount equal to the City Engineer’s estimate of the amount needed to
guarantee that the Developer will repair any physical improvements which fail
to withstand the first winter and first spring thaw and to guarantee the
durability of those repairs, according to the City Code, and to guarantee the
Developer’s performance of any unfinished work under this agreement. The
portion of the payment guarantee to be retained shall be equal to the amount of
the performance guarantee to be retained.
      7.   Construction Deadline. All of the physical improvements required to
be constructed by the Developer shall be accomplished by ____________, 20___.
If the Developer has not performed all of its work by that date, the City
Council may, at its option, contract to have the work completed and pay for
this work out of the Developer’s performance guarantee. No building permits for
the construction of new homes in the plat will be issued until the platted
roads have been constructed and given a favorable “Completed Inspection” by the
City Engineer. (City Code Section 8-903.) (Optional) [Given that winter is
nearly upon us as of the date of this Agreement, building permits may be issued
to the Developer if the Developer constructs a Class V aggregate-surfaced road
according to Town Road Specifications, which in the opinion of the Town
Engineer, will remain serviceable through May 1, 20__.]
      8.   Township’s Remedies. The parties agree that the Developer’s failure
to perform its requirements or the Developer’s failure to provide corrective
work when called upon to honor a guarantee shall entitle the City to use the
cash deposits or to make claims on the bonds or drafts on letters of credit in
amounts sufficient to provide a substitute performance for the Developer’s
obligations. Any funds remaining on deposit after completion of all work and
expiration of all guarantees shall be refunded to the Developer; provided that
the subdivider has first delivered to the City Clerk an original sworn
construction statement attesting to the full payment of all contractors,
subcontractors and material suppliers who provided labor or material for
construction of the required improvements; and provided that the sworn
construction statement is in a form approved by the City Attorney and
accompanied by such additional waivers, affidavits or releases from contractors
and suppliers as may be required by the City Attorney. {'{'}See forms:
Developer’s Interim Sworn Construction Statement, Exhibit “C” to this Contract;
Developer’s Final Sworn Construction Statement, Exhibit “D” to this Contract;
and, Waiver of Bond Claims and Mechanic’s Lien Rights, Exhibit “E” to this
Contract.{'}'} Notwithstanding Developer’s guarantee, Developer shall hold the
City harmless from any and all claims which may arise from third parties,
including contractors and subcontractors, for contract claims and/or damages
sustained resulting from the performance or failure of performance of the
Developer’s work described in this Contract.

[These elevations are the lowest permitted elevations. Because of the wide
variety of soil conditions and the high water table in Columbus, and because of
the inherent lack of certainty in soil testing and site evaluation, the City
Council strongly recommends that all floors be constructed higher in elevation
than the lowest permitted elevations stated above.]
****************************************************************************************************
VERSION NO. 2.
The following construction restrictions are imposed upon the lots within the
proposed plat. Each lot shall have an [11,000] square foot contiguous finished
Buildable Area, as defined by the City Code, constructed no lower in elevation

DEVELOPMENT CONTRACT
(Optional)   [AND VARIANCE FOR]
[name of plat]
THIS AGREEMENT, made this ____ day of ____________, 20__, is by and between the
City of Columbus, Anoka County, Minnesota, hereinafter referred to as the
“City,” and ________________________, hereinafter [collectively] referred to as
“Developer.”
   A.   DEVELOPMENT CONTRACT / GENERAL AGREEMENT.
[Recitals for Part A., are the same as in Development Contract, Form A, above,
and are not reprinted here.]
IT IS AGREED BY AND BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO:
      1.   Plat Approval. The City Council shall approve the proposed final
plat of [name of plat] [and approve by metes-and-bounds description of those
parts of Developer’s lands which are not included within the proposed plat] and
release the plat and other recordable instruments to Developer for recording
when:
         a.   all of the subdivision and title requirements of the Columbus
City Code have been met by the Developer;
         b.   all fees, deposits, and bonds have been properly paid or
delivered to and accepted by the appropriate City officials;
         c.   all public improvements, drainage facilities, stormwater
management facilities, wetlands facilities, and Buildable Areas have been
constructed or installed and inspected and accepted by the City.
Since the timing of final plat approval depends upon the Developer’s
performance of this agreement, Developer waives all plat approval deadlines
which may accrue by law or by the City Code.
This Development Contract affects, encumbers, and otherwise concerns the lands
described on the attached Exhibit[s] “A” [and “B”?].
[Paragraphs 2., and 3., are the same as in Development Contract, Form A, above,
and are not reprinted here.]
      4.   Remaining Requirements. As of the date of this Contract, it appears
from an examination of City records that some platting requirements have been
met by the Developer and that the following platting and development
requirements remain unperformed by the Developer:
[Paragraph 4., subparagraphs a., through f., are the same as in Development
Contract, Form A, above, and are not reprinted here.]
         g.   None of the required public improvements, drainage facilities,
stormwater management facilities, wetlands facilities, and Buildable Areas have
been constructed or installed by Developer.
      5.   Developer’s Performance Guarantee and Payment Guarantee. At any time
after this agreement has been signed by both parties and the Developer wants to
have the plat signed by the City and to have the plat and other recordable
instruments released by the City for recording, then the Developer must provide
performance security and payment security pursuant to the City Code. The
amounts of such securities shall be determined by the City Council after
reviewing the extent to which Developer has completed the work required by this
agreement and by the City Code.
         a.   Performance Guarantee. To guarantee to the City that the
Developer will comply with the Columbus City Code and that Developer will fully
perform this Contract, Developer shall, before the signed plat and other
recordable instruments are released by the City for recording, deposit with the
Columbus Treasurer a performance security in the amount of $__________. The
$__________ represents 125% of the amount of the contracted public work, as
estimated by the City Engineer, and this is the amount which the City Engineer
recommends as an amount sufficient to guarantee the Developer’s performance, as
an amount which should be sufficient for the City to provide substitute
performance of the contract in the event of a default by Developer, and as an
amount sufficient to guarantee the durability of the improvements installed by
the Developer, including inspections and reimbursement for professional

SECTION 9-102.   APPLICATIONS.
   A.   GENERAL APPLICATION. Application for an Excavation, Grading, or Filling
Permit shall be made by the fee owner of the land where the proposed
Excavation, Grading, or Filling will be located and presented to the City
Administrator who shall review the application with the assistance of the City
Engineer. If the Zoning Administrator finds that the application is complete in
all respects and that the proposed Excavation, Grading or Filling falls within
the guidelines for permissible activities under §
9-100 and §
9-103 of the City Code, then the permit may be issued.
   Said application shall be in a form designated by the City Council and shall
contain among other things:
      1. The name and address of the fee owner of the proposed Excavation,
Grading, or Filling.
      2. Two copies of a Site Plan of the Excavation, Grading or Filling on a
scale of one inch to one hundred (100) feet with two feet contours, showing any
existing or proposed Excavation, Grading, or Filling in depth and area, and any
structures, improvements, and roads located thereon, together with proposed
drainage plans and finished grade plans for the Excavation, Grading, and
Filling. Applications affecting wetlands must be accompanied by either a
certificate of exemption or an approved wetlands replacement plan issued
pursuant to
Chapter 7C of this City Code. The site plan shall be accompanied by the Storm
Water Management Plan required by
Chapter 7D.
      3. The legal description of the tract or parcel upon which the proposed
Excavation, Grading, or Filling is located.
      4. The route proposed for the transportation of Earthly Deposits to or
from the property of the proposed Excavation, Grading, or Filling within the
City.
      5. The estimated period of time that the Excavation, Mining, or Filling
is to be operated and the days and hours of operation.
      6. $250.00 application fee and $1,200 escrow.
   B.   APPLICATION WITH OTHER DEVELOPMENT WORK. When the application for an
Excavation, Grading, or Filling Permit is made in conjunction with other
development work which requires proceedings and a public hearing before the
Planning Commission, such as a Conditional Use Permit, Interim Use Permit,
Planned Unit Development, construction of a road in a new development,
mitigation of damage to wetlands, or to improve a local drainage pattern, then
the applicant shall not be required to pay the fees otherwise required by this
Section. Excavation and removal of Earthly Deposits associated with development
work or road work shall not reduce the amount of upland within the City in
excess of the minimum amount necessary to accommodate stormwater ponding on the
development property, as determined by the City Engineer. Excavation and
removal of Earthly Deposits in excess of the minimum amount required to
accommodate stormwater ponding shall be subject to the Mineral Extraction
permitting requirements under
Chapter 7A of the City Code, unless otherwise approved by development agreement
that incorporates such Mineral Extraction permit requirements, including, but
not limited to: haul route restrictions, an applicable performance standards.

2016, amended by Ord. No. 18-01, effective May 31, 2018.]
SECTION 9-103.   REQUIREMENTS.
The City Administrator may issue an Excavation, Grading, or Filling Permit upon
finding that:
   A.   The establishment, maintenance and operation of the Excavation, Grading
or Filling will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other property in
the City for the uses already permitted in the district.
   B.   The Excavation, Grading, or Filling will not impede the normal and
orderly development and improvement of surrounding property for uses already
permitted in the district.
   C.   The hours and days of operation (7:00 a.m. – 7:00 p.m. Monday through
Saturday), the temporary and finished grade plan, the temporary and finished
drainage plan, and the operation of the Excavation, Grading, or Filling
generally, will not be injurious to the health, safety, welfare, comfort or
convenience of the public.
   D.   The transportation of the Earthly Deposits will not cause damage to any
public roads or streets, or that the applicant has stated the willingness to
provide financial guarantees to the City to pay for restoration of foreseeable
damage to public roads. Routing for the transportation of Earthly Deposits
minimizes the use of residential streets to the maximum extent possible.
   E.   When applicable, the applicant has first obtained either a permit or
letter of nonapplicability from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Minnesota
Department of Natural Resources, and watershed organization.
   F.   The City Engineer has given written recommendation for approval of the
application, with or without recommendations for special or unique conditions
or restrictions.
   G.   Dust control measures will be required on the construction site and any
graveled haul routes.
   H.   The applicant’s proposed use is accompanied by an approved Storm Water
Management Plan issued pursuant to
Chapter 7D of this City Code.
   I.   Special conditions or requirements of the Excavation, Grading, or
Filling Permit have been made in writing by the City Administrator or City
Engineer and are attached to the Permit.

effective March 1, 2007, amended by Ord. No. 09-04, effective March 19, 2009,
as amended by Ord. No. 16-12, effective December 22, 2016.]
SECTION 9-104.   FINANCIAL GUARANTEE FOR REPAIR OF DAMAGE TO CITY ROADS.
   A.   Cash or Letter of Credit Required. Where the Permit includes use of
City roads for hauling or transportation of excavated material or fill, the
City may require that the Permit holder post either a cash deposit or an
Irrevocable Letter of Credit with the City Treasurer to guarantee to the City
that any damage to a City road will be repaired at the expense of the Permit
holder and to guarantee reimbursement to the City for periodic road inspections
by the City Engineer.
   B.   Amount. The required amount of cash or of the letter of credit shall be
based upon the written recommendation of the City Engineer and shall be an
amount which is deemed sufficient to guarantee the Permit holder's compliance
with the road repair requirement stated in A., above.
   C.   Duration of Deposit. The cash guarantee shall remain on deposit with
the City Treasurer until the Permit has expired. The alternative letter of
credit shall be valid through the expiration date of the Permit and shall
remain on deposit until the permit has expired.
   D.   Form of Letter of Credit. The letter of credit, if used, shall be in an
approved form of the Irrevocable Letter of Credit. Each letter of credit shall
not be accepted until reviewed and approved by the City Attorney.
   E.   Determination of Damage. "Damage" to a city road as a result of
issuance of a permit for Excavation, Grading, or Filling is defined as any
condition of the road or right-of-way which, in the opinion of the City
Engineer (based upon pre-excavation and post-excavation inspections and upon
city road maintenance records), (1) is beyond normal wear and tear for that
road, and (2) was caused by trucks, vehicles or equipment traveling to and from
the permitted site.
   F.   Repairs Required. Road damage resulting from permitted activities shall
be repaired by the City and billed to the Permit holder. The Permit holder
shall reimburse the City within fifteen (15) days from the date of the billing
for road repairs and engineering fees. If the Permit holder does not pay the
bill within the fifteen (15) day period, the City shall reimburse itself by
making a draw against either the cash deposit or the letter of credit.
   G.   Suspension of Permit for Draws Against Deposits. If the City makes a
draw against either a cash deposit or a letter of credit as described above,
all permitted activities under the Permit shall then be immediately ceased and
the Permit shall be suspended. The City Administrator shall have the authority
to issue the suspension order to the Permit holder. The suspension shall
continue until:
      1.   The Permit holder restores either the cash deposit or the letter of
credit to the original amount as stated on the Permit, or,
      2.   Action of the City Council.
Such suspension shall cause the permit to be reviewed and adjudicated according
to the procedures of
Chapter 10 of this City Code. Review proceedings may result in reinstatement,
modification, continued suspension, or revocation of the Permit.
[CHAPTER 9, Article I, Section 105 (now § 9-104) amended by Ord. No. 86-3,
effective February 21, 1986, [Section 9-104 amended by Ord. No. 89-13,

09-04, effective March 19, 2009, as amended by Ord. No. 16-12, effective
December 22, 2016.]
SECTION 9-105.   SCOPE OF THIS CHAPTER.
This Chapter is intended to regulate Excavation, Grading, or Filling involving
a cumulative mass of two hundred (200) cubic yards or more in any six (6) month
period. By not regulating smaller excavations, or fills (i.e., less than two
hundred (200) cubic yards), the City Council finds that most typical
construction of single family homes and of business buildings should be
achievable without being subjected to the provisions of this Chapter.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any smaller excavations or fills which occur
closer than twenty (20) feet from any property line shall require a drainage,
erosion, and sedimentation control plan in sufficient detail to guarantee
adjacent properties or roadways are not impacted. Land owners are advised that
the limited scope of this Chapter does not relieve them of the responsibility
to ensure that their small excavation or fill meets the requirements of the
local watershed management, the county, or the state or federal government.

by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007, amended by Ord. No. 09-04,
effective March 19, 2009, as amended by Ord. No. 16-12, effective December 22,
2016.]
SECTION 9-106.   VIOLATIONS.
   A.   Any person violating the terms of this Chapter or the restrictions or
conditions of any Excavation, Grading, or Filling Permit issued thereunder
shall be the guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be
punished by a fine or imprisonment in accordance with the provisions of
Chapter 1, Section
1-109 of this City Code.
   B.   The imposition of criminal penalties shall not preclude action of the
City Council by way of Injunction or Forfeiture of cash deposit or letter of
credit or other civil remedy. The City Council may concurrently commence review
proceedings under Chapter 10 of this City Code, which may result in
reinstatement, modification, suspension, or revocation of the Permit.
   C.   Time is of the essence: each separate act performed in violation of
this Chapter or of an Excavation, Mining, or Filling Permit shall be deemed a
separate offense.

SECTION 9-107.   VALIDITY.
If any section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of this Chapter is for
any reason held to be unconstitutional, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the remaining provisions of this Chapter.

TITLE, INTERPRETATION AND ENACTMENT
SECTION 10-100.   TITLE.
This Ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the “Quasi-Judicial
Procedures Ordinance of the City of Columbus, Minnesota.”
[§ 10-100 amended by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007.]
SECTION 10-110.   PROVISION OF ORDINANCE DECLARED TO BE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS.
This Ordinance is intended to provide minimum procedural safeguards for the
individual where the power of the City is focused upon the individual. This
Ordinance shall serve as a guide to the City Council, the Planning Commission
and any other agency of the City as to the procedure to be used in adjudicating
individual cases. Where the requirements of this Ordinance are at variance or
in any other way conflict with the requirements of State or Federal Law, the
more restrictive law or that law imposing the higher standards shall govern.
[§ 10-110 amended by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007.]
SECTION 10-120.   SEVERABILITY CLAUSE.
Should any section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, clause, words, or
provision of this Ordinance be declared by any Court of competent jurisdiction
to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decisions shall not effect the validity
of the Ordinance as a whole or any part thereof other than the part so declared
to be unconstitutional or invalid.
SECTION 10-130.   REPEAL OF CONFLICTING ORDINANCES.
All ordinances or parts of ordinances or parts of the City Code in conflict
with this Quasi-Judicial Procedures Ordinance or inconsistent with the
provisions of this Ordinance, are hereby repealed to the extent necessary to
give this Ordinance full force and effect, except where such conflict or
inconsistency provides more stringent procedural safeguards to the individual,
in which case the more stringent procedures shall apply.
[§ 10-130 amended by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007.]
ARTICLE II
PROCEDURES
SECTION 10-200.   APPLICATION.
In all matters where the circumstances or application of the individual are to
be adjudicated, these procedures shall apply. Examples of situations which
require application of these procedures include, but are not limited to:
   A.   Zoning matters under
Chapter 7A and
7B –
      1.   All Variance applications;
      2.   All Conditional Use Permit applications;
      3.   All proceedings to revoke a Conditional Use Permit;
      4.   All cases requiring a decision on the status of Nonconforming Use.
   B.   Subdivision matters under
Chapter 8 –
      1.   All Variance applications;
      2.   All minor subdivision applications which do not appear to comply
with the Ordinance.
   C.   Licensing matters under
Chapter 4 –
      1.   All licensing matters which require a hearing.
   D.   Employee or Appointee Status Hearing –
      1.   All hearings to adjudicate the disciplining or termination of a City
employee or a City appointee. (Note: privacy laws and data practices laws may
require such hearings to be closed to the public.)
   E.   Excavation permit matters under
Chapter 9 -
      1.   All excavation permit matters which require a hearing.
[§ 10-200 amended by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007.]
SECTION 10-201.   CASE DOCUMENTATION.
   A.   Every case or application under
Chapters 7A,
7B,
8 and
9 shall be established as a separate City file and shall be identified as a
“Planning Case,” as follows:
(Example)
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/64e374fec8b9b93cf61169debb700b6b9d462f08/
IMAGES/0-0-0-1789.png]
   B.   Every licensing matter requiring a hearing under
Chapter 4 shall be established as a separate City file and shall be identified
as a “Licensing Case,” as follows:
(Example)
 [https://export.amlegal.com/media/64e374fec8b9b93cf61169debb700b6b9d462f08/
IMAGES/0-0-0-1787.png]
   C.   Every employee or appointee status matter shall be established a
separate City file (if a file has not already been established for the
individual) and shall be identified as a “Personnel File.”
[§ 10-201 amended by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007.]
SECTION 10-202.   NONCONTROVERSIAL CASES.
   In recognition of the fact that many noncontroversial cases will come before
the Planning Commission and before the City Council pursuant Chapters 4, 7A,
7B, 8 and 9, this Section permits an expedited procedure which avoids the
procedures of § 10-203 below. “Noncontroversial cases” are those where, on
first examination, it clearly appears from the application and other
documentation in the case file that the application (1) is not a case which is
required by Ordinance to be subjected to a public hearing, (2) the application
is in full compliance with the governing Ordinance(s), and (3) does not require
the exercise of discretionary judgment by the Planning Commission or City
Council.
   After first examination, the chairperson of the Planning Commission may
identify the case as a noncontroversial case. Any dispute at the Planning
Commission as to the noncontroversial status to the case renders the case
controversial, requiring application of § 10-203 procedures.
   Where it later appears to the City Council that the Planning Commission
erroneously expedited a case as noncontroversial, the City Council shall refer
the case back to the Planning Commission for application of § 10-203
procedures.
[§ 10-202 amended by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007.]
SECTION 10-203.   ADJUDICATION PROCEDURES.
   A.   An applicant or individual is entitled to proper notice and a fair
hearing prior to the final decision in his case.
   B.   The City Clerk, upon instruction from the City Council or Planning
Commission, shall issue and publish before the hearing a notice which specifies
the time and place of the hearing, a reasonably definite statement of the
result sought, a short statement of the facts of the matter, and a statement
that the applicant or individual has the right to be present and to be
represented by Counsel. (Note: Particular ordinances or laws may dictate exact
notice and publication requirements.)
   C.   The hearing may be held before the City Council or the primary
evidentiary hearing may be referred to the Planning Commission.
   D.   The applicant or individual shall have the right to cross-examine
witnesses who testify against him, and, the applicant or individual shall have
the right to produce witnesses and evidence in his behalf.
   E.   If the Planning Commission conducts the evidentiary hearing, it shall
make a full written report of its proceedings to the City Council and shall
forward the case file with the report. The report shall include minutes of
Planning Commission meetings and hearings where the case was discussed or
heard. The minutes must show all of the findings of fact, all the conclusions
to be drawn from the facts, and the recommendation to the City Council.
   F.   The City Council shall give full consideration and a fair determination
of the matter according to the record of proceedings before the Planning
Commission and according to any other evidence submitted directly to the City
Council.
   G.   A recording or verbatim transcript of the hearing or hearings shall be
made and kept as a part of the case file. If the City Council conducts all of
the hearings and proceedings in a case, the same quality of case record as
shown in paragraph E above must be produced and preserved.

SECTION 14-304.   APPLICATION, PERMIT, USAGE AND CONNECTION CHARGE.
No person, firm or corporation shall make any type of connection, repair,
enlargement or alteration to the City Facilities system except upon making an
application therefore on a form provided by the City and receiving a permit
issued by the City for such purposes. The application shall include the legal
description of the property to be served, the uses for which the connection is

there shall be paid to the City the following fees for the following purposes:
   A.   ASSESSMENTS PAID. No connection shall be made with respect to any
Sanitary Sewer or water main serving the property or any person or occupants of
the land, parcel or premises affected unless all assessments for such sewer or

which share shall be payable as described under Section 14-304.
   B.   PAYMENTS FOR INSTALLING SERVICE LINE. For service to the property for

   D.   CITY’S AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE CHARGES FOR SEWER AND WATER CONNECTION.
Under Minnesota Statutes § 444.075, subdivision 3, as amended, in order to pay
for the construction, reconstruction, repair, enlargement, improvement, or
other obtainment, the maintenance, operation and use of the Facilities, and of
obtaining and complying with permits required by law, the City Council may
impose just and equitable charges for the use and for the availability of the
Facilities and for connections with them and make contracts for the charges.
[Section 14-304 D. amended by Ord. No. 09-02, effective March 5, 2009.]
   E.   SEWER CONNECTION CHARGES. Every lot, parcel of land or building will be
charged a specific sum of money, in order to connect to City’s Facilities. Such
a charge is made for the privilege of making such a connection, either directly
or indirectly, to the disposal system through which connection the Facilities
of the City are made available for disposal of sewage, industrial waste, water
or other liquid from such premises. This charge hereinafter is referred to as
the City’s Service Availability Charge (the “SAC”). The City’s SAC fee is
$300.00 per SAC unit and is subject to amendment by ordinance. The City’s SAC
fee is in addition to the SAC unit charge made by the Metropolitan Council
Environmental Services (“MCES”). The total SAC charge for each building or
structure shall be equal to its number of SAC units multiplied by the current
year SAC rate mandated by the MCES plus the number of SAC units multiplied by
the City’s current SAC rate.
The owner of any property desiring to connect such property to an existing
Sanitary Sewer main where such property has not previously been connected to
said main may do so on the approval of the City and upon paying a City and MCES
SAC.
   F.   WATER CONNECTION CHARGES. Every lot, parcel of land or building will be
charged a specific sum of money, in order to connect to City’s Facilities. Such
a charge is made for the privilege of making such a connection, either directly
or indirectly, to the Waterworks system through which connection the Facilities
of the City are made available for the supply of water for domestic,
commercial, and industrial use, lawn irrigation and other outdoor use and fire
suppression. This charge hereinafter is referred to as the City’s Water
Availability Charge (the “WAC”). The City’s WAC fee is $1,100.00 per Equivalent
Residential Unit (ERU) and is subject to amendment by ordinance. The total WAC
charge for each property shall be equal to its maximum number of ERUs
multiplied by the City’s current WAC rate.
The owner of any property desiring to connect such property to City’s
Facilities where such property has not previously been connected may do so on
the approval of the City and upon paying a City WAC.
   G.   PAYMENT OF CONNECTION CHARGES. Connection charges are payable at the
time of building permit issuance. The Building Official shall not issue a
building permit until such connection charge is paid.
   H.   APPLICATION AND PERMIT. No connection from any premises to City’s
Facilities is authorized without there being first obtained for such connection
a permit issued by the City. No permit may be obtained from the City, and no
representative of the City is authorized to issue a permit for connection
unless and until an authorized representative of the City receives an
application for such connection, determines and establishes the type of
connection to be made and receives the connection charge required or unless by
approval of the City Council such payment is deferred or is to be made in
installments. The City shall prepare and provide for and furnish any form and
instrument found necessary to the connection applications and permits of the
City and perform all acts reasonably required with respect thereto.
Applications and permits shall be uniform, in accordance with this Ordinance.
   I.   ADMINISTRATION. The Building Official shall prepare or revise a
building permit or sewage and water connection permit application form to
provide information necessary for the computation of the number of City SAC and
WAC units assignable to the building or property in question, and shall collect
the applicable charge before issuance of a permit. The Building Official shall
make such information available to the City Council upon request. If upon
filing a report covering such permit with the MCES, the Council determines that
a greater number of units is assignable to the building or structure in
question, any additional amount of cost allocated to the City as a result shall
be paid by the person or company to whom the permit was granted.
   J.   INCREASED CONNECTION CHARGES BASED ON MEASUREMENTS. The Determination
and establishment in the first instance of the City SAC represented by the
connection, especially when made by estimate based upon representation of the
owner or occupancy of the premises, is at all times subject to further review
and Determination after the connection has been made and used by an actual
measurement by the City or MCES of the sewage or water discharge from such
connection entering into the system of the City. The receipt and acceptance by
the City of any money paid and received by the City, as previously imposed,
does not bar the City’s right to payment of the correct amount of money due
therefore, and may be determined and established by actual measurement; and the
City’s right to recover therefore is not impaired. After a connection has been
made and the connection charge established, imposed and paid, no diminution in
discharge from the premises shall entitle the owner (or occupant) to a
reduction, reimbursement or refund with respect to the connection charge
imposed and paid.
   K.   CALCULATION OF SEWER CONNECTION CHARGES.
      1.   There shall be a charge for each City SAC unit, as established from
time to time by ordinance of the City Board.
      2.   The following are hereby established as connection units:
            (a)   All Residential Properties shall be assigned one SAC unit per
dwelling unit.
            (b)   Commercial, institutional, industrial and other building
types shall be assigned a minimum of one unit. In accordance with MCES policy
and procedures, commercial City SAC units are determined by the approximate
maximum wastewater flow potential and industrial City SAC units are determined
based on maximum normal daily wastewater flow volume separately for process
areas and maximum potential daily wastewater flow volume for commercial areas.
The City will use the criteria in Appendix A to this ordinance for determining
the SAC units identified for commercial facilities. The City SAC unit estimate
for properties either not described in Appendix A, or industrial properties
will be determined by the City Council in conjunction with the MCES. The City
Council may review actual sewage flow one year after the initial discharge, and
the City may impose such additional connection charges in accordance with the
provisions of this Ordinance.
   The City shall provide information necessary for the computation of the
number of units assignable to the building or structure in question on the
building permit and sewer connection application forms and shall collect the
applicable charge before issuance of the permit.
            (c)   In accordance with MCES policy and procedures, the City
Council may consider credit for a SAC unit previously paid on any property when
a new use is established on a site. A new use is redevelopment of a property
for a different use.
            (d)   Any charges levied by and pursuant to Section
14-304,and which have been properly billed to the occupancy of any premises
served, and not paid, may be covered in a civil action by the City in any court
of competent jurisdiction.
            (e)   The funds received from the collection of charges authorized
by this Ordinance shall be deposited, as collected, in a fund known as the
Water and Sewer Fund, and shall be disbursed:
                  1)   To meet costs of operation;
                  2)   To the debt redemption to provide funds for the payment
of principal and interest on bonds issued to finance the costs of constructing
improvements to the City Facilities as prescribed by resolutions or covenants
authorizing or securing such bonds; and
                  3)   To provide funds for the reasonable requirements of
extending, improving and replacing City Facilities.
   L.   CALCULATION OF WATER CONNECTION CHARGES.
      1.   There shall be a charge for each City WAC unit, as established from
time to time by ordinance of the City Council.
      2.   The following are hereby established as connection units:
            (a)   Each property proposed to be connected to the City’s
Waterworks system shall have a determination made as to the number of ERUs of
water demand the property can place on the Waterworks system. This
determination shall be made by the City Engineer. The determination shall
include the number of buildable acres contained within the subject property.
Each buildable acre is determined to place a minimum of five (5) ERUs of water
demand on the system.
            (b)   The water connection charge shall be the number of ERUs
assigned to the property multiplied by the current WAC rate.
   M.   MULTIPLE CONNECTIONS. Multiple connections of more than one building to

SECTION 14-636.   SEPTIC REPORTS.
A septic report shall be required for accessory buildings and building
additions over 240 square feet before a building permit will be issued. The
report shall include the following:
   A.   Identification of an alternate Subsurface Sewage Treatment System site
of at least 3,000 square feet and soils suitable for a Standard System as
defined by Minn. R. Ch. 7080.
   B.   The location of all wells on the property.
[§ 14-636, added by Ord. No. 98-5, effective July 30, 1998.]
SECTION 14-637.   COMPLIANCE INSPECTIONS.
   A.   A Compliance inspection, as defined by Minn. R. Ch. 7080-7083, shall be
required prior to the following:
      1.   Sale or transfer of ownership of any building;
      2.   Public or church accessory building or building additions over 240
square feet.
      3.   When altering an existing structure to add a bedroom.
   B.   An SSTS found in noncompliance with the requirements of this Chapter
shall be either:
      1.   Brought into compliance; or
      2.   Have established a Septic Compliance Escrow Account in accord with
the provisions of this Section prior to the sale or transfer of ownership, or
prior to the construction of a public or church accessory building or building
over 240 square feet.
   C.   An SSTS found in compliance but lacking proper access to the
maintenance hole shall have the required risers and inspection pipes installed
to conform with the requirements of this Chapter.
   D.   An SSTS shall be pumped at the time of the Compliance inspection unless
the SSTS is found in noncompliance and is required to be repaired or upgraded.
   E.   Septic Compliance Escrow Accounts are a temporary alternative to
conformance on the date of sale. Establishing a Septic Compliance Escrow
Account is not conformance with the provisions of this section; however, it is
a defense against enforcement during the duration of the hardship. A Septic
Compliance Escrow Account may be established whenever the seller demonstrates,
and the City Council finds that:
      1.   A hardship not created by the buyer or seller makes it impossible or
impractical to bring the system into compliance; and
      2.   The hardship is temporary, so that within six (6) months the
hardship will be alleviated and the system will be brought into compliance.
Soil frozen to a depth of more than twelve (12) inches is deemed a hardship.
Hardship may be found due to impractical cost whenever factors not created by
the Seller cause the cost of the compliance repairs to increase to 133% or more
of the cost of repairs without the claimed hardship factors. Hardship may also
be found due to impossibility when no locally available contractor has the
equipment necessary to perform the compliance repairs, provided locally
available contractors have the equipment necessary to perform compliance
repairs without the hardship.
   F.   The Septic Compliance Escrow Account will be established and maintained
by the buyer and seller. Following the finding of hardship, the buyer and
seller will obtain estimates of the cost of compliance repair. The City
Building Official will review these estimates. Buyer and seller shall establish
a Septic Compliance Escrow Account, naming the City of Columbus as a necessary
party for the release of escrow funds. (An example of a suitable agreement is
included in Appendix A). Buyer and seller shall then deposit an amount equal to
125% of the estimated compliance repair cost into the escrow account. Upon a
showing that the buyer and seller have entered into the required escrow
agreement, the City shall approve the sale contingent on the successful
completion of compliance repairs and closing of escrow. The contingency may be
recorded against the property. Upon completion of compliance repairs, the City
shall authorize the release of escrow funds and remove the contingency recorded
against the property.

IV and V systems and midsized subsurface sewage treatment systems as defined in
Minn. R. Ch. 7080.
[§ 14-639, added by Ord. No. 15-01, effective May 7, 2015.]
SECTION 14-640.   CONSTRUCTION PERMIT REQUIRED.
No person shall install, alter, excavate, repair, replace, or extend any SSTS
or any component thereof, including, pipes, tanks, drop boxes, distribution
boxes, and drain fields, in the City without first obtaining a construction
permit therefore from the Building Official for the specific installation,
alteration, excavation, repair, or extension. No land disturbing activities in
furtherance of such construction shall be permitted until a determination has
been made by the Zoning Administrator as to the applicability of
Chapter 7D to the proposed construction. A construction permit for these
purposes shall only be applied for and issued to a licensed Installer. A
Construction Permit for an SSTS is separate from a Building Permit issued under
Chapter 13 of this City Code. For new construction, the applications for a
construction permit, building permit, and zoning permit (Ch. 7A) shall be
processed together.
The City Council may refuse to issue a construction permit for cause or upon
the recommendation of the Building Official or City Administrator for
noncompliance with this Chapter or any rule, statute, or ordinance incorporated
herein. The City Council may revoke a permit for cause for any violation of
this Chapter or any other provisions of the City Code, or for falsification or
misrepresentation of any documents, records or reports submitted to obtain a
permit.

SECTION 14-646.   PUMPING PERMITS AND FEES.
A permit shall be obtained for each pumping job. An application for the permit
shall be submitted to the City Administrator by the Maintainer. The application
for any pumping permit shall be on a form approved by the City Administrator
and shall include sufficient information to identify and locate the Maintainer
dumping facility, and to identify the Maintainer and approved pumping vehicle.
The fee for a permit shall be determined by the City Council and published in a
fee schedule. The City Council may refuse to issue a pumping permit for cause
or upon the recommendation of the Building Official or City Administrator. The
City Council may revoke a permit for cause, for any violation of this Chapter
or any other provisions of the City Code or for falsification or
misrepresentation of any documents, records or reports submitted to obtain a
permit.  
   A.   Routine Pumping. A “routine pumping” permit is issued for a pumping
which occurs twelve (12) months or more after the previous cleaning. The permit
fee for a routine pumping shall be determined by the City Council and published
in a fee schedule.
   B.   Frequent Pumping. The application for a third pumping permit within a
twelve (12) months period is indicative of a failing Subsurface Sewage
Treatment System and requires an inspection of the system (see § 14-647).
   C.   Emergency Pumping. An “emergency pumping” is defined as a pumping (1)
which is required because of the Subsurface Sewage Treatment System’s failure
to meet the minimum standards of Section

ARTICLE IX.
REGULATIONS FOR HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES AND PETROLEUM CONTAMINATED SOILS.
SECTION 14-900.   TITLE.
This Article may be cited as the “City of Columbus Regulations for Hazardous
Substances and Petroleum Contaminated Soils.”
[§ 14-900 amended by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007.]
SECTION 14-901.   FINDINGS.
In adopting these regulations, the City Council finds:
   A.   Federal and state law allows for disposal and remediation of certain
contaminated substances by aeration and bioremediation.
   B.   All homes, schools, churches and businesses in the City of Columbus
obtain drinking water from on-site fresh water wells.
   C.   Two of the watersheds covering the City are on the upstream side of the
metropolitan fresh water supply. Surface waters and groundwaters from these two
watersheds flow to the Mississippi River at points above the intakes for
metropolitan fresh water supply systems.
   D.   Prohibiting bioremediation in the City will not prevent petroleum
contaminated soils from being treated through bioremediation in other less
environmentally sensitive areas of the state. Additionally, thermal remediation
of petroleum contaminated soils is readily available at a number of
metropolitan facilities.
   E.   Soils, extensive wetlands, unique wildlife areas, water tables, ground
water systems, surface water drainage patterns, and proximity of fresh water
wells to proposed aeration and bioremediation sites make most of the City of
Columbus unsuitable for aeration and bioremediation techniques.
   F.   Although the legislature has made seemingly favorable findings
regarding bioremediation of petroleum contaminated soils, no evidence has been
provided to the City that refutes the possibility of residual or long-term
effects from bioremediation in environmentally sensitive areas such as the City
of Columbus. No evidence has been provided to the City that refutes the
possibility of residual or long-term effects from bioremediation in the
property being utilized for bioremediation or in adjacent lands.
   G.   Until the City receives compelling evidence derived from competent,
long-range scientific studies that such techniques will have no adverse impacts
on the city’s lands and waters, aeration and bioremediation of petroleum
contaminated soils should be prohibited in the city.
[§ 14-901 amended by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007.]
SECTION 14-902.   PURPOSE.
This article regulates the depositing, distribution and placement of hazardous
substances and petroleum contaminated soils in the City of Columbus. These City
requirements are in addition to all applicable federal, state and county
regulations.
[§ 14-902 amended by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007.]
SECTION 14-903.   DEFINITIONS.
All definitions shall be determined by reference to Minnesota Statutes,
Minnesota agency regulations adopted pursuant to statutes, to the meanings
given in this Section, to this City Code, and, otherwise, words and phrases
shall have the meaning customarily assigned to them as a matter of general
usage.
   A.   “Hazardous Substances” shall include within its definition those
substances described in City Code Section 8-503 and any other substances which
are included in definitions contained in federal or state law.
   B.   “Petroleum Contaminated Soils” shall have the meaning given to it by
state law.
   C.   “Bioremediation” shall have the meaning given to it by state law.
[§ 14-903 amended by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007.]
SECTION 14-904.   HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES.
Transportation of Hazardous Substances into the City of Columbus for treatment
or processing or storage is hereby prohibited. Treatment, processing, or
storage of Hazardous Substances generated or created within the City of
Columbus shall be in accordance with federal and state law.

treatment, processing, bioremediation, or storage is hereby prohibited.
Aeration and bioremediation of petroleum contaminated soils within the City of
Columbus are hereby prohibited. All zones within the city, as defined in
Chapter 7A, are within the scope of these prohibitions.
[§ 14-905 amended by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007.]
SECTION 14-906.   VIOLATIONS AND REMEDIES.
   A.   Violation is a Misdemeanor. Any person who violates any provision of
this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall
be punished by a fine or imprisonment in accordance with the provisions of
Chapter 1, Section
1-109 of this City Code.
   B.   Other Laws Not Infringed. The penalty provisions of Section
14-906 shall not be deemed to supersede or infringe upon the authority of other
governmental agencies to prosecute for violations of federal or state laws.
   C.   Civil Remedies for the City. In addition to civil remedies available to
the City for injunction or abatement, the City Council, after notice and
hearing on a violation of this Chapter, may elect to take a draft under any
letter of credit posted for a Conditional Use Permit to abate the violation

ARTICLE X
CLANDESTINE DRUG LAB AND CHEMICAL DUMP SITES
SECTION 14-1000.   GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   A.   Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this Ordinance is to reduce public
exposure to health risks where law enforcement officers have determined that
hazardous chemicals from a suspected clandestine drug lab site or associated
dumpsite may exist. The City Council finds that such sites may contain
chemicals and residues that place people, particularly children or adults of
child bearing age, at risk when exposed through inhabiting or visiting the
site, at the time the hazardous substances are discovered by law enforcement
officers and in the future.
Based upon professional reports, assessments, testing, investigations and
presentations, the City Council finds that such hazardous chemicals can
condense, penetrate, and contaminate the land, surfaces, furnishings,
buildings, and equipment in or near structures or other locations where such
sites exist. The City Council finds that these conditions present health and
safety risks to residents, occupants, and visitors through fire, explosion,
skin and respiratory exposure and related dangers. The City Council further
finds that such sites present health and safety risks to residences, buildings,
and structures and to the general housing stock of the community.
   B.   Interpretation and Application. In their interpretation and
application, the provisions of this Ordinance shall be construed to protect the
public health, safety and welfare. Where conditions imposed by any provision of
this Ordinance are either more or less restrictive than comparable provision
imposed by any other law, ordinance, statute, or regulation of any kind, the
regulations which are more restrictive or which impose higher standards or
requirements shall prevail.
Should any court of competent jurisdiction declare any section or subpart of
this Ordinance to be invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of
the Ordinance as a whole or any part thereof, other than the provision declared
invalid.
   C.   Fees. Fees for the administration of this Ordinance may be established
and amended from time to time by further ordinance of the City Council.
   D.   Definitions. For the purpose of this Ordinance, the following terms or
words shall be interpreted as follows:
      (1)   “Child” shall mean any person less than 18 years of age;

Drug Lab;
      (7)   “Manufacture” shall mean and include, in places other than a
licensed pharmacy, the production, cultivation quality control, and
standardization, by mechanical, physical, chemical or pharmaceutical means,
packing, repacking, tableting, encapsulating, labeling, relabeling, filling, or
by other process, of controlled substances;
      (8)   “Owner” shall mean any person, firm or corporation who owns, in
whole or in part, the land, buildings or structures in or on which there is
found a Clandestine Drug Lab. Owner shall not mean any person, firm, or
corporation holding solely a security interest in any such land, buildings, or
structures.
      (9)   “Public Health Nuisance” shall mean all dwellings, accessory
structures and buildings or adjacent property associated with a clandestine
drug lab site are potentially unsafe due to health hazards and are considered a

Clandestine Drug Lab Site or Chemical Dumpsite.

specifying the grounds for the appeal and the relief requested. The appeal must
be filed within ten (10) days of the issuance of the item from which the appeal

SECTION 15-200.   PARK HOURS.
Parks open one-half hour before sunrise and close one-half hour after sunset.

SECTION 15-201.   GROUP ACTIVITIES.
Whenever any group, association, or organization desires to reserve park
facilities for a particular purpose, such as picnics, sporting activities,
parties, or theatrical or entertainment performance, the representative of said
group, association or organization shall first obtain a park facilities
reservation and use permit from the Zoning Administrator or duly authorized
representative for such purposes. The Zoning Administrator shall grant the
application if it appears that the group, association, or organization will not
interfere with the general use of the park or individual members of the public,
and if said group, association, or organization meets all conditions contained
in the application. The approval of the application may contain a requirement
for an indemnity bond to protect the City from any liability of any kind or
character and to protect City property from damage. The Zoning Administrator
shall require that group activities requiring extra police protection or other
special facilities or expense to the City shall be provided at the sole expense
of the group, association, or organization requesting a permit and may require
that the indemnity bond cover such services.
All groups are required to clean up the park and the facilities which they use
and to leave the park and the facilities in the same condition in which they
found them, normal wear and tear accepted. Any group failing to clean up after
itself shall be placed on probationary status for a period of five years
following the date on which the group failed to clean up after itself.
Probationary groups must pay a clean-up security deposit in advance of the date
of the activity in the park at the rate of $1.00 per person. The clean-up
security deposit check shall be returned to the group’s representative only
after the park has been favorably inspected by a City official. The costs of
clean-up after an unfavorable inspection shall be deducted from the deposit and
the balance, if any, shall be refunded to the group.
The Zoning Administrator’s decision to grant or deny the application may be
appealed to the City Council. The Zoning Administrator may refer any
application to the City Council for decision. The Zoning Administrator may
refer any application to the City Engineer or to the City Attorney for
professional assistance.
   A.   Application. A person seeking issuance of such a permit shall file an
application at the office of the Zoning Administrator. The application shall
state:
      1.   Type of activity;
      2.   The name and address of the applicant;
      3.   The name and address of the person sponsoring the activity, if
different from the applicant;
      4.   The day and hour for which the permit is desired;
      5.   The park or portion thereof for which such permit is desired;
      6.   An estimate of the anticipated attendance;
      7.   Any other information which the City shall find reasonably necessary
to a fair determination as to whether a permit should be issued;
      8.   Probationary groups shall submit a check at $1.00 per person for
clean-up security deposit; and
      9.   Groups with anticipated attendance of 200 or more shall be strongly
advised to arrange for rental of additional self-contained toilet facilities.
Probationary groups with anticipated attendance of 200 or more shall be
required to prepay to the Columbus Treasurer for the rental of additional self-
contained toilet facilities at the ratio of one facility per fifty (50)
persons.
   B.   Standards for Issuance. The Zoning Administrator or City Council shall
issue a permit when the following findings have been made:
      1.   That the proposed activity or use of the park will not unreasonably
interfere with or detract from the general public enjoyment of the park;
      2.   That the proposed activity and use will not unreasonably interfere
with or detract from the promotion of public health, welfare, safety and
recreation;
      3.   That the proposed activity or use is not reasonably anticipated to
incite violence, crime or disorderly conduct;
      4.   That the proposed activity will not involve unusual, extraordinary
or burdensome expense or police operation by the City; and

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE
SECTION 18-101.   FINDINGS.
After notice and public hearings before the Columbus City Council, the City
Council makes the following findings:
   A.   Development in the City of Columbus has progressed to the stage where
the construction and location of the various utilities, Pipelines and wiring
systems within public rights-of-way needs to be regulated.
   B.   The City Council has the authority to impose reasonable regulations
upon the construction and location of various facilities from public utilities.
[§ 18-101, Paragraph B, amended by Ord. No. 89-17, effective December 8, 198,
amended by Ord. No. 92-2, effective April 17, 1992, amended by Ord. No. 09-02,
effective March 5, 2009.]
   C.   The City Council has the authority to regulate the construction and
location of Utility systems in furtherance of the protection of public health,
public safety and public welfare pursuant to Minn. Stat. §462.358, Subd. 5, as
amended.
[§ 18-101, Paragraph C, amended by Ord. No. 89-17, effective December 8, 1989,
amended by Ord. No. 09-02, effective March 9, 2009.]
   D.   The City Council has the authority to exercise municipal powers to
further regulate the location and construction of utilities within the City.
[§ 18-101, Paagraph D, amended by Ord. No. 09-02, effective March 9, 2009.]
   E.   The City has been presented with proposals from competing suppliers of
natural gas to construct Pipeline Distribution Systems within the same roads to
service the same territories within the City and, further, this conflict in
proposals needs to be regulated to protect the public safety, public health and
public welfare. The prospect of two (2) or more Natural Gas Pipelines being
constructed in close proximity to each other within the same right-of-way
presents the following public safety hazards:
      1.   The inability to identify the source of a leak or explosion and the
inability to conduct immediate repairs;
      2.   The danger of multiple fires or multiple explosions in the event of
a break or rupture of one of the multiple gas lines;
      3.   Increased reaction time to emergency situations;
      4.   The increased probability that an excavator who fails to call for
the location of a Pipeline facility will strike one of the multiple gas
Pipelines;
      5.   Undue congestion and confusion at emergency sites because of the
need to have more than one gas Utility present at the site;
      6.   The potential of one gas Utility operating the other gas Utility’s
appliances or valves; and
      7.   The presence of multiple Natural Gas Distribution Systems within the
same easement road or right-of-way owned by unrelated companies would increase
the risk of explosion and fire.
The prospect of two (2) or more Natural Gas Pipelines being constructed within
the same rights-of-way to serve the same neighborhoods presents the following
public welfare problems:
      1.   An increased cost to the customers in the overlapping Service Areas;
      2.   The unneeded additional expense in operating costs which the other
customers of the competing utilities would need to bear; and
      3.   It would be uneconomical, inconvenient and disruptive for property
owners and the public to have the same easement, road or right-of-way excavated
twice for the installation of gas Pipeline Distribution System.
[§ 18-101 amended by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007, amended by Ord.
No. 09-02, effective March 5, 2009.]
SECTION 18-102.   PURPOSE.
The purpose of this Chapter is to provide minimal reasonable regulations as to
the location and construction of public utilities facilities within any public
easement road or right-of-way within the City of Columbus. A further purpose of
this Chapter is to provide reasonable minimal regulations in the public
interest to prevent overlapping Distribution Systems and overlapping service
territories by providers of Natural Gas.
[§ 18-102 amended by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007.]

ARTICLE III
CONSTRUCTION OF FACILITIES
SECTION 18-301.   ALL UTILITIES SUBJECT TO THIS CHAPTER.
All Utilities operating or maintaining lines, facilities or equipment within a
city road right-of-way or upon Public Land are subject to the regulations of
this Chapter.
SECTION 18-302.   UTILITY CONSTRUCTION IN ROAD CROSS-SECTION.
All Utilities shall construct their lines in accordance with the cross-section
specifications contained in
Chapter 8 of this City Code,
Appendix A, “Standard Specifications for New Roadway Construction,”
incorporated herein by reference.
[§ 18-302 amended by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007.]
SECTION 18-303.   CONSTRUCTION PERMITS.
No Utility company shall open, excavate, or disturb the surface of any public
ground or right-of-way for any purpose without first having obtained a
construction permit from the City Administrator. No land disturbing activities
in furtherance of construction of utilities shall be commenced until the Zoning
Administrator has made a determination as to the applicability of Chapter 7D on
the proposed construction. The City Administrator shall require proof of
workers’ compensation insurance coverage from either the Utility or its
subcontractor prior to issuance of any construction permit.
   A.   Distribution System Permits.
      1.   Prior to construction of any lines, equipment, facilities, or other
parts of a Distribution System, a Utility shall first obtain a construction
permit from the City Administrator and/or City Engineer. The application for a
permit shall be submitted in duplicate to the City Administrator at the City
Hall. The application shall include: a scaled area map showing the proposed
location of the lines or equipment to be constructed; depictions and
specifications for lines, cables, equipment or facilities to be installed; and
a road cross-sectional schematic showing the proposed location of any buried
lines or cables. The application shall be accompanied by a $200.00 permit fee.
      2.   The completed application shall be forwarded to the City Engineer

Engineer has approved the application in writing and until the City has been
reimbursed by the applicant for its actual expense incurred in reviewing the
application, including all professional consulting fees.
   B.   Service Connection Permits. Prior to any construction or relocation and
reconstruction of any Service Connection, a Utility shall first obtain a
construction permit from the City Administrator. The application shall be
accompanied by a map showing the address and location of the Service Line to be
installed or reconstructed. The City Administrator may issue the permit upon
receipt of the completed application. The purpose of the permit is to provide
the City with information regarding the location, time and extent of the
construction or excavation activity.
   C.   Repair or Maintenance Permits. Prior to any excavation or construction
to repair or maintain any portion of a Distribution System, a Utility shall
first obtain a construction permit from the City Administrator. The application

permit where an emergency exists requiring the immediate repair of its lines or
facilities. Within three (3) working days after effecting emergency repairs,
the Utility shall make application for the appropriate permit. For emergency
repairs to a Distribution System, the permit:
      1.   Shall include the Utility’s certification that the repaired line has
not been relocated; or
      2.   Shall include map(s) and schematic(s) to show the relocation of the
repaired line or equipment.
[Section
18-303,amended by Ord. No. 93-3, effective March 12, 1993, amended by Ord. No.
94-5, effective January 12, 1996, amended by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1,
2007, amended by Ord. No. 09-04, effective March 19, 2009.]
SECTION 18-304.   CROSSING CHARGED PIPELINES.
    A.   Crossing Charged Pipeline. No person, corporation or other entity
shall cause or permit a Pipeline to become a Charged Pipeline where the
Pipeline to be charged crosses over or beneath a Charged Pipeline which exists
as of August 18, 1989.
   B.   Exception. A Charged Pipeline may cross over or under another Charged
Pipeline where both Charged Pipelines are part of a Distribution System and
neither is a Service Connection, and only where the existence of the second
Pipeline to be charged is necessary to extend the delivery of Natural Gas to
customers located in a new Service Area or in areas outside of the City.
Exceptions granted under this section shall be extremely limited, and economic
considerations alone shall not justify the issuance of a permit where another
practical means of delivering Natural Gas is available without creating a
situation in which two Charged Pipelines cross each other.
[§ 18-304 amended by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007.]
SECTION 18-305.   RESTRICTION ON MULTIPLE GAS LINES.
Multiple parallel gas Pipelines owned by two (2) or more gas Utilities shall
not be constructed within the same City right-of-way, except that one gas
Utility may construct its Pipeline on one side of the right-of-way to provide a
Distribution System for its Service Area within which the right-of-way is
included, and a second gas Utility may construct a transmission Pipeline on the
opposite side of the right-of-way to connect to new Service Areas or to connect
to areas outside of the City.
[§ 18-305 amended by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007.]
SECTION 18-306.   RESTORATION WORK.
After undertaking any work requiring the opening of any Public Way or Public
Ground, the Utility shall restore the same, including paving and its
foundation, to as good condition as formerly existed, and shall maintain the
same in good condition for two (2) years thereafter. The work shall be
completed as promptly as weather permits, and if the Utility shall not promptly
perform and complete the work, remove all dirt, rubbish, equipment and
material, and put the Public Way or Public Ground in the said condition, the
City shall have, after demand to the Utility to cure and the passage of a
reasonable period of time following the demand, but not to exceed five (5)
days, the right to make the restoration at the expense of the Utility. The
Utility shall pay to the City the cost of such work done for or performed by
the City, including its administrative expense and overhead, plus ten percent
(10%) additional as liquidated damages. This remedy shall be in addition to any
other remedy available to the City.
[§ 18-306 amended by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007.]
SECTION 18-307.   RELOCATION OF UTILITIES.
   A.   Relocation of Utilities in Public Ways. If the City determines to
vacate for a City improvement project, or to grade, regrade, or change the
right-of-way lines of any Public Way, or construct or reconstruct any Utility
System in any Public Way, it may order the Utility to relocate its Facilities
located therein. The Utility shall relocate its Facilities at its own expense.
The City shall give the Utility reasonable notice of plans to vacate for a City
improvement project, or to grade, regrade, or change the line of any right-of-
way or to construct or reconstruct any City Utility System. If a relocation is
ordered within five (5) years of a prior relocation of the same Facilities,
which was made at Utility expense, the City shall reimburse for non-betterment
expenses on a time and material basis, provided that if a subsequent relocation
is required because of the extension of a City Utility System to a previously
unserved area, may be required to make the subsequent relocation at its
expense. Nothing in this Ordinance requires Utility to relocate, remove,
replace or reconnect at its own expense its facilities where such relocation,
removal, replacement or reconstruction is solely for the convenience of the
City and is not reasonably necessary for the construction or reconstruction of
a Public Way or City Utility System or other City improvement. In no case shall
the City be liable to the Utility for failure to specifically preserve a right-
of-way under Minn. Stat. § 160.29, as amended.
[§ 18-307, Paragraph A, amended by Ord. No. 89-17, effective December 8, 1989,
amended by Ord. No. 09-02, effective March 5, 2009.]
   B.   Relocation of Utility in Public Ground. The City may require the
Utility to relocate or remove its Facilities from Public Ground upon a finding
by City that the facilities have become or will become a substantial impairment
of the public use to which the Public Ground is or will be put. The relocation
or removal shall be at the Utility’s expense. The provisions of this Paragraph
B apply only to facilities constructed upon Public Ground in reliance on a
Service Area license and a Utility does not, by this provision, waive its
rights under a recorded easement document or prescriptive right in favor of the
Utility.
[§ 18-307 amended by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007, amended by Ord.
No. 09-02, effective March 5, 2009.]
SECTION 18-308.   RELOCATION WHEN PUBLIC GROUND VACATED.
The vacation of any Public Ground shall not operate to deprive the Utility of
the right to operate and maintain its facilities therein. Unless ordered under
Section
18-307,the Utility need not relocate until the reasonable cost of relocating
and the loss and expense resulting from such relocation are first paid to the
Company. When the vacation is for the benefit of the City in the furtherance of
a public purpose, the Utility shall relocate at its own expense.
[§ 18-308 amended by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007.]
SECTION 18-309.   STREET IMPROVEMENTS, PAVING OR RESURFACING.
   A.   The City shall give the Utility reasonable written notice of plans for
street improvements where paving or resurfacing of a permanent nature is
involved. The notice shall contain the nature and character of the
improvements, the streets upon which the improvements are to be made, the
extent of the improvements and the time when the City will start the work, and,
if more than one street is involved, the order in which this work is to
proceed. The notice shall be given to the Utility a sufficient length of time,
considering seasonable working conditions, in advance of the actual
commencement of the work, to permit the Utility to make any additions,
alterations or repairs to its facilities the Utility deems necessary.
   B.   In cases where streets are at final width and grade, and the City has
installed underground sewer and water mains and Service Connections to the
property line abutting the streets prior to a permanent paving or resurfacing
of such streets, and the Utility’s main is located under such street, the
Utility may be required to install gas Service Connections prior to such paving
or resurfacing, whenever it is apparent that gas service will be required
during the five (5) years following the paving or resurfacing.
[§ 18-309 amended by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007.]
SECTION 18-310.   LOCATION OF ABOVE-GROUND FACILITIES
   A.   Location of Above-Ground Facilities. Above-ground Utilities shall be
located and constructed so as not to interfere with the safety and convenience
of ordinary travel along and over Public Ways. A permit to construct facilities
on Public Grounds or Public Ways may be disallowed by the City Council upon
finding that the proposed facility constitutes a hazard in the right-of-way. A
“hazard in the right-of-way” is any construction at any location within the
full width of the right-of-way, which because of position, siting and proximity
to the traveled portion of the right-of-way and because of strength, density
and mass of construction would be the kind of impediment to a motor vehicle
traveling at the posted speed limit sufficient to cause bodily harm to vehicle
passengers when impacted by said vehicle after it has left the travelled
portion of the right-of-way. Upon such a finding, the Utility shall be required
to construct its facility outside of the right-of-way. The Utility’s
construction, reconstruction, operation, repair, maintenance and location of
above-ground facilities shall be subject to other reasonable regulations of the
City.
   B.   Field Locations. The Company shall provide field locations for any of
its underground facilities within a reasonable period of time on request by the
City. The period of time will be considered reasonable if it compares favorably
with the average time required by the cities in the same county to locate
municipal underground facilities for the Utility.
[§ 18-310 amended by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007.]
ARTICLE IV
GENERAL CONDITIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL SERVICE AREA LICENSES FOR NATURAL GAS
UTILITIES
SECTION 18-401.   INDEMNIFICATION.
   A.   Each Service Area licensee shall indemnify, keep and hold the City free
and harmless from any and all liability on account of injury to persons or
damage to property occasioned by the construction, maintenance, repair,
inspection, the issuance of permits or licenses, or the operation of the
Utility’s facilities located in the City. The City shall not be indemnified for
losses or claims occasioned through its own negligence except for losses or
claims arising out of or alleging the City’s negligence as to the issuance of
licenses or permits for, or inspection of, the Utility’s plans or work. The
City shall not be indemnified if the injury or damage results from the
performance in a proper manner of acts reasonably deemed hazardous by Utility,
and such performance is nevertheless ordered or directed by the City after
notice of Utility’s determination.
   B.   In the event a suit is brought against the City under circumstances
where this license condition applies, the Utility, at its sole cost and
expense, shall defend the City in such suit if written notice thereof is
promptly given to the Utility within a period wherein the Utility is not
prejudiced by lack of such notice. If the Utility is required to indemnify and
defend, it will thereafter have control of such litigation, but the Utility may
not settle such litigation without the consent of the City, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld. This section is not, as to third parties, a
waiver of any defense or immunity otherwise available to the City; and the
Utility, in defending any action on behalf of the City, shall be entitled to
assert in any action every defense or immunity that the City could assert on
its own behalf.
[§ 18-401 amended by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007.]
SECTION 18-402.   ADEQUATE SUPPLY.
Each Service Area licensee shall furnish and supply to the Service Area
inhabitants an adequate supply of gas, as long as available under such pressure
and conditions as may be reasonably required under such rules and regulations
as may be established by this Chapter, and the Minnesota Public Utilities
Commission or other such regulatory body as may hereinafter be established
under the laws of the State of Minnesota, and given jurisdiction thereof.
SECTION 18-403.   PUBLIC SAFETY.
By acceptance of its Service Area license, each licensee acknowledges that the
City may enact ordinances which affect the licensee’s rights and duties with
respect to Pipeline safety and construction, and acknowledges that where such
public safety is a bona fide municipal concern, such ordinances shall
effectively serve to amend this Chapter and the rights and duties contained
herein. Each licensee specifically consents to such amendments, even though
they be unilateral in nature.
[§ 18-403 amended by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007.]
SECTION 18-404.   ASSIGNMENT OF SERVICE AREA LICENSES.
A licensee, upon notice to the City, shall have the right and authority to
assign all rights conferred upon it by this Chapter to any person. The assignee
of such rights, by accepting such assignment, shall become subject to the
regulations and conditions of this Chapter.

of its Distribution System in the City.
[§ 18-405 amended by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007.]
SECTION 18-406.   NONEXCLUSIVE SERVICE AREAS.
   A.   Each Service Area license is nonexclusive and conditional. If it is in
the public interest to do so, the City Council may grant intermingled Service
Areas to competing gas utilities. It is the intent of these provisions to
provide a reasonable measure of regulation to avoid intermingled or overlapping
Service Areas. In this sense, each Service Area license is nonexclusive.
   B.   A Service Area license is subject to the general conditions of this
Article and to the specific conditions recited in each license.
[§ 18-406 amended by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007.]
SECTION 18-407.   REVIEW OR REVOCATION OF A SERVICE AREA LICENSE.
   A.   The City Council may review a Service Area license upon the request of
any person or upon its own initiative.
   B.   A Service Area license may be revoked or reduced in its area upon the
City Council making any one or more of the following findings:
      1.   The licensee has failed to meet the general conditions of this
Article or the specific conditions of its license;
      2.   The licensee has failed to operate the Utility within the City in
accord with this Chapter; or
      3.   Any just cause.
Revocation proceedings will be conducted in accord with
Chapter 10 of the City Code.
[§ 18-407 amended by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007.]
SECTION 18-408.   APPLICATION FOR SERVICE AREA LICENSE.
Application for a Service Area license shall be made in writing to the City
Administrator and shall include such maps, schematics, diagrams and narrative
descriptions as are necessary to describe or depict:
   A.   The existing Distribution System;

07-02, effective March 1, 2007, amended by Ord. No. 09-04, effective March 19,
2009.]
SECTION 18-409.   EXPANSION OF SERVICE AREAS.
A Service Area licensee may make application to expand its Service Area in the
same manner as an original license application.
SECTION 18-410.   INITIAL SERVICE AREA LICENSE FEES.
   A.   License fees shall be paid by the first licensee(s) to defray the
City’s cost in granting a license and in administering the regulations of this
Chapter. The Utilities which obtain the first Service Area Licenses in the City
shall each be charged a license fee based upon the formula: $1,000.00, plus
$2.10 for each improved parcel within the described service area. The number of
improved parcels shall be determined by the City Administrator by reference to
the most recent listing by the Anoka County Assessor. License fees charged for

   E.   INDEMNIFICATION
      1.   Indemnity of City. Company shall indemnify and hold the City

the issuance of permits, or the operation of the Gas Facilities located in the

or work.
      2.   Defense of City. In the event a suit is brought against the City
under circumstances where this agreement to indemnify applies, Company at its
sole cost and expense shall defend the City in such suit if written Notice
thereof is promptly given to Company within a period wherein Company is not
prejudiced by lack of such Notice. If Company is required to indemnify and
defend, it will thereafter have control of such litigation, but Company may not
settle such litigation without the consent of the City, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld. This section is not, as to third parties, a waiver of
any defense or immunity otherwise available to the City. The Company, in
defending any action on behalf of the City, shall be entitled to assert in any
action every defense or immunity that the City could assert in its own behalf.
This Franchise agreement shall not be interpreted to constitute a waiver by the

Any change in the form of government of the City shall not affect the validity
of this Ordinance. Any governmental unit succeeding the City shall, without the
consent of Company, succeed to all of the rights and obligations of the City
provided in this Ordinance.
   H.   FRANCHISE FEE
      1.   Form. During the term of the franchise hereby granted, the City may
charge the Company a franchise fee. If the City should enact a franchise fee
through a franchise fee ordinance, the Company will administer the collection
and payment of franchise fees to City in lieu of permit fees, or other fees
that may otherwise be imposed on the Company in relation to its operations as a
public utility in the City. The franchise fee will be collected on a flat per
meter basis, or by some other method that is mutually acceptable to both City
and Company for each customer within the corporate limits of the City. The
amount of the fee collected may differ for each customer class. The City will
use a formula that provides a stable and predictable amount of fees, without
placing the Company at a competitive disadvantage. Such fee shall not exceed
any amount that the Company may legally charge to its customers prior to
payment to the City. If the Company claims that the City required fee formula
is discriminatory or otherwise places the Company at a competitive
disadvantage, the company will provide a formula that will produce a
substantially similar fee amount to the City. The City will attempt to
accommodate the Company but is under no franchise obligation to adopt the
Company-proposed franchise fee formula and each review will not delay the
implementation of the City-imposed fee. If the City and Company are unable to
agree, the disagreement shall be subject to the Dispute Resolution provisions
of this Ordinance.
      2.   Separate Ordinance. The franchise fee shall be imposed by separate
ordinance duly adopted by the City Council, which ordinance shall not be
adopted until at least sixty (60) days after written Notice enclosing such
proposed ordinance has been served upon the Company by certified mail. The
Company is not required to collect a franchise fee if the terms of the fee
agreement are inconsistent with this franchise or state law, provided the
Company notifies the City Council of the same within the sixty (60) day period.
      3.   Condition of Fee. The separate ordinance imposing the fee shall not
be effective against the Company unless it lawfully imposes a fee of the same
or substantially similar amount on the sale of energy within the City by any
other energy supplier, provided that, as to such supplier, the City has the
authority or contractual right to require a franchise fee or similar fee
through an agreed-upon franchise.
      4.   Collection of Fee. The franchise fee shall be payable not less than
quarterly during complete billing months of the period for which payment is to
be made. The franchise fee formula may be changed from time to time, however,
the change shall meet the same Notice and acceptance requirements and the fee
may not be changed more often than annually. Such fee shall not exceed any
amount that the company may legally charge to its customers prior to payment to
the City. Such fee is subject to subsequent reductions to account for
uncollectibles and customer refunds incurred by the Company. The Company shall
not be responsible to pay City fees that Company is unable to collect under
Commission rules or order. The Company agrees to make available for inspection
by the City at reasonable times all records necessary to audit the Company’s
determination of the franchise fee payments.
      5.   Continuation of Franchise Fee. If this Franchise expires and the
City and the Company are unable to agree upon terms of a new franchise, the
franchise fee, if any being imposed by the City at the time this Franchise
expires, will remain in effect until a new franchise is agreed upon. However,
the franchise fee will not remain in effect for more than one year after the
franchise expires as stated in Section 2.6 of this Franchise. If for any reason
franchise terminates, the franchise fee will terminate at the same time.
   I.   ABANDONED FACILITIES.
The Company shall comply with Minnesota Statutes, Section 216D.01 et. seq. and
Minnesota Rules 7819.3300, as theymay be amended from time to time with respect
to abandoned facilities located in Public Ways and Public Grounds.
   J.   PROVISIONS OF ORDINANCE.
      1.   Severability.  Every section, provision, or part of this Ordinance
is declared separate from every other section, provision, or part; and if any
section, provision, or part shall be held invalid, it shall not affect any
other section, provision, or part. Where a provision of any other City
ordinance conflicts with the provisions of this Ordinance, the provisions of
this Ordinance shall prevail.
      2.   Limitation on Applicability . This Ordinance constitutes a franchise
agreement between the City and Company as the only parties. No provisions
herein shall in any way inure to the benefit of any third person (including the
public at large) so as to constitute any such person as a third party
beneficiary of this Ordinance or of any one or more of the terms hereof, or
otherwise give rise to any cause of action in any person not a party hereto.
   K.   AMENDMENT PROCEDURE. Either party may propose at any time that this
Franchise Ordinance be amended. Franchise Ordinance may be amended at any time
by the City passing a subsequent ordinance declaring the provisions of the
amendment, which amendatory ordinance shall become effective upon the filing of
Company’s written consent thereto with the City Clerk within 60 days after the
effective date of the amendatory ordinance. If the Company does not consent to
the amendment, the ordinance containing the amendment shall be revoked by City.

TITLE, POLICY, AND PURPOSE
SECTION 20-100.   TITLE.
This Chapter may be cited as the “Forestry Regulations for the City of
Columbus.”
[Section 20-100 amended by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007, amended by
Ord. No. 07-04, effective July 26, 2007.]
SECTION 20-101.   PURPOSE.
This Chapter regulates all trees and Forests on public lands as the same are
defined herein. This Chapter also regulates all diseases and pests of Shade
Trees on public and private lands as the same are defined herein. The purposes
of this Chapter are:
   A.   To regulate the planting, maintenance and removal of trees on public
lands under the jurisdiction of the City;
   B.   To preserve the Forests within the City;
   C.   To protect property values by preserving the Forests in the City;
   D.   To provide regulations for resisting and eradicating diseases and pests
of Shade Trees;
   E.   To provide development guidelines which seek to reduce loss of or
damage to Significant Trees on undeveloped land; and
   F.   To provide guidelines which encourage the planting of new trees to
replace those trees lost to disease, pests, or development.
[Section 20-101 amended by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007, amended by
Ord. No. 07-04, effective July 26, 2007.]
SECTION 20-102.   FINDINGS.
The City Council finds:
   A.   That the public and private Forests within the City are significant
environmental and aesthetic assets which should be preserved, protected, and
replenished.
   B.   That the public and private Forests within the City are significant
property value assets.
   C.   That oak Forests are the predominant hardwood Forests of the City and
that preservation of these Woods justifies an annual inspection of the City for
oak wilt disease and Shade Tree Pests.
   D.   That the science of fighting diseases and pests of Shade Trees has
changed somewhat since the City’s first regulations were adopted.
   E.   That the numerous provisions regulating trees and Forests in various
chapters of the City Code should be coordinated in one chapter of the Code.
   F.   That the City Code should be augmented with reasonable regulations
which are designed to meet these purposes and to protect these values.
[Section 20-102 amended by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007, amended by
Ord. No. 07-04, effective July 26, 2007.]
SECTION 20-103.   POLICY.
The following policy statements are adopted by the City:
   A.   Preserve and Protect. The City shall do all things reasonable to
preserve and protect existing trees on public lands within the City and to
assist private landowners in the preservation and protection of their trees.
   B.   Preservation Preferred to Replacement. The preferred method of
completing an excavation, a subdivision of land, new construction, or other
development work is the method or plan which avoids damage to any Significant
Trees.
   C.   Voluntary Replacement Standards. If an excavation, a subdivision of
land, new construction, or other development work cannot be accomplished
without removing existing Significant Trees, then the trees removed should be
replaced with new trees. Each replacement tree should be not less than one inch
caliper.
   D.   Replacement Species and Diversity. Since oaks and other Shade Trees are
susceptible to diseases and pests, the City Forester shall recommend acceptable
species for replacement trees to reduce susceptibility to disease and to
increase diversity of tree species.
[Section 20-103 amended by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007, amended by

ARTICLE V.
SHADE TREE DISEASES
SECTION 20-501.   DECLARATION OF POLICY.
The City Council has determined that the health of the Shade Trees are
threatened by pests and the health of the oak trees within the municipal limits
are threatened by a fatal disease known as oak wilt disease. It has further
been determined that the loss of Shade Trees, including oak trees, growing upon
private and public property would substantially depreciate the value of
property within the City and impair the safety, good order, general welfare and
convenience of the public. It is declared to be the intention of the City
Council to control and prevent the spread of Shade Tree Pests and oak wilt
disease and this Article is enacted for that purpose.

ARTICLE VI.
DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES
PREAMBLE TO ARTICLE VI:
The findings stated in Section 20-102 above are reasserted here. Trees and
Forests on private property are significant environmental values which should
be protected, managed, and nurtured. Unlike wetlands for which there are
protective statutory regulations, Forest and trees on private land have not yet
been given public protection by the Minnesota legislature. Until the
legislature acts, the City of Columbus is limited to offering voluntary
guidelines for the protection of Forest and trees on private land. Landowners
are encouraged to act responsibly when considering the removal of trees and
Forests. Except for the mandatory inspection for oak wilt under § 20-604 below
and except for the required tree maintenance plan, this Article VI is offered
to landowners as a voluntary guide: no provision of this Article shall be
interpreted or construed to prevent a landowner from removing any particular
tree from privately owned land.

No. 13-01, effective January 31, 2013.]
SECTION 20-600.   BUILDING PERMIT AND ZONING PERMIT GUIDELINES.
All applicants for Building Permits and Zoning Permits under
Chapter 7A of this City Code shall submit a tree maintenance plan in accordance
with the requirements for tree care under Section
20-603 of this Chapter.
[§ 20-600 amended by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007, amended by Ord.
No. 13-01, effective January 31, 2013.]
SECTION 20-601.   SUBDIVISION DESIGN GUIDELINES.
All applicants for subdivisions under
Chapter 8 of this City Code shall submit a tree maintenance plan in accordance
with the requirements for tree care under Section
20-603 of this Chapter.
[§ 20-601 amended by Ord. No. 07-02, effective March 1, 2007, amended by Ord.
No. 13-01, effective January 31, 2013.]
SECTION 20-602.   EXCAVATION PERMIT GUIDELINES.
All applicants for excavation permits under
Chapter 9 of this City Code shall submit a tree maintenance plan in accordance
with the requirements for tree care under Section

SECTION 20-603.   TREE MAINTENANCE PLAN.
   A.   Generally. When a tree maintenance plan is required under the
guidelines of this Chapter to protect Significant Trees, the plan shall be
reviewed by the Zoning Administrator as part of the proposed site plan. The
tree maintenance plan also must be reviewed by the City Forester in accordance
with the standards and specifications for tree care section of this Chapter and
physical barriers installed before any earth-moving, excavation, or
construction of improvements begins. The tree maintenance plan shall cover all
areas of preventing construction damage including the designation of utility
alleys, cut and fill areas, tree felling, tree wounding, tree protection zones,
the location of improvements to be constructed, the location of individual on-
site sewage treatment systems, the location of wells, the location of
driveways, the proposed location of replacement plantings, and disease control
measures, and any other areas thought to be advisable by the Forester.
   B.   Coordinated with Other Regulations. The tree maintenance plan shall be
coordinated with each of the following:
      1.   The consideration of a preliminary survey for a minor subdivision;
      2.   The consideration of a preliminary plat for a major subdivision
(plat);
      3.   The site plan for an excavation regulated under
Chapter 9 of this City Code;
      4.   The site plan for new construction under the application for a
Building Permit and Zoning Permit under
Chapter 7A of this City Code; and,
      5.   Any other activity or development which could foreseeably damage
existing Significant Trees.
   C.   State Law and County Ordinances. The tree maintenance plan shall also
be reviewed with consideration of state regulations which may require an
environmental impact statement. {'{'}See, for example, Minn. Rules § 4410.4300,
Subpart 28, and § 4410.4600, Subpart 18, which strictly regulates clear cutting
of Forest and requires an environmental impact statement. Parcels under 20
acres are exempt from the E.I.S. requirement.{'}'} The tree maintenance plan
shall also be reviewed with consideration of Columbus’ Shoreland Management
Ordinance and Floodplain Management Ordinance. {'{'}Minn. Rules § 6120.3300,
Subpart 8, requires that conversion of forested areas on lands subject to
Shoreland Management or Flood Plain Management Ordinances to a non-forested
use, e.g., housing development, requires a Conditional Use Permit which
prohibits clear cutting of shore areas and requires a detailed erosion and
sediment control plan. Additionally, these plans must be approved by the Anoka
County Soil and Water Conservation Service before issuance of the Conditional
Use Permit.{'}'}

and oak wilt control measures completed for the control of the disease prior to
the earlier of the following two events:
