contrary.

§ 10.20 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Any licensed peace officer of the city’s Police Department, the County
Sheriff or any Deputy Sheriff shall have the authority to enforce any provision
of this code.
   (B)   As permitted by M.S. § 626.862, as it may be amended from time to
time, the City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer shall have the authority to
administer and enforce this code. In addition, under that statutory authority,
certain individuals designated within the code or by the Administrator/Clerk-
Treasurer or City Council shall have the authority to administer and enforce
the provisions specified. All and any person or persons designated may issue a
citation in lieu of arrest or continued detention to enforce any provision of
the code.
   (C)   The City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer and any city official or
employee designated by this code who has the responsibility to perform a duty
under this code may, with the permission of a licensee of a business or owner
of any property or resident of a dwelling, or other person in control of any
premises, inspect or otherwise enter any property to enforce compliance with
this code.
   (D)   If the licensee, owner, resident or other person in control of a
premises objects to the inspection of or entrance to the property, the City
Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer, peace officer or any employee or official
charged with the duty of enforcing the provisions of this code may, upon a
showing that probable cause exists for the issuance of a valid search warrant
from a court of competent jurisdiction, petition and obtain a search warrant
before conducting the inspection or otherwise entering the property. This
warrant shall be only to determine whether the provisions of this code enacted
to protect the health, safety and welfare of the people are being complied with
and to enforce these provisions only, and no criminal charges shall be made as
a result of the warrant. No warrant shall be issued unless there be probable
cause to issue the warrant. Probable cause occurs if the search is reasonable.
Probable cause does not depend on specific knowledge of the condition of a
particular property.
   (E)   Every licensee, owner, resident or other person in control of property
within the city shall permit at reasonable times inspections of or entrance to
the property by the City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer or any other authorized
city officer or employee only to determine whether the provisions of this code
enacted to protect the health, safety and welfare of the people are being
complied with and to enforce these provisions. Unreasonable refusal to permit
the inspection of or entrance to the property shall be grounds for termination
of any and all permits, licenses or city service to the property. Mailed notice
shall be given to the licensee, owner, resident or other person in control of
the property, stating the grounds for the termination, and the licensee, owner,
resident or other person in control of the property shall be given an
opportunity to appear before the City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer to object
to the termination before it occurs, subject to appeal of the Administrator/
Clerk-Treasurer’s decision to the City Council at a regularly scheduled or
special meeting.
   (F)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of
the city to enter private property in urgent emergency situations where there
is an imminent danger in order to protect the public health, safety and
welfare.
§ 10.21 PAYMENT INTO CITY TREASURY OF FINES AND PENALTIES.
   All fines, forfeitures and penalties recovered for the violation of any
ordinance, charter, rule or regulation of the city shall be paid into the City
Treasury by the Court or officer thereof receiving the moneys. Payment shall be
made in the manner, at the time and in the proportion provided by law.
(1989 Code, § 1.06)
§ 10.22 ACT OTHERWISE UNLAWFUL.
   The city code does not authorize an act or omission otherwise prohibited by
law.
(1989 Code, § 1.04)
§ 10.98 SUPPLEMENTAL ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES.
   (A)   In addition to those administrative penalties established in this code
and the enforcement powers granted in §
10.20, the City Council is authorized to create by resolution, adopted by a
majority of the members of the Council, supplemental administrative penalties.
The resolution may not proscribe administrative penalties for traffic offenses
designated by M.S. § 169.999, as it may be amended from time to time.
   (B)   These administrative penalty procedures in this section are intended
to provide the public and the city with an informal, cost-effective and
expeditious alternative to traditional criminal charges for violations of
certain provisions of this code. The procedures are intended to be voluntary on
the part of those who have been charged with those offenses.
   (C)   Administrative penalties for violations of various provisions of the
code, other than those penalties established in the code or in statutes that
are adopted by reference, may be established from time to time by resolution of
a majority of the members of the City Council. In order to be effective, an
administrative penalty for a particular violation must be established before
the violation occurred.
   (D)   In the discretion of the peace officer, City Administrator/Clerk-
Treasurer or other person giving notice of an alleged violation of a provision
of this code, in a written notice of an alleged violation, sent by first class
mail to the person who is alleged to have violated the code, the person giving
notice may request the payment of a voluntary administrative penalty for the
violation directly to the City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer within 14 days of
the notice of the violation. A sample notice is contained in Appendix A to this
chapter. In the sole discretion of the person giving the notice of the alleged
violation, the time for payment may be extended an additional 14 days, whether
or not requested by the person to whom the notice has been given. In addition
to the administrative penalty, the person giving notice may request in the
notice to the alleged violator to adopt a compliance plan to correct the
situation resulting in the alleged violation and may provide that, if the
alleged violator corrects the situation resulting in the alleged violation
within the time specified in the notice, the payment of the administrative
penalty will be waived.
   (E)   At any time before the payment of the administrative penalty is due,
the person who has been given notice of an alleged violation may request to
appear before the City Council to contest the request for payment of the
penalty. After a hearing before the Council, the Council may determine to
withdraw the request for payment or to renew the request for payment. Because
the payment of the administrative penalty is voluntary, there shall be no
appeal from the decision of the Council.
   (F)   At any time after the date the payment of the administrative penalty
is due, if the administrative penalty remains unpaid or the situation creating
the alleged violation remains uncorrected, the city, through its Attorney, may
bring criminal charges in accordance with state law and this code. Likewise,
the city, in its discretion, may bring criminal charges in the first instance,
rather than requesting the payment of an administrative penalty, even if a
penalty for the particular violation has been established by Council
resolution. If the administrative penalty is paid, or if any requested
correction of the situation resulting in the violation is completed, no
criminal charges shall be initiated by the city for the alleged violation.
§ 10.99 GENERAL PENALTY AND ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Any person, firm or corporation who violates any provision of this
code for which another penalty is not specifically provided shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor. The penalty which may be imposed for
any crime which is a misdemeanor under this code, including state statutes
specifically adopted by reference, shall be a sentence of not more than 90 days
or a fine of not more than $1,000, or both.
   (B)   Any person, firm or corporation who violates any provision of this
code, including state statutes specifically adopted by reference, which is
designated to be a petty misdemeanor shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a
petty misdemeanor. The penalty which may be imposed for any petty offense which
is a petty misdemeanor shall be a sentence of a fine of not more than $300.
   (C)   Pursuant to M.S. § 631.48, as it may be amended from time to time, in
either the case of a misdemeanor or a petty misdemeanor, the costs of
prosecution may be added. A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon
each day during which a violation occurs or continues.
   (D)   The failure of any officer or employee of the city to perform any
official duty imposed by this code shall not subject the officer or employee to
the penalty imposed for a violation.
   (E)   In addition to any penalties provided for in this section or in §
10.98, if any person, firm or corporation fails to comply with any provision of
this code, the Council or any city official designated by it, may institute
appropriate proceedings at law or at equity to restrain, correct or abate the
violation.
APPENDIX A: NOTICE OF CODE VIOLATION
To: (Name and address of person who is alleged to have violated the code)
From: (Name and title of city official giving the notice)
Re: Alleged violation of Section _____ of the City Code, relating to (give
title of section)
Date: (Date of notice)
   I hereby allege that on (date of violation) you violated §                 
of the City Code relating to      
                                                                                                                                    
 .
   The City Council has by resolution established an administrative penalty in
the amount of $         for this violation.
   Payment of this administrative penalty is voluntary, but if you do not pay
it the city may initiate criminal proceedings for this alleged violation.
   Payment is due within 14 days of the date of this notice. Before the due
date, you may request an additional 14-day extension of the time to pay the
administrative penalty.
   As an alternative to the payment of this administrative penalty, if the
situation that gave rise to this alleged violation is corrected by
                        (establish date), then the payment of the
administrative penalty will be waived.
   Even if the administrative penalty is paid, the city reserves the right to
institute appropriate proceedings at law or at equity to restrain, correct or
abate the violation.
   Before the due date, you may request to appear before the City Council to
contest the request for payment of the penalty. After a hearing before the
Council, the Council may determine to withdraw the request for payment or to
renew the request for payment. Because the payment of the administrative
penalty is voluntary, there shall be no appeal from the decision of the
Council.
   If you pay the administrative penalty, the city will not initiate criminal
proceedings for this alleged violation. However, the Council, or any city
official designated by it, may institute appropriate proceedings at law or at
equity to restrain, correct or abate the violation.
   Payment of the administrative penalty may be made by check, cash or money
order to the City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer.

LODGING TAX
§ 35.01 RECITALS.
   The State Legislature has authorized the imposition of a tax upon lodging at
a hotel, motel, rooming house, tourist court or other use of space by a
transient. The Council finds that the imposition of this tax would provide
funding for a convention and tourism bureau to promote the city as a tourist
and convention center.
(1989 Code, § 6.32, Subd. 1)
§ 35.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   LODGER. The person obtaining lodging from an operator.
   LODGING. The furnishing for a consideration of LODGING by a hotel, motel or
rooming house except where the LODGING shall be for a continuous period of 30
days or more to the same lodger(s). The furnishing of rooms by religious,
educational or nonprofit organizations shall not constitute LODGING for
purposes of this section.
   OPERATOR. A person who provides lodging to others or any officer, agent or
employee of the person.
   RENT. The total consideration valued in money charged for lodging, whether
paid in money or otherwise, but shall not include any charges for services
rendered in connection with furnishing lodging other than the room charge
itself.
   TAX ADMINISTRATOR. The City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer.
(1989 Code, § 6.32, Subd. 2)
§ 35.03 IMPOSITION OF TAX.
   There is hereby imposed a tax of 3% on the rent charged by an operator for
providing lodging to any person after October 1, 1991. The tax shall be stated
and charged separately and shall be collected by the operator from the lodger.
The tax collected by the operator shall be a debt owed by the operator to the
city and shall be extinguished only by payment to the city. In no case shall
the tax imposed by this section upon an operator exceed the amount of tax which
the operator is authorized and required by this section to collect from a
lodger.
(1989 Code, § 6.32, Subd. 3)
§ 35.04 COLLECTIONS.
   Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this section at the time the
rent is paid. The tax collections shall be deemed to be held in trust by the
operator for the city. The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the
rent charged for the lodging and those persons paying the tax shall receive a
receipt of payment from the operator.
(1989 Code, § 6.32, Subd. 4)
§ 35.05 EXEMPTIONS.
   An exemption shall be granted to any person as to whom or whose occupancy it
is beyond the power of the city to tax. No exemption shall be granted except
upon a claim therefor made at the time the rent is collected and a claim shall
be made in writing and under penalty of perjury on forms provided by the Tax
Administrator. All the claims shall be forwarded to the Tax Administrator when
the returns and collections are submitted as required by this section.
(1989 Code, § 6.32, Subd. 5)
§ 35.06 ADVERTISING NO TAX.
   It is unlawful for any operator to advertise or hold out or state to the
public or any customer, directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part
thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be
added to the rent or that, if added, it or any part thereof will be refunded.
In computing the tax to be collected, amounts of tax less than $0.01 shall be
considered an additional cent.
(1989 Code, § 6.32, Subd. 6) Penalty, see §
35.99
§ 35.07 PAYMENT AND RETURNS.
   (A)   The taxes imposed by this section shall be paid by the operator to the
Tax Administrator monthly not later than 15 days after the end of the month in
which the taxes were collected. At the time of payment the operator shall
submit a return upon forms and containing information as the Tax Administrator
may require. The return shall contain the following minimum information:
      (1)   The total amount of rent collected for lodging during the period
covered by the return;
      (2)   The amount of tax required to be collected and due for the period;
      (3)   The signature of the person filing the return or that of his or her
agent duly authorized in writing;
      (4)   The period covered by the return; and

tax.
   (B)   The operator may offset against the taxes payable, with respect to any
reporting period, the amount of taxes imposed by this section previously paid
as a result of any transaction, the consideration for which became
uncollectible during the reporting period, but only in proportion to the
portion of the consideration which became uncollectible.
(1989 Code, § 6.32, Subd. 7)
§ 35.08 EXAMINATION OF RETURN, ADJUSTMENTS, NOTICES AND DEMANDS.
   The Tax Administrator shall, after return is filed, examine the same and
make any investigation or examination of the records and accounts of the person
making the return deemed necessary for determining its correctness. The tax
computed on the basis of the examination shall be the tax to be paid. If the
tax due is found to be greater than that paid, the excess shall be paid to the
Tax Administrator ten days after receipt of a notice thereof given either
personally or sent by registered mail to the address shown on the return. If
the tax paid is greater than the tax found to be due, the excess shall be
refunded to the person who paid the tax to the Tax Administrator ten days after
determination of the refund.
(1989 Code, § 6.32, Subd. 8)
§ 35.09 REFUNDS.
   Any person may apply to the Tax Administrator for a refund of taxes paid for
a prescribed period in excess of the amount legally due for that period,
provided that no application for refund shall be considered unless filed within
one year after the tax was paid, or within one year from the filing of the
return, whichever period is the longer. The Tax Administrator shall examine the
claim and make and file written findings thereon denying or allowing the claim
in whole or in part and shall mail a notice thereof by registered mail to the
person at the address stated upon the return. If the claim is allowed in whole
or in part, the Tax Administrator shall credit the amount of the allowance
against any taxes due under this section from the claimant and the balance of
the allowance, if any, shall be paid by the Tax Administrator to the claimant.
(1989 Code, § 6.32, Subd. 9)
§ 35.10 FAILURE TO FILE A RETURN.
   (A)   If any operator required by this section to file a return shall fail
to do so within the time prescribed, or shall make, willfully or otherwise, an
incorrect, false or fraudulent return, the operator shall, upon written notice
and demand, file the return or corrected return within five days of receipt of
the written notice and shall at the same time pay any tax due on the basis
thereof. If the person shall fail to file the return or corrected return, the
Tax Administrator shall make a return or corrected return, for the person from
any knowledge and information as the Tax Administrator can obtain, and assess a
tax on the basis thereof, which tax (less any payments theretofore made on
account of the tax for the taxable period covered by the return) shall be paid
within five days of the receipt of written notice and demand for the payment.
Any return or assessment made by the Tax Administrator shall be prima facie
correct and valid, and the person shall have the burden of establishing its
incorrectness or invalidity in any action or proceeding in respect thereto.
   (B)   If any portion of a tax imposed by this section, including penalties
thereon, is not paid within 30 days after it is required to be paid, the City
Attorney may institute any legal action as may be necessary to recover the
amount due plus interest, penalties, the costs and disbursements of any action.
   (C)   Upon a showing of good cause, the Tax Administrator may grant an
operator one 30-day extension of time within which to file a return and make
payment of taxes as required by this section, provided that interest during the
period of extension shall be added to the taxes due at the rate of 10% per
annum.
(1989 Code, § 6.32, Subd. 10)
§ 35.11 ADMINISTRATION OF TAX.
   The Tax Administrator shall administer and enforce the assessment and
collection of the taxes imposed by this section. The Tax Administrator shall
cause to be prepared blank forms for the returns and other documents required
by this section and shall distribute the same throughout the city and furnish
them on application, but failure to receive or secure them shall not relieve
any person from any obligation required of him or her under this section.
(1989 Code, § 6.32, Subd. 12)
§ 35.12 EXAMINE RECORDS.
   The Tax Administrator and those persons acting on behalf of the Tax
Administrator authorized in writing by the Tax Administrator or the city may

provided in this section. Every operator is directed and required to give to
the person authorized to examine the books, papers and records the means,
facilities and opportunity for examination and investigations as are hereby
authorized.
(1989 Code, § 6.32, Subd. 13)
§ 35.13 UNLAWFUL ACTS.
   It is unlawful for any person to willfully fail to make a return required by
this section; to fail to pay the tax after written demand for payment; to fail
to remit the taxes collected or any penalty or interest imposed by this section
after written demand for the payment; or to refuse to permit the Tax
Administrator or any duly authorized agents or employees to examine the books,
records and papers under his or her control; or to willfully make any
incomplete, false or fraudulent return.
(1989 Code, § 6.32, Subd. 14) Penalty, see §
35.99
§ 35.14 USE OF PROCEEDS.
   Five percent of the proceeds obtained from the collection of taxes pursuant
to this section shall be paid to the Tax Administrator for costs of collection.

the same may be amended from time to time, to provide funding to Iron Trail
Convention and Visitors Bureau, or any other tourist or convention center as
selected by Council resolution, for the purpose of marketing and promoting the
city as a tourist or convention center.
(1989 Code, § 6.32, Subd. 15)
§ 35.15 APPEALS.
   (A)   Any operator aggrieved by any notice, order or determination made by

notice, order or determination detailing the operator’s reasons for contesting
the notice, order or determination. The petition shall contain the name of the
petitioner, the petitioner’s address and the location of the lodging subject to
the order, notice or determination.
   (B)   The petition shall be filed with the Tax Administrator within ten days
after the notice, order or determination for which review is sought has been
mailed or served upon the person requesting review.
   (C)   Upon receipt of the petition, the Tax Administrator shall set a date
and time for a meeting with the petitioner and shall give the petitioner at
least five days’ prior written notice of the date, time and place of the

   (D)   At the meeting, the petitioner shall be given an opportunity to show
cause why the notice, order or determination should be modified or withdrawn.
If the meeting does not result in the matter being resolved to the satisfaction
of the petitioner, the petitioner may appeal to the Council.
   (E)   A petitioner seeking to appeal a decision to the Council must file a
written notice of appeal with the Council, in care of the City Administrator/
Clerk-Treasurer, within ten days after the Tax Administrator’s decision
following the meeting has been mailed to the petitioner. The matter will
thereupon be placed on the Council agenda as soon as is practical. At least
five days prior to the hearing before the Council, the Tax Administrator shall
prepare and serve on the petitioner a “Memorandum of Proposed Findings of Fact
and Conclusions of Law.” A copy of the memorandum shall be presented to the
Council at the time of the appeal hearing. The Council shall then review the
proposed findings of fact and conclusions to determine whether they are
correct. Upon a determination by the Council that findings and conclusions are
incorrect, the Council may modify, reverse or affirm the decision of the Tax
Administrator based upon an application of this subchapter and the evidence
presented.

§ 35.16 LATE PAYMENTS; PENALTIES.
   (A)   If any tax imposed by this subchapter is not paid within the time
herein specified for the payment, or any extension thereof, there shall be
added thereto a specific penalty equal to 10% of the amount remaining unpaid.
   (B)   In case of any failure to make and file a return within the time
prescribed by this section, unless it is shown that the failure is not due to
willful neglect, there shall be added to the tax in addition to the 10%
specific penalty provided in division (A) above, 10% if the failure is for not
more than 30 days with an additional 5% for each additional 30 days or fraction
thereof during which the failure continued, not exceeding 25% in the aggregate.
If the penalty as computed does not exceed $10, a minimum penalty of $10 shall
be assessed. The amount so added to any tax shall be collected at the same time
and the same manner and as a part of the tax unless the tax has been paid
before the discovery of the negligence, in which case the amount so added shall
be collected in the same manner as the tax.
   (C)   If any person willfully fails to file any return or make any payment
required by this section, or willfully files a false or fraudulent return or
willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat the tax or payment thereof,
there shall also be imposed as a penalty an amount equal to 50% of any tax
(less any amounts paid on the basis of the false or fraudulent return) found
due for the period to which the return related. The penalty imposed by this
division (C) shall be collected as part of the tax, and shall be in addition to
any other penalties provided by this section.
   (D)   All payments received shall be credited first to penalties, next to
interest, and then to the tax due.

by this section, shall bear interest at the maximum rate per annum as
prescribed by M.S. § 469.190(7), as it may be amended from time to time, from
the time the tax should have been paid until paid. Any interest and penalty
shall be added to the tax and be collected as part thereof.

DISPOSAL OF ABANDONED MOTOR VEHICLES, UNCLAIMED PROPERTY AND EXCESS PROPERTY
§ 36.20 DISPOSAL OF ABANDONED MOTOR VEHICLES.
   (A)   Definitions. For the purpose of this subchapter, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      ABANDONED MOTOR VEHICLE. A motor vehicle as defined in M.S. Chapter 169,
as it may be amended from time to time, that has remained for a period of more
than 48 hours on public property illegally or lacking vital component parts, or
has remained for a period of more than 48 hours on private property without the
consent of the person in control of the property, or in an inoperable condition
such that it has no substantial potential further use consistent with its usual
function unless it is kept in an enclosed garage or storage building. It shall
also mean a motor vehicle voluntarily surrendered by its owner to and accepted
by the city. A classic car or pioneer car, as defined in M.S. Chapter 168, as
it may be amended from time to time, shall not be considered an ABANDONED MOTOR
VEHICLE within the meaning of this section. Vehicles on the premises of junk
yards or automobile graveyards, which are licensed and maintained in accordance
with the city code, shall not be considered ABANDONED MOTOR VEHICLES within the
meaning of this section.
      JUNK VEHICLE. A vehicle that is three years old or older; is extensively
damaged, with the damage including such things as broken or missing wheels,
motor, drive train or transmission, is apparently inoperable; does not have a
valid, current registration plate; and has an approximate fair market value
equal only to the approximate value of the scrap in it.
      UNAUTHORIZED VEHICLE. A vehicle that is subject to removal and
impoundment pursuant to state statutes but is not a junk vehicle or abandoned
vehicle.
      VITAL COMPONENT PARTS.  Those parts of a motor vehicle that are essential
to the mechanical functioning of the vehicle, including but not limited to the
motor, drive train and wheels.
   (B)   Custody. The city may take into custody and impound any abandoned or
junk motor vehicle or any unauthorized vehicle as provided by statute.
   (C)   Sale; waiting periods.
      (1)   An impounded vehicle is eligible for disposal or sale 15 days after
notice to the owner if the vehicle is determined to be a junk vehicle, except
that it may have a valid, current registration plate and still be eligible for
disposal or sale; or an abandoned motor vehicle.
      (2)   An impounded vehicle is eligible for disposal or sale 45 days after
notice to the owner if the vehicle is determined to be an unauthorized vehicle.
   (D)   Notice.
      (1)   When an impounded vehicle is taken into custody, the city or
impound lot operator shall give notice of the taking within five days. The
notice shall set forth the date and place of the taking, the year, make, model
and serial number of the abandoned motor vehicle, if the information can be
reasonably obtained, and the place where the vehicle is being held, shall
inform the owner and any lienholders of their right to reclaim the vehicle
under division (E) of this section, and shall state that failure of the owner
or lienholder to exercise his or her right to reclaim the vehicle and contents
within the appropriate time allowed under statute shall be deemed a waiver by
him or her of all rights, title and interest in the vehicle and a consent to
the transfer of title to and disposal or sale of the vehicle and contents
pursuant to division (F) of this section.
      (2)   The notice shall be sent by mail to the registered owner, if any,
of the impounded motor vehicle and to all readily identifiable lienholders of
record. This information shall be made available to impound lot operators for
notification purposes. If it is impossible to determine with reasonable
certainty the identity and address of the registered owner and all lienholders,
the notice shall be published once in the official newspaper where the motor
vehicle was towed from or abandoned. Published notices may be grouped together
for convenience and economy. If an unauthorized vehicle remains unclaimed after
30 days from the date the notice was sent, a second notice shall be sent by
certified mail, return receipt requested, to the registered owner, if any, of
the unauthorized vehicle and to all readily identifiable lienholders of record.
   (E)   Right to reclaim.
      (1)   The owner or any lienholder of an impounded motor vehicle shall
have the right to reclaim the vehicle from the city or impound lot upon payment
of all towing and storage charges resulting from taking the vehicle into
custody within 15 or 45 days as applicable under this section after the date of
the notice required by this section.
      (2)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair any lien of a
garage keeper under the laws of this state, or the right of the lienholder to
foreclose. For the purposes of this division (E), GARAGE KEEPER is an operator
of a parking place or establishment, an operator of a motor vehicle storage
facility or an operator of an establishment for the servicing, repair or
maintenance of motor vehicles.
   (F)   Auction or sale.
      (1)   An abandoned or unauthorized motor vehicle and contents taken into
custody by the city or any impound lot and not reclaimed under division (E) of
this section may be disposed of or sold at auction or sale when eligible
pursuant to division (E) above. The purchaser shall be given a receipt in a
form prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles which shall be sufficient
title to dispose of the vehicle. The receipt shall also entitle the purchaser
to register the vehicle and receive a certificate of title, free and clear of
all liens and claims of ownership. Before a vehicle is issued a new certificate
of title, it must receive a motor vehicle safety check.
      (2)   From the proceeds of the sale of an abandoned or unauthorized motor
vehicle by the city or public impound lot, the city shall reimburse itself for
the cost of towing, preserving and storing the vehicle, and all administrative,
notice and publication costs incurred pursuant to this section. Any remainder
from the proceeds of a sale shall be held for the owner of the vehicle or
entitled lienholder for 90 days and then shall be deposited in the General Fund
of the city.
      (3)   The operator of a nonpublic impound lot may retain any proceeds
from a sale derived from a sale conducted under the authority of this section.
The operator may retain all proceeds from the sale of any personal belongings
and contents in the vehicle that were not claimed by the owner or the owner’s
agent before the sale; except that any suspected contraband or other items that
likely would be subject to forfeiture in a criminal trial must be turned over
to the appropriate law enforcement agency.
   (G)   Operator’s deficiency claim. The nonpublic impound lot operator has a
deficiency claim against the registered owner of the vehicle for the reasonable
costs of services provided in the towing, storage and inspection of the vehicle
minus the proceeds of the sale or auction. The claim for storage costs may not
exceed the cost of 25 days’ storage for an abandoned or junk vehicle and 55
days’ storage for a vehicle determined to be an unauthorized vehicle.
   (H)   Disposal of vehicles. Where no bid has been received for an abandoned
or junk motor vehicle, the city may dispose of it in accordance with this
section.
   (I)   Contracts and disposal.
      (1)   The city may contract with any qualified person for collection,
storage, incineration, volume reduction, transportation or other services
necessary to prepare abandoned motor vehicles and other scrap metal for
recycling or other methods of disposal.
      (2)   Where the city enters into a contract with a person duly licensed
by the State Pollution Control Agency, the Agency shall review the contract to
determine whether it conforms to the Agency’s plan for solid waste disposal. A
contract that does so conform may be approved by the Agency. Where a contract
has been approved, the Agency may reimburse the city for the costs incurred
under the contract which have not been reimbursed.
      (3)   If the city utilizes its own equipment and personnel for disposal
of the abandoned motor vehicle, it shall be entitled to reimbursement for the
cost thereof along with its other costs as herein provided.
(1989 Code, § 2.50, Subd. 1)
§ 36.21 DISPOSAL OF UNCLAIMED PROPERTY.
   (A)   Definition. The term ABANDONED PROPERTY means tangible or intangible
property that has lawfully come into the possession of the city in the course
of municipal operations, remains unclaimed by the owner, and has been in the
possession of the city for at least 60 days and has been declared one by a
resolution of the Council.
   (B)   Preliminary notice. If the City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer knows
the identity and whereabouts of the owner, he or she shall serve written notice
upon him or her at least 30 days prior to a declaration of abandonment by the
Council. If the city acquired possession from a prior holder, the identity and
whereabouts of whom are known by the City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer, notice
shall also be served upon him or her. The notice shall describe the property
and state that unless it is claimed and proof of ownership, or entitlement to
possession established, the matter of declaring it abandoned property will be
brought to the attention of the Council after the expiration of 30 days from
the date of the notice.
   (C)   Notice and sale. Upon adoption of a resolution declaring certain
property to be abandoned property, the City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer shall
publish a notice thereof describing the same, together with the names (if
known) and addresses (if known) of prior owners and holders thereof, and
including a brief description of the property. The text of the notice shall
also state the time, place and manner of sale of all the property, except cash
and negotiables. The notice shall be published once in a legal newspaper at
least ten days prior to the sale. Sale shall be made to the highest bidder at
public auction or sale or by a nonprofit organization with a significant
mission of community service in a private sale in the manner authorized by
statute.
   (D)   Funds and claims thereon. Expenses shall be paid from the proceeds of
the sale; the balance of the proceeds shall be paid into the General Fund of
the city if the property was disposed of by a public auction or sale, or in the
case of a private sale, to the nonprofit organization authorized to conduct the
sale. The former owner, if he or she makes claim within six months from the
date of publication of the notice herein provided, and upon application and
satisfactory proof of ownership, may be paid the amount of cash or negotiables
or, in the case of property sold, the amount received therefor, less a pro rata

of payment of the bill rendered or resort to the hearing procedure provided
herein, service will be discontinued at the time specified, but in no event
until the charges have been due and unpaid for at least 30 days.

service to a customer for nonpayment of bills, service will be reinstated only
after all bills for service then due have been paid, along with a turn-on
charge, with said charge to be set by resolution of the City Council.

§ 52.01 DEFICIENCY OF WATER AND SHUTTING OFF WATER.
   The city is not liable for any deficiency or failure in the supply of water
to customers, whether occasioned by shutting the water off for the purpose of
making repairs or connections or by any other cause whatever. In case of fire,
or alarm of fire, water may be shut off to ensure a supply for firefighting. In

her service pipe within 24 hours after oral or written notice has been given
the owner or occupant of the premises, the water may be shut off and will not
be turned on until a reconnection charge has been paid and the water service

way shall become the property of the city. When new buildings are erected on
the site of old ones, and it is desired to increase the old water service, a
new permit shall be taken out and the regular tapping charge shall be made as
if this were a new service.
   (B)   It is unlawful for any person to cause or allow any service pipe to be
hammered or squeezed together at the ends to stop the flow of water, or to save
expense in improperly removing the pipe from the main. Also, any improper

   Every service pipe must be laid in a manner as to prevent rupture by
settlement. The service pipe shall be placed not less than seven feet below the
surface, in all cases so arranged as to prevent rupture and stoppage by
freezing. Frozen service pipes between the curb stop and the building shall be
the responsibility of the owner. Service pipes must extend from the curb stops
to the inside of the building; or if not taken into a building, then to the
hydrant or other fixtures which they are intended to supply. A valve, the same
size as the service pipe, shall be placed close to the inside wall of the
building, ahead of the meter and well protected from freezing. Joints on copper
tubing shall be flared or compression-fitted and kept to a minimum. Not more
than one joint shall be used for a service up to 70 feet in length. All joints

supply and when they are found, the city shall notify the owner or occupant to
disconnect the same and, if not immediately done, the city water shall be
turned off. Before any new connections to the city system are permitted, the
city shall ascertain that no cross-connections will exist when the new
connection is made. When a building is connected to city water, the private
water supply may be used only for any purposes as the city may allow.
(1989 Code, § 3.30, Subd. 5) Penalty, see §
50.99
§ 52.06 PROHIBITED USES OR RESTRICTED HOURS.

city, it may entirely prohibit water use or limit the times and hours during
which water may be used from the city water system for lawn and garden
sprinkling, irrigation, car washing, air conditioning and other uses, or either
or any of them. It is a petty misdemeanor for any water consumer to cause or
permit water to be used in violation of the determination after public
announcement thereof has been made through the news media specifically
indicating the restrictions thereof.
(1989 Code, § 3.30, Subd. 6) Penalty, see §
50.99
§ 52.07 PRIVATE FIRE HOSE CONNECTIONS.
   Owners of structures with self-contained fire protection systems may apply
for and obtain permission to connect the street mains with hydrants, large
pipes and hose couplings, for use in case of fire only, at their own
installation expense and at rates as the Council may adopt by resolution as
herein provided.

§ 52.08 OPENING HYDRANTS.
   It is unlawful for any person, other than members of the Fire Department or
other person duly authorized by the city, in pursuance of lawful purpose, to
open any fire hydrant or attempt to draw water from the same or in any manner
interfere therewith. It is also unlawful for any person so authorized to
deliver or suffer to be delivered to any other person any hydrant key or
wrench, except for the purposes strictly pertaining to their lawful use.
(1989 Code, § 3.30, Subd. 8) Penalty, see §
50.99
§ 52.09 CODE REQUIREMENT.
   All piping, connections and appurtenances shall be installed and performed
strictly in accordance with the State Plumbing Code. Failure to install or
maintain the same in accordance therewith, or failure to have or permit
required inspections shall, upon discovery by the city, be an additional ground
for termination of water service to any consumer.
(1989 Code, § 3.30, Subd. 9)
§ 52.10 SECONDARY CONNECTIONS PROHIBITED.
   As used in this chapter, a SECONDARY CONNECTION means a connection with the
water service line to another building rather than directly to the water main.
Secondary connections are hereby prohibited. Existing secondary connections
shall be abandoned within 90 days after receipt of written notice to both
property owners. If this remedial action is not taken, water service to both
properties shall be shut off and discontinued.

standards for pretreatment provided in Chapter 1, EPA Rules and Regulations,
Subchapter D, Water Programs Part 128 Pretreatment Standards, Federal Register,
Volume 38, No. 215, Thursday, November 8, 1973 and any amendments thereto and
which, in the judgment of the city or its representative, may have a
deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment or receiving
waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public
nuisance, the city may: reject the wastes; require pretreatment to an
acceptable condition for discharge to public sewers; require control over the
quantities and rates of discharge; and/or require payment to cover the added
costs of handling and treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes or
sewer charges under the provisions of this chapter. If the city, or its
representative, permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the
design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the
review and approval of the city, or its representative, and subject to the
requirements of all applicable codes, city code provisions and laws.
   (G)   Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the city, or its representative, they are necessary for the proper
handling of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any
flammable wastes, sand or other harmful ingredients; except that the
interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling
units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the city,
or its representative, and shall be located as to be readily and easily
accessible for cleaning and inspection.
   (H)   Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are
provided, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective
operation by the owner at his or her expense.
   (I)   Each industry shall be required to install a control manhole and, when
required by the city, or its representative, the owner of any property serviced
by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control
manhole together with the necessary meters and other appurtenances in the
building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the
wastes. The manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located and
shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the city, or its
representative. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his or her
expense and shall be maintained by him or her so as to be safe and accessible
at all times.
   (J)   (1)   The owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying
industrial wastes shall provide laboratory measurements, tests and analyses of
waters and wastes to illustrate compliance with this chapter and any special
conditions for discharge established by the city, its representative or
regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over the discharge.
      (2)   The number, type and frequency of laboratory analyses to be
performed by the owner shall be as stipulated by the city, or its
representative, but no less than once per year the industry must supply a
complete analysis of the constituents of the wastewater discharge to assure
that compliance with the federal, state and local standards are being met. The
owner shall report the results of measurements and laboratory analyses to the
city. The owner shall bear the expense of all measurements, analyses and
reporting required by the city. At times as deemed necessary, the city, or its
representative, reserves the right to take measurements and samples for
analysis by an outside laboratory service. The expense of an outside laboratory
shall be borne by the industry or owner.
   (K)   All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at the control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, BOD and SS analyses are obtained from 24-hour
composites of all outfalls, whereas pHs are determined from periodic grab
samples.)
   (L)   No statement contained in this chapter shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the city for treatment, subject to payment therefor, in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter, by the industrial concern,
provided the payments are in accordance with federal and state guidelines for
user charge system and industrial cost recovery system.
   (M)   Each residential household, commercial complex, commercial business or
industry shall pay to the city the established amount set forth by EPA user
charge system or industrial cost recovery for the proper operation of the
sewage treatment plant. Any building which is privately owned, whether occupied
or not, shall be subject to this payment. Any established multi-dwelling shall
make payment in the amount established by the user charge system. The payment
shall be made unless the water service is discontinued and the service valve
closed.

WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGES
§ 53.20 USER CHARGES.
   (A)   Basis for wastewater service charges. The wastewater service charge
for the use of and for service supplied by the wastewater facilities of the
city shall consist of a basic user charge for operation and maintenance plus
replacement, a debt service charge, depreciation and a surcharge, if
applicable.
   (B)   Debt service charge. The debt service charge shall be computed by
dividing the annual debt service of all outstanding loans by the number of
users. Through further divisions, the cost per 1,000 gallons can be computed
and billed accordingly, when applicable.
   (C)   Basic user charge. The basic user charge shall be based on water usage
as recorded by water meters and/or sewage meters for wastes having the
following normal concentrations:
      (1)   A five-day, 20ºC biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of 200 mg/l;
      (2)   A suspended solids (SS) content of 250 mg/l; and
      (3)   It shall consist of operation and maintenance costs plus
replacement and shall be computed as follows:
         (a)   Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and
maintain the wastewater facilities including a replacement fund for the year,
for all works categories;
         (b)   Proportion the estimated costs to wastewater facility categories
by volume, suspended solids and BOD, if possible;
         (c)   Estimate wastewater volume, pound of SS and pounds of BOD to be
treated;
         (d)   Proportion the estimated costs to non-industrial and industrial
users by volume, SS and BOD;
         (e)   Compute costs per 1,000 gallons for normal sewage strength; and
         (f)   Compute surcharge costs per 1,000 gallons per mg/l in excess of
normal sewage strength for BOD and SS.
   (D)   A surcharge will be levied on all users whose waters exceed the
maximum concentrations for BOD (200 mg/l) and SS (250 mg/l). The surcharge will
be based on water usage as recorded by water meters and/or sewage meters for
all wastes which exceed the 200 mg/l and 250 mg/l concentration for BOD and SS,
respectively. Section
53.24(B) specifies the procedure to compute a surcharge.
   (E)   The adequacy of the wastewater service charge shall be reviewed
annually by the City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer in the annual audit report.
The wastewater service charge shall be revised periodically to reflect a change
in debt service or a change in operation and maintenance costs, including
replacement costs.

shall be the metered water consumption read to the lowest even increments of
1,000 gallons.
   (A)   The quantity of water used as measured by the city water meter on the
premises; provided, however, that in determining the charge to be paid for
premises used exclusively for residential purposes, the water meter reading
from the average of the first two months of the year may be used as the basis
for the computation of the user charges for billing periods for that year.
   (B)   If the person discharging wastes into the public sewers procures any
part, or all, of his or her water from sources other than the city water
utility, all or a part of which is discharged into the public sewers, the

§ 90.01 SHADE TREE DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION.
   (A)   Policy and purpose. The city has determined that the health of oak and
elm trees is threatened by fatal diseases known as oak wilt and Dutch elm
disease. It has further determined that the loss of oak and elm trees located
on public and private property would substantially depreciate the value of
property and impair the safety, good order, general welfare and convenience of
the public. It is declared to be the intention of the Council to control and
prevent the spread of these diseases, and provide for the removal of dead or
diseased trees, as nuisances.
   (B)   Definitions.    For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a

tree, so infected, unless the parts have been fully burned or treated under the
direction of the Tree Inspector.
      SHADE TREE DISEASE. Dutch elm disease or oak wilt disease.
      TREE INSPECTOR. The Public Works Director, or any other employee of the
city as the Council may designate and who shall thereafter qualify.
   (C)   Scope and adoption by reference. M.S. §§ 89.001 et seq., as it may be
amended from time to time, is hereby adopted by reference, together with the
rules and regulations of the State Commissioner of Agriculture relating to
shade tree diseases; provided, that this section shall supersede those
statutes, rules and regulations only to the extent of inconsistencies.
   (D)   Stockpiling of elm wood. The stockpiling of bark-bearing elmwood shall
be permitted during the period from September 15 through April 1 of the
following year if a permit has been issued therefor. Any wood not utilized by
April 1 must then be removed and disposed of as provided by this section and
the regulations incorporated thereby. Prior to April 1 of each year, the Tree
Inspector shall inspect all public and private properties for elmwood logs or
stumps that could serve as bark beetle breeding sites, and require by April 1,
removal or debarking of all wood, logs or stumps to be retained.

not more than eight inches or which have gone to or about to go to seed; to
remove all public health or safety hazards therefrom; to install or repair
water service lines thereon; and to treat or remove insect-infested or diseased
trees thereon.
   (B)   If any owner or occupant fails to assume the primary responsibility
described in division (A) of this section, and after notice given by the City
Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer has not within two days of the notice complied,
the city may cause the work to be done and the expenses thus incurred shall be
a lien upon the real estate. The City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer shall
certify to the County Auditor of this county a statement of the amount of the
cost incurred by the city. This amount together with interest shall be entered
as a special assessment against the lot or parcel of land and be collected in
the same manner as real estate taxes.

under a proposed fall line of the trees or branches to be trimmed and that
adequate consideration for protection of neighboring property is also provided.
Third parties are required to provide proof of liability insurance.
   (D)   Tree planting, maintenance, and removal.
      (1)   Permits required.
         (a)   It is unlawful for any person to plant or remove any tree on
public property (boulevard tree), without first obtaining a permit from the
city.
         (b)   In the case of a requested boulevard planting, a permit
application shall be submitted and the city will provide a list of approved and
suggested trees and guidelines for planting and pruning.
         (c)   Permits shall not be required for tree removal from private
property, but due consideration for streets, pedestrians, neighbors and proof
of third party liability insurance must be made.
         (d)   There is no fee for the permits.
         (e)   Permits shall not be required for work performed by city
employees.
      (2)   Planting; boulevard tree specifications.
         (a)   Tree species. A list of desirable trees for planting and a list
of trees not suitable for planting in boulevards will be available at City
Hall.
         (b)   Utilities. No public trees may be planted under or within ten
lateral feet of any overhead transmission or primary utility wire, over or
within five lateral feet of any underground water line, sewer line, sub-drain,
transmission line, or other utility. No trees shall be planted within utility
easements. A locate call must be made prior to planting to determine location
of utility lines (Gopher State One Call: 800-252-1166).
         (c)   Distance from intersection. Tree's minimum distance from an
intersection is defined by "Clear Vision Areas" (Section 8.09, Zoning
Ordinance): "A clear vision area shall be maintained on the corners of all
property at the intersection of two streets, or a street and a railroad. A
clear vision area shall be a triangular shaped area with two sides following
lot lines; the clear vision areas shall extend along the edge of the road
surface or curb for a distance of not less than 25 feet. The clear vision area
shall contain no planting, fence, wall, structure or temporary or permanent
obstruction exceeding 36 inches in height, except for trees with branches and
foliage removed to a height of eight feet above the ground, and open wire
fencing that does not obscure sight."
         (d)   Distance from driveways. Trees must be at least five feet from
any driveway or approach sidewalk within a boulevard area.
         (e)   Distance from curb, sidewalk, and streets edges without curbing.
When no sidewalk exists the trees must be a minimum of eight feet behind the
curb. When a sidewalk exists with an eight foot boulevard, the trees may be
centered between the sidewalk and the curb. If the boulevard is smaller than
eight feet, the trees should be planted at least four feet to the house side of
the sidewalk. On streets lacking curbing and a paved parking area, plant trees
a minimum distance of 12 feet from the edge of the road. Unique situations or
specific requirement questions should be referred to the Tree Board.
         (f)   Distance from fire hydrants. No public tree shall be planted
closer than ten feet to any fire hydrant.
      (3)   Maintenance.
         (a)   The city shall have the right to plant, prune, maintain, and
remove public trees as may be necessary to ensure the public safety or to
preserve or enhance the symmetry and beauty of such public property. The city
may remove or cause or order to be removed, any tree or part thereof which is
in an unsafe condition which by reason of its nature is injurious to sewers,
electric power lines, gas lines, water lines or other public improvements, or
is affected with any injurious fungus, insect or other pest, including but not
limited to Dutch elm disease, oak wilt disease or Emerald Ash Borer.
         (b)   If the city chooses to plant boulevard trees on a property's
boulevard, the property owners shall be notified in writing and have the right
to stop the planting.
            1.   Prevention of visual obstructions. Every public or private
tree overhanging any street or right-of-way within the city shall be trimmed so
that the branches shall not obstruct the light from any street lamp or obstruct
the view of any street intersection or street sign and so that there shall be a
clear space of at least 12 feet above the street or eight feet above the
sidewalk.
            2.   Topping. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or city
department to top any street tree, park tree, or other tree on public property.
Trees severely damaged by storms or other causes, or certain trees under
utility wires or other obstructions where other pruning practices are
impractical may be exempted from this section at the determination of the City
Inspector.
            3.   Control of private hazard trees. The city maintains the right
to take action on private trees that meet the definition of hazard trees to
protect the public. Every effort will be made to cooperate with the citizen
before action is taken. Required process for orders relating to private hazard
trees is as follows:
               a.   Except in situations of imminent danger to human life and
safety, the tree inspector or city representative will not enter private
property for the purpose of inspecting for hazard trees without the permission
of the owner, resident, or other person in control of the property, unless the
inspector has obtained a warrant or order from a court of competent
jurisdiction authorizing the entry.
               b.   All orders to remove, treat or trim trees, eradicate or
otherwise control the hazardous condition given pursuant to this section shall
be in writing and authorized by the city or its designated representative.
Orders shall be served in person or by mail upon the owner of the property
where such trees are located. Such orders shall afford the owner of the
property not less than 30 days or a reasonable amount of time determined by the
city from the date of the mailing of such notice to comply with such order.
               c.   If the required action is not taken by the property owner
within the specified time, the city may cause the tree concerned to be trimmed,
removed, or treated for the hazardous condition to be eradicated or otherwise
controlled. The costs of such actions shall be apportioned as provided in
division (F)(2).
               d.   Disposal of wood from hazard trees must follow accepted
Department of Natural Resource standards to ensure diseased wood does not
infect healthy trees. Wood from elms infected with Dutch elm disease, oaks
infected with oak wilt or ash infected with Emerald Ash Borer must follow DNR
approved quarantine procedures. Apportionment of costs relating to hazard
trees:
                  i.   Public trees. In the event that the city determines that
a tree located on a boulevard or on public land as defined in division (B)
herein is a hazard, the city will be responsible for the tree treatment,
trimming, or removal.
                  ii.   Private tree. In the event the city determines that a
private tree is a hazard to city owned utilities, the homeowner will assume
responsibility for the cost of removal, treatment, trimming or otherwise
eradicating or controlling the hazardous condition. In cases wherein the tree
is determined to be infected with a shade tree pest or disease, including but
not limited to Dutch elm disease, oak wilt disease, and Emerald Ash Borer, and
where the city has determined that a private tree is a hazard, the owner will
be responsible for removal, treatment, trimming or otherwise eradicating or
controlling the hazardous private tree. In situations where a private tree is
dead, dying and decayed and deemed as being an imminent danger to public
health, safety, and well-being, the owner will be responsible for appropriate
trimming or removal of their tree.
                  iii.   Special assessments. If a private hazard tree is not
removed or treated as ordered or if the owner does not voluntarily pay to the
city the cost of removal or treatment by the city, all costs incurred by the
city for trimming, tree removal, treatment, eradicating or controlling the
hazardous condition may be recovered by the city by assessing the property.
      (4)   Removal. Permits shall not be required for trees removed from
private property, but due consideration for streets, pedestrians, neighbors and
proof of third party liability insurance must be made. Permits are required, at
no cost, to remove any boulevard tree.
   (E)   Tree protection.
      (1)   No person may plant, remove, alter, destroy, cut or disturb any
public tree within the city without permission from the city.
      (2)   Abuse or mutilation of public trees. No person shall damage,
transplant, top, remove or mutilate any public tree. Damage may include, but is
not limited to the following: posting signs with nails, staples, screws or
other devices, hanging wires of any kind, vehicle damage, weed whip, lawn mower
damage, stripping bark off the tree, and poison or toxin applications.
      (3)   Protection of public trees near construction activities. Any public
tree in the immediate vicinity of any excavation, demolition or construction
site of any building, structure, street or utilities work which has potential
for injury, shall be protected from injury by the person responsible for
carrying out the construction activities.
   (F)   Penalties, claims.
      (1)   Violations. Every person violates a section, division, paragraph or
provision of this section when he or she performs an act thereby prohibited or
declared unlawful, fails to act when the failure is thereby prohibited or
declared unlawful, performs an act prohibited or declared unlawful or fails to
act when the failure is prohibited or declared unlawful by a code adopted by
reference by this section, and upon conviction thereof, shall be punished as
for a misdemeanor except as otherwise stated in specific provisions hereof.
      (2)   Assessment of claim. In the event that a hazardous condition is not
removed by the date specified in the notice, the city is authorized to cause
the removal of such hazardous condition. The reasonable cost of such removal
shall be filed as an assessment against the property on which the hazardous
tree was located.
      (3)   Appeals. Any person aggrieved by any ruling or order of the city
may appeal to the City Council, which shall hear the matter and make a final
decision. The City Council shall have the right to review decisions and may
modify, affirm, or reverse any determination of the Tree Board.

provisions relating to nuisances. Any peace officer or designated person shall
have the power to inspect private premises and take all reasonable precautions
to prevent the commission and maintenance of public nuisances. Except in
emergency situations of imminent danger to human life and safety, no police
officer or designated person shall enter private property for the purpose of

designee, or any other person designated by City Council motion, may give
written notice to the owner or occupant of the property requiring that the
nuisance be abated within 48 hours. Notice shall be personally served upon the
owner or occupant of the property. If the nuisance is not abated within the 48-
hour time period, unless good cause is shown by the owner or occupant for an
additional period of time, the city or its designee may enter onto the property
and abate the nuisance by causing the weeds and grasses to be cut and removed
at the expense of the owner, and may remove any garbage, refuse or other
materials accumulated on the property at the expense of the owner, and if not
paid, the cost for the work shall be certified to the real estate as a special
assessment, in accordance with this code of ordinances.

abated by the city or a person who has caused a public nuisance on a property
not owned by that person shall be personally liable for the cost to the city of
the abatement, including administrative costs. As soon as the work has been
completed and the cost determined, the City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer or
other official shall prepare a bill for the cost and mail it to the owner.
Thereupon the amount shall be immediately due and payable at the office of the
City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer.
   (B)   Assessment. After notice and hearing as provided in M.S. § 429.061, as
it may be amended from time to time, if the nuisance is a public health or
safety hazard on private property, the accumulation of snow and ice on public
sidewalks, the growth of weeds on private property or outside the traveled
portion of streets, or unsound or insect-infected trees, the City
Administrator/Clerk- Treasurer shall, on or before September 1 next following
abatement of the nuisance, list the total unpaid charges along with all other
charges as well as other charges for current services to be assessed under M.S.
§ 429.101, as it may be amended from time to time, against each separate lot or
parcel to which the charges are attributable. The City Council may then spread
the charges against the property under that statute and other pertinent
statutes for certification to the County Auditor and collection along with
current taxes the following year or in annual installments, not exceeding ten,
as the City Council may determine in each case.

RIGHT-OF-WAYS
§ 91.065 FINDINGS, PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   To provide for the health, safety and welfare of its citizens, and to
ensure the integrity of its streets and the appropriate use of the rights-of-
way, the city strives to keep its rights-of-way in a state of good repair and
free from unnecessary encumbrances.
   (B)   Accordingly, the city hereby enacts this new subchapter of this code
relating to right-of-way permits and administration. This subchapter imposes
reasonable regulation on the placement and maintenance of facilities and
equipment currently within its rights-of-way or to be placed therein at some
future time. It is intended to complement the regulatory roles of state and
federal agencies. Under this subchapter, persons excavating and obstructing the
rights-of-way will bear financial responsibility for their work. Finally, this
subchapter provides for recovery of out-of-pocket and projected costs from
persons using the public rights-of-way.
   (C)   This subchapter shall be interpreted consistently with M.S. §§ 237.16,
237.162, 237.163, 237.79, 237.81 and 238.086 (the “Act”), as it may be amended
from time to time, and the other laws governing applicable rights of the city
and users of the right-of-way. This subchapter shall also be interpreted
consistent with Minn. Rules 7819.0050 - 7819.9950, as they may be amended from
time to time, where possible. To the extent any provision of this subchapter
cannot be interpreted consistently with the Minnesota Rules, that
interpretation most consistent with the Act and other applicable statutory and
case law is intended. This subchapter shall not be interpreted to limit the
regulatory and police powers of the city to adopt and enforce general
ordinances necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public.

   (B)   Site inspection. Permittee shall make the work-site available to the
city and to all others as authorized by law for inspection at all reasonable
times during the execution of and upon completion of the work.
   (C)   Authority of Director.
      (1)   At the time of inspection, the Director may order the immediate
cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the life, health, safety
or well-being of the public.
      (2)   The Director may issue an order to the permittee for any work that
does not conform to the terms of the permit or other applicable standards,
conditions, or codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the
violation will be cause for revocation of the permit. Within ten days after
issuance of the order, the permittee shall present proof to the director that
the violation has been corrected. If such proof has not been presented within
the required time, the director may revoke the permit pursuant to §
91.086.
§ 91.084 WORK DONE WITHOUT A PERMIT.
   (A)   Emergency situations.
      (1)   Each registrant shall immediately notify the Director of any event
regarding its facilities that it considers to be an emergency. The registrant
may proceed to take whatever actions are necessary to respond to the emergency.
Excavators’ notification to Gopher State One Call regarding an emergency
situation does not fulfill this requirement. Within two business days after the
occurrence of the emergency, the registrant shall apply for the necessary
permits, pay the fees associated therewith, and fulfill the rest of the
requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with this subchapter for
the actions it took in response to the emergency.
      (2)   If the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding a registrant's
facilities, the city will attempt to contact the local representative of each
registrant affected, or potentially affected, by the emergency. In any event,
the city may take whatever action it deems necessary to respond to the
emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the registrant whose facilities
occasioned the emergency.
   (B)   Non-emergency situations. Except in an emergency, any person who,
without first having obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or excavates a
right-of-way must subsequently obtain a permit and, as a penalty, pay double
the normal fee for said permit, pay double all the other fees required by the
city code, deposit with the city the fees necessary to correct any damage to
the right-of-way, and comply with all of the requirements of this subchapter.
§ 91.085 SUPPLEMENTARY NOTIFICATION.
   If the obstruction or excavation of the right-of-way begins later or ends
sooner than the date given on the permit, permittee shall notify the city of
the accurate information as soon as this information is known.
§ 91.086 REVOCATION OF PERMITS.
   (A)   Substantial breach. The city reserves its right, as provided herein,
to revoke any right-of-way permit without a fee refund, if there is a
substantial breach of the terms and conditions of any statute, ordinance, rule
or regulation, or any material condition of the permit. A substantial breach by
permittee shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following:
      (1)   The violation of any material provision of the right-of-way permit;
      (2)   An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the right-
of-way permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit
upon the city or its citizens;
      (3)   Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a
right-of-way permit;
      (4)   The failure to complete the work in a timely manner, unless a
permit extension is obtained or unless the failure to complete work is due to
reasons beyond the permittee's control; or
      (5)   The failure to correct, in a timely manner, work that does not
conform to a condition indicated on an order issued pursuant to §
91.084.
   (B)   Written notice of breach. If the city determines that the permittee
has committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any statute,
ordinance, rule, regulation or any condition of the permit, the city shall make
a written demand upon the permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall
state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. A
substantial breach, as stated above, will allow the city, at its discretion, to
place additional or revised conditions on the permit to mitigate and remedy the
breach.
   (C)   Response to notice of breach. Within 24 hours of receiving
notification of the breach, the permittee shall provide the city with a plan,
acceptable to the city, that will cure the breach. The permittee’s failure to
so contact the city, or the permittee's failure to timely submit an acceptable
plan, or the permittee’s failure to reasonably implement the approved plan,
shall be cause for immediate revocation of the permit. Further, the permittee’s
failure to so contact the city, or the permittee’s failure to submit an
acceptable plan, or the permittee's failure to reasonably implement the
approved plan, shall automatically place the permittee on probation for one
full year.
   (D)   Cause for probation. From time to time, the city may establish a list
of conditions of the permit, which if breached will automatically place the
permittee on probation for one full year, such as, but not limited to, working
out of the allotted time period or working on right-of-way grossly outside of
the permit authorization.
   (E)   Automatic revocation. If a permittee, while on probation, commits a
breach as outlined above, permittee's permit will automatically be revoked and
permittee will not be allowed further permits for one full year, except for
emergency repairs.
   (F)   Reimbursement of city costs. If a permit is revoked, the permittee
shall also reimburse the city for the city’s reasonable costs, including
restoration costs and the costs of collection and reasonable attorneys’ fees
incurred in connection with such revocation.
§ 91.087 MAPPING DATA.
   (A)   Information required. Each registrant and the permittee shall provide
mapping information required by the city in accordance with Minn. Rules
7819.4000 and 7819.4100, as they may be amended from time to time. Within 90
days following completion of any work pursuant to a permit, the permittee shall
provide the Director accurate maps and drawings certifying the “as-built”
location of all equipment installed, owed and maintained by the permittee. The
maps and drawings shall include the horizontal and vertical location of all
facilities and equipment and shall be provided consistent with the city’s
electronic mapping system, when practical or as a condition imposed by the
Director. Failure to provide maps and drawings pursuant to this subsection
shall be grounds for revoking the permit holder’s registration.
   (B)   Service laterals. All permits issued for the installation or repair of
service laterals, other than minor repairs as defined in Minn. Rules 7560.0150,
Subpart 2, shall require the permittee’s use of appropriate means of
establishing the horizontal locations of installed service laterals, and the
service lateral vertical locations in those cases where the director reasonably
requires it. Permittees or their subcontractors shall submit to the director
evidence satisfactory to the director of the installed service lateral
locations. Compliance with this division and with applicable Gopher State One
Call law and Minnesota Rules governing service laterals install after December
31, 2005, shall be a condition of any city approval necessary for payments to
contractors working on a public improvement project including those under M.S.
Chapter 429, as it may be amended from time to time, and city approval of
performance under development agreements, or other subdivision or site plan
approval under M.S. Chapter 462, as it may be amended from time to time. The
Director shall reasonably determine the appropriate method of providing such
information to the city. Failure to provide prompt and accurate information on
the service laterals installed may result in the revocation of the permit
issued for the work or for future permits to the offending permittee or its
subcontractors.
§ 91.088 LOCATION AND RELOCATION OF FACILITIES.
   (A)   Placement, location and relocation. Placement, location and relocation
of facilities must comply with the Act, with other applicable law, and with
Minn. Rules 7819.3100, 7819.5000 and 7819.5100, as they may be amended from
time to time, to the extent the rules do not limit authority otherwise
available to cities.
   (B)   Corridors.
      (1)   The city may assign a specific area within the right-of-way, or any
particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of facilities
that is or, pursuant to current technology, the city expects will someday be
located within the right-of-way. All excavation, obstruction, or other permits
issued by the city involving the installation or replacement of facilities
shall designate the proper corridor for the facilities at issue.
      (2)   Any registrant who has facilities in the right-of-way in a position
at variance with the corridors established by the city shall, no later than at
the time of the next reconstruction or excavation of the area where the
facilities are located, move the facilities to the assigned position within the
right-of-way, unless this requirement is waived by the city for good cause
shown, upon consideration of such factors as the remaining economic life of the
facilities, public safety, customer service needs and hardship to the
registrant.
   (C)   Nuisance. One year after the passage of this subchapter, any
facilities found in a right-of-way that have not been registered shall be
deemed to be a nuisance. The city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at
law or in equity, including, but not limited to, abating the nuisance or
talcing possession of the facilities and restoring the right-of-way to a
useable condition.
   (D)   Limitation of space. To protect health, safety, and welfare, or when
necessary to protect the right-of-way and its current use, the city shall have
the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional facilities
within the right-of-way. In making such decisions, the city shall strive to the
extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the right-
of-way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the public interest,
the public's needs for the particular utility service, the condition of the
right-of-way, the time of year with respect to essential utilities, the
protection of existing facilities in the right-of-way, and future city plans
for public improvements and development projects which have been determined to
be in the public interest.
§ 91.089 PRE-EXCAVATION FACILITIES LOCATION.
   In addition to complying with the requirements of M.S. §§ 216D.01 through
216D.09, as they may be amended from time to time (“One Call Excavation Notice
System”) before the start date of any right-of-way excavation, each registrant
who has facilities or equipment in the area to be excavated shall mark the
horizontal and vertical placement of all said facilities. Any registrant whose
facilities are less than 20 inches below a concrete or asphalt surface shall
notify and work closely with the excavation contractor to establish the exact
location of its facilities and the best procedure for excavation.
§ 91.090 DAMAGE TO OTHER FACILITIES.
   When the city does work in the right-of-way and finds it necessary to
maintain, support or move a registrant’s facilities to protect it, the city
shall notify the local representative as early as is reasonably possible. The
costs associated therewith will be billed to that registrant and must be paid
within 30 days from the date of billing. Each registrant shall be responsible
for the cost of repairing any facilities in the right-of-way which it or its
facilities damage. Each registrant shall be responsible for the cost of
repairing any damage to the facilities of another registrant caused during the
city’s response to an emergency occasioned by that registrant’s facilities.
§ 91.091 RIGHT-OF-WAY VACATION.
   If the city vacates a right-of-way that contains the facilities of a
registrant, the registrant’s rights in the vacated right-of-way are governed by
Minn. Rules 7819.3200, as it may be amended from time to time.
§ 91.092 INDEMNIFICATION AND LIABILITY.
   By registering with the city, or by accepting a permit under this
subchapter, a registrant or permittee agrees to defend and indemnify the city
in accordance with the provisions of Minn. Rules 7819.1250, as it may be
amended from time to time.
§ 91.093 ABANDONED AND UNUSABLE FACILITIES.
   (A)   Discontinued operations. A registrant who has determined to
discontinue all or a portion of its operations in the city must provide
information satisfactory to the city that the registrant’s obligations for its
facilities in the right-of-way under this subchapter have been lawfully assumed
by another registrant.
   (B)   Removal. Any registrant who has abandoned facilities in any right-of-
way shall remove it from that right-of-way if required in conjunction with
other right-of-way repair, excavation, or construction, unless this requirement
is waived by the city.
§ 91.094 APPEAL.
   A right-of-way user that has been denied registration; has been denied a
permit; has had a permit revoked; believes that the fees imposed are not in
conformity with M.S. § 237.163, Subdivision 6, as it may be amended from time
to time; or disputes a determination of the director regarding §
91.087(B) may have the denial, revocation, fee imposition, or decision
reviewed, upon written request, by the City Council. The City Council shall act
on a timely written request at its next regularly scheduled meeting, provided
the right-of-way user has submitted its appeal with sufficient time to include
the appeal as a regular agenda item. A decision by the city council affirming
the denial, revocation, or fee imposition will be in writing and supported by
written findings establishing the reasonableness of the decision.
§ 91.999 PENALTY.
   Every person violates a section, division, paragraph or provision of this
chapter when he or she performs an act thereby prohibited or declared unlawful,
or fails to act when the failure is thereby prohibited or declared unlawful,
and upon conviction thereof, shall be punished as follows:
   (A)   Where the specific section, division, paragraph or provision
specifically makes violation a misdemeanor, he or she shall be punished as for
a misdemeanor; where a violation is committed in a manner or under
circumstances so as to endanger or be likely to endanger any person or
property, he or she shall be punished as for a misdemeanor; where he or she
stands convicted of violation of any provision of this chapter, exclusive of
violations relating to the standing or parking of an unattended vehicle, within
the immediate preceding 12-month period for the third or subsequent time, he or
she shall be punished as for a misdemeanor; and
   (B)   As to any violation not constituting a misdemeanor under the

his or her choice. If the animal is quarantined on the premises of the owner,
the city shall have access to the animal at any reasonable time for study and
observation of rabies symptoms, in accordance with §
10.20. In the case of a stray animal or in the case of an animal whose

92.99
§ 92.20 PROHIBITION OF DEER FEEDING.
   (A)   Findings.
      (1)   Recreational feeding of deer often causes deer concentrations which
develop into depredation and other public safety problems.
      (2)   Depredation of garden crops and landscaping plants is increasing as
deer habitat decreases and deer populations increase within particular areas
and neighborhoods in the city.
      (3)   High deer populations can result in increased car-deer crashes
within the community, causing public safety concerns and negative economic
impacts such as increased car insurance premium costs.
      (4)   High deer densities also contribute to the possible spread of
chronic diseases among deer populations and chronic wasting disease.
   (B)   Purpose and intent. The intent of the City Council is not to
unreasonably infringe upon the recreational enjoyment of city residents who
observe wildlife and enhance wildlife habitat on their property. The purpose of
this feeding ban is to eliminate these deer attractions which, when combined
with other management strategies, should reduce over time the depredation

permit to be placed on the ground, or within five feet of the ground surface,
either on property owned or controlled by such person or on property owned by
others, any grain, fodder, fruit, vegetables, nuts, hay, or other edible
materials, which may reasonably be expected to intentionally result in deer
feeding, unless such items are screened or protected in a manner that prevents
deer from feeding on them. Also prohibited are salt licks and powder or liquid
deer attractants, unless legally used for deer management control purposes.
Living fruit trees and other live vegetation shall not be considered as deer
feeding. The provisions of this division (C) shall apply to the city limits.

Police Department Officer, other law enforcement service, or agent of the city,
with prior approval of the City Council, is empowered to enter upon any
premises to investigate or inspect the premises for prohibited deer feeding
activities to eliminate the public nuisance. This section may be enforced by

survey property only after reasonable notice to and consent from the owner and
any person occupying the property. Such entry shall be made in a manner as to

occupied by the owner of the dog;
            2.   Provoking, tormenting, abusing, or assaulting the dog, or who

that may be requested, the owner must comply with the requirements of M.S. §
347.52(a) and (c) regarding proper enclosures and notification to the city upon
transfer or death of the dog, until and unless a hearing officer or court of
law reverses the declaration.
      (1)   Process for dangerous dogs. The city will issue a license to the
owner of a dangerous dog if the owner presents sufficient evidence that:
         (a)   There is a proper enclosure;
         (b)   Written proof that there is a surety bond by a surety company
authorized to conduct business in the state in the sum of at least $300,000,
payable to any person injured by a dangerous dog, or receipt of a copy of a
policy of liability insurance issued by an insurance company authorized to do
business in the state in the amount of at least $300,000, insuring the owner

insurance company at least ten days prior to such cancellation;
         (c)   The owner has paid the annual license fee for dangerous dogs;
         (d)   The owner has had a microchip identification implanted in the
dangerous dog. The name of the microchip manufacturer and identification number
of the microchip must be provided to the city. If the microchip is not
implanted by the owner, it may be implanted by the city at the owner's expense;
and
         (e)   The owner provides proof that the dog has been sterilized. If
the owner does not sterilize the dog within 30 days, the city may seize the dog
and sterilize it at the owner's expense.

         (c)   The owner has had a microchip identification implanted in the
potentially dangerous dog. The name of the microchip manufacturer and
identification number of the microchip must be provided to the city. If the
microchip is not implanted by the owner, it may be implanted by the city at the
owner's expense.
      (3)   Inspection. A pre-license inspection of the premises to insure
compliance with the city code is required. If the city issues a license to the
owner of a dangerous or potentially dangerous dog, the city shall be allowed at
any reasonable time to inspect the dog, the proper enclosure, and all places
where the animal is kept.
      (4)   Warning symbol. The owner of a dangerous dog licensed under this
section must post a sign with the uniform dangerous dog warning symbol on the
property in order to inform children that there is a dangerous dog on the
property. The sign will be provided by the city upon issuance of the license.
      (5)   Tags. A dangerous dog licensed under this section must wear a
standardized, easily identifiable tag at all times that contains the uniform

      (6)   License fee. The city will charge the owner an annual license fee
for a dangerous or potentially dangerous dog.
   (E)   Properly restrained in proper enclosure or outside of proper
enclosure. While on the owner's property, an owner of a dangerous or
potentially dangerous dog must keep it in a proper enclosure. Inside a
residential home, there must be a secured area maintained where the dog will
stay when persons other than family members are present. If the dog is outside
the proper enclosure, the dog must be muzzled and restrained by a substantial
chain or leash no longer than four feet and under the physical restraint of an
adult. The muzzle must be made in a manner that will prevent the dog from
biting any person or animal but that will not cause injury to the dog or
interfere with its vision or respiration.
   (F)   Notification requirements to city.
      (1)   Relocation or death. The owner of a dog that has been declared
dangerous or potentially dangerous must notify the City Administrator/Clerk-
Treasurer in writing if the dog is to be relocated from its current address or
if the dog has died. The notification must be given in writing within 30 days
of the relocation or death. The notification must include the current owner's
name and address, and the new owner's name and the relocation address. If the
relocation address is outside of the city, the city may notify the local law
enforcement agency of the transfer of the dog into its jurisdiction.
      (2)   Renter's obligations. A person who owns or possess a dangerous or
potentially dangerous dog and who will rent property from another where the dog
will reside must disclose to the property owner prior to entering the lease
agreement and at the time of any lease renewal periods that the person owns or
possesses a dangerous or potentially dangerous dog that will reside at the
property. A dog owner, who is currently renting property, must notify the
property owner within 14 days of city notification if the owned dog is newly
declared as dangerous or potentially dangerous and the owner keeps the dog on
the property.
      (3)   Transfer of ownership into the city. No dog that has been
previously determined to be dangerous or potentially dangerous by another
jurisdiction shall be kept, owned, or harbored in the city unless the dog's
owner complies with the requirements of this section prior to bringing the dog
into the city. Dogs in violation of this division are subject to impoundment
and destruction.
   (G)   Seizure. Animal control may immediately seize any dangerous or
potentially dangerous dog if:
      (1)   After 14 days after the owner has notice that the dog is declared
dangerous or potentially dangerous, the dog is not validly licensed and no
appeal has been filed;
      (2)   After 14 days after the owner has notice that the dog is dangerous,
the owner does not secure the proper liability insurance or surety coverage as

      (6)   The dog's microchip has been removed.
   (H)   Reclamation. A dog seized under division (G) may be reclaimed by the
owner of the dog upon payment of maintenance costs and presenting proof to
animal control that the requirements of this section have been met. A dog not
reclaimed under this division within seven days may be disposed of and the
owner will be liable to the city for maintenance costs. A person claiming an
interest in a seized dog may prevent disposition of the dog by posting a
security in an amount sufficient to provide for the dog's maintenance costs.
The security must be posted with the city within seven days of the seizure
inclusive of the date seized.
   (I)   Subsequent offenses: seizure. If a person has been convicted of
violating a provision of this section, and the person is charged with a
subsequent violation relating to the same dog, the dog may be seized. If the
owner is convicted of the crime for which the dog was seized, the court may
order that the dog be destroyed in a proper and humane manner and the owner pay
the maintenance costs. If the owner is not convicted and the dog is not
reclaimed by the owner within seven days after the owner has been notified that
the dog may be reclaimed, the dog may be disposed of, used for research, or
destroyed.
   (J)   Notice, hearings.
      (1)   Notice. After a dog has been declared dangerous or potentially
dangerous or has been seized for destruction, the city shall give notice by
delivering or mailing it to the owner of the dog, or by posting a copy of it at
the place where the dog is kept, or by delivering it to a person residing on
the property, and telephoning, if possible. The notice shall include:

         (a)   The dog weighs more than 20 pounds;
         (b)   The strength of the dog, including jaw strength;
         (c)   The dog's tolerance for pain;
         (d)   The dog's tendency to refuse to terminate an attack;
         (e)   The dog's propensity to bite humans or other domestic animals;
         (f)   The dog's potential for unpredictable behavior;
         (g)   The dog's aggressiveness; and
         (h)   The likelihood that a bite by the dog will result in serious
injury.
   (L)   Concealing of dogs. No person may harbor, hide, or conceal a dog that

347.515 or 347.52, as they may be amended from time to time;

a dangerous or potentially dangerous dog but never achieved compliance with
this section, may be prohibited from ownership or custody of another dog for a
period of five years after the original declaration. Any dog found to be in
violation may be impounded until due process is completed pursuant to division
(J).
      (3)   If any member of a household is prohibited from owning a dog in
subsections (M)(1) or (2), unless specifically approved with or without
restrictions by the city, no person in the household is permitted to own a dog.
   (N)   Dog ownership prohibition review. Beginning three years after a
conviction under division (M)(1) that prohibits a person from owning a dog, and
annually thereafter, the person may request in writing to the Police Chief that
the city review the prohibition. The city may consider such facts as the
seriousness of the violation or violations that led to the prohibition, any
criminal convictions, or other facts that the city deems appropriate. The city
may rescind the prohibition entirely or rescind it with limitations. The city
also may establish conditions a person must meet before the prohibition is
rescinded, including, but not limited to, successfully completing dog training
or dog handling courses. If the city rescinds a person's prohibition and the
person subsequently fails to comply with any limitations imposed by the city or
the person is convicted of any animal violation involving unprovoked bites or
dog attacks, the city may permanently prohibit the person from owning a dog in
this state.
   (O)   Penalties.

however, that before making the determination, the Council shall hold a public
hearing thereon pursuant to the notice to interested parties and the public as
it may deem necessary or proper in action calling for the hearing.
   (B)   Rates. Where, under specific provisions of this chapter, the Council
has reserved to itself the right to fix or approve fees, rates or charges of a

class of service, and no licensee or proprietor of a regulated business shall
claim or demand payment in excess thereof.
   (C)   Hearing. Any applicant or licensee under this chapter who challenges
denial of a license or rates fixed or approved by the Council shall have a
right to a hearing before the Council upon written request therefor. Notice of

§ 111.01 PURPOSE.
   (A)   This chapter is not intended to in any way hinder, delay or interfere
with legitimate business or organizational activities. The Council finds,
however, that solicitors have used public streets and their direct contact with
residents of the city for the illegitimate solicitation practices of
harassment, nuisance, theft, deceit or menacing, troublesome or unlawful
activities.
   (B)   This chapter is intended to ferret out and control:
      (1)   Businesses and organizations using solicitation as a means of
concealing unlawful activities;
      (2)   Businesses and organizations which, though their activities be
lawful or even commendable, use the illegitimate practices in solicitation; and
      (3)   Individual natural persons who, though they represent lawful
businesses and organizations, use the illegitimate solicitation practices.
   (C)   The Council further finds that a large number of the residents of the
city are employed as their livelihood and means of support by manufacturing
plants and other businesses on shifts rotating between night and day, and to
disturb them during their sleeping hours for the purpose of solicitation is a
source of nuisance or even harassment and should be subject to control.
(1989 Code, § 6.31, Subd. 1)

§ 112.002 APPLICATIONS AND LICENSES UNDER THIS CHAPTER; PROCEDURE AND
ADMINISTRATION.
   (A)   Application. All applications shall be made at the office of the City
Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer upon forms prescribed by the city, or if by the
Commissioner, then together with any additional information as the Council may
desire. Information required may vary with the type of business organization
making application. All questions asked or information required by the
application forms shall be answered fully and completely by the applicant.
Every application for the issuance or renewal of an alcoholic beverage license
must include a copy of each summons received by the applicant during the
preceding year under M.S. § 340A.802, as it may be amended from time to time.
   (B)   False statements. It is unlawful for any applicant to intentionally
make a false statement or omission upon any application form. Any false
statement in the application or any willful omission to state any information
called for on the application form shall, upon discovery of a falsehood, work
an automatic refusal of license, or if already issued, shall render any license
issued pursuant thereto void and of no effect to protect the applicant from
prosecution for violation of this chapter or any part thereof.
   (C)   Application and investigation fees. At the time the initial
application is made, an applicant for a license under this chapter shall
accompany the application with payment of a fee to be considered an application
and investigation fee, not refundable to the applicant, to cover the cost of
the city in processing the application and the investigation of the applicant.
No fee shall be required of an applicant for a temporary beer license.
   (D)   Action.
      (1)   Granting. The Council may approve any application for the period of
the remainder of the then current license year or for the entire ensuing
license year. All applications including proposed license periods must be
consistent with this chapter. Prior to consideration of any application for a
license, the applicant shall pay the license fee, and if applicable, pay the
investigation fee. Upon rejection of any application for a license, or upon
withdrawal of an application before consideration by the Council, the license
fee shall be refunded to the applicant. Failure to pay any portion of a fee
when due shall be cause for revocation.
      (2)   Issuing. If an application is approved, the City Administrator/
Clerk-Treasurer shall forthwith issue a license pursuant thereto in the form
prescribed by the city or the Commissioner, as the case may be. Except as
otherwise specifically provided, all licenses shall be on a fiscal year basis,
July 1 to June 30. For licenses issued and which are to become effective other
than on the first day of the licensed year, the fee to be paid with the
application shall be a pro rata share of the annual license fee. Licenses shall
be valid only at one location and on the premises therein described.
      (3)   Transfer. No license shall be transferable between persons. Any
change in individual ownership, incorporation or substitution of partners is a
transfer. No license shall be transferable to a different location without
prior consent of the Council and payment of the fee for a duplicate license. It
is unlawful to make any transfer in violation of this division (D)(3).
      (4)   Refusal and termination. The Council may, in its sole discretion
and for any reasonable cause, refuse to grant any application. No license shall
be granted to a person of questionable moral character or business reputation.
Licenses shall terminate only by expiration or revocation.
      (5)   Public interest. No license under this chapter may be issued,
transferred or renewed if the results of any investigation show, to the
satisfaction of the Council, that the issuance, transfer or renewal would not
be in the public interest.
      (6)   Revocation or suspension. For any license granted under the
provisions of this chapter, the Council may revoke, suspend for a period not to
exceed 60 days, impose a civil fine not to exceed $2,000 or any combination of
these sanctions, for each violation on a finding that the licensee has failed
to comply with a statute, regulation or provision of the city code relating to
alcoholic beverages. The Council shall revoke the license upon conviction of
any licensee or agent or employee of a licensee for violating any law relating
to the sale or possession of beer, wine or liquor upon premises of the
licensee, or if the revocation is mandatory by statute. If it shall be made to
appear at the hearing thereon that the violation was not willful, the Council
may order suspension; provided that revocation shall be ordered upon the third
violation or offense. No suspension or revocation shall take effect until the
licensee has been afforded an opportunity for a hearing before the Council, a
committee of the Council or a hearing under the Administrative Procedures Act
being M.S. §§ 14.001 to 14.69, as they may be amended from time to time, as may
be determined by the Council in action calling the hearing. The hearing shall
be called by the Council upon written notice to the licensee served in person
or by certified mail not less than 15 nor more than 30 days prior to the
hearing date, stating the time, place and purpose thereof. As additional
restrictions or regulations on licensees under this chapter, and in addition to
grounds for revocation or suspension stated in the city code or statute, the
following shall also be grounds for that action, that:
         (a)   The licensee suffered or permitted illegal acts upon licensed
premises unrelated to the sale of beer, wine or liquor;
         (b)   The licensee had knowledge of the illegal acts upon licensed
premises, but failed to report the same to police;
         (c)   The licensee failed or refused to cooperate fully with police in
investigating the alleged illegal acts upon licensed premises; or
         (d)   The activities of the licensee created a serious danger to
public health, safety or welfare.
      (7)   Corporate applicants and licensees. A corporate applicant, at the
time of application, shall furnish the city with a list of all persons that
have an interest in the corporation and the extent of the interest. The list
shall name all shareholders and show the number of shares held by each, either
individually or beneficially for others. It is the duty of each corporate
licensee to notify the City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer in writing of any
change in legal ownership or beneficial interest in the corporation or in the
shares. Any change in the ownership or beneficial interest in the shares
entitled to be voted at a meeting of the shareholders of a corporate licensee,
which results in the change of voting control of the corporation by the persons
owning the shares therein, shall be deemed equivalent to a transfer of the
license issued to the corporation, and the license shall be revoked 30 days
after the change in ownership or beneficial interest of shares unless the
Council has been notified of the change in writing and has approved it by
appropriate action. The Council, or any officer of the city designated by it,
may at any reasonable time examine the stock transfer records and minute books
of any corporate licensee in order to verify and identify the shareholders, and
the Council or its designated officer may examine the business records of any
other licensee to the extent necessary to disclose the interest which persons
other than the licensee have in the licensed business. The Council may revoke
any license issued upon its determination that a change of ownership of shares
in a corporate licensee or any change of ownership of any interest in the
business of any other licensee has actually resulted in the change of control
of the licensed business so as materially to affect the integrity and character
of its management and its operation, but no action shall be taken until after a
hearing by the Council on notice to the licensee.
   (E)   Duplicate licenses.  Duplicates of all original licenses under this
chapter may be issued by the City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer without action
by the Council, upon licensee’s affidavit that the original has been lost, and
upon payment of the fee adopted by resolution of the Council for issuance of
the duplicate. All duplicate licenses shall be clearly marked “Duplicate.”
   (F)   Posting. All licensees shall conspicuously post their licenses in
their places of business.
   (G)   Resident manager or agent. Before a license is issued under this
chapter to an individual who is a nonresident of the city, to more than one
individual whether or not they are residents of the city, or to a corporation,
partnership or association, the applicant or applicants shall appoint in
writing a natural person who is a resident of the city as its manager or agent.
The resident manager or agent shall, by the terms of his or her written
consent, take full responsibility for the conduct of the licensed premises, and
serve as agent for service of notices and other process relating to the
license. The manager or agent must be a person who, by reason of age,
character, reputation and other attributes, could qualify individually as a
licensee. If the manager or agent ceases to be a resident of the city or ceases
to act in that capacity for the licensee without appointment of a successor,
the license issued pursuant to the appointment shall be subject to revocation
or suspension.
   (H)   Persons disqualified.
      (1)   No license under this chapter may be issued to:
         (a)   A person not a citizen of the United States or a resident alien;
         (b)   A person who within five years of the license application has
been convicted of any felony or a willful violation of a federal or state law,
or local ordinance governing the manufacture, sale, distribution, or possession
for sale or distribution, of alcoholic beverages;
         (c)   A person who has had an alcoholic beverage license revoked
within five years of the license application or to any person who at the time
of the violation owns any interest, whether as a holder of more than 5% of the
capital stock of a corporate licensee, as a partner or otherwise, in the
premises or in the business conducted thereon, or to a corporation,
partnership, association, enterprise, business or firm in which the person is
in any manner interested;
         (d)   A person under the age of 21 years; or
         (e)   A person not of good moral character and repute.
      (2)   No person holding a license from the Commissioner as a
manufacturer, brewer (except as provided by statute), wholesaler or importer
may have a direct or indirect interest, in whole or in part, in a business
holding an alcoholic beverage license from the city.

§ 113.01 PURPOSE.
   Because the city recognizes that many persons under the age of 21 years
purchase or otherwise obtain, possess and use tobacco, tobacco products,
electronic delivery devices, nicotine or lobelia delivery products and tobacco
related devices and the sales, possession and use are violations of both state
and federal laws; and because studies, which the city hereby accepts and
adopts, have shown that most smokers begin smoking before they have reached the
age of 21 years and that those persons who reach the age of 21 years without
having started smoking are significantly less likely to begin smoking; and
because smoking has been shown to be the cause of several serious health
problems which subsequently place a financial burden on all levels of
government; this chapter shall be intended to regulate the sale, possession and
use of tobacco, tobacco products, electronic delivery devices, nicotine or
lobelia delivery products and tobacco related devices for the purpose of
enforcing and furthering existing laws, to protect minors against the serious
effects associated with the illegal use of tobacco, tobacco products,
electronic delivery devices, nicotine or lobelia delivery products and tobacco
related devices and to further the official public policy of the state in
regard to preventing young people from starting to smoke as stated in M.S. §
144.391, as it may be amended from time to time.
(Ord. 95, passed 12-20-2022)
§ 113.02 DEFINITIONS.
   Except as may otherwise be provided or clearly implied by context, all terms
shall be given their commonly accepted definitions. For the purpose of this
chapter, the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly
indicates or requires a different meaning.
   COMPLIANCE CHECKS. The system the city uses to investigate and ensure that
those authorized to sell tobacco, tobacco products, electronic delivery
devices, nicotine or lobelia delivery products and tobacco related devices are
following and complying with the requirements of this chapter. COMPLIANCE
CHECKS shall involve the use of minors as authorized by this chapter.
COMPLIANCE CHECKS shall also mean the use of minors who attempt to purchase
tobacco, tobacco products, electronic delivery devices, nicotine or lobelia
delivery products, or tobacco related devices for educational, research and
training purposes as authorized by state and federal laws. COMPLIANCE CHECKS
may also be conducted by other units of government for the purpose of enforcing
appropriate federal, state or local laws and regulations relating to tobacco,
tobacco products and tobacco related devices.
   ELECTRONIC DELIVERY DEVICE. Any product containing or delivering nicotine,
lobelia, or any other substance intended for human consumption that can be used
by a person to simulate smoking by delivery of nicotine or any other substance
through inhalation of vapor from the product, including any component part of
an electronic delivery device, whether or not it is sold or marketed
separately.
   INDIVIDUALLY PACKAGED. The practice of selling any tobacco or tobacco
product wrapped individually for sale. Individually wrapped tobacco and tobacco
products shall include but not be limited to single cigarette packs, single
bags or cans of loose tobacco in any form and single cans or other packaging of

single pack or other container as described in this definition shall not be

related devices in any manner where  any person shall have access to the
tobacco, tobacco products, electronic delivery devices, nicotine or lobelia

intervention shall entail the actual physical exchange of the tobacco, tobacco
product, electronic delivery devices, nicotine or lobelia delivery products, or
tobacco related device between the customer and the licensee or employee. The

charges, as may be amended from time to time. Initial license applications
covering a period of less than one year shall be charged a fee calculated on a
monthly pro rata basis.
   (F)   Restriction on issuance.
      (1)   No license shall be granted or renewed for operation on any

other financial claims of the city are delinquent and unpaid. In the event an
action has been commenced pursuant to the provisions of M.S. Ch. 278, as it may
be amended from time to time, questioning the amount or validity of taxes, the

division. No waiver may be granted, however, for taxes or any portion thereof
which remain unpaid for a period exceeding one year after becoming due.

HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS

property of unlicensed, unregistered or inoperable motor vehicles, household
furniture, furnishings or appliances or parts or components thereof, or metal,
wood, glass, paper, rubber, concrete or other material, whether organic or
inorganic, can facilitate the growth or spread of noxious weeds, the nesting
and breeding of rodents, insects and harmful bacteria, and be a threat of fire.
The Council also finds that unless the accumulation is stored in a lawfully
operated junk yard, housed within a lawfully erected building, or in a
container permitted and the contents disposed of under provisions of the city
code, it is a source of filth, cause of sickness and an immediate danger to the
health, safety and welfare of persons and property in the city. The Council
finds that if the unauthorized, unwholesome and dangerous accumulation is
permitted to continue to pose a threat, it is a hazardous condition and a
nuisance and must be abated, and this section is adopted to protect the
residents of the city and their property and, in addition, to protect the
rights of persons who may be found in violation of its provisions.
ACCUMULATION, as that term is used in this division (A), means prohibited items
in any number or amount.

to which the public has access or may be exposed, of food particles or other
material causing discomfort to patrons, or disrepair of seating, floor
covering, plumbing, heating or electrical facilities, or failure to maintain a
reasonable standard of cleanliness and absence of noxious odors, can facilitate
the nesting and breeding of rodents, insects and harmful bacteria and is a
source of filth, cause of sickness and an immediate danger to the health,
safety and welfare of persons and property in the city. The Council finds that
if the unauthorized, unwholesome and dangerous accumulation is permitted to
continue to pose a threat, it is a hazardous condition and a nuisance and must
be abated, and this section is adopted to protect the residents of the city and
their property and, in addition, to protect the rights of persons who may be
harmed in violation of its provisions. ACCUMULATION, as that term is used in
this division (B), means prohibited items or conditions in any number or
amount.

§ 130.31 UNLAWFUL ACTS AND ENFORCEMENT.

within a lawfully erected building, or in a container permitted and the
contents disposed of under other provisions of the city code.

or may be exposed, any accumulation of food particles or other material causing
discomfort to patrons; disrepair of seating, floor covering, plumbing, heating

cleanliness and absence of noxious odors.
   (C)   As to any provision of this section which constitutes an unlawful act,
and in addition to all of the civil proceedings described in this section, each
day that a violation continues or is permitted to continue shall constitute a
separate offense in prosecution of the unlawful act.

If the Council finds that there is a violation, the decision shall include an
order to abate the nuisance and specify the date by which the abatement shall
be completed.
   (C)   Estimated value, if any, of all offensive items described in §

SIGNS
§ 150.35 PURPOSE AND DEFINITIONS.
   (A)   Findings, purpose and effect.
      (1)   Findings. The City Council hereby finds as follows:
         (a)   Exterior signs have a substantial impact on the character and
quality of the environment.
         (b)   Signs provide an important medium through which individuals may
convey a variety of messages.
         (c)   Signs can create traffic hazards, aesthetic concerns and
detriments to property values, thereby threatening the public health, safety
and welfare.
         (d)   The city's zoning regulations include the regulation of signs in
an effort to provide adequate means of expression and to promote the economic
viability of the business community, while protecting the city and its citizens
from a proliferation of signs of a type, size, location and character that
would adversely impact upon the aesthetics of the community and threaten the
health, safety and welfare of the community. The regulation of the physical
characteristics of signs within the city has had a positive impact on traffic
safety and the appearance of the community.
      (2)   Purpose and intent. It is not the purpose or intent of this sign
subchapter to regulate the message displayed on any sign; nor is it the purpose
or intent of this subchapter to regulate any building design or any display not
defined as a sign, or any sign which cannot be viewed from outside a building.
The purpose and intent of this subchapter is to:
         (a)   Regulate the number, location, size, type, illumination and
other physical characteristics of signs within the city in order to promote the
public health, safety and welfare;
         (b)   Maintain, enhance and improve the aesthetic environment of the
city by preventing visual clutter that is harmful to the appearance of the
community; and
         (c)   Improve the visual appearance of the city while providing for
effective means of communication, consistent with constitutional guarantees and
the city's goals of public safety and aesthetics.
      (3)   Effect. A sign may be erected, mounted, displayed or maintained in
the city if it is in conformance with the provisions of these regulations. The
effect of this sign subchapter, as more specifically set forth herein, is to:
         (a)   Allow a wide variety of sign types in commercial zones, and a
more limited variety of signs in other zones, subject to the standards set
forth in this subchapter;
         (b)   Allow certain small, unobtrusive signs incidental to the
principal use of a site in all zones when in compliance with the requirements
of this subchapter;
         (c)   Prohibit signs whose location, size, type, illumination or other
physical characteristics negatively affect the environment and where the
communication can be accomplished by means having a lesser impact on the
environment and the public health, safety and welfare; and
         (d)   Provide for the enforcement of the provisions of this
subchapter.
   (B)   Definitions. The following words and terms, when used in this
subchapter, shall have the following meanings, unless the context clearly
indicates otherwise:
      ABANDONED SIGN. Any sign and/or its supporting sign structure which
remains without a message or whose display surface remains blank for a period
of one year or more, or any sign which pertains to a time, event or purpose
which no longer applies, shall be deemed to have been abandoned. Signs

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   Statutory authorization.  The State Legislature has, in M.S. Chapter
103F and Chapter 462, as they may be amended from time to time, delegated the
authority to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize
flood losses. M.S. Chapter 103F, as it may be amended from time to time,
further stipulates that communities subject to recurrent flooding must
participate and maintain eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (B)   Statement of purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to maintain the
city’s eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program and to minimize
potential losses due to periodic flooding, including loss of life, loss of
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety and general welfare.
   (C)   Warning of disclaimer of liability.  This chapter does not imply that
areas outside of the floodplain district or land uses permitted within those
districts will be free from flooding and flood damages. This chapter shall not
create liability on the part of the city or any officer or employee thereof for
any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any
administrative decisions lawfully made thereunder.
(1989 Code, § 13.01)
§ 151.02 LANDS TO WHICH THIS CHAPTER APPLIES.
   This chapter shall apply to all lands designated as floodplain within the
jurisdiction of the city.
(1989 Code, § 13.02, Subd. 2)
§ 151.03 INTERPRETATION.
   (A)   The boundaries of the floodplain district shall be determined by
scaling distances on the Official Floodplain District Map. Where interpretation
is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the floodplain
district, the City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer shall make the necessary
interpretation based on elevations on the regional (100-year) flood profile, if
available.
   (B)   If 100-year flood elevations are not available, the city shall:
      (1)   Require a floodplain evaluation consistent with §
151.20 to determine a 100-year flood elevation for the site; or
      (2)   Base its decision on available hydraulic/hydrologic or site
elevation survey data which demonstrates the likelihood the site is within or
outside of the floodplain.
(1989 Code, § 13.02, Subd. 3)
§ 151.04 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ACCESSORY USE OR STRUCTURE. A use or structure on the same lot with, and of
a nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal use or
structure.
   BASEMENT. Any area of a structure, including crawl spaces, having its floor
or base subgrade (below ground level) on all four sides, regardless of the
depth of excavation below ground level.
   FLOOD FRINGE. The portion of the floodplain outside of the floodway.
   FLOODPLAIN. The channel or beds proper and the areas adjoining a wetland,
lake or watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regional
flood.
   FLOODWAY. The bed of a wetland or lake and the channel of a watercourse and
those portions of the adjoining floodplain which are reasonably required to
carry or store the regional flood discharge.
   OBSTRUCTION. Any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment,
projection, excavation, channel modification, culvert, building, wire, fence,
stockpile, refuse, fill, structure, stockpile of sand or gravel or other
material or matter in, along, across or projecting into any channel,
watercourse, lake bed or regulatory floodplain which may impede, retard or
change the direction of the flow, either in itself or by catching or collecting
debris carried by floodwater.
   REGIONAL FLOOD. A flood which is representative of large floods known to
have occurred generally in this state and reasonably characteristic of what can
be expected to occur on an average frequency in the magnitude of the 100-year
recurrence interval. REGIONAL FLOOD is synonymous with the term BASE FLOOD used
in the Flood Insurance Rate Map.
   REGULATORY FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION. An elevation no lower than one foot
above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation
caused by encroachments on the floodplain that result from designation of a
floodway.
   STRUCTURE. Anything constructed or erected on the ground or attached to the
ground or on-site utilities, including but not limited to buildings, factories,
sheds, detached garages, cabins, manufactured homes, travel trailers/vehicles
not meeting the exemption criteria specified in §
151.22, and other similar items.
(1989 Code, § 13.03)
§ 151.05 CONFLICT WITH PRE-EXISTING ZONING REGULATIONS AND GENERAL COMPLIANCE.
   (A)   The floodplain district as overlay zoning district. The floodplain
zoning district shall be considered an overlay zoning district to all existing
land use regulations of the city. The uses permitted in §§
151.20 and
151.21 shall be permitted only if not prohibited by any established, underlying
zoning district. The requirements of this chapter shall apply in addition to
other legally established regulations of the city and where this chapter
imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall apply.
   (B)   Compliance. No new structure or land shall hereafter be used and no
structure shall be located, extended, converted or structurally altered without
full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations
which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter. Within the
floodway and flood fringe, all uses not listed as permitted uses in §
151.20 shall be prohibited. In addition, a caution is provided here that:
      (1)   New manufactured homes, replacement manufactured homes and certain
travel trailers and travel vehicles are subject to the general provisions of
this chapter and specifically §
151.22;
      (2)   Modifications, additions, structural alterations or repair after
damage to existing nonconforming structures and nonconforming uses of
structures or land are regulated by the general provisions of this chapter and
specifically §
151.39; and
      (3)   As-built elevations for elevated structures must be certified by
ground surveys as stated in §§
151.35 through
151.37.
(1989 Code, § 13.04) (Ord. 21, 2nd Ser., eff. 5-30-1997)
STANDARDS
§ 151.20 PERMITTED USES, STANDARDS AND FLOODPLAIN ELEVATION CRITERIA.
   (A)   Permitted uses in the floodplain.  The following uses of land are
permitted uses in the floodplain district:
      (1)   Any use of land which does not involve a structure, an addition to
the outside dimensions to an existing structure or an obstruction to flood
flows such as fill, excavation or storage of materials or equipment;
      (2)   Any use of land involving the construction of new structures, the
placement or replacement of manufactured homes, the addition to the outside
dimensions of an existing structure or obstructions such as fill or storage of
materials or equipment, provided these activities are located in the flood
fringe portion of the floodplain. These uses shall be subject to the
development standards in division (B) below, and the floodplain evaluation
criteria in division (C) below, for determining floodway and flood fringe
boundaries; and
      (3)   Travel trailers and travel vehicles as regulated by §
151.22.
   (B)   Standards for floodplain permitted uses.
      (1)   Fill. Fill shall be properly compacted and the slopes shall be
properly protected by the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable
method. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria
for removing the special flood hazard area designation for certain structures
properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation. FEMA’s
requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection
standards for multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should
be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of
special flood hazard area designation will be requested.
      (2)   Storage of materials and equipment.
         (a)   The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of
flooding, flammable, explosive or potentially injurious to human, animal or
plant life is prohibited.
         (b)   Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if
readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning
or, if placed on fill, to the regulatory flood protection elevation.
      (3)   Use prohibited. No use shall be permitted which will adversely
affect the capacity of the channels or floodways of any tributary to the main
stream, or of any drainage ditch or any other drainage facility or system.
      (4)   Structures. All structures, including accessory structures,
additions to existing structures and manufactured homes, shall be constructed
on fill so that the basement floor, or first floor if there is no basement, is
at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation. The finished fill
elevation must be no lower than one foot below the regulatory flood protection
elevation and shall extend at an elevation at least 15 feet beyond the limits
of the structure constructed thereon.
      (5)   All uses. Uses that do not have vehicular access at or above an
elevation not more than two feet below the regulatory flood protection
elevation to lands outside of the floodplain shall not be permitted unless
granted a variance by the Board of Adjustment. In granting a variance, the
Board shall specify limitations on the period of use or occupancy of the use
and only after determining that adequate flood warning time and local emergency
response and recovery procedures exist.
      (6)   Commercial and manufacturing uses. Accessory land uses, such as
yards, railroad tracks, and parking lots, may be at elevations lower than the
regulatory flood protection elevation. However, a permit for the facilities to
be used by the employees or the general public shall not be granted in the
absence of a flood warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if
the area would be inundated to a depth greater than two feet or be subject to
flood velocities greater than four feet per second upon occurrence of the
regional flood.
      (7)   On-site sewage treatment and water supply systems. Where public
utilities are not provided, on-site water supply systems must be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems; and new or
replacement on-site sewage treatment systems must be designed to minimize or
eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the
systems into flood waters and they shall not be subject to impairment or
contamination during times of flooding. Any sewage treatment system designed in
accordance with the state’s current state-wide standards for on-site sewage
treatment systems shall be determined to be in compliance with this section.
      (8)   Manufactured homes. All manufactured homes must be securely
anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system that resists flotation
collapse and lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include but are not to
be limited to use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This
requirement is in addition to applicable state or local anchoring requirements
for resisting wind forces.
   (C)   Floodplain evaluation.
      (1)   Upon receipt of an application for a permit, manufactured home park
development or subdivision approval within the floodplain district, the Zoning
Officer shall require the applicant to furnish sufficient site development
plans and a hydrologic/hydraulic analysis by a qualified engineer or
hydrologist specifying the nature of the development and whether the proposed
use is located in the floodway or flood fringe and the regulatory flood
protection elevation for the site. Procedures consistent with Minn. Rules 1983,
parts 6120.5600 (Technical Standards and Requirements for Floodplain
Evaluation) and 6120.5700 (Minimum Floodplain Management Standards for Local
Ordinances), shall be followed during the technical evaluation and review of
the development proposal.
      (2)   The Zoning Officer shall submit one copy of all information
required by division (C)(1) above, to the respective Department of Natural
Resources’ Area Hydrologist for review and comment at least 20 days prior to
the granting of a permit or manufactured home park development/subdivision
approval by the city. The Zoning Officer shall notify the respective Department
of Natural Resources’ Area Hydrologist within ten days after a permit or
manufactured home park development/subdivision approval is granted.
(1989 Code, § 13.10)
§ 151.21 UTILITIES, RAILROADS, ROADS AND BRIDGES IN THE FLOODPLAIN DISTRICT.
   All utilities and transportation facilities, including railroad tracks,
roads and bridges, shall be constructed in accordance with state floodplain
management standards contained in Minn. Rules 1983, parts 6120.5000 through
6120.6200.
(1989 Code, § 13.11) (Ord. 21, 2nd Ser., eff. 5-30-1997)
§ 151.22 TRAVEL TRAILERS AND TRAVEL VEHICLES.
   Travel trailers and travel vehicles that do not meet the exemption criteria
specified in division (A) below shall be subject to the provisions of this
chapter and as specifically spelled out in divisions (C) and (D) below.
   (A)   Exemption. Travel trailers and travel vehicles are exempt from the
provisions of this chapter if they are placed in any of the areas listed in
division (B) below, and further they meet the following criteria:
      (1)   Have current licenses required for highway use;
      (2)   Are highway ready, meaning on wheels or the internal jacking
system, are attached to the site only by quick-disconnect type utilities
commonly used in campgrounds and trailer parks and the travel trailer/travel
vehicle has no permanent structural type additions attached to it; and
      (3)   The travel trailer or travel vehicle and associated use must be
permissible in any pre-existing, underlying zoning use district.
   (B)   Areas exempted for placement of travel/recreational vehicles.
      (1)   Individual lots or parcels of record;
      (2)   Existing commercial recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds; and
      (3)   Existing condominium type associations.
   (C)   Loss of exemption. Travel trailers and travel vehicles exempted in
division (A) above lose this exemption when development occurs on the parcel
exceeding $500 for a structural addition to the travel trailer/travel vehicle
or an accessory structure such as a garage or storage building. The travel
trailer/travel vehicle and all additions and accessory structures will then be
treated as a new structure and shall be subject to the elevation requirements
and the use of land restrictions specified in §
151.20.
   (D)   Conditions. New commercial travel trailer or travel vehicle parks or
campgrounds and new residential type subdivisions and condominium associations
and the expansion of any existing similar use exceeding five units or dwelling
sites shall be subject to the following.
      (1)   Any new or replacement travel trailer or travel vehicle will be
allowed in the floodway or flood fringe districts, provided the trailer or
vehicle and its contents are placed on fill above the regulatory flood
protection elevation determined in accordance with the provisions of §
151.20(C), and proper elevated road access to the site exists in accordance
with §
151.20. No fill placed in the floodway to meet the requirements of this section
shall increase flood stages of the 100-year or regional flood; and
      (2)   All new or replacement travel trailers or travel vehicles not
meeting the criteria of division (D)(1) above may, as an alternative, be
allowed if in accordance with the following provisions. The applicant must
submit an emergency plan for the safe evacuation of all vehicles and people
during the 100-year flood. The plan shall be prepared by a registered engineer
or other qualified individual and shall demonstrate that adequate time and
personnel exist to carry out the evacuation. All attendant sewage and water
facilities for new or replacement travel trailers or other recreational
vehicles must be protected or constructed so as to not be impaired or
contaminated during times of flooding in accordance with §
151.20(B)(7).
(1989 Code, § 13.30) (Ord. 21, 2nd Ser., eff. 5-30-1997)
§ 151.23 SUBDIVISIONS.
   (A)   Determination. No land shall be subdivided and no manufactured home
park shall be developed or expanded where the site is determined to be
unsuitable by the Zoning Officer for reason of flooding or inadequate drainage,
water supply or sewage treatment facilities. The Zoning Officer shall review
the subdivision/development proposal to ensure that each lot or parcel contains
sufficient area outside of the floodway for fill placement for elevating
structures, sewage systems and related activities.
   (B)   Information required. In the floodplain district, applicants for
subdivision approval or development of a manufactured home park or manufactured
home park expansion shall provide the information required in §
151.20(C). The Zoning Officer shall evaluate the proposed subdivision or mobile
home park development in accordance with the standards established, in §
151.20(B) and (C) and §
151.21.
   (C)   Required elevation.  For all subdivisions in the floodplain, the
floodway and flood fringe boundaries, the regulatory flood protection elevation
and the required elevation of all access roads shall be clearly labeled on all
required subdivision drawings and platting documents.
   (D)   Removal of special flood hazard area designation. The Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for removing the
special flood hazard area designation for certain structures properly elevated
on fill above the 100-year flood elevation. FEMA’s requirements incorporate
specific fill compaction and side slope protection standards for multi-
structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should be investigated
prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of special flood hazard
area designation will be requested.
(1989 Code, § 13.40) (Ord. 21, 2nd Ser., eff. 5-30-1997)
ADMINISTRATION
§ 151.35 PERMIT REQUIRED.
   A permit issued by the City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer shall be secured
prior to the construction, addition or alteration of any building or structure;
prior to the use or change of use of a building, structure or land; prior to
the change or extension of a nonconforming use; and prior to excavation or the
placement of an obstruction within the floodplain.
(1989 Code, § 13.50, Subd. 1) (Ord. 21, 2nd Ser., eff. 5-30-1997)
§ 151.36 STATE AND FEDERAL PERMITS.
   Prior to granting a permit or processing an application for a variance, the
City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer shall determine that the applicant has
obtained all necessary state and federal permits.
(1989 Code, § 13.50, Subd. 2) (Ord. 21, 2nd Ser., eff. 5-30-1997)
§ 151.37 CERTIFICATION OF LOWEST FLOOR ELEVATIONS.
   The applicant shall be required to submit certification by a registered
professional engineer, registered architect or registered land surveyor that
the finished fill and building elevations were accomplished in compliance with
the provisions of this chapter. The Zoning Officer shall maintain a record of
the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) for all new structures
and alterations or additions to existing structures in the floodplain district.
(1989 Code, § 13.50, Subd. 3) (Ord. 21, 2nd Ser., eff. 5-30-1997)
§ 151.38 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Defined. A VARIANCE means a modification of a specific permitted
development standard required in an official control including this chapter to
allow an alternative development standard not stated as acceptable in the
official control, but only as applied to a particular property for the purpose
of alleviating a hardship, practical difficulty or unique circumstance as
defined and elaborated upon in a community’s respective planning and zoning
enabling legislation.
   (B)   Authorization. The Board may authorize upon appeal in specific cases a
relief or variance from the terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to
the public interest and only for those circumstances such as hardship,
practical difficulties or circumstances unique to the property under
consideration, as provided for in the respective enabling legislation for
planning and zoning for cities or counties as appropriate. In the granting of
the variance, the Board of Adjustment shall clearly identify in writing the
specific conditions that existed consistent with the criteria specified in the
respective enabling legislation which justified the granting of the variance.
   (C)   Determination.  Variances from the provisions of this chapter may be
authorized where the Board of Adjustment has determined the variance will not
be contrary to the public interest and the spirit and intent of this chapter.
No variance shall allow in any district a use prohibited in that district or
permit a lower degree of flood protection than the regulatory flood protection
elevation. Variances may be used to modify permissible methods of flood
protection.
   (D)   Submission. The Board shall submit by mail to the Commissioner of
Natural Resources a copy of the application for proposed variance sufficiently
in advance so that the Commissioner will receive at least ten days’ notice of
the hearing. A copy of all decisions granting a variance shall be forwarded by
mail to the Commissioner of Natural Resources within ten days of the action.
   (E)   Appeals. Appeals from any decision of the Board may be made, and as
specified in the city’s official controls and also in state statutes.
   (F)   Flood insurance notice and record keeping. The Planning and Zoning
Official shall notify the applicant for a variance that the issuance of a
variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in
increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for
$100 of insurance coverage; and that construction below the 100-year or
regional flood level increases risks to life and property. This notification
shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions. The city shall
maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their
issuance, and report the variances issued in its annual or biannual report
submitted to the Administrator of the National Flood Insurance Program.
(1989 Code, § 13.60) (Ord. 21, 2nd Ser., eff. 5-30-1997)
§ 151.39 NONCONFORMITIES.
   A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful before
the effective date of this chapter but which is not in conformity with the
provisions of this chapter may be continued subject to the following
conditions.
   (A)   No use shall be expanded, changed, enlarged or altered in a way which
increases its nonconformity.
   (B)   An alteration within the inside dimensions of a nonconforming use or
structure is permissible, provided it will not result in increasing the flood
damage potential of that use or structure.
   (C)   The cost of all structural alterations or additions both inside and
outside of a structure to any nonconforming structure over the life of the
structure shall not exceed 50% of the market value of the structure unless the
conditions of this section are satisfied. The cost of all structural
alterations and additions constructed since the adoption of city’s initial
floodplain controls must be calculated into today’s current cost which will
include all costs such as construction materials and a reasonable cost placed
on all manpower or labor. If the current cost of all previous and proposed
alterations and additions exceeds 50% of the current market value of the
structure, then the structure must meet the standards of §
151.20 for new structures.
   (D)   If any nonconforming use of a structure or land or nonconforming
structure is destroyed by any means, including floods, to an extent of 50% or
more of its market value at the time of destruction, it shall not be
reconstructed except in conformance with the provisions of this chapter. The
city may issue a permit for reconstruction if the use is located outside the
floodway and, upon reconstruction, is adequately elevated on fill in conformity
with the provisions of this chapter.
(1989 Code, § 13.70) (Ord. 21, 2nd Ser., eff. 5-30-1997)
§ 151.40 AMENDMENTS.
   All amendments to this chapter, including revisions to the Official
Floodplain Zoning District Map, shall be submitted to and approved by the
Commissioner of Natural Resources prior to adoption. The floodplain designation
on the Official Floodplain Zoning District Map shall not be removed unless the
area is filled to an elevation at or above the regulatory flood protection
elevation and is contiguous to lands outside of the floodplain. Changes in the
Official Zoning Map must meet the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA)
technical conditions and criteria and must receive prior FEMA approval before
adoption. The Commissioner of Natural Resources must be given ten days’ written
notice of all hearings to consider an amendment to this chapter and the notice
shall include a draft of the amendment or technical study under consideration.
(1989 Code, § 13.80) (Ord. 21, 2nd Ser., eff. 5-30-1997)
§ 151.99 PENALTY.
   It is unlawful for any person to violate the provisions of this chapter or
fail to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions
and safeguards established in connection with grants of variances).
   (A)   In responding to a suspected city code violation, the Planning and
Zoning Official and the Council may utilize the full array of enforcement
actions available to it, including but not limited to prosecution and fines,
injunctions, after-the-fact permits, orders for corrective measures or a
request to the National Flood Insurance Program for denial of flood insurance
availability to the guilty party. The city must act in good faith to enforce
these official controls and to correct city code violations to the extent
possible so as not to jeopardize its eligibility in the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (B)   When a city code violation is either discovered by or brought to the
attention of the Planning and Zoning Official, the Planning and Zoning Official
shall immediately investigate the situation and document the nature and extent
of the violation of the official control. As soon as is reasonably possible,
this information will be submitted to the appropriate Department of Natural
Resources and Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Regional Office along with
the city’s plan of action to correct the violation to the degree possible.
   (C)   The Planning and Zoning Official shall notify the suspected party of
the requirements of this chapter and all other official controls and the nature
and extent of the suspected violation of these controls. If the structure and/
or use is under construction or development, the Planning and Zoning Official
may order the construction or development immediately halted until a proper
permit or approval is granted by the city. If the construction or development
is already completed, then the Planning and Zoning Official may either issue an
order identifying the corrective actions that must be made within a specified
time period to bring the use or structure into compliance with the official
controls, or notify the responsible party to apply for an after-the-fact
permit/development approval within a specified period of time not to exceed 30
days.
   (D)   If the responsible party does not appropriately respond to the
Planning and Zoning Official within the specified period of time, each
additional day that lapses shall constitute an additional violation of this
chapter and shall be prosecuted accordingly. The Planning and Zoning Official
shall also, upon the lapse of the specified response period, notify the
landowner to restore the land to the condition which existed prior to the
violation of this chapter.

subdivision boundary, in which case it may have a single tier of lots.
   (B)   Length. The maximum length of blocks shall be 1,500 feet and the
minimum length, 400 feet. Blocks over 900 feet long may require pedestrian ways
at least ten feet wide at their approximate center.
(1989 Code, § 12.06, Subd. 5)
§ 152.25 LOTS.
   (A)   Location.  All lots shall abut for their full frontage on a publicly
dedicated street.
   (B)   Size. The lot dimensions shall be so as to comply with the minimum lot
areas specified in the zoning chapter.
   (C)   Butt lots.  Butt lots shall be prohibited.
   (D)   Side lot lines. Side lines of lots shall be substantially at right
angles to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines.
   (E)   Watercourses. Lots abutting upon a watercourse, drainageway, channel
or stream shall have sufficient depth and width to provide a minimum area of

parallel streets) shall not be permitted except where lots back to a major
thoroughfare street.
   (I)   Future arrangements. Where parcels of land are subdivided into
unusually large lots, such as when large lots are required for septic tank
operations, the plat shall be designed and shall show, in dashed lines, how
lots can be resubdivided at some future date when public sanitary sewers are
available.
(1989 Code, § 12.06, Subd. 6)
§ 152.26 PUBLIC SITES, PEDESTRIAN WAYS, OPEN SPACES AND NATURAL FEATURES.
   (A)   Public uses. Where a proposed park, playground, school, trail system
or other public use shown on the Comprehensive Guide Plan is located in whole
or in part within a subdivision, the area shall be dedicated to the public or
reserved for public purchase at fair market value. If, within two years of
recording of the plat, the purchase is not consummated, the reservation shall
be cancelled.
   (B)   Dedication. In all new subdivisions, the city shall require that a
sufficient portion of the land be used aside and dedicated to the public for
parks, schools, playgrounds or other public use exclusive of property dedicated
for streets and other public ways. It shall be presumed that a sufficient
amount of land has been dedicated for parks, schools and playgrounds for the
present and future residents if the subdivider dedicates at least 10% of the
land in the subdivision. The city, upon consideration of the particular type of
development proposed in the subdivision, may require larger or lesser amounts
of land to be dedicated if it determines that the present and future residents
of the subdivision would require greater or lesser amounts of land for those
purposes. In lieu of dedication of the land, the Council shall have the option
to require a cash payment equivalent to the fair market of the land in lieu of
a land dedication.
   (C)   Private parks. Subdividers shall be encouraged to provide small,
privately owned parks and open spaces in all commercial, industrial and
residential developments to satisfy the needs of employees, shoppers and small

the subdivider, which are listed and described above, are to be furnished and
installed at the sole expense of the subdivider and at no expense to the
public. If any improvement installed within the subdivision will be of
substantial benefit to lands beyond the boundaries of the subdivision, the
Council may make provision for causing a portion of the cost of the
improvement, representing the benefit to those lands, to be assessed against
the same, and in that case the subdivider will be required only to pay for
those portions of the whole cost of the improvements as will represent the
benefit to the property within the subdivision.
   (B)   Required improvement contract. Prior to installation of required
improvements and prior to approval of the final plat, the subdivider shall
enter into a contract with the city requiring that the subdivider furnish and
construct the improvements at his or her expense and in accordance with plans
and specifications to be approved by the City Engineer. The contract shall
stipulate the type and extent of the improvements to be constructed, the cost
of the construction, the city’s authority to inspect the construction and the
amount of the escrow deposit or performance bond to be furnished in accordance
with division (C) of this section. Alternatively, the city, in its discretion
may require that, or, at the request of the subdivider may agree to undertake
the installation of the required improvements, in which event the subdivider
shall enter into a contract with the city agreeing to pay the expense thereof,
including all construction, engineering, legal, financing and administrative
costs incurred by the city by reason thereof; by this contract the developer
shall agree to the method and schedule of payment to the city as determined by
the city and, if required, shall agree to furnish the escrow deposit or surety
bond described in division (C) below.
   (C)   Financial guarantee. Prior to the approval of the final plat, if the
subdivider is to undertake the installation of the required improvements, he or
she shall make an escrow deposit or, in lieu thereof, furnish a performance
bond equal to the total construction cost of the improvements as estimated by
the City Engineer, and including the cost of inspection by the city, or if the
city undertakes the installation of the improvements, and if requested by the
city, the subdivider shall make an escrow deposit or, in lieu thereof, furnish
a surety bond in the amount of the sum he or she has agreed to pay the city for
the installation of the improvements. Any deposit or bond shall accrue to the
city in case of default of the subdivider. In case of default, the city shall
appropriate the deposit and pursue its remedies provided by the bond. The term
of any deposit or bond shall be specified by the city. Any bond must be subject
to approval by the city. Deposits shall be made with the Administrator/Clerk-
Treasurer of the city or with a responsible escrow agent acceptable to the
city. The city may agree to provide for reduction of the amount of any bond or
deposit by reason of completion of, or payment for, the improvements for which
the bond or deposit has been made. Nothing herein shall preclude the city from
making special assessments against benefitted property for improvements made on
it.

   The Council finds that the city is faced with mounting problems in providing
means of guiding future development of land so as to ensure a safer, pleasant
and more economical environment for residential, commercial, industrial and
public activities, and to promote the public health, safety and general
welfare. Through the enactment of this chapter, the Council intends to prepare
for anticipated changes and by those preparations, to bring about a significant
savings in both private and public expenditures. This chapter is intended to be
one means of effectuating the Comprehensive Guide Plan undertaken by the city.

objectives through the regulation of the location, height, bulk, number of
stories, size of buildings and other structures, the percentage of lot area
which may be occupied, the size of yards and other open spaces, the density and
distribution of population, the uses of buildings and structures for trade,
industry, residence, recreation, public activities or other purposes, and the
uses of land for trade, industry, residence, recreation, public activities or
other purposes, through the establishment of standards and procedures
regulating uses within the city.

(1989 Code, § 11.13)
§ 153.007 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Generally. In instances where the strict enforcement of the literal
provisions of this chapter would cause undue hardship because of circumstances
unique and distinctive to an individual property under consideration, the
Council, sitting as a Board of Adjustments and Appeals, shall have the power to
grant variances, in keeping with the spirit and intent of this chapter. The
provisions of this chapter, considered in conjunction with the unique and
distinctive circumstances affecting the property must be the proximate cause of
the hardship; circumstances caused by the property owner or his or her
predecessor in title shall not constitute sufficient justification to grant a
variance. The following rules shall govern applications for a variance from the
strict requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   Procedures.
      (1)   A variance application shall be initiated by the owner of the
subject property or his or her authorized agent. The application shall be
referred to the Planning Commission for public hearing, study and report and
may not be acted upon by the Council until it has received the recommendation
of the Planning Commission, or until 90 days have elapsed from the date of
referral of the application without a report by the Planning Commission. The
DATE OF REFERRAL is defined as the date of the public hearing.
      (2)    The applicant shall fill out and submit to the Secretary of the
Planning Commission a planning and zoning application, copies of which are
available at the city offices, together with a fee as set by resolution of the
City Council. The application shall be filed with the Secretary of the Planning
Commission at least 14 days before the date of the public hearing.
      (3)   The Secretary of the Planning Commission shall refer the matter to
the Planning Commission by placing the application upon the agenda of the
Planning Commission’s next regular meeting; provided, however, that the
Secretary may, with the approval of the Chairperson of the Planning Commission,
place the application on the agenda for a special meeting of the Planning
Commission.
      (4)   Not less than ten days before the date of the hearing, the
Secretary of the Planning Commission shall mail notice of the hearing to the
applicant and to the property owners or occupants within 350 feet (including
streets) of the subject property. The failure of the owner or occupant to
receive the notice shall not invalidate the proceedings hereunder.
      (5)   The Planning Commission shall report its recommendations to the
Council not later than 60 days following the date of referral to the Planning
Commission.
      (6)   The application and recommendation of the Planning Commission shall
be placed on the agenda of the Council within 30 days following the
recommendation of the Planning Commission, or in the event the Planning
Commission has failed to make a recommendation, within 90 days of the date of
referral to the Planning Commission.
      (7)   The Council shall make a final determination of the application
within 60 days of the recommendation by the Planning Commission, or in the
event the Planning Commission has failed to make any recommendation, within 120
days of the date of referral to the Planning Commission.
      (8)   The applicant or his or her agent shall appear at each meeting of
the Planning Commission and of the Council during which the application is
considered. Furthermore, each applicant shall provide for the Planning
Commission or the Council, as the case may be, the maps, drawings, plans,
records or other information requested by the Planning Commission or the
Council for the purpose of assisting the determination of the application.
      (9)   The Secretary of the Planning Commission, following the Planning
Commission’s action upon the application, and the City Administrator/Clerk-
Treasurer, following the Council’s action upon the application, shall give the
applicant a written notice of the action taken. A copy of this notice shall be
kept on file as a part of the permanent record of the application.
   (C)   Standards for variances.  The Planning Commission may recommend and
the Council, sitting as a Board of Adjustments and Appeals, may grant variances
from the literal provisions of this chapter in instances where their strict
enforcement would cause undue hardship because of circumstances unique and
distinctive to the individual property under consideration. However, the
Planning Commission shall not recommend and the Council shall in no case permit
as a variance any use that is not permitted under this chapter in the district
where the affected person’s land is located. A variance may be granted by the
Council after demonstration by evidence that all of the following
qualifications are met.
      (1)   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or
topographical conditions of the specific parcels of land involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience,
if the strict letter of the regulations were to be carried out.
      (2)   The conditions upon which the application for a variance is based
are unique to the parcel of land for which the variance is sought, and are not
common, generally, to other property within the same zoning classification.
      (3)   The alleged hardship is related to the requirements of this chapter
and has not been created by any persons presently or formerly having an
interest in the parcel of land.
      (4)   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
welfare or injurious to other land or improvements in the neighborhood in which
the parcel of land is located.
   (D)   Conditions and restrictions. The Planning Commission may recommend and
the Council, sitting as a Board of Adjustments and Appeals, may impose
conditions and restrictions in the granting of variances so as to ensure
compliance with the provisions of this chapter and with the spirit and intent
of the Comprehensive Plan and to protect adjacent properties.

ADULT ORIENTED ESTABLISHMENTS
§ 153.110 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (A)   Purpose.  
      (1)   It is the purpose of this subchapter to regulate adult oriented
establishments to promote the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the
citizens of the city and to establish reasonable and uniform regulation to:
         (a)   Prevent additional criminal activity within the city;
         (b)   Prevent deterioration of neighborhoods and its consequent
adverse effect on real estate values of properties within the neighborhood;
         (c)   To locate adult oriented establishments away from residential
areas, schools, churches, parks and playgrounds; and
         (d)   Prevent concentration of adult oriented establishments within
certain areas of the city.
      (2)   The provisions of this subchapter have neither the purpose nor
effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any
communicative materials, including adult oriented materials. Similarly, it is
not the intent nor effect of this subchapter to restrict or deny access by
adults to adult oriented materials protected by the First and Fourteenth
Amendments to the Constitution of the United States or to deny access by
distributors and exhibitors of adult oriented entertainment to their intended
market.
   (B)   Findings. The City Council makes the following findings about the
effect adult oriented establishments have on the character of the city’s
neighborhoods.
      (1)   In making these findings, the City Council accepts the
recommendations of staff who have reviewed the many reports, studies, judicial
decisions and experiences of other cities around the state and country
concerning the secondary effects on the areas in which the activities are
located or take place, including: The Report of the Attorney General Working
Group on Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses, dated June 6, 1989,
prepared by then State Attorney General Hubert H. Humphrey, III; the City of
St. Cloud, MN; the City of St. Paul, MN; the City of Los Angeles, CA; the City
of Austin, TX; and various other cities throughout the country that have
studied the impact of adult oriented businesses. These studies have concluded
that adult uses and sexually oriented businesses have adverse impacts on the
surrounding neighborhoods.
      (2)   Based on these studies the City Council concludes:
         (a)   Adult uses and sexually oriented businesses can contribute to an
increase in crime in the area where these businesses are located. This can be a
burden to the city crime prevention programs and law enforcement services;
         (b)   Adult uses and sexually oriented businesses can significantly
contribute to the deterioration of residential neighborhoods and can increase
neighborhood blight. These businesses also can impair the character and quality
of the residential housing in the area where these businesses are located. This
situation could reduce the amount of desirable housing and cause residents to
flee the neighborhood;
         (c)   The concentration of adult uses and sexually oriented businesses
in one area can greatly affect the area where the businesses are concentrated.
A cycle of decay can result from the influx and concentration of adult uses and
sexually oriented businesses. Others may perceive the presence of the
businesses as an indication that the area is deteriorating and results in other
businesses and residents moving or fleeing from the area. Lower property values
that can result from the concentration of these businesses, erode the city’s
tax base and contribute to blight;
         (d)   Adult uses and sexually oriented businesses can have a
dehumanizing and distractive influence on young people and students attending
schools, using parks, playgrounds and other public recreational areas. They can
interfere with or even destroy the spiritual experience of persons attending
church, synagogue or other place of worship and can interfere with or even
destroy the opportunity for solemn and respectful contemplation at cemeteries
and similar facilities;
         (e)   It is necessary to provide for the special and express
regulations of business establishments or commercial enterprises that operate
as adult body painting studios, adult book stores, adult cabarets, adult car
washes, adult companionship establishments, adult hotels or motels, adult
massage parlors or health clubs, adult motion picture arcades or theaters,
adult modeling studios, adult novelty businesses, adult saunas and similar
adult oriented services operating under various names to protect the public
health, safety and welfare, and to guard against inception and transmission of
disease;
         (f)   Businesses such as the types described in division (B)(2)(e)
above and all other similar establishments whose services include sessions
offered to adults conducted in private by members of the same or opposite sex,
and employing personnel with no specialized training, are susceptible to
operations contravening, subverting or endangering the morals of the city by
being the site of acts of prostitution, illicit sex and occasions of violent
crimes, and thus requiring close inspection, permitting and regulations;
         (g)   Control and regulation of businesses of these types, in view of
the abuses often perpetrated, require intensive efforts by the Police
Department and other departments of the city. It is necessary for the city to
provide services to all of the city without concentrating the public services
in one area. The concentrated use of city services detracts from and reduces
the level of services available to the rest of the city. Thus, these types of
establishments can diminish the ability of the city to protect and promote the
general health, welfare, morals and safety of the city;
         (h)   The limitation on the hours of operation and the regulation of
exterior appearance, including signage, of adult oriented business activities
is necessary to protect and secure neighboring uses, to control adverse noise
and traffic impacts associated with those activities, and otherwise address,
mitigate and, if possible, eliminate the adverse impacts and secondary effects
of sexual oriented business activities on the areas in which the activities are
located or taking place; and
         (i)   The City Council adopts the following land use and permitting
regulations, recognizing that it has an interest in the present and future
character of the city’s residential and commercial neighborhoods. These
regulations are to lessen the detrimental and adverse effects adult uses and
sexually oriented businesses have on adjacent land uses and to protect and
promote the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the city.

§ 154.01 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (A)   The City Council of the City of Aurora finds that there is a need for
periodic municipal inspection of residential rental units in the city to ensure
that such units meet city and state safety, health, fire, and zoning codes and
to promote the public health, safety, and welfare of the community at-large and
the residents of rental units within this city.
   (B)   The City Council of the City of Aurora finds that a municipal
registration program is appropriate to effectively enforce residential rental
unit maintenance standards and correct or prevent law violations, nuisances,
and other disturbances and disorders involving residential rental units within
this city.
   (C)   The City Council of the City of Aurora finds that an effective means
of implementing the foregoing findings is registration of all residential
rental units within the city and inspection of such units from time to time as
determined appropriate in the exercise of discretion by staff and personnel of
the city and in response to complaints involving such units.

of occupancy as originally registered is contemplated by the new owner, a new
registration application will be required.

§ 154.07 POSTING OF REGISTRATION.
   Each rental unit registration holder must post the rental unit registration
in a conspicuous spot near the front entry to the rental unit in a public
corridor, hallway, or lobby. Failure to post the registration and keep the
registration posted is a misdemeanor, but is not grounds for termination of
registration.
(Ord. 97, passed 5-2-2023)
§ 154.08 FEES.
   The fees for rental unit registration, registration renewal, late fees and
inspection may be set by ordinance or resolution of the City Council adopted

(Ord. 97, passed 5-2-2023)
§ 154.09 MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS.

enforcing this chapter.
   (D)   Written notice of a violation of this chapter may be given to the
registration holder by certified mail directed to the address of the
registration holder as shown by the Administrator's registration application
file. Said notice may contain a compliance order stating that compliance with
this chapter shall be made immediately and, in that case, the notice shall

less than 30 days, unless extended by the Administrator, based on good cause.
   (E)   A registration holder may appeal to the City Administrator the
requirements of any compliance order by filing a written appeal with the office

(Ord. 97, passed 5-2-2023)
§ 154.12 CONDUCT ON REGISTERED PREMISES.
   (A)   It is the responsibility of the registration holder to require and
ensure that occupants of the registered premises conduct themselves in such a
manner as to not cause the premises to be disorderly or to be used, occupied,
or maintained in violation of law or ordinance. For purposes of this section, a
rental unit is disorderly and in violation of law or ordinance when any of the
following activities occur in, on or at the registered premises:
      (1)   Conduct which constitutes a violation of Aurora City Code relating
to nuisances as it now exists or as hereafter amended.
      (2)   Conduct which constitutes a violation of Aurora City Code
Chapter 130, the noise ordinances as it now exists or as hereafter amended.
      (3)   Conduct which constitutes disorderly conduct in violation of M.S. §
609.72 as it now exists or as hereafter amended.
      (4)   Conduct which constitutes a violation of laws relating to
possession of controlled substances pursuant to M.S. Chapter 152 as it now
exists or as hereafter amended.
      (5)   Conduct which constitutes a violation of any city ordinance or
state law relating to minors possessing or consuming alcohol, or relating to
providing, furnishing or serving alcohol to minors, or relating to sale of
alcoholic beverages.
      (6)   Conduct which constitutes a violation of state laws or city
ordinances relating to prostitution, indecent exposure or acts related to
prostitution as defined by state law.
      (7)   Conduct which constitutes a violation of city ordinances and state
laws relating to weapons or fire arms.
      (8)   Conduct which constitutes a violation of city ordinances or state
laws relating to assault, specifically including domestic assaults and criminal
sexual conduct.
      (9)   Conduct which constitutes a violation of ordinances or laws
relating to contributing to the need for protection, services, or delinquency
of a minor as defined in M.S. § 260B.425 as it now exists or as hereafter
amended.
      (10)   Conduct which constitutes a violation of any other federal, state
or local ordinance or regulation and which is reasonably likely to threaten,
annoy or harass tenants or visitors to rental units, or to residents, visitors
or occupants of neighboring properties.
   (B)   The City Administrator shall administer this section of the chapter
and may delegate administration to a designee authorized in writing by the City
Administrator.
   (C)   If the Administrator determines that a violation of this section has
occurred, then the Administrator will give notice of the violation to the
registration holder and the renters of the rental unit, if known, and will
direct that the registration holder take steps to prevent further violations.
   (D)   If another violation of this section occurs within 90 days of the
incident for which notice was given as provided in division (C) of this
section, then the City Administrator will give notice of the violation to the
registration holder and the renters of the rental unit, if known, and will
direct that the registration holder take steps to prevent further violations.
The City Administrator will also, at that time, request that the registration
holder submit to the City Administrator, within ten days of the City
Administrator's mailing of the notice of violation provided in this section, a
report itemizing all actions taken by the registration holder in response to
all notices of violations as to the rental unit within the preceding 90 days.
   (E)   If a third violation of this section occurs within 90 days after the
last of any two or more previous violations for which notices were given
pursuant to this section, and the registration holder has not sufficiently
taken action to prevent further violations, then the rental unit registration
for the premises may be denied, revoked, suspended or not renewed.
      (1)   Action to deny, revoke, suspend or not renew a rental unit
registration may be initiated by the City Administrator who shall give to the
registration holder a written notice of hearing before the City Administrator
to consider such denial, revocation, suspension or non-renewal.
      (2)   A notice of intent to deny, revoke, suspend or not renew
registration shall specify all violations of this section and shall state the
date, time, place and purpose of the hearing provided by this subdivision.
      (3)   The hearing held pursuant to this subdivision shall occur no later
than 30 days after notice.
      (4)   Following the hearing, the City Administrator may deny, revoke,
suspend or not renew registration for all or any part of the registered
premises or may grant conditional registration upon such terms and conditions
as the Administrator finds necessary to accomplish the purpose of this chapter.
   (F)   No adverse registration action may be imposed where the violation of
this section occurred during the pendency of unlawful detainer eviction
proceedings brought under Minnesota Statutes or within 30 days of notice given
by the registration holder to a tenant to vacate the premises at which the
violation occurred. Unlawful detainer eviction proceedings or a notice to
vacate the premises, will not, however, bar adverse registration action unless
diligently pursued by the registration holder. Action to deny, revoke, suspend
or not renew registration for violation of this section may be postponed or
dismissed by the City Administrator at any time if it appears to the
Administrator that the registration holder has taken appropriate remedial
action.
   (G)   The standard of proof to be used in determinations by the City
Administrator as to conduct constituting violations under this section is a
fair preponderance of evidence in support of such a determination. It is not
necessary that criminal charges be brought to support a determination of
violation of this section or a determination that conduct constituting a
violation of this section has occurred. It is necessary, in determining a
violation of this section, that law enforcement officers be called to the
rental unit in response to a complaint and that a police report and
investigation of the same be prepared.
   (H)   For the purpose of this chapter, a violation under this section
includes violations by the rental unit renters or occupants, or by their
visitors or guests, in or at the rental unit of the renters or tenants, or in,
at or upon its curtilage, including anywhere on the property grounds and
premises of an apartment building, home or mobile home park at which the rental
unit is situated.
   (I)   Failure of a registration holder to respond to notices provided in
this section is not, by itself alone, a violation of this chapter.
(Ord. 97, passed 5-2-2023)
§ 154.13 FAILURE TO GRANT REGISTRATION, REVOCATION, SUSPENSION OR FAILURE TO
RENEW REGISTRATION.
   (A)   The city reserves the right to not register a rental unit unless it
complies with the requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   Any registration issued under this chapter is subject to the right,
which is hereby expressly reserved by the city, to deny, suspend, revoke, or
not renew the same should the registration holder or their agents, employees,
representatives, or lessees directly or indirectly operate or maintain the
rental dwellings contrary to the provisions of this chapter or any other
ordinance of the city or any special permit issued by the city, or the laws of
the State of Minnesota. Provided, however, registration shall not be denied,
suspended, revoked or not renewed if the registration holder complies with a
compliance order or orders in a reasonably timely manner as determined by the
City Administrator.
   (C)   The City Administrator shall notify the applicant that registration
has been denied, or the registration holder that registration is being
suspended, revoked or not-renewed. The suspension, revocation or non-renewal
shall occur 35 days after the date of the notification order, or at such later
date as set out in the notification.
   (D)   A determination by the City Administrator to deny, suspend, revoke or
not-renew registration of a rental unit may be appealed to the City Council by
filing with the City Administrator a written notice of appeal within 15 days of
the date on which the City Administrator mails such determination to the
applicant or registration holder. In that event, the appeal will be heard by
the City Council at its next meeting occurring at least 15 days after the
filing of the notice of appeal.
   (E)   At any appeal of a determination by the City Administrator under this
chapter, the registration holder or applicant, local property manager for the
registration holder or applicant, or an attorney representing them, may appear
and make a presentation to the City Council. The City Administrator shall
present to the City Council the basis for the determination being appealed.
After the hearing, the Council may uphold, reverse or modify the decision of
the City Administrator based upon the provisions of this chapter and upon the
protection of the public health, sanitation, safety or general welfare of the
community at-large or the residents of rental units within the city. The City
Council shall issue written findings and determination within 31 days of the
hearing, unless the Council extends that time for good cause.
   (F)   A decision of the City Council made as provided in this section may be
appealed by Writ of Certiorari to the Court of Appeals of the State of
Minnesota pursuant to its Rules of Civil Appellate Procedure.
(Ord. 97, passed 5-2-2023)
§ 154.14 SUMMARY ACTION.
   (A)   As a condition of receiving rental unit registration, each
registration holder is presumed to agree and consent that when the conduct of
any registration holder or registration holder's agent, representative,
employee or lessee, or the condition of their rental unit, or the property in
or on which it is located, is detrimental to the public health, sanitation,
safety and general welfare of the community at-large, or residents of the
rental units so as to constitute a nuisance, fire hazard, or other unsafe or
dangerous condition and thus give rise to an emergency, the City Administrator
shall have the authority to summarily condemn or close individual rental units
or such areas of the rental dwelling as the Administrator deems necessary.
Notice of summary condemnation shall be posted at the units or areas affected
and shall describe the units or areas affected. No person shall remove the
posted notice, other than the Fire Chief, East Range Police Chief, City
Administrator, or their designated representative. Any person aggrieved by the
decision or the action of the City Administrator or Fire Marshall set out in
this division, may appeal the decision following the procedures set out in this
chapter. The hearing shall be conducted in the same manner as provided in this
chapter, however, the date of the hearing may be expedited with the consent of
the registration holder.
   (B)   The decision of the City Administrator set forth in this division is
not voided by the filing of such appeal. Only after the hearing by the City
Council has been held will the decision or action of the City Administrator be
affected.
(Ord. 97, passed 5-2-2023)
§ 154.15 APPLICABLE LAWS.
   Registration holders are subject to all of the ordinances of the city and
State of Minnesota relating to rental dwellings, and this chapter shall not be
construed or interpreted to supersede or limit any other applicable ordinance
or law.
(Ord. 97, passed 5-2-2023)
§ 154.16 VIOLATIONS, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.
   (A)   Nothing in this chapter prevents the city from taking enforcement
action under any of its fire, housing, zoning, health safety, or other codes,
ordinances and state laws for violations thereof, or to seek injunctive relief
and criminal prosecution for violations of any ordinance, code, or law. Nothing
contained in this chapter prevents the city from seeking injunctive relief
against a property owner or designated property manager who fails to comply
with the terms and conditions of this chapter or to obtain an order closing
such rental units until violations of this particular chapter have been
remedied by the property owner or designated property manager.
   (B)   Violation of this chapter is a misdemeanor. Each separate day on which
a continuing violation occurs is a separate violation.

§ 156.01 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (A)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate time, place,
and manner of the operation of a cannabis business to promote the health,
safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the city and to establish
reasonable and uniform regulations to:
      (1)   Prevent unwanted criminal activity within the city;
      (2)   Prevent deterioration of neighborhoods and its consequent adverse
effect on real estate values of properties within the neighborhood; and
      (3)   To locate cannabis businesses away from residential areas, schools,
residential treatment facilities, day care facilities, parks and playgrounds.
   (B)   Findings. The City Council makes the following findings about the
effect cannabis businesses have on the character of the city's neighborhoods.
      (1)   Cannabis businesses can have a detrimental influence on young
people and students attending schools and day cares and can diminish the
enjoyment and family atmosphere of persons using parks, playgrounds and other
public recreational areas.
      (2)   Cannabis businesses can have a detrimental influence on people in
residential treatment facilities.
      (3)   M.S. Chapter 342, as it may be amended from time to time, allows
local government units to regulate cannabis businesses within city limits.
      (4)   Minnesota Statutes defines CANNABIS BUSINESSES as:
         (a)   CANNABIS MICROBUSINESS. Can grow, make, sell, and buy cannabis
(including plants and seedlings) and lower-potency hemp products. They can also
have on-site lounges where customers can use cannabis. These businesses can
grow up to 5,000 square feet of cannabis plants indoors and up to one-half acre
outdoors. This license may hold a cannabis event organizer license.
         (b)   CANNABIS MEZZOBUSINESS. Can grow, make, sell, and buy cannabis
(including plants and seedlings) and lower-potency hemp products.
Mezzobusinesses can grow up to 15,000 square feet of cannabis plants indoors
and up to one acre outdoors. This license type is available in limited
quantities, and licensees will be selected through a vetted lottery run by the
Office of Cannabis Management.
         (c)   CANNABIS CULTIVATOR. Can grow cannabis plants from seed to
maturity. They can grow up to 30,000 square feet of cannabis plants indoors and
two acres outdoors. Cultivators are allowed to harvest, package, label, and
transport fully grown cannabis plants to manufacturers. They can also package,
label, and transport seedlings. This license type is available in limited
quantities, and licensees will be selected through a vetted lottery run by the
Office of Cannabis Management.
         (d)   CANNABIS MANUFACTURER. Process raw cannabis plants into various
products, such as edibles, concentrates, wax, oils, and tinctures.
Manufacturers can buy cannabis flowers, cannabis products, and lower-potency
hemp products from other cannabis businesses. They turn these materials into
cannabis products, then package and sell them to other cannabis businesses.
This license type is available in limited quantities, and licensees will be
selected through a vetted lottery run by the Office of Cannabis Management.
         (e)   CANNABIS RETAILER. Sell packaged cannabis products to the
general public and medical patients. They can buy cannabis (including plants
and seedlings) and lower-potency hemp products from other cannabis businesses
and sell them to customers. This license type is available in limited
quantities, and licensees will be selected through a vetted lottery run by the
Office of Cannabis Management. A cannabis retailer may operate up to five
retail locations; however, no person, cooperative, or business may hold a
license to own or operate more than one cannabis retail business in one city
and three retail businesses in one county.
         (f)   CANNABIS WHOLESALER. Buy cannabis, cannabis products, and lower-
potency hemp products from cannabis businesses and then sell them to other
cannabis businesses.
         (g)   CANNABIS TRANSPORTER. Businesses that move cannabis, cannabis
products, and lower-potency hemp products between businesses.
         (h)   CANNABIS TESTING FACILITY. Receive cannabis, cannabis products,
and lower-potency hemp products from manufacturers and cultivators to test.
They ensure these products meet safety standards.
         (i)   CANNABIS EVENT ORGANIZER. Plan and host events featuring
cannabis, and may allow for the sale of cannabis, cannabis products, and lower-
potency hemp products to consumers at events like festivals (an event cannot
last more than four days). They can also provide spaces for consumers to use
cannabis. An event organizer must receive local approval, including obtaining
any necessary permits or licenses issued by a local unit of government.
         (j)   CANNABIS DELIVERY SERVICE. May purchase cannabis and lower-
potency hemp products from specific cannabis businesses and sell and deliver
those products directly to consumers.
         (k)   LOWER-POTENCY HEMP EDIBLE MANUFACTURER. Produce edibles from
hemp. These manufacturers can create, package, and label lower-potency hemp
products, and sell them to cannabis businesses. This license type cannot hold
any cannabis business licenses.
         (l)   LOWER-POTENCY HEMP EDIBLE RETAILER. Sell packaged lower-potency
hemp edibles to consumers. This license type cannot hold any cannabis business
licenses.
         (m)   MEDICAL CANNABIS CULTIVATOR. 
         (n)   MEDICAL CANNABIS PROCESSOR.
         (o)   MEDICAL CANNABIS RETAILER.
         (p)   MEDICAL CANNABIS COMBINATION BUSINESS. Can grow, manufacture,
package, label, and sell cannabis products (including cannabis plants and
seedlings) to both medical patients and adult consumers. These businesses can
package and sell medical cannabis products to other eligible cannabis
businesses. They are allowed to cultivate up to 60,000 square feet of medical
cannabis plant canopy for distribution into the medical market, and depending
upon the total amount of medical sales the year prior, up to an additional
30,000 square feet of cannabis plant canopy for distribution into the adult-use
market.
      (5)   Businesses such as the types described in division (B)(4), and all
other similar businesses, require close inspection, permitting, and
regulations.
      (6)   Control and regulation of businesses of these types, in view of the
abuses that may be perpetrated, require intensive efforts by the Police
Department and other departments of the city. It is necessary for the city to
provide services to all of the city without concentrating the public services
in one area. The concentrated use of city services detracts from and reduces
the level of services available to the rest of the city. Thus, if not properly
overseen, these types of establishments can diminish the ability of the city to
protect and promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the city.
      (7)   The limitation on the hours of operation and the regulation of
exterior appearance, including signage, of cannabis business activities is
necessary to protect and secure neighboring uses, to control adverse noise and
traffic impacts associated with those activities, and otherwise address,
mitigate and, if possible, eliminate the adverse impacts and secondary effects
of cannabis business activities on the areas in which the activities are
located or taking place.
      (8)   The City Council adopts the following land use and permitting
regulations, recognizing that it has an interest in the present and future
character of the city's residential and commercial neighborhoods. These
regulations are to lessen the potential detrimental and adverse effects
cannabis businesses may have on adjacent land uses and to protect and promote
the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the city.
