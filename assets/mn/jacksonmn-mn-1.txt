Sec. 1.01. Name and boundaries.
   The City of Jackson, in the County of Jackson, and State of Minnesota, when
this Charter takes effect, shall continue to be a municipal corporation, under
the name and style of the City of Jackson, with the same boundaries as now are
or hereafter may be established.
Sec. 1.02. Division of the City into wards.
   The City of Jackson is hereby re-districted and divided into two (2) wards
by a line beginning at the point of intersection of the westerly projection of
the center line of Sherman Street and the west boundary of the City, thence
east on the center line of Sherman Street to its intersection with the center
line of Fourth Street, thence south on the centerline of Fourth Street to its
intersection with the center line of West Ashley Street, thence east on the
center line of West Ashley and East Ashley Streets, and theeasterly projection
thereof, to the east boundary of the City. All that portion of the City lying
generally on the north side of said line is hereby designated the First Ward,
and all that portion of the City lying generally on the south side of said line
is hereby designated the Second Ward. In the event of the adoption of an
ordinance code, the administrative portion thereof shall accurately describe
ward boundaries then in effect. The council may at any time, and shall after
each federal census, consider changes in ward boundaries. But any change in
ward boundaries shall be for the sole purpose of making the wards as nearly
equal in population as practicable, so as to provide equal representation. Any
future changes in ward boundaries shall be by ordinance.
Sec. 1.03. Powers of the City.
   The City shall have all powers which it may now or hereafter be possible for
a municipal corporation in this state to exercise in harmony with the
constitutions of this state and of the United States. It is the intention of
this charter that every power which the people of the City of Jackson might
lawfully confer upon themselves, as a municipal corporation, by specific
enumeration in this charter shall be deemed to have been so conferred by the
provisions of this Section. This charter shall be construed liberally in favor
of the City, and the specific mention of particular powers in the charter shall
not be construed as limiting in any way the generality of the power herein
sought to be conferred.
Sec. 1.04. Charter a public act.
   This charter shall be a public act and need not be pleaded or proved in any
case.
CHAPTER 2: FORM OF GOVERNMENT, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES,
AND CITY AFFAIRS GENERALLY
Sec. 2.01. Form of Government.
   The form of government established by this charter in the “Mayor-Council
Plan.” The council shall exercise the legislative power of the City and
determine all matters of policy.
Sec. 2.02. Boards, committees and commissions.
   The council may establish, regulate and abolish such committees from within
its membership, and for such purposes, as it shall deem necessary or desirable.
The council may establish, regulate and abolish administrative boards to manage
activities and funds relating to parks and recreation, hospital, utilities,
airport and library. The council may establish, regulate and abolish such
advisory boards and commissions to advise the council with respect to any
municipal function or activity (including those for which it may establish
administrative boards), to investigate any subject of interest to the City, or
to perform quasijudicial functions. If the purpose for which such board or
commission is established is to continue beyond the period during which the
initial membership thereof would be expected to serve, then establishment shall
be by ordinance, otherwise it may be by resolution.
Sec. 2.03. Elective officers.
   The council shall be composed of a mayor and six aldermen, three of which
aldermen shall be elected by and from the electors of each ward in the City.
The mayor shall be elected by and from the electors of the City at large. All
members of the council shall hold their offices for terms of four years and
until their successors are elected and qualify. The council shall be judges of
the election of the mayor and aldermen.
Sec. 2.04. Incompatible offices.
   No member of the council may hold any paid municipal office or employment
for the City other than that to which he was elected, and until one year after
the expiration of his term as mayor alderman. No former member of the council
shall be appointed until one year after the expiration of the term for which he
was elected to any paid appointive office or employment under the City which
office or employment was created, or the emoluments of which were increased
during his term.
Sec. 2.05. Vacancies in the council.
   A vacancy in the council, whether it be in the office of mayor or alderman,
shall be deemed to exist in case of the failure of any person elected thereto
to qualify on or before the date of the second regular meeting of the new
council, or by reason of the death, resignation, removal from office, removal
from the City, continuous absence from the City for more than three months, or
conviction of a felony of any such person after his election, or by reason of
the failure of any councilman without good cause to perform any of the duties
of membership in the council for a period of three months. In each such case
the council shall by resolution declare such vacancy to exist and shall
forthwith appoint an eligible person to fill the same until the next regular
municipal election, when the office shall be filled for the unexpired term. In
the event an alderman moves his residence from the ward from which he was
elected to another ward within the City, no vacancy shall be deemed to exist
until the next regular City election, at which time the office shall be filled
for the unexpired term. Nor shall a change in ward boundaries as herein
provided in anyway affect the then current term of any alderman. However, a
candidate for election or re-election to the office of alderman must be a bona
fide resident of the ward from which he seeks election and meet all other
requirements of such candidacy.
Sec. 2.06. The mayor.
   The mayor shall be the presiding officer of the council, except that the
council shall choose from its members a mayor pro tern who shall hold office at
the pleasure of the council and shall serve as mayor in case of the mayor’s
temporary disability or absence. The mayor or the mayor pro tem when acting in
place of the mayor shall have a vote, as a member of the council, only in case
of a tie. He shall exercise all powers and perform all duties conferred and
imposed upon him by this charter, the ordinances of the City and the laws of
the State. He shall be recognized as the official head of the City for all
ceremonial purposes, by the courts for the purpose of serving civil process,
and by the governor for the purposes of martial law. He shall study the
operations of the City government and shall report to the council any neglect,
dereliction of duty, or waste on the part of any officer or department of the
City. He shall be the chief executive officer of the City and shall have
control of the police. In time of public danger or emergency he may take
command of the police and maintain order.
Sec. 2.07. Salaries.
   The council by ordinance may, and in the event of the adoption of an
ordinance code in the administrative portion thereof shall, fix their own
salaries as members of the governing body of the City and its chief elected
executive officer, in such amount as they deem reasonable. Provided, however,
that no change in salary shall take effect until the next succeeding City
election.
Sec. 2.08. Investigation of City affairs.
   The council and mayor, or either of them, and any officer or officers
formally authorized by them, or either of them, shall have power to make
investigations into the City’s affairs, to subpoena witnesses, administer
oaths, and compel the production of books and papers. The council shall provide
for an audit of the City’s accounts at least once a year by the State
Department in charge of such work or by certified public accountant. The
council may at any time provide for an examination or audit of the accounts of
any officer or department of the City government and it may cause to be made
any survey or research study of any subject of municipal concern.
Sec. 2.09. City employees, their wages, salaries, benefits and regulation.

matters of regulation and control.

ordinance prior to the act or omission complained of.

to in full.
Sec. 3.09. When ordinances and resolutions take effect.

shall be published in book, pamphlet or continuously revised loose-leaf form

Administrator for general distribution to the public free or at a reasonable
charge. Distribution in such published form shall be sufficient notice of any
ordinance provision not previously published or posted if a notice that copies
of the codification are available at the office of the City Administrator is
published in the official newspaper.
CHAPTER 4: NOMINATIONS AND ELECTIONS
Sec. 4.01. The regular municipal election.
   A regular municipal election shall be held on the first Tuesday after the
first Monday in November of each even-numbered year at such place or places as
the City council may designate. The City Administrator shall give at least two
weeks’ previous notice of the time and place of holding such election and of
the officers to be elected and proposals to be submitted, if any, by posting in
at least one public place in each voting precinct or by publication at least
once in the official newspaper. Failure to give such notice shall not
invalidate such election. At the regular municipal election there shall be
elected, in addition to the members of the council, such municipal judges as
may be provided by law.
Sec. 4.02. Special elections.
   The council may by resolution order a special election and provide all means
for holding it. At least two weeks’ published notice of a special election
shall be given in the official newspaper or by posting such notice in at least
one public place in each voting precinct. The procedure at such election shall
conform as nearly as possible to that prescribed for other municipal elections.
Sec. 4.03. Nominations for office.
   At any time not more than ninety days preceding any municipal election, but
at least thirty days prior to such election, any eligible person may become a
candidate for any office elective under the provisions of this charter either
by filing an affidavit with the City Administrator, or by having an application
in his behalf signed by at least five qualified voters and containing his
endorsed acceptance thereon. Such affidavit or application shall be on a form
furnished by the City and stating the full name and address of the candidate
and the office for which he is a candidate, together with the ward which he
seeks to represent unless the office is one for which election is at large. At
the time of filing such affidavit or application the City Administrator shall
collect a fee of one dollar.
Sec. 4.04. Procedure at elections.
   Subject to the provisions of this charter and applicable state laws, the
council may by ordinance further regulate the conduct of municipal elections.
Except as otherwise provided in this charter or in ordinances adopted pursuant
thereto, the general laws of the State of Minnesota pertaining to elections
shall apply to municipal elections.
Sec. 4.05. Withdrawal.
   Any candidate may withdraw not later than twelve o’clock noon of the day
following the last day for filing, by filing a written notice of withdrawal,
signed and sworn to by him, with the City Administrator.
Sec. 4.06. Canvass of elections.
   The council shall meet and canvass the election returns within five days
after any regular or special election, make full declaration of the results as
soon as possible, and file a statement thereof with the City Administrator.
Such statement shall include the following: (a) the total number of ballots
cast; (b) the total number of good ballots cast; (c) the total number of
spoiled or defective ballots cast; (d) the vote for each candidate with an
indication of those who were elected; (e) the votes on any question submitted,
if any; (f) a true copy of the ballots used; (g) the names of the judges and
clerks of the election; and (h) such other information as may seem pertinent.
All successful candidates shall forthwith be notified in writing by the City
Administrator of their election.
CHAPTER 5: INITIATIVE, REFERENDUM, AND RECALL
Sec. 5.01. Powers reserved by the people.
   The people of Jackson reserve to themselves the power, in accordance with
the provisions of this charter, to initiate and adopt any ordinance, except an
ordinance appropriating money or authorizing the levy of taxes, to require such
an ordinance when adopted by the council to be referred to the electors for
approval or disapproval, and to recall elected public officials. These powers
shall be called the initiative, the referendum, and the recall, respectively.
Sec. 5.02. Expenditures by petitioners.
   No member of any initiative, referendum, or recall committee, no circulator
of a signature paper, and no signet of any such paper, or any other person,
shall accept or offer any reward, pecuniary or otherwise, for service rendered
in connection with the circulation thereof, but this shall not prevent the
committee from paying for legal advice and from incurring an expense not to
exceed such sum as may be provided by ordinance for stationery, copying,
printing, and notaries’ fees. Any violation of the provisions of this section
is a misdemeanor.
Sec. 5.03. Further regulations.
   The council may provide by ordinance such further regulations for the
initiative, referendum, and recall, not inconsistent with this charter, as it
deems necessary.
INITIATIVE
Sec. 5.04. Initiation of measures.
   Any five electors may form themselves into a committee for the initiation of
any ordinance except as provided in Sec.
5.01. Before circulating any petition they shall file a verified copy of their
proposed ordinance with the City Administrator together with their names and
addresses as members of such committee. They shall also attach a verified copy
of the proposed ordinance to each of the signature papers herein described,
together with their names and addresses as sponsors therefor.
Sec. 5.05. Form of petition and of signature papers.
   The petition for the adoption of any ordinance shall consist of the
ordinance, together with all the signature papers and affidavits thereto
attached. Such petition shall not be complete unless signed by a number of
voters equal to at least five per cent of the total number of voters registered
on the date of the last preceding regular municipal election. All the
signatures need not be on one signature paper, but the circulator of every such
paper shall make an affidavit that each signature appended to the paper is the
genuine signature of the person whose name it purports to be. Each signature
paper shall be in substantially the following form:
   INITIATIVE PETITION
proposing an ordinance to (stating the purpose of the ordinance), a copy of
which ordinance is hereto attached. This ordinance is sponsored by the
following committee of electors:
   Name                     Address
1.   ______________________________________________________________
2.   ______________________________________________________________
3.   ______________________________________________________________
4.   ______________________________________________________________
5.   ______________________________________________________________
   The undersigned electors, understanding the terms and the nature of the
ordinance hereto attached, petition the council for its adoption, or, in lieu
thereof, for its submission to the electors for their approval.
   Name                     Address
1.   _____________________________________________________________
2.   _____________________________________________________________
3.   _____________________________________________________________
   At the end of the list of signatures shall be appended the affidavit of the
circulator mentioned above.
Sec. 5.06. Filing of petitions and action thereon.
   All the signature papers shall be filed in the office of the City
Administrator as one instrument. Within five days after the filing of the
petition, the City Administrator shall ascertain by examination the number of
electors whose signatures are appended thereto and whether this number is at
least equal to five per cent of the total number of voters registered on the
date of the last preceding regular municipal election. If he finds the petition
insufficient or irregular, he shall at once notify one or more of the committee
of sponsors of that fact, certifying the reasons for his finding. The committee
shall then be given thirty days in which to file additional signature papers
and to correct the petition in all other particulars. If at the end of that
period the petition is found to be still insufficient or irregular, the City
Administrator shall file in it his office and shall notify each member of the
committee of that fact. The final finding of the insufficiency or irregularity
of a petition shall not prejudice the filing of a new petition for the same
purpose, nor shall it prevent the council from referring the ordinance to the
electors at the next regular or any special election at its option.
Sec. 5.07. Action of council on petition.
   When the petition is found to be sufficient, the City Administrator shall so
certify to the council at its next meeting, stating the number of petitioners
and the percentage of the total number of voters which they constitute, and the
council shall at once read the ordinance and refer it to an appropriate
committee, which may be a committee of the whole. The committee or council
shall thereupon provide for public hearings upon the ordinance, after the
holding of which the ordinance shall be finally acted upon by the council not
later than sixty-five days after the date upon which it was submitted to the
council by the City Administrator. If the council fails to adopt the proposed
ordinance, or adopts it in a form different from that set forth in the petition
and unsatisfactory to the petitioners, the proposed ordinance shall be
submitted by the council to the vote of the electors at the next regular
municipal election; but if the number of signers of the petition is at least
equal to ten per cent of the total number of voters registered on the date of
the last preceding regular municipal election, the council shall call a special
election upon the measure. Such special election shall be held not less than
thirty nor more than forty-five days from the date of final action on the
ordinance by the council or after the expiration of sixty-five days from the
date of submission to the council when there has been no final action; but if a
regular election is to occur within three months, the council may submit the
ordinance at that election. If the council passes the proposed ordinance with
amendments and at least four-fifths of the committee of petitioners do not
express their dissatisfaction with such amended form by a statement filed with
the City Administrator within ten days of the passage thereof by the council,
the ordinance need not be submitted to the electors.
Sec. 5.08. Initiative ballots.
   The ballots used when voting upon any such proposed ordinance shall state
the substance of the ordinance and shall give the voters the opportunity to
vote either “yes” or “no” on the question of adoption. If a majority of the
electors voting on any such ordinance vote in favor of it, it shall thereupon
become an ordinance of the City. Any number of proposed ordinances may be voted
upon at the same election but the voter shall be allowed to vote for or against
each separately. In case of inconsistency between two initiated ordinances
approved at one election, the one approved by the higher percentage of electors
voting on the question shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.
Sec. 5.09. Initiation of charter amendments.
   Nothing in this charter shall be construed as in any way affecting the right
of the electors under the constitution and statues of Minnesota to propose
amendments to this charter.
REFERENDUM
Sec. 5.10. The referendum.
   If prior to the date when an ordinance takes effect a petition signed by
qualified electors of the City equal in number to at least fifteen per cent of
the total number of voters registered on the date of the last preceding regular
municipal election, is filed with the City Administrator requesting that any
such ordinance be repealed or be submitted to a vote of the electors, the
ordinance shall thereby be prevented from going into operation. The council
shall thereupon reconsider the ordinance at its next regular meeting, and
either repeal it or by aye or no vote re-affirm its adherence to the ordinance
as adopted. In the latter case the council shall immediately order a special
election to be held thereon, or submit the ordinance at the next regular
municipal election, pending which the ordinance shall remain suspended. If a
majority of the electors voting thereon is opposed to the ordinance, it shall
not become effective; but if a majority of the electors voting thereon favors
the ordinance, it shall go into effect immediately or on the date therein
specified.
Sec. 5.11. Referendum petitions.
   The requirements laid down in Sections 5.04 and 5.05 above as to the
formation of committees for the initiation of ordinances and as to the form of
petitions and signature papers shall apply to the referendum as far as
possible, but with such verbal changes as may be necessary. A referendum
petition shall read as follows:
   REFERENDUM PETITION
proposing the repeal of an ordinance to (stating the purpose of the ordinance),
a copy of which ordinance is hereto attached. The proposed repeal is sponsored
by the Following committee of electors:

1.   ______________________________________________________________
2.   ______________________________________________________________
3.   ______________________________________________________________   
Sec. 5.12. Referendum ballots.
   The ballots used in any referendum election shall conform to the rules laid
down in Section
5.08 of this charter for initiative ballots.
RECALL
Sec. 5.13. The recall.
   Any five electors may form themselves into a committee for the purpose of
bringing about the recall of any elected officer of the City. The committee
shall certify to the City Administrator the name of the officer whose removal
is sought, a statement of the grounds for removal in not more than two hundred
fifty words, and their intention to bring about his recall. A copy of this
certificate shall be attached to each signature paper and no signature paper
shall be put into circulation previous to such certification.
Sec. 5.14. Recall petitions.
   The petition for the recall of any official shall consist of a certificate
identical with that filed with the City Administrator together with all the
signature papers and affidavits thereto attached. All the signatures need not
be on one signature paper, but the circulator of every paper shall make an
affidavit that each signature appended to the paper is the genuine signature of
the person whose name it purports to be. Each signature paper shall be in
substantially the following form:
   RECALL PETITION
Proposing the recall of    from his office as which recall is sought for the
reasons set forth in the attached certificate. This movement is sponsored by
the following committee of electors:
   Name                     Address
1.   ______________________________________________________________
2.   ______________________________________________________________
3.   ______________________________________________________________
4.   ______________________________________________________________
5.   ______________________________________________________________
   The undersigned electors, understanding the nature of the charges against
the officer herein sought to be recalled, desire the holding of a recall
election for that purpose.
   Name                     Address
1.   ______________________________________________________________
2.   ______________________________________________________________
3.   ______________________________________________________________
   At the end of the list of signatures shall be appended the affidavit of the
circulator.
Sec. 5.15. Filing of petition.
   Within thirty days after the filing of the original certificate, the
committee shall file the completed petition in the office of the City
Administrator. The City Administrator shall examine the petition within the
next five days, and if he finds it irregular in any way, or finds that the
number of signers is less than a number of voters at least equal to twenty-five
per cent of the total number of voters registered on the date of the last
preceding regular municipal election, he shall so notify one or more members of
the committee. The committee shall then be given ten days in which to file
additional signature papers and to correct the petition in all other respects,
but they may not change the statement of the grounds upon which the recall is
sought. If at the end of that time the City Administrator finds the petition
still insufficient or irregular, he shall notify all the members of the
committee to that effect and shall file the petition in his office. No further
action shall be taken thereon.
Sec. 5.16. Recall election.
   If the petition or amended petition is found sufficient, the City
Administrator shall transmit to the council without delay, and shall also
officially notify the person sought to be recalled of the sufficiency of the
petition and of the pending action. The council shall at its next meeting, by
resolution, provide for the holding of a special recall election not less than
thirty nor more than forty-five days after such meeting, but if any other
election is to occur within sixty days after such meeting, the council may in
its discretion provide for the holding of the recall election at that time.
Sec. 5.17. Procedure at recall election.
   The City Administrator shall include with the published or posted notice of
the election the statement of the grounds for the recall and also, in not more
than five hundred words, the answer of the officer concerned in justification
of his course in office. Candidates to succeed the officer to be recalled shall
be nominated in the usual way, and the election shall be conducted as far as
possible, in accordance with the usual procedure in municipal elections.
Sec. 5.18. Form of recall ballot.
   Unless the officer whose removal is sought resigns within ten days after the
receipt by the council of completed recall petition, the form of the ballot at
such election shall be as near as may be:
   “Shall _________________________________ be recalled?” the name of the
officer whose recall is sought being inserted in the blank, and the electors
shall be permitted to vote separately “yes” or “no” upon this question. The
ballot shall also contain the names of the candidates to be voted upon to fill
the vacancy, in case the recall is successful, under the caption: “Candidates
to fill the place of ______________________________________ , if recalled”; but
the officer whose recall is sought shall not himself be a candidate upon such
ballot. If a majority of those voting on the question of recall vote in favor
of recall, the official shall be thereby removed from office, and the candidate
who receives the highest number of votes for his place shall be elected thereto
for the remainder of the unexpired term. If the officer sought to be recalled
resigns within ten days after the receipt by the council of the completed
recall petition, the form of ballot at the election shall be the same, as
nearly as possible, as the form in use at a regular municipal election.
CHAPTER 6: ADMINISTRATION OF CITY AFFAIRS
Sec. 6.01. The council.
   The council shall be the chief administrative body of the City. Its
administrative powers may be enforced by an Administrative Code enacted in the
form of an ordinance, or Administrative Chapter in an ordinance codification.
The City Administrator shall be bound by any such legislation, but the council
may delegate administrative authority to him without such administrative
legislation.
Sec. 6.02. Powers and duties of the council.
   It shall be the duty of the council to act in the best interests of the
entire City and it shall have all powers to so act, except as limited by
statute or the provisions of this chapter.
Sec. 6.03. Departments of administration.
   The council may create such departments, divisions, and bureaus for the
administration of the City’s affairs as may seem necessary, and from time to
time alter their powers and organization. The Administrative Code, or
Administration Chapter of a codification, shall create, limit, and regulate all
departments, divisions, and bureaus.
Sec. 6.04. Purchases and contracts.
   The Council shall be the chief purchasing agent of the City. All City
purchases and contracts shall be made by the Council when the amount of the
purchase or contract does not exceed Two Thousand Five Hundred Dollars. All
other purchases shall be made as provided in Section
6.05. All contracts and instruments of any kind to which the City is a party
shall be signed by the mayor and the City Administrator on behalf of the City
and shall be executed in the name of the City.
Sec. 6.05. Contracts; how let.
   In all cases of work to be done by contract, or of the purchase of chattels
of any kind, where the amount involved is more than Two Thousand Five Hundred
Dollars, unless the council shall by an emergency ordinance otherwise provided,
the council shall advertise for bids in such manner as may be designated by the
council. Contracts of this magnitude shall be let only by the council to the
lowest responsible bidder. The council may, however, reject any and all bids.
Nothing contained in this section shall prevent the council from contracting
for the doing of work with patented processes, or from the purchasing of
patented appliances. Subject to the provisions of this charter, the council may
by ordinance adopt further regulations for the making of bids and the letting
of contracts. All contracts shall be let to the lowest responsible bidder. The
“lowest responsible bidder” shall be interpreted as giving the council the
right to accept any bid which it determines is most advantageous to the City.
CHAPTER 7: TAXATION AND FINANCES
Sec. 7.01. Council to control finances.
   The council shall have the full authority over the financial affairs of the
City, and shall provide for the collection of all revenues and other assets,
the auditing and settlement of accounts, and the safekeeping and disbursement
of public moneys, and in the exercise of sound discretion shall make
appropriations for the payment of all liabilities and expenses. The council
may, by ordinance, provide for any means of auditing and allowing accounts
which are otherwise permitted by law.
Sec. 7.02. Fiscal years.
   The fiscal year of the City shall be the calendar year.
Sec. 7.03. System of taxation.
   Subject to the State constitution, and except as forbidden by it or by State
legislation, the council shall have full power to provide by ordinance for a
system of local taxation. In the taxation of real and personal property as
such, the City shall conform as fully as possible to the general State law as
to the assessment of such property and the collection of such taxes.
Sec. 7.04. Board of equalization.
   The council shall constitute a board of equalization to equalize assessments
of property for taxation purposes according to law.
Sec. 7.05. Preparation of the annual budget.
   The City Administrator shall prepare the estimates for the annual budget.
The budget shall be by funds and shall include all the funds of the City,
except the funds made up of proceeds of bond issues, utility funds, and special
assessment funds, and may include any of such funds at the discretion of the
council. The estimates of expenditures for each fund budgeted shall be arranged
for each department or division of the City under the following heads:
   (1)   ordinary expenses (for operation, maintenance, and repairs);
   (2)   payment of principal and interest on bonds and other fixed charges;
   (3)   capital outlays (for new construction, new equipment, and all
improvements of a lasting character). Ordinary expenses shall be subdivided
into:
      (a)   salaries and wages, with a list of all salaried offices and
positions, including the salary allowance and the number of persons holding
each;
      (b)   other expenses, with sufficient detail to be readily understood.
   All increases and decreases shall be clearly shown. In parallel columns
shall be added the amounts granted and the amounts expended under similar heads
for the past two completed fiscal years and the current fiscal year, actual to
date and estimated for the balance of the year. In addition to the estimates of
expenditures, the budget shall include for each budgeted fund a statement of
the revenues which have accrued for the past two completed fiscal years with
the amount collected and the uncollected balances together with the same
information, based in so far as necessary on estimates, for the current fiscal
year, and an estimate of the revenues for the ensuing fiscal year. The
statement of revenues for each year shall specify the following items: sums
derived from (a) taxation, (b) fees, (c) fines, (d) interest, (e)
miscellaneous, not included in the foregoing, (f) sales and rental, (g) earning
of public utilities and other public service enterprises, (h) special
assessments, and (i) sales of bonds and other obligations. Such estimates shall
be printed or typewritten and there shall be sufficient copies for each member
of the council, for the City Administrator, and three, at least, to be posted
in public places in the City. The estimates shall be submitted to the council
at its first regular meeting in September and shall be made public. The City
Administrator may submit with the estimates such explanatory statement or
statements as he may deem necessary.
Sec. 7.06. Passage of the budget.
   The budget shall be the principal item of business at the first regular
monthly meeting of the council in September and the council shall hold
adjourned meetings from time to time until all the estimates have been
considered. The meetings shall be so conducted as to give interested citizens a
reasonable opportunity to be heard. The budget estimates shall be read in full
and the City Administrator shall explain the various items thereof as fully as
may be deemed necessary by the council. The annual budget finally agreed upon
shall set forth in detail the complete financial plan of the City for the
ensuing fiscal year for the funds budgeted and shall be signed by the majority
of the council when adopted. It shall indicate the sums to be raised and from
what sources and the sums to be spent and for what purposes according to
section 7.05. The total sum appropriated shall be less than the total estimated
revenue by a safe margin. The council shall adopt the budget not later than the
first week of October by a resolution which shall set forth the total for each
budgeted fund and each department with such segregation as to objects and
purposes of expenditures as the council deems necessary for purposes of budget
control. The council shall also adopt a resolution levying whatever taxes it
considers necessary within statutory limits for the ensuing year for each fund.
The tax levy resolution shall be certified to the county auditor in accordance
with law not later than October 10. At the beginning of the fiscal year the
sums fixed in the budget resolution shall be and become appropriated for the
several purposes named in the budget resolution and no other.
Sec. 7.07. Enforcement of the City budget.
   It shall be the duty of the City Administrator to enforce strictly the
provisions of the budget. He shall not approve any order upon the City treasury
for any expenditure unless an appropriation has been made in the budget
resolution, nor for any expenditure covered by the budget resolution unless
there is a sufficient unexpended balance left after deduction of the total past
expenditures and the sum of all outstanding orders and incumbrance. No officer
or employee of the City shall place any order or make any purchase except for a
purpose and to the amount authorized in the budget resolution. Any obligation
incurred by any person in the employ of the City for any purpose not authorized
in the budget resolution or for any amount in excess of the amount therein
authorized shall be a personal obligation upon the person incurring the
expenditure.
Sec. 7.08. Alterations in the budget.
   After the budget resolution has been adopted, the council shall have no
power to increase the amounts fixed in the budget resolution, by the insertion
of new items or otherwise, beyond the estimated revenues, unless the actual
receipts exceed the estimates and then not beyond the actual receipts. The
council may at any time, by resolution approved by a majority of its members,
reduce the sums appropriated for any purpose by the budget resolutions, or by
unanimous vote, authorize the transfer of sums from unincumbered balances of
appropriations in the budget resolution to other purposes.
Sec. 7.09. Emergency appropriation in budget.
   The council may include an emergency appropriation as a part of the budget
but not to exceed ten per cent of the total budget. A transfer from the
emergency appropriation to any other appropriation shall be made only by
unanimous vote, of the council and shall be used only for the purposes
designated by the council.
Sec. 7.10. Disbursements, how made.
   No disbursement of City funds shall be made except by check signed by the
Mayor and City Administrator and specifying the purpose for which the
disbursement is made and the fund from which it is drawn. No such check shall
be issued until there is money to the credit of the fund from which it is to be
paid sufficient to pay it together with all outstanding encumbrances upon the
fund. No such check shall be issued until the claim to which it relates has
been supported by an itemized bill, payroll, or time-sheet approved and signed
by the responsible City officer who vouches for its correctness and
reasonableness. The City Administrator shall note on each contract requiring
the payment of money by the City the particular fund out of which it is to be
paid. The council may by ordinance make further regulations for the safekeeping
and disbursement of the funds of the City.
Sec. 7.11. Funds to be kept.
   Subd. 1. There shall be maintained in the City treasury the funds provided
for in the following subdivisions.
   Subd. 2. A general fund for the payment of such expenses of the City as the
council may deem proper. Into this fund shall be paid all money not provided
herein or by statute to be paid into any other fund.
   Subd. 3. A debt service fund, into which shall be paid all receipts from
taxes or other sources for the payment of principal and interest of all
obligations issued by the City except bonds issued on account of any local
improvement to be financed wholly or partly by special assessments and bonds
issued on account of any municipally owned utility. Out of this fund shall be
paid the principal and interest of such obligations when due. Any surplus in
such fund not needed immediately for debt service may be invested under the
direction of the council in such securities as are authorized by statute for
the investment of such funds; and such investments may be liquidated at any
time. To the extent required by law, a separate account in the debt service
fund shall be maintained for each issue of City obligations.
   Subd. 4. A bond fund, into which shall be paid and from which shall be
disbursed, the proceeds of all bonds issued by the City except bonds issued on
account of any local improvement to be financed wholly or partly by special
assessments and bonds issued on account of any municipally owned utility. A
separate bond account shall be kept for each issue of such bonds.
   Subd. 5. A special assessment fund, which shall be used to finance local
improvements to be paid for, in whole or in part, from special assessments
against benefited property. There shall be paid into this fund: (1) collections
of special assessments, with interest, levied against benefited property; (2)
proceeds of bonds or warrants sold by the City to finance local improvements to
be paid for in whole or in part, by special assessments; and the proceeds of
inter-fund loans; (3) amounts from other City funds representing either (a)
apportionments of costs against the City at large, (b) benefit assessments
against City property, or (c) appropriations to maintain the integrity of the
fund. There shall be paid out of this fund: (1) all expenses and costs of the
improvement projects financed through the fund; (2) the redemption of all
special assessment fund obligations, with interest, at or before maturity; and
any inter-fund loans; and (3) abatements of assessments and refunds of receipts
in error. The council shall maintain the integrity of this fund by
appropriation from tax funds if necessary, and in addition may by ordinance
create and maintain in the fund a cash reserve sufficient for working capital
purposes. In order to anticipate the collection of special assessments and the
municipal share of the cost of a local improvement, the council may by a
majority vote issue and sell obligations pledging the full faith and credit of
the City, or pledging only special assessments, in such amounts and maturities
as it may determine; but the aggregate amount of such obligations outstanding
at any time shall not exceed the sum of the following: (1) all assessments
levied and uncollected; (2) cost of work in progress to be financed in whole or
in part by special assessments, and (3) the cash reserve for working capital as
previously determined by ordinance. In order that the fund may be administered
on a self-sustaining basis, all local improvement projects financed through it
shall upon completion be certified by the City Administrator as to total cost,
which shall thereupon be apportioned by the council either as assessments
against benefited property or as amounts due from other City funds. Amounts
apportioned against other City funds shall be due when installments of special
assessments levied for the same project are due, corresponding assessment rolls
shall be charged interest as in the case of assessments and shall be credited
to the fund, with any interest due, when collected. To the extent required by
law, a tax for the City’s share of the cost shall be levied before any
obligations against the funds are issued and sold. When a local improvement to
be financed wholly or partly from special assessment is undertaken under any
applicable statute, any provision of this subdivision inconsistent with the
statute shall not apply.
   Subd. 6. A public utility fund into which shall be paid all money derived
from the sale of obligations issued on account of any municipally owned utility
and all money derived from the sale of utility services, and from the sale of
any property acquired for or used in connection with any such utility. There
shall be paid out of this fund the cost of the purchase, construction,
operation, maintenance and repair of such utility, including the principal of
and interest upon obligations which have been or shall be issued on its
account. Separate accounts within the public utility fund shall be kept for all
utilities which are operated separately.
   Subd. 7. In addition to the foregoing funds, there may be maintained in the
City treasury, whenever the council deems it advisable, the following funds:
      (a)   One or more working capital or revolving funds, for financing self-
sustaining activities not accounted for through other funds;
      (b)   One or more trust and agency funds, for the care and disbursement
of money received and held by the City as trustee or custodian or in the
capacity of any agent for individuals or other governmental units;
      (c)   Such other funds as may be required by statute or ordinance.
   Subd. 8. In lieu of establishing any of the types of funds specified in
Subd. 7, the council may provide for the recording of operations or activities
for which the use of such funds might be suitable through the maintenance of
separate accounts in any appropriate fund already established. The council
shall have full power by ordinance or resolution to make inter-fund loans,
except from trust and agency funds, as it may deem necessary and appropriate
from time to time.
Sec. 7.12. Accounts and reports.
   The City Administrator shall be the chief accounting officer of the City and
of every branch thereof, and the council may prescribe and enforce proper
accounting methods, forms, blanks, and other devices consistent with the law,
this charter, and the ordinances adopted in accord therewith. He shall submit
to the council a statement each month showing the amount of money in the City
treasury, the status of all funds, the amount spent are chargeable against each
of the annual budget allowances and the balances left in each, and such other
information about the finances of the City as the council may require. Once
each year, on or before the last day of February, the City Administrator shall
submit a report to the council covering the entire financial operations of the
City for the past year. This report shall show: the actual receipts and
expenditures, omitting duplications and stating the cash balance at the
beginning of the last fiscal year and at the close; the total outlays for
operation and maintenance, and the total capital outlays; the condition of each
of the funds; the total receipts by sources and the total expenditures by
general purposes; the total outstanding bonds and debts of the City, when due,
the amount of new bonds issued and the amount redeemed, and the interest rate
of each; the condition of all the annual budget allowances; and inventory of
all the property owned by the City; and such further information as the City
Administrator deems advisable or the council requires.
Sec. 7.13. City indebtedness.
   Except as provided in Secs.
7.14 and
7.15, no obligations shall be issued to pay current expenses but the council
may issue and sell obligations for any other municipal purposes in accordance
with law and within the limits prescribed by law. Except in the case of
obligations for which election is not required by this charter or by state law,
no such obligations shall be issued and sold without the approval of a majority
of the electors of the City voting thereon at a general or special election.
Sec. 7.14. Tax anticipation certificates.
   At any time after January 1st following the making of an annual tax levy,
the council may issue certificates of indebtedness in anticipation of the
collection of taxes levied for any fund and not yet collected. The total amount
of certificates issued against any fund for any year with interest thereon
until maturity shall not exceed ninety per cent of the total current taxes for
the fund uncollected at the time of issuance plus the cash on hand in the fund.
Such certificates shall be issued on such terms and conditions as the council
may determine and shall bear interest at a rate not to exceed the maximum rate
permitted by law, but they shall become due and payable not later than the 1st
day of April of the year following their issuance. The proceeds of the tax
levied for the fund against which tax anticipation certificates are issued and
the full faith and credit of the City shall be irrevocably pledged for the
redemption of the certificates in the order of their issuance against the fund.
Sec. 7.15. Emergency debt certificates.
   If in any year the receipts from taxes or other sources should from some
unforeseen cause become insufficient for the ordinary expenses of the City, or
if any calamity or other public emergency should subject the City to the
necessity of making extraordinary expenditures, the council may by ordinance
issue and sell on such terms and in such manner as the council determines
emergency debt certificates to run not to exceed two years and to bear interest
at not more than six per cent per year. A tax sufficient to pay principal and
interest on such certificates with the margin required by law shall be levied
as required by law. The ordinance authorizing an issue of such emergency debt
certificates shall state the nature of the emergency and be approved by
unanimous vote of the council. It may be passed as an emergency ordinance.
CHAPTER 8: PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS AND SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS
Sec. 8.01. Power to make improvements and levy assessments.
   The City shall have the power to make any and every type of public
improvement not forbidden by the laws of this State and to levy special
assessments to pay all or any part of the cost of such improvements as are of a
local character. The amounts assessed to benefited property to pay for such
local improvements may equal the cost of the improvement, including all costs
and expenses connected therewith, with interest, until paid, but shall in no
case exceed the benefits to the property.
Sec. 8.02. Assessments for services.
   The council may provide by ordinance that the cost of sprinkling, snow or
rubbish removal, or of any other service to streets, sidewalks, or other public
property, or the costs of any services to other property undertaken by the City
may be assessed against the property benefited and collected in like manner as
are special assessments.
Sec. 8.03. Local improvements regulations.
   After this charter takes effect local improvements commenced prior thereto
shall be completed and assessments may be levied and securities issued for the
financing thereof as prescribed by the law (or charter provision) applicable
thereto. The council may prepare and adopt a comprehensive ordinance
prescribing the procedure which shall be followed thereafter in making all
local improvements and levying assessments therefor. Such ordinance shall
supercede all other provisions of the law on the same subject and may be
amended only by unanimous vote of the council. In the absence of such ordinance
all local improvements may be made and assessments levied therefor as
prescribed by an applicable law.
Sec. 8.04. Public works; how performed.
   Public works, including all local improvements, may be constructed,
extended, repaired, and maintained either directly by day labor or by contract.
The City shall require contractors to give bonds for the protection of the City
and all persons furnished labor and materials pursuant to the laws of the
State.
CHAPTER 9: EMINENT DOMAIN
Sec. 9.01. Power to acquire property.
   The City may acquire, by purchase, gift, devise or condemnation and
property, corporal or incorporeal, either within or without its corporate
boundaries, which may be needed by the City for any public use or purpose.
Easements for slopes, fills, sewers, building lines, poles, wires, pipes, and
conduits for water, gas, heat, and power may be acquired by gift, devise,
purchase or condemnation in the manner provided by law.
Sec. 9.02. Proceedings in acquiring property.
   The necessity for the taking of any property by the City shall be determined
by the council and shall be declared by a resolution which shall describe such
property as nearly as may be and state the use to which it is to be devoted. In
acquiring property by exercising the power of eminent domain, the City shall
proceed according to the laws of this State, except as otherwise provided in
this chapter.
Sec. 9.03. Payment of award.
   When an award of damages is confirmed in any proceeding for the taking of
property for public use by right of eminent domain, or whenever the court
renders final judgment in any appeal from any such award and the time for
abandoning such proceedings by the City has expired, the City shall, as
provided by statute, pay the amount of the award or judgment of the court, as
the case may be; and if not so paid, judgment therefor may be had against the
City.
Sec. 9.04. City may abandon proceedings.
   The City may, by resolution of the council at any stage of the condemnation
proceedings or at any time within thirty days after final determination
thereof, abandon such proceedings as to all or any part of the property sought
to be acquired and shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses thereof,
including fees of counsel.
Sec. 9.05. City may take entire plant.
   If the City condemns a public utility which is operated at the time of the
commencement of the condemnation proceedings as one property or as one system,
it shall not be necessary in the condemnation proceedings or any of the
proceedings of the council, to describe or treat separately the different kinds
of property composing such system; but all of the property, lands, articles,
franchises, and rights which comprise such system may, unless otherwise ordered
by the court, be treated together as one property and an award for the whole
property in one lump sum may be made by the commissioners or other body
assessing the damages on condemnation. This does not prevent the City, when the
plant and property are separable into distinct parts, from acquiring only such
part or parts thereof as may be necessary in the public interest.
CHAPTER 10: FRANCHISES
Sec. 10.01 Franchises defined.
   The word “franchise” as used in this chapter shall be construed to mean any
special privileges granted to any person, co-partnership, or corporation, in,
over, upon, or under any of the highways or public places of the City, whether
such privilege has heretofore been granted by it or by the State of Minnesota,
or shall hereafter be granted by the City or by the State of Minnesota.
Sec. 10.02. Franchise ordinances.
   The council may grant franchises by ordinance adopted by a three-fourths
vote, but in no case shall a franchise be granted by an emergency ordinance.
Franchise rights shall always be subject to the superior right of the public to
the use of streets and public places. All corporations, co-partnerships, or
persons desiring to make an especially burdensome use of the streets or public
places, inconsistent with the public’s right in such places, or desiring the
privilege of placing in, over, upon, or under any street or public place any
permanent or semi-permanent fixtures for the purpose of construction or
operating street or other railway, telegraphing, or transmitting electricity,
or transporting by pneumatic tubes, or for furnishing to the City or its
inhabitants or any portion thereof, transportation facilities, water, light,
heat, power, gas, telephone, or any other such utility, or for any other
purpose, shall be required to obtain a franchise before proceeding to make such
use of the streets or public places or before proceeding to place such fixtures
in such places.
Sec. 10.03. Term of franchise limited.
   No perpetual franchise shall ever be granted, nor shall any franchise be
granted for a longer period than twenty-five years.
Sec. 10.04. Power of regulation reserved.
   The City shall have the right and power to regulate and control the exercise
by any corporation, co-partnership, or person, of any franchise however
acquired, and whether such franchise has been heretofore granted by it or by
the State of Minnesota, or shall hereafter be granted by the City or by the
State, of Minnesota.
Sec. 10.05. Regulation of rates and charges.
   All corporations, co-partnerships, and persons exercising franchises in the
City shall give courteous, efficient, and adequate service at reasonable rates.
A reasonable rate shall be construed to be one which will with efficient
management, normally yield, above all operating expenses and depreciation, a
fair return upon all money honestly and efficiently invested in the plant and
equipment used by the company in the public service within the City. This shall
not be construed as a guarantee of a return and in no case shall there be any
return upon franchise value. Within these limits, the determination of the
maximum price or rate to be charged by any company for service rendered to the
City or to any person or persons within the City shall be made, if possible, by
direct negotiations between the company and the council at public hearings. In
case of failure to reach an agreement by this method, the council shall, not
less than thirty days before the expiration of any existing rate schedule or
agreement, appoint an expert as its representative; the company shall appoint a
representative; and these two shall by mutual agreement select a third person,
preferably an expert in valuation and rate making, who shall together
constitute a board of arbitration. This board shall report its findings as soon
as possible and the rate which it shall agree upon by a majority vote shall be
the legal rate, subject to revision by any court of competent jurisdiction.
Schedules or rates thus fixed shall be as flexible as may be. The City and the
company may, by mutual agreement, revise existing schedules of rates at any
time, proceeding in each case as provided for the original rates.
Sec. 10.06. Conditions in every franchise.
   All conditions specified in this section shall be a part of every franchise
even though they may not be expressly contained in the franchise:
      (a)   That the grantee shall be subject to and will perform on its part
all the terms of Sections
10.01 to 10.08, inclusive, as well as all other pertinent provisions of this
charter.
      (b)   That the grantee shall in no case claim or pretend to exercise any
power to fix fares, rates, and charges; but that such fares, rates, and charges
shall at all times be just, fair and reasonable for the services rendered and
shall in all cases be fixed and from time to time changed in the manner
provided in Section
10.05 of this charter.
      (c)   That the council shall have the right to require reasonable
extensions of any public service system from time to time, and to make such
rules and regulations as may be required to secure adequate and proper service
and to provide sufficient accommodations for the public.
      (d)   That the grantee shall not issue any capital stock on account of
the franchise or the value thereof, and that the grantee shall have no right to
receive upon condemnation proceedings brought by the City to acquire the public
utility exercising such franchise, any return on account of the franchise or
its value.
      (e)   That no sale or lease of said franchise shall be effective until
the assignee or lessee shall have filed in the office of the City Administrator
an instrument, duly executed, reciting the facts of such sale or lease,
accepting the terms of the franchise, and agreeing to perform all the
conditions required of the grantee thereunder. The assignee or lessee shall
also file a bond in such amount and with such conditions as the council may
require, which bond shall run to the City as obligee, with sureties
satisfactory to the council, and shall obligate the assignee or lessee to
discharge all obligations and liabilities imposed by said franchise.
      (f)   That every grant in said franchise containing permission for the
erection of poles, masts, or other fixtures in the streets and for the
attachment of wires thereto, or for the laying of tracks in, or of pipes or
conduits under the streets or public places, or for the placing in the streets
or other public places of any permanent or semi-permanent fixtures whatsoever,
shall be subject to the conditions that the council shall have the power to
require such alterations therein, or relocation or rerouting thereof, as the
council may at any time deem necessary for the safety, health, or convenience
of the public, and particularly that it shall have the power to require the
removal of poles, masts, and other fixtures bearing wires and the placing under
ground of all wires for whatsoever purpose used.
      (g)   Every franchise and every extension or renewal of such franchise,
shall contain a provision for its acceptance in writing by the grantee within
thirty days after its passage by the council and before its submission to a
vote of the people in case of a referendum. No such franchise shall be binding
upon the City until its acceptance by the grantee. Such acceptance shall be
construed to be an acceptance of, and consent to, all the terms, conditions,
and limitation contained in the ordinance granting the franchise as well as of
the provisions of this charter.
      (h)   Every franchise shall contain a provision granting the City the
right to acquire the same in accordance with statute.
   Whenever two hundred legal voters of the City petition the council to
acquire a franchise, the council shall within thirty days after the
presentation of such petition, submit the same to the voters of the City, at an
election for that purpose, provided that if any other municipal election is to
occur within ninety days after the presentation of said petition, the council
may in its discretion submit said matter at such election. The violation by the
holder of any franchise of any of the express provisions prescribed by this
section shall be a sufficient cause for the forfeiture of the franchise by a
resolution of the council.
Sec. 10.07. Further provisions of franchises.
   The enumeration and specification of particular matters which must be
included in every franchise or renewal or extension thereof, shall not be
construed as impairing the right of the City to insert in any such franchise or
renewal or extension thereof such other and further conditions and restrictions
as the council may deem proper to protect the City’s interests, nor shall
anything contained in this charter limit any right or power possessed by the
City over existing franchises.
CHAPTER 11: PUBLIC OWNERSHIP AND OPERATION OF UTILITIES
Sec. 11.01. Acquisition and operation of utilities.
   The City may own and operate any gas, water, heat, power, light, telephone
or other public utility for supplying its own needs for utility service or for
supplying utility service to private consumers or both. It may construct all
facilities reasonably needed for that purpose and may acquire any existing
utility properties so needed; but no proceedings to acquire any such public
utility shall be consummated unless the City has the money in the treasury to
pay for acquisition or has made provision for paying for the property proposed
to be acquired. The operation of all public utilities owned by the City shall
be under the supervision of the council.
Sec. 11.02. Rates and finances.
   Upon recommendations made by the City Administrator or upon its own motion,
the council may fix rates, fares, and prices, for municipal utilities but such
rates, fares and prices shall be just and reasonable. In like manner the
council may prescribe the time and manner in which payments for all such
services shall be made, and may make such other regulations as may be
necessary, and prescribe penalties for violation of such regulations.
Sec. 11.03. Purchase in bulk.
   The council may, in lieu of providing for the local production of gas,
electricity, water, and other utilities, purchase the same in bulk and resell
them to local consumers at such rates as it may fix.
Sec. 11.04. Lease of plant.
   The council may, if the public interests will be served thereby, contract
with any responsible person, co-partnership, or corporation, for the operation
of any utility owned by the City, upon such rentals and conditions as it may
deem necessary; but such contract shall be embodied in and let only by an
ordinance approved by unanimous vote of the council and subject to popular
referendum. Such ordinance shall not be an emergency ordinance. In no case
shall such contract be for a longer term than ten years.
Sec. 11.05. Public utility. How sold.
   No public utility owned by the City shall be sold or otherwise disposed of
by the City unless the full terms of the proposition of sale or other
disposition are embodied in an ordinance approved by a majority of the electors
voting thereon at a general or special election. In the case of a water works
or light plant, any sale, lease, or abandonment shall be subject, in addition,
to the requirements of State law.
CHAPTER 12: MISCELLANEOUS AND TRANSITORY PROVISIONS
Sec. 12.01. Official publications.
   The council shall annually designate a legal newspaper of general
circulation in the City as its official newspaper in which shall be published
ordinances and other matters required by law to be so published as well as such
other matters as the council may deem it in the public interest to have
published in this manner.
Sec. 12.02. Oath of office.
   Every officer of the City shall, before entering upon the duties of his
office, take and subscribe an oath of office in substantially the following
form: “I do solemnly swear (or affirm) to support the constitution of the
United States and of this State and to discharge faithfully the duties
devolving upon me as (mayor, alderman, City Administrator, etc.) of the City of
Jackson to the best of my judgment and ability.”
Sec. 12.03. City officers not to be interested in contracts.
   Except as otherwise permitted by law, no officer of the city who is
authorized to take part in any manner in any contract with the City shall
voluntarily have a personal financial interest in such contract or personally
benefit financially therefrom.
Sec. 12.04. Official bonds.
   The City Administrator, and such other officers or employees of the City as
may be provided for by ordinance, shall each before entering upon the duties of
his respective office or employment, give a corporate surety bond to the City
in such form and in such amount as may be fixed by the council as security for
the faithful performance of his official duties and the safekeeping of the
public funds. Such bonds may be either individual or blanket bonds in the
discretion of the council. They shall be approved by the City council, and
approved as to form by the City Attorney, and filed with the City
Administrator. The provisions of the laws of the State relating to official
bonds not inconsistent with this charter shall be complied with. The premiums
on such bonds shall be paid by the City.
Sec. 12.05. Sale of real property.
   No real property of the City shall be disposed of except by ordinance. The
proceeds of any sale of such property shall be used as far as possible to
retire any outstanding indebtedness incurred by the City in the purchase,
construction, or improvement of this or other property used for the same public
purpose. If there is no such outstanding indebtedness, the council may by
ordinance or resolution designate some other public use for the proceeds.
Sec. 12.06. Vacation of streets.
   The council may by resolution approved by unanimous vote, vacate any street
or alley or part thereof within the City. Such vacation may be made only after
published or posted notice and an opportunity has been given to affected
property owners and the public to be heard, and upon such further terms and by
such procedure as the council by ordinance may prescribe. A notice of
completion of such proceedings shall be filed with the proper county officers
in accordance with law.
Sec. 12.07. City to succeed to rights and obligations of former City.
   The City shall succeed to all the property, rights, and privileges, and
shall be subject to all the legal obligations of the City under the former
charter.
Sec. 12.08. Effective date of this charter and terms of present officers.
   This charter shall take effect on the date or at the times stated in the

§ 10.20 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Any Licensed Peace Officer of the city’s Police Department, or the
County Sheriff, or any Deputy Sheriff shall have the authority to enforce any
provision of this code.
   (B)   As permitted by M.S. § 626.862, as it may be amended from time to
time, the City Clerk shall have the authority to administer and enforce this
code. In addition, under that statutory authority, certain individuals
designated within the code or by the Clerk or City Council shall have the
authority to administer and enforce the provisions specified. All and any
person or persons designated may issue a citation in lieu of arrest or
continued detention to enforce any provision of the code.
   (C)   The City Clerk and any city official or employee designated by this
code who has the responsibility to perform a duty under this code may with the
permission of a licensee of a business or owner of any property or resident of
a dwelling, or other person in control of any premises, inspect or otherwise
enter any property to enforce compliance with this code.
   (D)   If the licensee, owner, resident, or other person in control of a
premises objects to the inspection of or entrance to the property, the City
Clerk, Peace Officer, or any employee or official charged with the duty of
enforcing the provisions of this code may, upon a showing that probable cause
exists for the issuance of a valid search warrant from a court of competent
jurisdiction, petition and obtain a search warrant before conducting the
inspection or otherwise entering the property. This warrant shall be only to
determine whether the provisions of this code enacted to protect the health,
safety and welfare of the people are being complied with and to enforce these
provisions only, and no criminal charges shall be made as a result of the
warrant. No warrant shall be issued unless there be probable cause to issue the
warrant. Probable cause occurs if the search is reasonable. Probable cause does
not depend on specific knowledge of the condition of a particular property.
   (E)   Every licensee, owner, resident or other person in control of property
within the city shall permit at reasonable times inspections of or entrance to
the property by the City Clerk or any other authorized city officer or employee
only to determine whether the provisions of this code enacted to protect the
health, safety and welfare of the people are being complied with and to enforce
these provisions. Unreasonable refusal to permit the inspection of or entrance
to the property shall be grounds for termination of any and all permits,
licenses or city service to the property. Mailed notice shall be given to the
licensee, owner, resident or other person in control of the property, stating
the grounds for the termination, and the licensee, owner, resident or other
person in control of the property shall be given an opportunity to appear
before the City Clerk to object to the termination before it occurs, subject to
appeal of the Clerk’s decision to the City Council at a regularly scheduled or
special meeting.
   (F)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of
the City to enter private property in urgent emergency situations where there
is an imminent danger in order to protect the public health, safety and
welfare.
§ 10.98 SUPPLEMENTAL ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES.
   (A)   In addition to those administrative penalties established in this code
and the enforcement powers granted in §
10.20, the City Council is authorized to create by resolution, adopted by a
majority of the members of the Council, supplemental administrative penalties.
   (B)   These administrative penalty procedures in this section are intended
to provide the public and the city with an informal, cost effective and
expeditious alternative to traditional criminal charges for violations of
certain provisions of this code. The procedures are intended to be voluntary on
the part of those who have been charged with those offenses.
   (C)   Administrative penalties for violations of various provisions of the
code, other than those penalties established in the code or in statutes that
are adopted by reference, may be established from time to time by resolution of
a majority of the members of the City Council. In order to be effective, an
administrative penalty for a particular violation must be established before
the violation occurred.
   (D)   In the discretion of the peace officer, City Clerk, or other person
giving notice of an alleged violation of a provision of this code, in a written
notice of an alleged violation, sent by first class mail to the person who is
alleged to have violated the code, the person giving notice may request the
payment of a voluntary administrative penalty for the violation directly to the
City Treasurer within 14 days of the notice of the violation. In the sole
discretion of the person giving the notice of the alleged violation, the time
for payment may be extended an additional 14 days, whether or not requested by
the person to whom the notice has been given. In addition to the administrative
penalty, the person giving notice may request in the notice to the alleged
violator to adopt a compliance plan to correct the situation resulting in the
alleged violation and may provide that if the alleged violator corrects the
situation resulting in the alleged violation within the time specified in the
notice, that the payment of the administrative penalty will be waived.
   (E)   At any time before the payment of the administrative penalty is due,
the person who has been given notice of an alleged violation may request to
appear before the City Council to contest the request for payment of the
penalty. After a hearing before the Council, the Council may determine to
withdraw the request for payment or to renew the request for payment. Because
the payment of the administrative penalty is voluntary, there shall be no
appeal from the decision of the Council.
   (F)   If the administrative penalty remains unpaid after the date that its
payment is due, the City may bring criminal charges at any time in accordance
with state law or this code. Likewise, the City, in its discretion, may bring
criminal charges in the first instance, rather than requesting payment of an
administrative penalty, even if a penalty for the particular violation has been
established by ordinance or by Council resolution. If the administrative
penalty is paid, no criminal charges shall be initiated by the City for the
alleged violation.
(Am. Ord. 69, 6th Series, passed 3-5-2013)
§ 10.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person, firm, or corporation who violates any provision of this
code for which another penalty is not specifically provided, shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor. The penalty which may be imposed for
any crime which is a misdemeanor under this code, including Minnesota Statutes
specifically adopted by reference, shall be a sentence of not more than 90 days
or a fine of not more than $1,000, or both.
   (B)   Any person, firm or corporation who violates any provision of this
code, including Minnesota Statutes specifically adopted by reference, which is
designated to be a petty misdemeanor shall, upon conviction be guilty of a
petty misdemeanor. The penalty which may be imposed for any petty offense which
is a petty misdemeanor shall be a sentence of a fine of not more than $300.
   (C)   In either the case of a misdemeanor or a petty misdemeanor, the costs
of prosecution may be added. A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon
each day during which a violation occurs or continues.
   (D)   The failure of any officer or employee of the city to perform any
official duty imposed by this code shall not subject the officer or employee to
the penalty imposed for a violation.

action, or from hazardous material mishaps of catastrophic measure; and in
order to insure that preparations of this city will be adequate to deal with
those disasters, and generally, to provide for the common defense and to
protect the public peace, health, and safety, and to preserve the lives and
property of the people of this city, it is hereby found and declared to be
necessary:
   (A)   To establish a city emergency management organization responsible for
city planning and preparation for emergency government operations in time of
disasters.
   (B)   To provide for the exercise of necessary powers during emergencies and
disasters.
   (C)   To provide for the rendering of mutual aid between this city and other

   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   DISASTER. A situation which creates an immediate and serious impairment to
the health and safety of any person, or a situation which has resulted in or is
likely to result in catastrophic loss to property, and for which traditional
sources of relief and assistance within the affected area are unable to repair
or prevent the injury or loss.
   EMERGENCY. An unforeseen combination of circumstances which calls for
immediate action to prevent from developing or occurring.
   EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT. The preparation for and the carrying out of all
emergency functions, other than functions for which military forces are
primarily responsible, to prevent, minimize, and repair injury and damage

nature, or from sabotage, hostile action, or from industrial hazardous material
mishaps. These functions include, without limitation, fire-fighting services,
police services, emergency medical services, engineering, warning services,
communications, radiological, and chemical, evacuation, congregate care,
emergency transportation, existing or properly assigned functions of plant
protection, temporary restoration of public utility services and other

necessary or incidental for carrying out the foregoing functions. Emergency
management includes those activities sometimes referred to as “civil defense”
functions.
   EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT FORCES. The total personnel resources engaged in city-
level emergency management functions in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter or any rule or order thereunder. This includes personnel from city
departments, authorized volunteers, and private organizations and agencies.

   There is hereby created within the city government an emergency management
organization which shall be under the supervision and control of the City
Emergency Management Director, called the Director. The Director shall be
appointed by the Mayor with approval of the City Council for an indefinite term
and may be removed by him or her at any time. The Director shall serve with a
salary as established by the City Council and shall be paid his or her
necessary expenses. The Director shall have direct responsibility for the

organization, subject to the direction and control of the Mayor.
§ 35.04 POWERS AND DUTIES OF DIRECTOR.

on any regional or state conference for emergency management. The Director
shall develop proposed mutual aid agreements with other political subdivisions
of the state for reciprocal emergency management aid and assistance in an
emergency too great to be dealt with unassisted, and shall present these
agreements to the Council for its action. These arrangements shall be
consistent with the State Emergency Plan.
   (B)   The Director shall make studies and surveys of the human resources,
industries, resources, and facilities of the city as deemed necessary to
determine their adequacy for emergency management and to plan for their most
efficient use in time of an emergency or disaster. The Director shall establish
the economic stabilization systems and measures, service staffs, boards, and
sub-boards required, in accordance with state and federal plans and directions
subject to the approval of the Mayor.
   (C)   The Director shall prepare a comprehensive emergency plan for the
emergency preparedness of the city and shall present the plan to the Council
for its approval. When the Council has approved the plan, it shall be the duty
of all city agencies and all emergency preparedness forces of the city to
perform the duties and functions assigned by the plan as approved. The plan may
be modified in like manner from time to time. The Director shall coordinate the
emergency management activities of the city to the end that they shall be
consistent and fully integrated with the emergency plans of the federal
government and the state and correlated with emergency plans of the county and
other political subdivisions within the state.
   (D)   In accordance with the State and City Emergency Plan, the Director
shall institute training programs, public information programs and conduct
practice warning alerts and emergency exercises as may be necessary to assure
prompt and effective operation of the City Emergency Plan when a disaster
occurs.
   (E)   The Director shall utilize the personnel, services, equipment,
supplies, and facilities of existing departments and agencies of the city to
the maximum extent practicable. The officers and personnel of all city
departments and agencies shall, to the maximum extent practicable, cooperate
with and extend services and facilities to the city’s emergency management
organization and to the Governor upon request. The head of each department or
agency in cooperation with the Director shall be responsible for the planning
and programming of those emergency activities as will involve the utilization
of the facilities of the department or agency.
   (F)   The Director shall, in cooperation with those city departments and
agencies affected, assist in the organizing, recruiting, and training of
emergency management personnel, which may be required on a volunteer basis to
carry out the emergency plans of the city and state. To the extent that
emergency personnel are recruited to augment a regular city department or
agency for emergencies, they shall be assigned to the departments or agencies
and shall be under the administration and control of the department or agency.

   (H)   The Director shall carry out all orders, rules, and regulations issued
by the Governor with reference to emergency management.

   (A)   A local emergency may be declared only by the Mayor or his or her
legal successor. It shall not be continued for a period in excess of three days
except by or with the consent of the Council. Any order, or proclamation
declaring, continuing, or terminating a local emergency shall be given prompt
and general publicity and shall be filed in the office of the City Clerk.

the response and recovery aspects of applicable local or inter-jurisdictional
disaster plans, and may authorize aid and assistance thereunder.

in accordance with the agreement under which it functions.

§ 35.06 EMERGENCY REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Whenever necessary, to meet a declared emergency or to prepare for an
emergency for which adequate regulations have not been adopted by the Governor
or the Council, the Council may by resolution promulgate regulations,
consistent with applicable federal or state law or regulation, respecting: the
conduct of persons and the use of property during emergencies; the repair,
maintenance, and safeguarding of essential public services, emergency health,
fire, and safety regulations, drills or practice periods required for
preliminary training, and all other matters which are required to protect
public safety, health, and welfare in declared emergencies.
   (B)   Every resolution of emergency regulations shall be in writing; shall
be dated; shall refer to the particular emergency to which it pertains, if so

hall or other headquarters of the city or at other places in the affected area
as the Council shall designate in the resolution. By resolution, the Council
may modify or rescind a regulation.
   (C)   The Council may rescind any regulation by resolution at any time. If
not sooner rescinded, every regulation shall expire at the end of 30 days after
its effective date or at the end of the emergency to which it relates,
whichever comes first. Any resolution, rule, or regulation inconsistent with an
emergency regulation promulgated by the Council shall be suspended during the
period of time and to the extent conflict exists.
   (D)   During a declared emergency, the city is, under the provisions of M.S.
§ 12.31, as it may be amended from time to time and notwithstanding any
statutory or Charter provision to the contrary, empowered, through its Council,
acting within or without the corporate limits of the city, to enter into
contracts and incur obligations necessary to combat the disaster by protecting
the health and safety of persons and property and providing emergency
assistance to the victims of a disaster. The city may exercise these powers in
the light of the exigencies of the disaster without compliance with the time-
consuming procedures and formalities prescribed by law pertaining to the
performance of public work, entering rental equipment agreements, purchase of
supplies and materials, limitations upon tax levies, and the appropriation and
expenditure of public funds, including, but not limited to, publication of
resolutions, publication of calls for bids, provisions of personnel laws and

   Provisions of this chapter relating to municipal utilities shall constitute
portions of the contract between the city and all consumers of municipal
utility services, and every such consumer shall be deemed to assent to the
same. All contracts between franchisees and consumers of utility services other
than municipal shall be in strict accord with provisions of this title.
(1998 Code, § 3.03)
§ 50.04 DISCONNECTION FOR LATE PAYMENT.
   (A)   It is the policy of the city to discontinue utility service to
customers by reason of nonpayment of bills only after notice and a meaningful
opportunity to be heard on disputed bills. The city’s form for application for
utility service and all bills shall contain address and telephone number of
city hall and clearly visible and easily readable provisions to the effect
that:
      (1)   All bills are due and payable on or before the date set forth on
the bill;
      (2)   If any bill is not paid by or before that date, a second bill will
be mailed containing a cutoff notice that if the bill is not paid within ten
days of the mailing of the second bill, service will be discontinued for
nonpayment;
      (3)   If all or any part of a bill is in dispute, a customer shall advise
the city by written notice, in person or by telephone prior to the proposed
disconnection date. If the city and the customer are unable to resolve the
dispute in a mutually satisfactory manner, the customer may request a hearing;
first before the Utilities Commission and next before the City Council.
   (B)   Requests for delays or waiver of payment will not be entertained; only
questions of proper and correct billing will be considered. In the absence of
payment of the bill rendered or resort to the hearing procedure provided
herein, service will be discontinued at the time specified.
   (C)   If the city discontinues utility service to a customer for nonpayment
of bills, service will be reinstated only after all bills for service then due
and a re-connect charge in an amount set by the City Council have been paid.
RULES AND REGULATIONS
§ 50.20 BILLING, PAYMENT AND PENALTY.
    (A)   All municipal utilities shall be billed in monthly installments, on
or before the first day of the month following reading of any meter read during
the month. All utilities charges shall be delinquent if they are unpaid at the
close of business on the fifteenth day of the month following the billing;
provided, that if the fifteenth day of the month shall fall on a Saturday,
Sunday or legal holiday, the time shall be extended to the close of business on
the next succeeding day on which business is normally transacted. A penalty
shall be added to, and become part of, all delinquent utility bills. If any
bill is not paid in full on or before the fifteenth day of the month following
the date upon which it became delinquent, municipal utilities may, at the
option of the city, be suspended to the consumer whose bill is so delinquent in
accordance with § 50.04. If service is suspended due to delinquency, it shall
not be restored at that location until a reconnection charge for each utility
reconnected and all amounts owed for service and penalties have been paid.
   (B)   Recalculation of charges.
      (1)   If a property owner or person responsible for paying sanitary sewer
charges incurred herein, questions the correctness of any such charges, that
person may have the determination of the charge recomputed within three months
of the bill.
      (2)   The property owner or person responsible for paying sanitary sewer
charges may submit a written request to City Hall for a recomputation of
charges due to a significant deviation in water usage. After consideration of
the facts and circumstances of the request, the City Council, upon the
recommendation of the Public Utilities Commission, may reduce the sanitary
sewer charges for one billing cycle to that person's monthly average for the
preceding 12 month period, provided the cause of the deviation has been
corrected and did not result in excess use of the sanitary sewer. The reduction
shall be credited to the customer's next utility bill. The customer shall
provide proof that the problem has been corrected (i.e.- receipt, invoice,
etc.) The customer may enter into a reasonable payment plan with the city in
the event the customer is not eligible for a reduction in the sanitary sewer
charge for a significant deviation in water usage and has corrected the cause
of the problem. Late charges shall still apply. For purposes of this division,
a "significant deviation" is defined as an increase in charges equal to or
greater than a 150% increase in the person's average monthly sanitary sewer
charge for the preceding 12 month period.

§ 50.23 OWNERSHIP OF MUNICIPAL UTILITIES.
   Ownership of all municipal utilities, plants, lines, mains, extensions and
appurtenances thereto shall be and remain in the city, and no person shall own
any part or portion thereof; provided, however, that private facilities and
appurtenances constructed on private property are not intended to be included
in municipal ownership.
(1998 Code, § 3.04, Subd. 4)
§ 50.24 RIGHT OF ENTRY.
   By applying for, or receiving, a municipal utility service, a customer
irrevocably consents and agrees that any city employee acting within the course
and scope of his employment may, in conformance with §
10.20, enter into and upon the private property of the customer, including
dwellings and other buildings, at all reasonable times under the circumstances,
in or upon which private property a municipal utility, or connection therewith,
is installed, for the purpose of inspecting, repairing, reading meters,
connecting or disconnecting the municipal utility service.
(1998 Code, § 3.04, Subd. 5)
§ 50.25 METER TEST.
   Whenever a consumer shall request the city to test any utility meter in use
by him or her, the request shall be accompanied by a cash deposit for each
meter to be tested. If any such meter is found to be inaccurate, the same shall
be replaced with an accurate meter and the deposit thereon refunded. If the
meter shall be found to be accurate in its recordings or calculations, it shall
be reinstalled and the deposit shall be retained by the city to defray the cost
of the test. As to remote-type readers, and if there is a disparity between the
meter reading and the remote reading, the meter reading shall govern.
(1998 Code, § 3.04, Subd. 6)

the city.
   (D)   It is unlawful for any person to “jumper” or by any means or device
fully or partially circumvent a municipal utility meter, or to knowingly use or

of which the proper billing authorities have no knowledge.
   (E)   It is unlawful for any person to make or use any connection to the
city water or sewer system without the owner(s) of the location to be served
thereby first entering into a written contract with the Council for the
service, if the location to be served is beyond the corporate limits of the
city.

power is the power used to perform actual work, such as creating heat, light,
or motion. Reactive power, or kilovolt-amperes-reactive (KVAR), is power that
doesn’t do useful work but is used to sustain an electromagnetic field, such as
with motors. Real (working) power and reactive power together make up apparent
power. Apparent power is the true power that must be supplied to the customer.
      (2)   Customers shall use electricity in such a way that the average
power factor remains as close to 100% as possible; and the city may, at its
discretion, perform tests and/or install reactive metering to determine the
customer’s power factor, and adjust the amount billed if the customer’s power
factor is determined to be less than 95%.
   (D)   Large power. A “large power” customer is one with:
       (1)   A single phase or 3 phase 60 cycle service at standard secondary
voltage, or
      (2)   With a load of 40 KW or larger.
   (E)   Charge in aid of construction. Availability of service will be subject
to applicable rules and regulations, but where equipment must be installed or
lines extended, an additional charge may be made.
   (F)   Rates. Subject to the foregoing, the fees, rates, and charges to be
imposed and collected by the city for electricity that it distributes shall be
as set forth in the Fee Schedule Ordinance, adopted by reference in §
36.01 of this code.
   (G)   Modifications. The City Council may modify, amend, or revoke any such
fee, charge, or rate by resolution or ordinance.

power system directly into any Commission-approved independent system
operator’s or regional transmission organization’s organized electric markets.
   (B)   Retail customers served by the City wishing to bid their demand
response into a Commission-approved independent system operator’s or regional
transmission organization’s organized electric markets may do so by
participating in the program established by the City or its authorized
designee. Retail customers are not permitted to participate in the demand
response program of any other entity without the express, prior authorization
of the City.

operator’s or regional transmission organization’s organized markets for energy
imbalance, spinning reserves, supplemental reserves, reactive power and voltage
control, or regulation and frequency response ancillary services (or its
functional equivalent in the Commission-approved independent system operator’s
or regional transmission organization’s tariff).
   (B)   Retail customers served by the City’s public power system wishing to
bid their demand response into a Commission-approved independent system
operator’s or regional transmission organization’s organized markets for energy
imbalance, spinning reserves, supplemental reserves, reactive power and voltage
control, or regulation and frequency response ancillary services (or its
functional equivalent in the Commission-approved independent system operator’s
or regional transmission organization’s tariff) may do so by participating in
the program established by the City or its authorized designee. Retail
customers are not permitted to participate in the demand response program of
any other entity without the express prior authorization of the City.

private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of the
type to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. In the
maintaining of these interceptors, the owner shall be responsible for the
proper removal and disposal of the captured materials by appropriate means and
shall maintain a record of dates and means of disposal which are subject to
review by the Wastewater Superintendent. Any removal and hauling of the
collecting materials not performed by the owner’s personnel must be performed
by a currently licensed waste disposal firm.
   (I)   Where required by the city, the owner of any property serviced by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable structure or
control manhole with the necessary meters and other appurtenances in the
building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of wastes.
The structure shall be accessible and safely located and shall be constructed
in accordance with plans approved by the city. The structure shall be installed
by the owner at his or her expense and shall be maintained by the owner to be
safe and accessible at all times. (Ord. 8, 4th Series, eff. 1-1-1988)
   (J)   The owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying
industrial wastes may, at the discretion of the city, be required to provide
laboratory measurements, tests, or analyses of waters or wastes to illustrate
compliance with this chapter and any special condition for discharge
established by the city or regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over the
discharge. The number, type, and frequency of sampling and laboratory analyses
to be performed by the owner shall be as stipulated by the city. The industry
must supply a complete analysis of the constituents to assure that compliance
with federal, state and local standards being met. The owner shall report the
results of measurements and laboratory analyses to the city at such times and
in such manner as prescribed by the city. The owner shall bear the expense of
all measurements, analyses and reporting required by the city. At such times as
deemed necessary, the city reserves the right to take measurements and samples
for analysis by an independent laboratory. (Ord. 19, 5th Series, eff. 7-30-
1992)
   (K)   All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters

necessary, facilities to prevent accidental discharges of prohibited materials
shall be provided and maintained at the owner’s expense. Detailed plans showing
facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be
submitted to the Wastewater Superintendent for review and approval prior to
construction of the facility. Review and approval of the plans and operating
procedures shall not relieve any user from the responsibility to modify the
user’s facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter. Users
shall notify the Wastewater Superintendent immediately upon having a slug or
accidental discharge of substances of wastewater in violation of this chapter
to enable countermeasures to be taken by the Wastewater Superintendent to
minimize damage to the wastewater treatment works. The notification will not
relieve any user of any liability for any expense, loss or damage to the
wastewater treatment system or treatment process, or for any fines imposed on
the city on account thereof under any state and federal law. Employers shall
insure that all employees who may cause or discover such a discharge are
advised of the emergency notification procedure.
   (M)   It is unlawful for any person, having charge of any building or other
premises which drains into the public sewer, to permit any substance or matter
which may form a deposit or obstruction to flow or pass into the public sewer.
Within 30 days after receipt of written notice from the city, the owner shall
install a suitable and sufficient catch basin or waste trap, or if one already
exists, shall clean out, repair or alter the same and perform such other work
as the Wastewater Superintendent may deem necessary. Upon the owner’s refusal
or neglect to install a catch basin or waste trap or to clean out, repair, or
alter the same after the period of 30 days, the Wastewater Superintendent may
cause such work to be completed at the expense of the owner.
   (N)   Whenever any service connection becomes clogged, obstructed, broken or
out of order, or detrimental to the use of the public sewer, or unfit for the
purpose of drainage, the owner shall repair or cause such work to be done as
the Wastewater Superintendent may direct. Each day after 30 days that a person
neglects or fails to so act shall constitute a separate violation of this
chapter, and the Wastewater Superintendent may then cause the work to be done,
and recover from the owner or agency the expense thereof by an action in the
name of the city.
   (O)   The owner or operator of any motor vehicle washing or servicing
facility shall provide and maintain in serviceable condition at all times a
catch basin or waste trap in the building drain system to prevent grease, oil,
dirt or any mineral deposit from entering the public sewer system.
   (P)   In addition to any penalties that may be imposed for violation of any
provision of this chapter, the city may assess against any person the cost of
repairing or restoring sewers or associated facilities damaged as a result of
the discharge of prohibited wastes by such applicable to the type of service.
   (Q)   No statement contained in this section shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the city for treatment, providing that National Categorical
Pretreatment Standards and the city’s NPDES and/or state disposal system permit
limitations are not violated, and the user pays operation, maintenance, and
replacement costs in proportion to the user’s proportionate contribution of
wastewater flows and loadings to the treatment plant, and no user is charged at
a rate less than that of “Normal Domestic Strength Wastewater.”

(1998 Code, § 3.26, Subd. 1)
§ 54.41 ESTABLISHMENT OF A SEWER SERVICE CHARGE SYSTEM.
   (A)   The city establishes a sewer service charge system whereby all revenue
collected from users of the wastewater treatment facilities will be used to
affect all expenditures incurred for annual operation, maintenance, and
replacement and for debt service on capital expenditure incurred in
constructing the wastewater treatment works.
   (B)   Each user shall pay its proportionate share of operation, maintenance
and replacement costs of the treatment works, based on the user’s proportionate
contribution to the total wastewater loading from all users.
   (C)   Each user shall pay debt service charges to retire local capital costs
as determined by the Council.
   (D)   Sewer service rates and charges to users of the wastewater treatment
facility shall be determined and fixed in a “Sewer Service Charge System”
developed according to the provisions of this subchapter. The Sewer Service
Charge System developed shall be adopted by resolution upon enactment of this
subchapter and shall be posted and published in the local newspaper as required
by the City Charter. Subsequent changes in sewer service rates and charges
shall be adopted by Council resolution and shall be published in the local
newspaper.
   (E)   Revenues collected for sewer service shall be deposited in a separate
fund known as “The Sewer Service Fund.” Income from revenues collected will be
expanded to offset the cost of operation, maintenance and equipment replacement
for the facility and to retire the debt for capital expenditure.
   (F)   Sewer service charges and the Sewer Service Fund will be administered
in accordance with the provisions of §
54.44.
(1998 Code, § 3.26, Subd. 2)
§ 54.42 DETERMINATION OF SEWER SERVICE CHARGES.
   (A)   (1)   Users of the wastewater treatment works shall be identified as
belonging to one of the following user classes:
         (a)   Residential;
         (b)   Commercial;
         (c)   Governmental;
         (d)   Institutional; or
         (e)   Industrial.
      (2)   The allocation of users to these categories for the purpose of
assessing user charges and debt service charges shall be the responsibility of
the City Clerk. Allocation of users to user classes shall be based on the
substantive intent of the definitions of these classes contained herein.
   (B)   Each user shall pay operation, maintenance, and replacement costs in
proportion to the user’s proportionate contribution of wastewater flows and
loadings to the treatment plant, with the minimum rate for loadings of BOD and
TSS being the rate established for concentrations of 125 mg/l BOD and 150 mg/
l TSS (such as, normal domestic strength wastewater). Those industrial users
discharging segregated normal domestic strength wastewater only can be
classified as commercial users for the purpose of rate determination.
   (C)   The charges assessed residential users and those users of other
classes discharging normal domestic strength wastewater shall be established
proportionately according to billable wastewater volume. Billable wastewater
volume shall be calculated as follows:
      (1)   Residential users: Billable wastewater volume for residential users
shall be calculated on 100% of the metered wastewater usage throughout the
year;
      (2)   Non-residential users: The billable wastewater volume of non-
residential users will be calculated on 100% of the metered wastewater usage
throughout the year or calculated on the basis of wastewater flow meters. The
city may, at its discretion, require non-residential users to install such
additional water meters or wastewater flow meters as may be necessary to
determine billable wastewater volume.
(Ord. 7, 4th Series, eff. 1-1-1988; Ord. 22, 5th Series, eff. 11-26-1992)
   (D)   User charges for normal domestic users shall be determined as follows:
      (1)   Calculation of unit cost for treatment of normal domestic strength
wastewater:
         Uomr   =   Comr
               Tbwv
         Where      Uomr   =   Unit cost for operation, maintenance and
replacement in $/kgal.
               Comr   =   Total annual OM & R costs.
               Tbwv   =   Total annual billable wastewater volume in kgal.
      (2)   Calculation of user charge:
         Uc   =   Uomr x bwv
         Where:   Uc       =   User charge
               Uomr   =   Unit cost for operation, maintenance and replacement
in $/kgal.
               bwv   =   Billable wastewater volume of a particular user in
kgal.
   (E)   Local construction costs of the wastewater treatment facility will be
recovered through a debt service charge calculated using usage and connection
charges as follows:
      (1)   Calculation of debt service unit cost for wastewater volume:
         Uds   =   Cds
               Tbwv
         Where      Uds   =   Unit cost for debt service in $/kgal.
               *Cds   =   Cost of annual debt service assigned for wastewater
volume.
               Tbwv   =   Total annual billable wastewater volume in Kgal.
         * City may reduce the cost of annual debt service through the use of
other city funds at its discretion.
      (2)   Calculation of debt service billable connection cost:
         UD    =   CDC
               TC
         Where:   UD      =   Unit billable connection cost for debt service
               *CDC   =   Costs of annual debt service assigned for connections
               Tc      =    Total number of billable connections
         * City may reduce the cost of annual debt service through the use of
other city funds at its discretion.
      (3)   Calculation of Debt Service Charge:
         Dc   =   Uds x bw   =   UD x U
         Where:   Dc      =   Debt service charge
               Uds   =   Unit cost for debt service in $/kgal
               UD      =   Unit billable connection cost for debt service
               U      =   Number of billable connections for particular user
               bwv   =   Billable wastewater volume of a particular user in
kgal.
   (F)   The sewer service charge for a particular connection shall be
determined as follows:
         SSC   =   Uc + Dc
         Where:   SSC      =   Sewer Service Charge
               Uc      =   User charge
               Dc      =   Debt service charge
   (G)   An additional fee will be charged for wastewater collection system
maintenance or replacement of necessary collection system lines. This charge
will be added to the SSC and determined annually by the Council.
   (H)   The sewer service charges established in this subchapter shall not
prevent the assessment of additional charges to users who discharge wastes with
concentrations greater than normal domestic strength or wastes of unusual
character or contractual agreements with such users, as long as the following
conditions are met:
      (1)   The user pays operation, maintenance, and replacement costs in
proportion to the user’s proportionate contribution of wastewater flows and
loadings to the treatment plant, and no user is charged at a rate less than
that of normal domestic strength wastewater;
      (2)   The measurements of such wastes are conducted according to the
latest edition of “Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and
Wastewater” in a manner acceptable to the city as provided for in §§
54.01 et seq.
   (I)   A study of unit costs of collection and treatment processes
attributable to flow, BOD, TSS and other significant loadings may be developed
for determining the proportionate allocation of costs to flows and loadings for
users discharging wastes of greater than normal domestic strength or wastes of
unusual character.
   (J)   Monthly user rates for connections to the city’s municipal sanitary
sewer system shall be as set forth in the Fee Schedule Ordinance adopted by
reference in §
36.01 of this code.
(1998 Code, § 3.26, Subd. 3) (Ord. 7, 4th Series, eff. 1-1-1988; Ord. 139, 5th
Series, passed 5-17-2005)
§ 54.43 SEWER SERVICE FUND.
   (A)   The city establishes a Sewer Service Fund as an income fund to receive
all revenues generated by the sewer service charge system and all other income
dedicated to the operation, maintenance, replacement and construction of the
wastewater treatment works, including taxes, special charges, fees, and
assessments intended to retire construction debt. The city also establishes the

resident, or other person in control of the premises. If permission is denied,
the city may declare the existence of the abandoned or junk vehicle to be a
nuisance and proceed to abate the nuisance as provided for in §§
92.15 through
92.21. Once the abatement procedure has been completed, the city may apply for
an order from a court of competent jurisdiction authorizing the removal and
impoundment of the vehicle and, after the order has been granted, the city may
then remove and impound the vehicle.
§ 91.19 SALE; WAITING PERIODS.
   (A)   Sale after 15 days. An impounded vehicle is eligible for disposal or
sale under §
91.23, 15 days after notice to the owner, if the vehicle is determined to be:
      (1)   A junk vehicle, except that it may have a valid, current
registration plate and still be eligible for disposal or sale under this
subdivision; or
      (2)   An abandoned vehicle.
   (B)   Sale after 45 days. An impounded vehicle is eligible for disposal or
sale under §
91.23, 45 days after notice to the owner, if the vehicle is determined to be an
unauthorized vehicle.
§ 91.20 NOTICE OF TAKING AND SALE.
   (A)   Contents; notice given within 5 days. When an impounded vehicle is
taken into custody, the city or impound lot operator taking it into custody
shall give notice of the taking within 5 days. The notice shall:
      (1)   Set forth the date and place of the taking; the year, make, model
and serial number of the impounded motor vehicle if the information can be
reasonably obtained; and the place where the vehicle is being held;
      (2)   Inform the owner and any lienholders of their right to reclaim the
vehicle under §
91.21; and
      (3)   State that failure of the owner or lienholders to exercise their
right to reclaim the vehicle and contents within the appropriate time allowed
under §
91.19 shall be deemed a waiver by them of all right, title and interest in the
vehicle and contents and a consent to the transfer of title to and disposal or
sale of the vehicle and contents pursuant to §
91.23.
   (B)   Notice by mail or publication. The notice shall be sent by mail to the
registered owner, if any, of an impounded vehicle and to all readily
identifiable lienholders of record. The Department makes this information
available to impound lot operators for notification purposes. If it is

the registered owner and all lienholders, the notice shall be published once in
a newspaper of general circulation in the area where the motor vehicle was
towed from or abandoned. Published notices may be grouped together for
convenience and economy.
   (C)   Unauthorized vehicles; notice. If an unauthorized vehicle remains
unclaimed after 30 days from the date the notice was sent under division (B) of
this section, a second notice shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt

operator taking it into custody upon payment of all towing and storage charges
resulting from taking the vehicle into custody within 15 or 45 days, as
applicable under §
91.19, after the date of the notice required by §
91.20.
   (B)   Lienholders. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to impair any
lien of a garagekeeper under the laws of this state, or the right of a
lienholder to foreclose. For the purposes of this section, GARAGEKEEPER is an
operator of a parking place or establishment, an operator of a motor vehicle
storage facility, or an operator of an establishment for the servicing, repair
or maintenance of motor vehicles.
§ 91.22 OPERATOR’S DEFICIENCY CLAIM; CONSENT TO SALE.
   (A)   Deficiency claim. The nonpublic impound lot operator has a deficiency
claim against the registered owner of the vehicle for the reasonable costs of
services provided in the towing, storage and inspection of the vehicle minus
the proceeds of the sale or auction. The claim for storage costs may not exceed
the costs of:
      (1)   25 days storage for a vehicle described in §
91.19(A); and
      (2)   55 days storage for a vehicle described in §
91.19(B).
   (B)   Implied consent to sale. A registered owner who fails to claim the
impounded vehicle within the applicable time period allowed under §

disposal or sale of the vehicle and its contents and transfer of title.
§ 91.23 DISPOSITION BY IMPOUND LOT.
   (A)   Auction or sale.
      (1)   If an abandoned or unauthorized vehicle and contents taken into
custody by the city or any impound lot is not reclaimed under §
91.21, it may be disposed of or sold at auction or sale when eligible pursuant
to §§
91.20 and
91.21.
      (2)   The purchaser shall be given a receipt in a form prescribed by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles which shall be sufficient title to dispose of the
vehicle. The receipt shall also entitle the purchaser to register the vehicle
and receive a certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and claims of
ownership. Before a vehicle is issued a new certificate of title, it must
receive a motor vehicle safety check.
   (B)   Unsold vehicles. Abandoned or junk vehicles not sold by the city or
public impound lots pursuant to division (A) of this section shall be disposed
of in accordance with §
91.24.
   (C)   Sale proceeds; public entities. From the proceeds of a sale under this
section by the city or public impound lot of an abandoned or unauthorized motor
vehicle, the city shall reimburse itself for the cost of towing, preserving and
storing the vehicle, and all administrative, notice and publication costs
incurred in handling the vehicle pursuant to this chapter. Any remainder from
the proceeds of a sale shall be held for the owner of the vehicle or entitled
lienholder for 90 days and then shall be deposited in the treasury of the city.
   (D)   Sale proceeds; nonpublic impound lots. The operator of a nonpublic
impound lot may retain any proceeds derived from a sale conducted under the
authority of division (A) of this section. The operator may retain all proceeds
from sale of any personal belongings and contents in the vehicle that were not
claimed by the owner or the owner’s agent before the sale, except that any
suspected contraband or other items that likely would be subject to forfeiture
in a criminal trial must be turned over to the appropriate law enforcement
agency.
§ 91.24 DISPOSAL AUTHORITY.
   The city may contract with others or may utilize its own equipment and
personnel for the inventory of impounded motor vehicles and abandoned scrap
metal and may utilize its own equipment and personnel for the collection,
storage and transportation of these vehicles and abandoned scrap metal. The
city may utilize its own equipment and personnel only for the collection and
storage of not more than 5 abandoned or unauthorized vehicles without
advertising for or receiving bids in any 120-day period.
§ 91.25 CONTRACTS; REIMBURSEMENT BY MPCA.
   (A)   MPCA review and approval. If the city proposes to enter into a
contract with a person licensed by the MPCA pursuant to this section or a
contract pursuant to §
91.24, the MPCA may review the proposed contract before it is entered into by
the city, to determine whether it conforms to the MPCA’s plan for solid waste
management and is in compliance with MPCA rules. A contract that does so
conform may be approved by the MPCA and entered into by the city. Where a
contract has been approved, the MPCA may reimburse the city for the costs
incurred under the contract that have not been reimbursed under §
91.23. Except as otherwise provided in §
91.24, the MPCA shall not approve any contract that has been entered into
without prior notice to and without a request for bids from all persons duly
licensed by the MPCA to be a party to a disposal contract pursuant to M.S. §
116.07, as it may be amended from time to time; nor that does not provide for a
full performance bond; or does not provide for total collection and
transportation of abandoned motor vehicles, except that the MPCA may approve a
contract covering solely collection or transportation of abandoned motor
vehicles where the MPCA determines total collection and transportation to be
impracticable and where all other requirements herein have been met and the
unit of government, after proper notice and request for bids, has not received
any bid for total collection and transportation of abandoned motor vehicles.
   (B)    The city may perform work. If the city utilizes its own equipment and
personnel pursuant to its authority under §
91.24, and the use of the equipment and personnel conforms to the MPCA’s plan
for solid waste management and is in compliance with MPCA rules, the city may
be reimbursed by the MPCA for reasonable costs incurred which are not
reimbursed under §
91.23.
   (C)   The city required to contract work. The MPCA may demand that the city
contract for the disposal of abandoned motor vehicles and other scrap metal
pursuant to the MPCA’s plan for solid waste disposal. If the city fails to
contract within 180 days of the demand, the MPCA, through the Department of
Administration and on behalf of the city, may contract with any person duly
licensed by the MPCA for the disposal.

§ 94.09 ABATEMENT.
   (A)   Notice. Written notice of violation; notice of the time, date, place
and subject of any hearing before the City Council; notice of City Council
order; and notice of motion for summary enforcement hearing shall be given as
set forth in this section.
      (1)   Notice of violation. Written notice of violation shall be served by
a peace officer or designated person on the owner of record or occupant of the
premises either in person or by certified or registered mail. If the premises

occupant refuses to accept notice of violation, notice of violation shall be
served by posting it on the premises.
      (2)   Notice of City Council hearing. Written notice of any City Council
hearing to determine or abate a nuisance shall be served on the owner of record
and occupant of the premises either in person or by certified or registered

record or occupant of the premises of such fact and order that the nuisance be
terminated or abated. The notice of violation shall specify the steps to be
taken to abate the nuisance and the time within which the nuisance is to be
abated. If the notice of violation is not complied with within the time
specified, the officer or designated person shall report that fact forthwith to
the City Council. Thereafter, the City Council may, after notice to the owner
or occupant and an opportunity to be heard, determine that the condition
identified in the notice of violation is a nuisance and further order that if
the nuisance is not abated within the time prescribed by the City Council, the
city may seek injunctive relief by serving a copy of the City Council order and
notice of motion for summary enforcement or obtain an administrative search and
seizure warrant and abate the nuisance.
   (C)   Emergency procedure; summary enforcement. In cases of emergency, where
delay in abatement required to complete the notice and procedure requirements
set forth in divisions (A) and (B) of this section will permit a continuing
nuisance to unreasonably endanger public health safety or welfare, the City
Council may order summary enforcement and abate the nuisance. To proceed with
summary enforcement, the officer or designated person shall determine that a
public nuisance exists or is being maintained on premises in the city and that
delay in abatement of the nuisance will unreasonably endanger public health,
safety or welfare. The officer or designated person shall notify in writing the
occupant or owner of the premises of the nature of the nuisance and of the
city’s intention to seek summary enforcement and the time and place of the City
Council meeting to consider the question of summary enforcement. The City
Council shall determine whether or not the condition identified in the notice
to the owner or occupant is a nuisance, whether public health, safety or
welfare will be unreasonably endangered by delay in abatement required to
complete the procedure set forth in division (A) of this section, and may order
that the nuisance be immediately terminated or abated. If the nuisance is not
immediately terminated or abated, the City Council may order summary
enforcement and abate the nuisance.
   (D)   Immediate abatement. Nothing in this section shall prevent the city,
without notice or other process, from immediately abating any condition which
poses an imminent and serious hazard to human life or safety.

on or before September 1 next following abatement of the nuisance, list the

SHADE TREE DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION
§ 95.20 POLICY AND PURPOSE.
   The city has determined that the health of oak and elm trees is threatened
by fatal diseases known as oak wilt and Dutch elm disease. It has further
determined that the loss of oak and elm trees located on public and private
property would substantially depreciate the value of property and impair the
safety, good order, general welfare and convenience of the public. It is
declared to be the intention of the Council to control and prevent the spread
of these diseases and provide for the removal of dead or diseased trees as
nuisances.

specimens, samples and biopsies as may be necessary or desirable for diagnosis.
(1998 Code, § 9.30, Subd. 5)
§ 95.25 ABATEMENT OF NUISANCE.
   Abatement of a nuisance, defined herein, shall be by spraying, removing,

spread of shade tree disease. The abatement procedures shall be carried out in
accordance with current technical and expert methods and plans as may be
designed by the Commissioner of Agriculture of the state. The city shall

infection, or danger of infection, exists in any tree or wood on any public or
private property, he or she shall proceed as follows:

Failure to comply with this section shall constitute a violation.
      (2)   Removal by city. The City Clerk or other person designated by the

deposited thereon or after the snow has ceased to fall. The City Clerk or other
designated person shall keep a record showing the cost of removal adjacent to
each separate lot and parcel.
   (C)   Public health and safety hazards. When the city removes or eliminates
public health or safety hazards from private property under the following
provisions of this chapter, the administrative officer responsible for doing
the work shall keep a record of the cost of the removal or elimination against

abutting on private property is unsafe and in need of repairs, the City Council
may cause a notice to be served, by registered or certified mail or by personal
service, upon the record owner of the property, ordering the owner to have the
sidewalk repaired and made safe within 60 days and stating that if the owner
fails to do so, the city will do so, that the expense thereof must be paid by
the owner, and that if unpaid it will be made a special assessment against the
property concerned.

the repair attributable to each lot or parcel of property.
   (E)   Personal liability. The owner of property on which or adjacent to
which a current service has been performed shall be personally liable for the
cost of the service. As soon as the service has been completed and the cost

   (B)   Patch and restoration. The permittee shall patch its own work. The
city may choose either to have the permittee restore the right-of-way or to

in the manner and to the condition required by the city, or fails to
satisfactorily and timely complete all restoration required by the city, (1)
the city – at its option – may do such work; and (2) in that event, the
permittee shall pay to the city the cost of restoring the right-of-way within
30 days of billing therefor. If the permittee fails to pay as required, the

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 116.01 ADOPTION OF STATE LAW BY REFERENCE.
   The provisions of M.S. Ch. 340A, as they may be amended from time to time,
with reference to the definition of terms, conditions of operation,
restrictions on consumption, provisions relating to sales, hours of sale, and
all other matters pertaining to the retail sale, distribution, and consumption
of intoxicating liquor and 3.2 percent malt liquor are hereby adopted by
reference and are made a part of this Chapter as if set out in full. It is the
intention of the City Council that all future amendments to M.S. Ch. 340A are
hereby adopted by reference or referenced as if they had been in existence at
the time this Chapter is adopted.
§ 116.02 CITY MAY BE MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN STATE LAW.
   The Council is authorized by the provisions of M.S. § 340A.509, as it may be
amended from time to time, to impose, and has imposed in this chapter,
additional restrictions on the sale and possession of alcoholic beverages
within its limits beyond those contained in M.S. Ch. 340A, as it may be amended
from time to time.
§ 116.03 DEFINITIONS.
   In addition to the definitions contained in M.S. § 340A.101, as it may be
amended from time to time, the following terms are defined for purposes of this
chapter:
   LIQUOR. As used in this chapter, without modification by the words
“intoxicating” or “3.2 percent malt,” includes both intoxicating liquor and 3.2
percent malt liquor.
   RESTAURANT. An eating facility, other than a hotel, under the control of a
single proprietor or manager, where meals are regularly prepared on the
premises, where full waitress/waiter table service is provided, where a
customer orders food from printed menus and where the main food course is
served and consumed while seated at a single location. To be a “restaurant” as
defined by this section, an establishment shall have a license from the state
as required by M.S. § 157.16, as it may be amended from time to time, and meet
the definition of either a “small establishment,” “medium establishment” or
“large establishment” as defined in M.S. § 157.16, Subd. 3d, as it may be
amended from time to time. An establishment which serves prepackaged food that
receives heat treatment and is served in the package or frozen pizza that is
heated and served, shall not be considered to be a restaurant for purposes of
this chapter unless it meets the definitions of “small establishment,” “medium
establishment” or “large establishment.”
§ 116.04 NUDITY ON THE PREMISES OF LICENSED ESTABLISHMENTS PROHIBITED.
   (A)   The City Council finds that it is in the best interests of the public
health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the city that nudity is
prohibited as provided in this section on the premises of any establishment
licensed under this chapter. This is to protect and assist the owners,
operators, and employees of the establishment, as well as patrons and the
public in general, from harm stemming from the physical immediacy and
combination of alcohol, nudity, and sex. The Council especially intends to
prevent any subliminal endorsement of sexual harassment or activities likely to
lead to the possibility of various criminal conduct, including prostitution,
sexual assault, and disorderly conduct. The Council also finds that the
prohibition of nudity on the premises of any establishment licensed under this
chapter, as set forth in this section, reflects the prevailing community
standards of the city.
   (B)   It is unlawful for any licensee to permit or allow any person or
persons on the licensed premises when the person does not have his or her
buttocks, anus, breasts, and genitals covered with a non-transparent material.
It is unlawful for any person to be on the licensed premises when the person
does not have his or her buttocks, anus, breasts, and genitals covered with a
non-transparent material.
   (C)   A violation of this section is a misdemeanor punishable as provided by
law, and is justification for revocation or suspension of any liquor, wine, or
3.2 percent malt liquor license or the imposition of a civil penalty under the
provisions of §
116.99(B).
Penalty, see §
116.99

public park, on any public street, sidewalk, parking lot or alley, or in any

the consumption and display of liquor is lawfully permitted. Exceptions may be
granted from time to time for events with prior City Council approval.

commencement of the license year shall be prorated on a quarterly basis.
   (D)   All license fees shall be paid in full at the time the application is
filed with the city. If the application is denied, the license fee shall be
returned to the applicant.
   (E)   A refund of a pro rata share of an annual license fee may occur only
if authorized by M.S. § 340A.408, Subd. 5, as it may be amended from time to
time.
§ 116.24 COUNCIL DISCRETION TO GRANT OR DENY A LICENSE.
   The Council in its sound discretion may either grant or deny the application
for any license or for the transfer or renewal of any license. No applicant has
a right to a license under this chapter.
§ 116.25 APPLICATION FOR LICENSE.
   (A)   Form. Every application for a license issued under this chapter shall
be on a form provided by the city. Every application shall state the name of
the applicant, the applicant’s age, representations as to the applicant’s
character, with references as the Council may require, the type of license
applied for, the business in connection with which the proposed license will
operate and its location, a description of the premises, whether the applicant
is owner and operator of the business, how long the applicant has been in that
business at that place, and other information as the Council may require from
time to time. An application for an on-sale intoxicating liquor license shall
be in the form prescribed by the Commissioner of Public Safety and shall also
contain the information required in this section. The form shall be verified
and filed with the city. No person shall make a false statement in an
application.
   (B)   Financial responsibility. Prior to the issuance of any license under
this chapter, the applicant shall demonstrate proof of financial responsibility
as defined in M.S. § 340A.409, as it may be amended from time to time, with
regard to liability under M.S. § 340A.801, as it may be amended from time to
time. This proof will be filed with the city and the Commissioner of Public
Safety. Any liability insurance policy filed as proof of financial
responsibility under this section shall conform to M.S. § 340A.409, as it may
be amended from time to time. Operation of a business which is required to be
licensed by this chapter without having on file with the city at all times
effective proof of financial responsibility is a cause for revocation of the
license.
Penalty, see §
116.99
§ 116.26 DESCRIPTION OF PREMISES.
   The application shall specifically describe the compact and contiguous
premises within which liquor may be dispensed and consumed. The description may
not include any parking lot or sidewalk.
§ 116.27 APPLICATIONS FOR RENEWAL.
   At least 90 days before a license issued under this chapter is to be
renewed, an application for renewal shall be filed with the city. The decision
whether to renew a license rests within the sound discretion of the Council. No
licensee has a right to have the license renewed.
§ 116.28 TRANSFER OF LICENSE.
   No license issued under this chapter may be transferred without the approval
of the Council. Any transfer of stock of a corporate licensee is deemed to be a
transfer of the license, and a transfer of stock without prior Council approval
is a ground for revocation of the license. An application to transfer a license
shall be treated the same as an application for a new license, and all of the
provisions of this code applying to applications for a license shall apply.
Penalty, see §
116.99
§ 116.29 INVESTIGATION.
   (A)   Preliminary background information. On an initial application for a
license, on an application for transfer of a license, in the sound discretion
of the Council that it is in the public interest to do so and on an application
for renewal of a license, the city shall conduct a preliminary criminal
background investigation of the applicant and its employees or may contract
with the Commissioners of Public Safety for the investigation.
   (B)   Comprehensive background and financial investigation. If the results
of a preliminary investigation warrant, in the sound discretion of the Council,
a comprehensive background and financial investigation, the Council may either
conduct the investigation itself or contract with the Commissioner of Public
Safety for the investigation. The investigation fee for this comprehensive
background and financial investigation to be paid by the applicant shall be
$500, less any amount paid for the initial investigation if the investigation
is to be conducted within the state, and $10,000, less any amount paid for the
initial investigation, if the investigation is required outside the state. The
unused balance of the fee shall be returned to the applicant whether or not the
application is denied. The fee shall be paid in advance of any investigation
and the amount actually expended on the investigation shall not be refundable
in the event the application is denied. The results of the comprehensive
investigation shall be sent to the Commissioner of Public Safety if the
application is for an on-sale intoxicating liquor license or an on-sale wine
license.
(Am. Ord. 113, passed 1-5-2021)
§ 116.30 HEARING AND ISSUANCE.
   The Council shall investigate all facts set out in the application and not
investigated in the preliminary or comprehensive background and financial
investigations. Opportunity shall be given to any person to be heard for or
against the granting of the license. After the investigation and hearing, the
Council shall in its sound discretion grant or deny the application. No license
shall become effective until the proof of financial security has been approved
by the Commissioner of Public Safety.

described in the application.

for a license under state law.
   (E)   No license shall be granted within 500 feet of any school or church.

Penalty, see §
116.99
§ 116.36 SUSPENSION AND REVOCATION.
   (A)   The Council may suspend for a period not to exceed 60 days or revoke
any liquor license upon finding that the licensee has failed to comply with any

   (B)   The following are the minimum periods of suspension or revocation

to time, by motion, determine.
§ 116.52 OPERATION.
   (A)   Manager. The Council shall select and compensate a liquor store
manager to be in charge of the liquor store. The Manager shall not be a person
who would be prohibited by law or any provision of this chapter from being
eligible for an intoxicating liquor license. The Council may require the
Manager to furnish a surety bond to the city, conditioned upon the faithful
discharge of the duties of the office, in a sum as specified by the Council.
The bond premium may be paid by the city or the Manager, in the discretion of
the Council. The Manager shall operate the municipal liquor store under the
Council’s direction and shall perform those duties in connection with the store
as may be established by the Council. The Manager shall be responsible to the
Council for the conduct of the store in full compliance with this chapter and
with the laws relating to the sale of intoxicating liquor and 3.2 percent malt
liquor.
   (B)   Other employees. The Council may also appoint additional employees as

published in accordance with the provisions of M.S. § 471.6985, as it may be
amended from time to time.
   (E)   Hours of operation. The hours during which the sale of intoxicating

   (B)   The Council shall impose a civil penalty of up to $2,000 for each
violation of M.S. Ch. 340A, as it may be amended from time to time, and of this
chapter. Conviction of a violation in a court of law is not required in order
for the Council to impose the civil penalty. A hearing under the Administrative
Procedures Act, M.S. §§ 14.57 to 14.70, as it may be amended from time to time,
is not required before the penalty is imposed, but the Council shall hold a
hearing on the proposed violation and the proposed penalty and hear any person
who wishes to speak. Non-payment of the penalty is grounds for suspension or
revocation of the license. The following is the minimum schedule of presumptive
civil penalties which must be imposed in addition to any suspension unless the
licenses is revoked:
      (1)   For the first violation within any 3-year period, $500.
      (2)   For the second violation within any 3-year period, $1,000.
      (3)   For the third and subsequent violations within any 3-year period,
$2,000.
   (C)   The term “violation” as used in this section includes any and all
violations of the provisions of this chapter, or of M.S. Ch. 340A, as it may be
amended from time to time or any rules promulgated under that chapter as they
may be amended from time to time. The number of violations shall be determined
on the basis of the history of violations for the preceding 3-year period.
Revocation shall occur within 60 days following a violation for which
revocation is imposed.

authorized under said license; otherwise, the application shall be denied.   
      (2)   In making the above findings, the City Council shall take into
consideration the number of taxicabs already in operation in the City; whether

more than 60 days; or has violated any ordinances of the City or any law of the

133.99   Penalty
§ 133.01 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (A)   The City Council intends to discourage underage possession and
consumption of alcohol, even if done within the confines of a private
residence, and intends to hold persons criminally responsible for hosting
events or gatherings where persons under 21 years of age possess or consume
alcohol, regardless of whether the person hosting the event or gathering
supplied the alcoholic beverages.   
   (B)   The City Council finds:
      (1)   Events and gatherings held on private or public property where
alcoholic beverages are possessed or consumed by persons under the age of 21
may be harmful to those persons and constitute a potential threat to public
health.
      (2)   Prohibiting underage consumption of alcohol protects underage
persons and the general public from injuries related to consumption of alcohol,
such as alcohol overdose or alcohol-related traffic crashes.
      (3)   Alcohol is an addictive substance which, if used irresponsibly,
could have adverse effects on those who use it and on those who are affected by
the actions of an irresponsible user.
      (4)   Though events or gatherings involving underage possession and
consumption often occur outside the presence of parents, there are times when a
parent is present, condones the activity, or provides the alcoholic beverages.
      (5)   Giving or furnishing an alcoholic beverage to an underage person is
a crime, but this chapter is necessary to help further combat underage
consumption and to protect public health.   
      (6)   A deterrent effect will be created by holding a person criminally
responsible for hosting an event or gathering where underage possession or
consumption of alcoholic beverages occurs.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The legislature of the state has, in M.S. Ch. 103F and Ch. 462, as they may
be amended from time to time, delegated the responsibility to local government
units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the
City Council does ordain as follows.
(Ord. 130, 5th Series, passed 3-16-2004)
§ 151.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   General. The flood hazard areas of Jackson are subject to periodic
inundation which results in potential loss of life, loss of property, health
and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures or flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   Methods used to analyze flood hazards. This chapter is based upon a
reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which is consistent with the
standards established by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.
   (C)   National Flood Insurance Program compliance. This chapter is adopted
to comply with the rules and regulations of the National Flood Insurance
Program, codified as 44 C.F.R. parts 59 -78, as they may be amended from time
to time, so as to maintain the community’s eligibility in the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 130, 5th Series, passed 3-16-2004)
§ 151.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize those losses described in §
151.02 by provisions contained herein.
(Ord. 130, 5th Series, passed 3-16-2004)
§ 151.04 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definition shall apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ACCESSORY USE OR STRUCTURE. A use or structure on the same lot with, and of
a nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal use or
structure.
   BASEMENT. Any area of a structure, including crawl spaces, having its floor
or base subgrade (below ground level) on all 4 sides, regardless of the depth
of excavation below ground level.
   CONDITIONAL USE. A specific type of structure or land use listed in the
official control that may be allowed but only after an in-depth review
procedure and with appropriate conditions or restrictions as provided in the
official zoning controls or building codes and upon a finding that:
      (1)   Certain conditions as detailed in the zoning ordinance exist;
      (2)   The structure and/or land use conform to the comprehensive land use
plan if one exists and are compatible with the existing neighborhood.
   EQUAL DEGREE OF ENCROACHMENT. A method of determining the location of
floodway boundaries so that flood plain lands on both sides of a stream are
capable of conveying a proportionate share of flood flows.
   FLOOD. A temporary increase in the flow or stage of a stream or in the stage
of a wetland or lake that results in the inundation of normally dry areas.
   FLOOD FREQUENCY. The frequency for which it is expected that a specific
flood stage or discharge may be equaled or exceeded.
   FLOOD FRINGE. That portion of the flood plain outside of the floodway. FLOOD
FRINGE is synonymous with the term FLOODWAY FRINGE used in the Flood Insurance
Study for the city.
   FLOOD PLAIN. The beds proper and the areas adjoining a wetland, lake or
watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regional flood.
   FLOOD PROOFING. A combination of structural provisions, changes, or
adjustments to properties and structures subject to flooding, primarily for the
reduction or elimination of flood damages.
   FLOODWAY. The bed of a wetland or lake and the channel of a watercourse and
those portions of the adjoining flood plain which are reasonably required to
carry or store the regional flood discharge.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking
of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a basement area
is not considered a building’s lowest floor.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in 1 or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
manufactured home does not include the term recreational vehicle.
   OBSTRUCTION. Any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment,
projection, excavation, channel modification, culvert, building, wire, fence,
stockpile, refuse, fill, structure, or matter in, along, across, or projecting
into any channel, watercourse, or regulatory flood plain which may impede,
retard, or change the direction of the flow of water, either in itself or by
catching or collecting debris carried by the water.
   PRINCIPAL USE OR STRUCTURE. All uses or structures that are not accessory
uses or structures.
   REACH. A hydraulic engineering term to describe a longitudinal segment of a
stream or river influenced by a natural or man-made obstruction. In an urban
area, the segment of a stream or river between 2 consecutive bridge crossings
would most typically constitute a reach.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle that is built on a single chassis, is 400
square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, is
designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and
is designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary
living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. For the
purposes of this chapter, the term RECREATIONAL VEHICLE shall be synonymous
with the term TRAVEL TRAILER/TRAVEL VEHICLE.
   REGIONAL FLOOD. A flood which is representative of large floods known to
have occurred generally in Minnesota and reasonably characteristic of what can
be expected to occur on an average frequency in the magnitude of the 100-year
recurrence interval. REGIONAL FLOOD is synonymous with the term BASE FLOOD used
in a flood insurance study.
   REGULATORY FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION. An elevation no lower than 1 foot
above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation
caused by encroachments on the flood plain that result from designation of a
floodway.
   STRUCTURE. Anything constructed or erected on the ground or attached to the
ground or on-site utilities, including, but not limited to, buildings,
factories, sheds, detached garages, cabins, manufactured homes, recreational
vehicles not meeting the exemption criteria specified in §
151.31(C)(1) and other similar items.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure where the
cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or
exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Within any consecutive 365-day period, any
reconstruction, rehabilitation (including normal maintenance and repair),
repair after damage, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of
which equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the
start of construction of the improvement. This term includes structures that
have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include either:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions;
      (2)   Any alteration of an historic structure, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an
historic structure. For the purpose of this section, HISTORIC STRUCTURE shall
be as defined in Code of Federal Regulations part 59.1.
   VARIANCE. A modification of a specific permitted development standard
required in an official control including this chapter to allow an alternative
development standard not stated as acceptable in the official control, but only
as applied to a particular property for the purpose of alleviating a hardship,
practical difficulty or unique circumstance as defined and elaborated upon in a
community’s respective planning and zoning enabling legislation.
(Ord. 130, 5th Series, passed 3-16-2004)
§ 151.05 LANDS TO WHICH CHAPTER APPLIES.
   This chapter shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city
shown on the Official Zoning Map and/or the attachments thereto as being
located within the boundaries of the Floodway, Flood Fringe, or General Flood
Plain Districts.
(Ord. 130, 5th Series, passed 3-16-2004)
§ 151.06 ESTABLISHMENT OF OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.
   The Official Zoning Map, together with all materials attached thereto, is
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. The attached
material shall include the Flood Insurance Study for the city prepared by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, dated April 1, 2003, and the Flood
Insurance Rate Map, dated April 2, 2004 therein. The Official Zoning Map shall
be on file in the Office of the City Administrator.
(Ord. 130, 5th Series, passed 3-16-2004)
§ 151.07 REGULATORY FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION.
   The regulatory flood protection elevation shall be an elevation no lower
than 1 foot above the elevation of the regional flood, plus any increases in
flood elevation caused by encroachments on the flood plain that result from
designation of a floodway:
(Ord. 130, 5th Series, passed 3-16-2004)
§ 151.08 INTERPRETATION.
   (A)   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this
chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation
or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes.
   (B)   The boundaries of the zoning districts shall be determined by scaling
distances on the Official Zoning Map. Where interpretation is needed as to the
exact location of the boundaries of the district as shown on the Official
Zoning Map, as for example where there appears to be a conflict between a
mapped boundary and actual field conditions and there is a formal appeal of the
decision of the Zoning Administrator, the Planning Commission shall make the
necessary interpretation. All decisions will be based on elevations on the
regional (100-year) flood profile, the ground elevations that existed on the
site at the time the community adopted its initial flood plain ordinance, and
other available technical data. Persons contesting the location of the district
boundaries shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present their case to the
Planning Commission and to submit technical evidence.
(Ord. 130, 5th Series, passed 3-16-2004)
§ 151.09 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   It is not intended by this chapter to repeal, abrogate, or impair any
existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this
chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall
prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with this chapter are repealed to
the extent of the inconsistency only.
(Ord. 130, 5th Series, passed 3-16-2004)
§ 151.10 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   This chapter does not imply that areas outside the flood plain districts or
land uses permitted within the districts will be free from flooding or flood
damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city or any
officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on
this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

pipelines.
      (5)   Storage yards for equipment, machinery, or materials.
      (6)   Placement of fill or construction of fences.
      (7)   Recreational vehicles, either on individual lots of record or in
existing or new subdivisions or commercial or condominium type campgrounds,
subject to the exemptions and provisions of §
151.31(C).
      (8)   Structural works for flood control such as levees, dikes and
floodwalls constructed to any height where the intent is to protect individual
structures and levees or dikes where the intent is to protect agricultural
crops for a frequency flood event equal to or less than the 10-year frequency
flood event.
   (D)   Standards for conditional uses.
      (1)   No structure (temporary or permanent), fill (including fill for
roads and levees), deposit, obstruction, storage of materials or equipment, or
other uses may be allowed as a conditional use that will cause any increase in
the stage of the 100-year or regional flood or cause an increase in flood
damages in the reach or reaches affected.
      (2)   All floodway conditional uses shall be subject to the procedures
and standards contained in §
151.48.
      (3)   The conditional use shall be permissible in the underlying zoning
district if one exists.
      (4)   Fill:
         (a)   Fill, dredge spoil, and all other similar materials deposited or
stored in the flood plain shall be protected from erosion by vegetative cover,
mulching, riprap or other acceptable method.
         (b)   Dredge spoil sites and sand and gravel operations shall not be
allowed in the floodway unless a long-term site development plan is submitted
which includes an erosion/sedimentation prevention element to the plan.
         (c)   As an alternative, and consistent with subsection (b)
immediately above, dredge spoil disposal and sand and gravel operations may
allow temporary, on-site storage of fill or other materials which would have
caused an increase to the stage of the 100-year or regional flood but only
after the governing body has received an appropriate plan which assures the
removal of the materials from the floodway based upon the flood warning time
available. The conditional use permit must be title registered with the
property in the Office of the County Recorder.
      (5)   Accessory structures:
         (a)   Accessory structures shall not be designed for human habitation.
         (b)   Accessory structures, if permitted, shall be constructed and
placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the flow
of flood waters:
            1.   Whenever possible, structures shall be constructed with the
longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow; and
            2.   So far as practicable, structures shall be placed
approximately on the same flood flow lines as those of adjoining structures.
         (c)   Accessory structures shall be elevated on fill or structurally
dry flood proofed in accordance with the FP-1 or FP-2 flood proofing
classifications in the State Building Code. As an alternative, an accessory
structure may be flood proofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 flood proofing
classification in the State Building Code, provided the accessory structure
constitutes a minimal investment, does not exceed 500 square feet in size at
its largest projection, and for a detached garage, the detached garage must be
used solely for parking of vehicles and limited storage. All flood proofed
accessory structures must meet the following additional standards:
            1.   The structure must be adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure and shall be designed
to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls;
            2.   Any mechanical and utility equipment in a structure must be
elevated to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or properly
flood proofed; and
            3.   To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there
must be a minimum of 2 “automatic” openings in the outside walls of the
structure having a total net area of not less than 1 square inch for every
square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. There must be openings on at
least 2 sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings must be no higher
than 1 foot above the lowest adjacent grade to the structure. Using human
intervention to open a garage door prior to flooding will not satisfy this
requirement for automatic openings.
      (6)   Storage of materials and equipment:
         (a)   The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of
flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or
plant life is prohibited.
         (b)   Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if
readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning
and in accordance with a plan approved by the governing body.
      (7)   Structural works for flood control that will change the course,
current or cross section of protected wetlands or public waters shall be
subject to the provisions of M.S. Ch. 103G, as it may be amended from time to
time. Community-wide structural works for flood control intended to remove
areas from the regulatory flood plain shall not be allowed in the floodway.
      (8)   A levee, dike or floodwall constructed in the floodway shall not
cause an increase to the 100-year or regional flood and the technical analysis
must assume equal conveyance or storage loss on both sides of a stream.

§ 151.27 FLOOD FRINGE DISTRICT (FF).
   (A)   Permitted uses. Permitted uses shall be those uses of land or
structures listed as permitted uses in the underlying zoning use district(s).
If no pre-existing, underlying zoning use districts exist, then any residential
or non-residential structure or use of a structure or land shall be a permitted
use in the Flood Fringe District, provided the use does not constitute a public
nuisance. All permitted uses shall comply with the standards for Flood Fringe
District “permitted uses” listed in division (B) of this section and the
“standards for all Flood Fringe uses” listed in division (E) of this section.
   (B)   Standards for Flood Fringe permitted uses.
      (1)   All structures, including accessory structures, must be elevated on
fill so that the lowest floor, including basement floor, is at or above the
regulatory flood protection elevation. The finished fill elevation for
structures shall be no lower than 1 foot below the regulatory flood protection
elevation and the fill shall extend at such elevation at least 15 feet beyond
the outside limits of the structure erected thereon.
      (2)   As an alternative to elevation on fill, accessory structures that
constitute a minimal investment and that do not exceed 500 square feet at its
largest projection may be internally flood proofed in accordance with § 152.37
(D)(5)(c).
      (3)   The cumulative placement of fill where at any one time in excess of
1,000 cubic yards of fill is located on the parcel shall be allowable only as a
conditional use, unless the fill is specifically intended to elevate a
structure in accordance with subsection (1).
      (4)   The storage of any materials or equipment shall be elevated on fill
to the regulatory flood protection elevation.
      (5)   The provisions of division (E) of this section shall apply.
   (C)   Conditional uses. Any structure that is not elevated on fill or flood
proofed in accordance with subsections (B)(1) and (B)(2) and/or any use of land
that does not comply with the standards in subsections (B)(3) and (B)(4) shall
only be allowable as a conditional use. An application for a conditional use
shall be subject to the standards and criteria and evaluation procedures
specified in divisions (D) ad (E) of this section and §
151.48.
   (D)   Standards for conditional uses.
      (1)   Alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill may be
utilized to elevate a structure’s lowest floor above the regulatory flood
protection elevation. These alternative methods may include the use of stilts,
pilings, parallel walls, and the like, or above-grade, enclosed areas such as
crawl spaces or tuck under garages.
         (a)   The base or floor of an enclosed area shall be considered above-
grade and not a structure’s basement or lowest floor if:
            1.   The enclosed area is above-grade on at least one side of the
structure;
            2.   It is designed to internally flood and is constructed with
flood resistant materials; and
            3.   It is used solely for parking of vehicles, building access or
storage.
         (b)   The above-noted alternative elevation methods are subject to the
following additional standards:
            1.   Design and certification. The structure’s design and as-built
condition must be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect
as being in compliance with the general design standards of the State Building
Code and, specifically, that all electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and
air conditioning equipment and other service facilities must be at or above the
regulatory flood protection elevation or be designed to prevent flood water
from entering or accumulating within these components during times of flooding.
            2.   Specific standards for above-grade, enclosed areas. Above-
grade, fully enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages must be
designed to internally flood and the design plans must stipulate:
               a.   A minimum area of openings in the walls where internal
flooding is to be used as a flood proofing technique. There shall be a minimum
of 2 openings on at least 2 sides of the structure and the bottom of all
openings shall be no higher than 1-foot above grade. The automatic openings
shall have a minimum net area of not less than 1 square inch for every square
foot subject to flooding unless a registered professional engineer or architect
certifies that a smaller net area would suffice. The automatic openings may be
equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices, provided
that they permit the automatic entry and exit of flood waters without any form
of human intervention; and
               b.   That the enclosed area will be designed of flood resistant
materials in accordance with the FP-3 or FP-4 classifications in the State
Building Code and shall be used solely for building access, parking of vehicles
or storage.
      (2)   Basements, as defined by §
151.04, shall be subject to the following:
         (a)   Residential basement construction shall not be allowed below the
regulatory flood protection elevation;
         (b)   Non-residential basements may be allowed below the regulatory
flood protection elevation, provided the basement is structurally dry flood
proofed in accordance with subsection (3) below.
      (3)   All areas of non-residential structures, including basements to be
placed below the regulatory flood protection elevation, shall be flood proofed
in accordance with the structurally dry flood proofing classifications in the
State Building Code. Structurally dry flood proofing must meet the FP-1 or FP-
2 flood proofing classification in the State Building Code and this shall
require making the structure watertight with the walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of
buoyancy. Structures flood proofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 classification shall not
be permitted.
      (4)   When at any one time more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill or other
similar material is located on a parcel for such activities as on-site storage,
landscaping, sand and gravel operations, landfills, roads, dredge spoil
disposal or construction of flood control works, an erosion/sedimentation
control plan must be submitted unless the community is enforcing a state
approved shoreland management ordinance. In the absence of a state approved
shoreland ordinance, the plan must clearly specify methods to be used to
stabilize the fill on site for a flood event at a minimum of the 100-year or
regional flood event. The plan must be prepared and certified by a registered
professional engineer or other qualified individual acceptable to the governing
body. The plan may incorporate alternative procedures for removal of the
material from the flood plain if adequate flood warning time exists.
      (5)   Storage of materials and equipment:
         (a)   The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of
flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or
plant life is prohibited.
         (b)   Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if
readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning
and in accordance with a plan approved by the governing body.
      (6)   The provisions of division (E) of this section shall also apply.
   (E)   Standards for all Flood Fringe uses.
      (1)   All new principal structures must have vehicular access at or above
an elevation not more than 2 feet below the regulatory flood protection
elevation. If a variance to this requirement is granted, the Planning
Commission must specify limitations on the period of use or occupancy of the
structure for times of flooding and only after determining that adequate flood
warning time and local flood emergency response procedures exist.
      (2)   Commercial uses: accessory land uses, such as yards, railroad
tracks, and parking lots may be at elevations lower than the regulatory flood
protection elevation. However, a permit for the facilities to be used by the
employees or the general public shall not be granted in the absence of a flood
warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area would be
inundated to a depth and velocity such that when multiplying the depth (in
feet) times velocity (in feet per second) the product number exceeds 4 upon
occurrence of the regional flood.
      (3)   Manufacturing and industrial uses: measures shall be taken to
minimize interference with normal plant operations especially along streams
having protracted flood durations. Certain accessory land uses such as yards
and parking lots may be at lower elevations subject to requirements set out. in
subsection (2) above. In considering permit applications, due consideration
shall be given to needs of an industry whose business requires that it be
located in flood plain areas.
      (4)   Fill shall be properly compacted and the slopes shall be properly
protected by the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable method.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for
removing the special flood hazard area designation for certain structures
properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation - FEMA’s
requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection
standards for multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should
be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of
special flood hazard area designation will be requested.
      (5)   Flood plain developments shall not adversely affect the hydraulic
capacity of the channel and adjoining flood plain of any tributary watercourse
or drainage system where a floodway or other encroachment limit has not been
specified on the Official Zoning Map.
      (6)   Standards for recreational vehicles are contained in §
151.31(C).
      (7)   All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system that resists flotation, collapse and lateral
movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use
of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in
addition to applicable state or local anchoring requirements for resisting wind
forces.

§ 151.28 GENERAL FLOOD PLAIN DISTRICT.
   (A)   Permissible uses.
      (1)   The uses listed in §
151.26(A) shall be permitted uses.
      (2)   All other uses shall be subject to the floodway/flood fringe
evaluation criteria pursuant to division (B) below. Section 151.26 shall apply
if the proposed use is in the Floodway District and §
151.27 shall apply if the proposed use is in the Flood Fringe District.
   (B)   Procedures for Floodway and Flood Fringe determinations within the
General Flood Plain District.
      (1)   Upon receipt of an application for a permit or other approval
within the General Flood Plain District, the applicant shall be required to
furnish such of the following information as is deemed necessary by the Zoning
Administrator for the determination of the regulatory flood protection
elevation and whether the proposed use is within the Floodway or Flood Fringe
District.
         (a)   A typical valley cross-section(s) showing the channel of the
stream, elevation of land areas adjoining each side of the channel, cross-
sectional areas to be occupied by the proposed development, and high water
information.
         (b)   Plan (surface view) showing elevations or contours of the
ground, pertinent structure, fill, or storage elevations, the size, location,
and spatial arrangement of all proposed and existing structures on the site,
and the location and elevations of streets.
         (c)   Photographs showing existing land uses, vegetation upstream and
downstream, and soil types.
         (d)   Profile showing the slope of the bottom of the channel or flow
line of the stream for at least 500 feet in either direction from the proposed
development.
      (2)   The applicant shall be responsible to submit one copy of the above
information to a designated engineer or other expert person or agency for
technical assistance in determining whether the proposed use is in the Floodway
or Flood Fringe District and to determine the regulatory flood protection
elevation. Procedures consistent with Minn. Regs. 1983, Parts 6120.5000 -
6120.6200 and 44 C.F.R. part 65 shall be followed in this expert evaluation.
The designated engineer or expert is strongly encouraged to discuss the
proposed technical evaluation methodology with the respective Department of
Natural Resources’ Area Hydrologist prior to commencing the analysis. The
designated engineer or expert shall:
         (a)   Estimate the peak discharge of the regional flood;
         (b)   Calculate the water surface profile of the regional flood based
upon a hydraulic analysis of the stream channel and overbank areas;
         (c)   Compute the floodway necessary to convey or store the regional
flood without increasing flood stages more than 0.5 foot. A lesser stage
increase than 0.5 feet shall be required if, as a result of the additional
stage increase, increased flood damages would result. An equal degree of
encroachment on both sides of the stream within the reach shall be assumed in
computing floodway boundaries.
      (3)   The Zoning Administrator shall present the technical evaluation and
findings of the designated engineer or expert to the governing body. The
governing body must formally accept the technical evaluation and the
recommended Floodway and/or Flood Fringe District boundary or deny the permit
application. The Governing Body, prior to official action, may submit the
application and all supporting data and analyses to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, the Department of Natural Resources or the Planning
Commission for review and comment. Once the Floodway and Flood Fringe District
Boundaries have been determined, the Governing Body shall refer the matter back
to the Zoning Administrator, who shall process the permit application
consistent with the applicable provisions of §§
151.26 and
151.27.
(Ord. 130, 5th Series, passed 3-16-2004)
§ 151.29 SUBDIVISIONS.
   (A)   Review criteria. No land shall be subdivided which is unsuitable for
the reason of flooding, inadequate drainage, water supply or sewage treatment
facilities. All lots within the flood plain districts shall be able to contain
a building site outside of the Floodway District at or above the regulatory
flood protection elevation. All subdivisions shall have water and sewage
treatment facilities that comply with the provisions of this chapter and have
road access both to the subdivision and to the individual building sites no
lower than 2 feet below the regulatory flood protection elevation. For all
subdivisions in the flood plain, the Floodway and Flood Fringe District
boundaries, the regulatory flood protection elevation and the required
elevation of all access roads shall be clearly labeled on all required
subdivision drawings and platting documents.
   (B)   Floodway/Flood Fringe determinations in the General Flood Plain
District. In the General Flood Plain District, applicants shall provide the
information required in §
151.28(B) to determine the 100-year flood elevation, the Floodway and Flood
Fringe District boundaries and the regulatory flood protection elevation for
the subdivision site.
   (C)   Removal of special flood hazard area designation. The Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for removing the
special flood hazard area designation for certain structures properly elevated
on fill above the 100-year flood elevation. FEMA’s requirements incorporate
specific fill compaction and side slope protection standards for multi-
structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should be investigated
prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of special flood hazard
area designation will be requested..
(Ord. 130, 5th Series, passed 3-16-2004)
§ 151.30 UTILITIES, RAILROADS, ROADS, AND BRIDGES.
   (A)   Public utilities. All public utilities and facilities such as gas,
electrical, sewer, and water supply systems to be located in the flood plain
shall be flood proofed in accordance with the State Building Code or elevated
to above the regulatory flood protection elevation.
   (B)   Public transportation facilities. Railroad tracks, roads, and bridges
to be located within the flood plain shall comply with §§
151.26 and
151.27. Elevation to the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be
provided where failure or interruption of these transportation facilities would
result in danger to the public health or safety or where the facilities are
essential to the orderly functioning of the area. Minor or auxiliary roads or
railroads may be constructed at a lower elevation where failure or interruption
of transportation services would not endanger the public health or safety.
   (C)   On-site sewage treatment and water supply systems. Where public
utilities are not provided:
      (1)   On-site water supply systems must be designed to minimize or
eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems; and
      (2)   New or replacement on-site sewage treatment systems must be
designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems
and discharges from the systems into flood waters and they shall not be subject
to impairment or contamination during times of flooding. Any sewage treatment
system designed in accordance with the state’s current statewide standards for
on-site sewage treatment systems shall be determined to be in compliance with
this division.

§ 151.31 MANUFACTURED HOMES, TRAVEL TRAILERS AND TRAVEL VEHICLES.
   (A)   New manufactured home parks and expansions to existing manufactured
home parks shall be subject to the provisions placed on subdivisions by §
151.29.
   (B)   The placement of new or replacement manufactured homes in existing
manufactured home parks or on individual lots of record that are located in
flood plain districts will be treated as a new structure and may be placed only
if elevated in compliance with §
151.27. If vehicular road access for preexisting manufactured home parks is not
provided in accordance with §
151.27(A), then replacement manufactured homes will not be allowed until the
property owner(s) develops a flood warning emergency plan acceptable to the
Governing Body. All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an
adequately anchored foundation system that resists flotation, collapse and
lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited
to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in
addition to applicable state or local anchoring requirements for resisting wind
forces.
   (C)   Recreational vehicles that do not meet the exemption criteria
specified in subsection (1) below shall be subject to the provisions of this
chapter and as specifically spelled out in subsections (3) and (4) below.
      (1)   Exemption. Recreational vehicles are exempt from the provisions of
this chapter if they are placed in any of the areas listed in subsection (2)
below and they meet the following criteria:
         (a)   Have current licenses required for highway use;
         (b)   Are highway ready, meaning on wheels or the internal jacking
system, are attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities
commonly used in campgrounds and recreational vehicle parks and the
recreational vehicle has no permanent structural type additions attached to it;
         (c)   The recreational vehicle and associated use must be permissible
in any pre-existing, underlying zoning use district.
      (2)   Areas exempted for placement of recreational vehicles.
         (a)   Individual lots or parcels of record.
         (b)   Existing commercial recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds.
         (c)   Existing condominium type associations.
      (3)   Loss of exemption. Recreational vehicles exempted in subsection (1)
lose this exemption when development occurs on the parcel exceeding $500 for a
structural addition to the recreational vehicle or exceeding $500 for an
accessory structure such as a garage or storage building. The recreational
vehicle and all additions and accessory structures will then be treated as a
new structure and shall be subject to the elevation/flood proofing requirements
and the use of land restrictions specified in §§
151.26 and
151.27. There shall be no development or improvement on the parcel or
attachment to the recreational vehicle that hinders the removal of the
recreational vehicle to a flood free location should flooding occur.
      (4)   New uses and expansion of existing uses. New commercial
recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds and new residential type subdivisions
and condominium associations and the expansion of any existing similar use
exceeding 5 units or dwelling sites shall be subject to the following:
         (a)   Any new or replacement recreational vehicle will be allowed in
the Floodway or Flood Fringe Districts, provided the recreational vehicle and
its contents are placed on fill above the regulatory flood protection elevation
and proper elevated road access to the site exists in accordance with §
151.27(A). No fill placed in the floodway to meet the requirements of this
division shall increase flood stages of the 100-year or regional flood;
         (b)   All new or replacement recreational vehicles not meeting the
criteria of subsection (a) above may, as an alternative, be allowed as a
conditional use if in accordance with the following provisions and the
provisions of §
151.48. The applicant must submit an emergency plan for the safe evacuation of
all vehicles and people during the 100-year flood. The plan shall be prepared
by a registered engineer or other qualified individual, shall demonstrate that
adequate time and personnel exist to carry out the evacuation, and shall
demonstrate the provisions of subsections (C)(1) and (2) of this section will
be met. All attendant sewage and water facilities for new or replacement
recreational vehicles must be protected or constructed so as to not be impaired
or contaminated during times of flooding in accordance with §
151.30(C).
(Ord. 130, 5th Series, passed 3-16-2004)
§ 151.32 NONCONFORMING USES.
   (A)   A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful
before the passage or amendment of this chapter but which is not in conformity
with the provisions of this chapter may be continued subject to the following
conditions. Historic structures, as defined in §
151.04, shall be subject to the provisions of subsections (1) through (5)
below.
      (1)   No such use shall be expanded, changed, enlarged, or altered in a
way that increases its nonconformity.
      (2)   Any structural alteration or addition to a nonconforming structure
or nonconforming use which would result in increasing the flood damage
potential of that structure or use shall be protected to the regulatory flood
protection elevation in accordance with any of the elevation on fill or flood
proofing techniques (including, FP-1 thru FP-4 floodproofing classifications)
allowable in the State Building Code, except as further restricted in
subsections (3) and (6) below.
      (3)   The cost of any structural alterations or additions to any
nonconforming structure over the life of the structure shall not exceed 50% of
the market value of the structure unless the conditions of this subsection are
satisfied. The cost of all structural alterations and additions constructed
since the adoption of the community’s initial flood plain controls must be
calculated into today’s current cost, which will include all costs such as
construction materials and a reasonable cost placed on all manpower or labor.
If the current cost of all previous and proposed alterations and additions
exceeds 50% of the current market value of the structure, then the structure
must meet the standards of §§
151.26 and
151.27 for new structures depending upon whether the structure is in the
Floodway or Flood Fringe District, respectively.
      (4)   If any nonconforming use is discontinued for 12 consecutive months,
any future use of the building premises shall conform to this chapter. The
Assessor shall notify the Zoning Administrator in writing of instances of
nonconforming uses that have been discontinued for a period of 12 months.
      (5)   If any nonconforming use or structure is substantially damaged, as
defined in §
151.04, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions
of this chapter. The applicable provisions for establishing new uses or new
structures in §§
151.26, 151.27 and 151.28 will apply depending upon whether the use or
structure is in the Floodway, Flood Fringe or General Flood Plain District,
respectively.
      (6)   If a substantial improvement occurs, as defined in §
151.05, from any combination of a building addition to the outside dimensions
of the existing building or a rehabilitation, reconstruction, alteration, or
other improvement to the inside dimensions of an existing nonconforming
building, then the building addition (as required by subsection (2) above) and
the existing nonconforming building must meet the requirements of §§
151.26 or
151.27 for new structures, depending upon whether the structure is in the
Floodway or Flood Fringe District, respectively.

§ 151.46 PERMITS, CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS AND RECORD KEEPING.
   (A)   Permit required. A permit issued by the Zoning Administrator in
conformity with the provisions of this chapter shall be secured prior to the
erection, addition, modification, rehabilitation (including normal maintenance
and repair), or alteration of any building, structure, or portion thereof;
prior to the use or change of use of a building, structure, or land; prior to
the construction of a dam, fence, or on-site septic system; prior to the change
or extension of a nonconforming use; prior to the repair of a structure that
has been damaged by flood, fire, tornado, or any other source; and prior to the
placement of fill, excavation of materials, or the storage of materials or
equipment within the flood plain.
   (B)   Application for permit. Application for a permit shall be made in
duplicate to the Zoning Administrator on forms furnished by the Zoning
Administrator and shall include the following where applicable: plans in
duplicate drawn to scale, showing the nature, location, dimensions, and
elevations of the lot; existing or proposed structures, fill, or storage of
materials; and the location of the foregoing in relation to the stream channel.
   (C)   State and federal permits. Prior to granting a permit or processing an
application for a conditional use permit or variance, the Zoning Administrator
shall determine that the applicant has obtained all necessary state and federal
permits.
   (D)   Certificate of zoning compliance for a new, altered, or nonconforming
use. It shall be unlawful to use, occupy, or permit the use or occupancy of any
building or premises or part thereof hereafter created, erected, changed,
converted, altered, or enlarged in its use or structure until a certificate of
zoning compliance shall have been issued by the Zoning Administrator stating
that the use of the building or land conforms to the requirements of this
chapter.
   (E)   Construction and use to be as provided on applications, plans,
permits, variances and certificates of zoning compliance. Permits, conditional
use permits, or certificates of zoning compliance issued on the basis of
approved plans and applications authorize only the use, arrangement, and
construction set forth in such approved plans and applications and no other
use, arrangement, or construction. Any use, arrangement, or construction at
variance with that authorized shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and
punishable as provided by §
151.98.
   (F)   Certification. The applicant shall be required to submit certification
by a registered professional engineer, registered architect, or registered land
surveyor that the finished fill and building elevations were accomplished in
compliance with the provisions of this chapter. Flood proofing measures shall
be certified by a registered professional engineer or registered architect.
   (G)   Record of first floor elevation. The Zoning Administrator shall
maintain a record of the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) of
all new structures and alterations or additions to existing structures in the
flood plain. The Zoning Administrator shall also maintain a record of the

flood proofed.
   (H)   Notifications for watercourse alterations. The Zoning Administrator
shall notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the Commissioner
of the Department of Natural Resources prior to the community authorizing any
alteration or relocation of a watercourse. If the applicant has applied for a
permit to work in the beds of public waters pursuant to M.S. Ch. 103G, as it
may be amended from time to time, this shall suffice as adequate notice to the
Commissioner of Natural Resources. A copy of the notification shall also be
submitted to the Chicago Regional Office of the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA).
   (I)   Notification to FEMA when physical changes increase or decrease the
100-year flood elevation. As soon as is practicable, but not later than 6
months after the date the supporting information becomes available, the Zoning
Administrator shall notify the Chicago Regional Office of FEMA of the changes
by submitting a copy of the technical or scientific data.
(Ord. 130, 5th Series, passed 3-16-2004)
§ 151.47 APPEALS AND VARIANCES; DUTIES OF PLANNING COMMISSION.
   (A)   Rules. The Planning Commission shall adopt rules for the conduct of
business and may exercise all of the powers conferred on planning commissions
by state law.
   (B)   Administrative review. The Planning Commission shall hear and decide
appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision,
or determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement or
administration of this chapter.
   (C)   Variances. The Planning Commission may authorize upon appeal in
specific cases relief or variance from the terms of this chapter as will not be
contrary to the public interest and only for those circumstances such as
hardship, practical difficulties or circumstances unique to the property under
consideration, as provided for in the respective enabling legislation for
planning and zoning for cities or counties as appropriate. In the granting of
the variance, the Planning Commission shall clearly identify in writing the
specific conditions that existed consistent with the criteria specified in this
chapter, any other zoning regulations in the community, and in the respective
enabling legislation that justified the granting of the variance. No variance
shall have the effect of allowing in any district uses prohibited in that
district, permit a lower degree of flood protection than the regulatory flood
protection elevation for the particular area, or permit standards lower than
those required by state law. The following additional variance criteria of the
Federal Emergency Management Agency must be satisfied:
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued by a community within any designated
regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood
discharge would result;
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued by a community upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
   (D)   Hearings. Upon filing with the Planning Commission of an appeal from a
decision of the Zoning Administrator, or an application for a variance, the
Planning Commission shall fix a reasonable time for a hearing and give due
notice to the parties in interest as specified by law. The Planning Commission
shall submit by mail to the Commissioner of Natural Resources a copy of the
application for proposed variances sufficiently in advance so that the
Commissioner will receive at least 10 days notice of the hearing.
   (E)   Decisions. The Planning Commission shall arrive at a decision on the
appeal or variance within 30 days. In passing upon an appeal, the Planning
Commission may, so long as the action is in conformity with the provisions of
this chapter, reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or modify the order,
requirement, decision or determination of the Zoning Administrator or other
public official. It shall make its decision in writing setting forth the
findings of fact and the reasons for its decisions. In granting a variance the
Planning Commission may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards such as
those specified in §
151.48(F), which are in conformity with the purposes of this chapter.
Violations of the conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms
under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this
chapter punishable under §
151.98. A copy of all decisions granting variances shall be forwarded by mail
to the Commissioner of Natural Resources within 10 days of the action.
   (F)   Appeals. Appeals from any decision of the Planning Commission may be
made and as specified in this community’s official controls and also by
Minnesota Statutes.
   (G)   Flood insurance notice and record keeping. The Zoning Administrator
shall notify the applicant for a variance that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to
amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and
      (2)   The construction below the 100-year or regional flood level
increases risks to life and property. The notification shall be maintained with
a record of all variance actions. A community shall maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report the
variances issued in its annual or biennial report submitted to the
Administrator of the National Flood Insurance Program.
(Ord. 130, 5th Series, passed 3-16-2004)
§ 151.48 CONDITIONAL USES; STANDARDS AND EVALUATION PROCEDURES.
   The Planning Commission shall hear and decide applications for conditional
uses permissible under this chapter. Applications shall be submitted to the
Zoning Administrator who shall forward the application to Planning Commission
for consideration.
   (A)   Hearings. Upon filing with the Planning Commission an application for
a conditional use permit, the City Administrator shall submit by mail to the

flood heights and velocities, the seriousness of flood damage to the use, the
adequacy of the plans for protection, and other technical matters.
      (3)   Based upon the technical evaluation of the designated engineer or
expert, the City Council shall determine the specific flood hazard at the site
and evaluate the suitability of the proposed use in relation to the flood
hazard.
   (D)   Factors upon which the decision of the City Council shall be based. In
passing upon conditional use applications, the City Council shall consider all
relevant factors specified in other subdivisions of this chapter, and:
      (1)   The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments;
      (2)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands or
downstream to the injury of others or they may block bridges, culverts or other
hydraulic structures;
      (3)   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of
these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary conditions;
      (4)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of the damage on the individual owner;
      (5)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to

§ 151.49 AMENDMENTS
   (A)   The flood plain designation on the Official Zoning Map shall not be
removed from flood plain areas unless it can be shown that the designation is
in error or that the area has been filled to or above the elevation of the
regulatory flood protection elevation and is contiguous to lands outside the
flood plain. Special exceptions to this rule may be permitted by the
Commissioner of Natural Resources if he or she determines that, through other
measures, lands are adequately protected for the intended use.
   (B)   All amendments to this chapter, including amendments to the Official
Zoning Map, must be submitted to and approved by the Commissioner of Natural
Resources prior to adoption. Changes in the Official Zoning Map must meet the
Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Technical Conditions and Criteria

§ 151.98 VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with
any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards
established in connection with grants of variances or conditional uses) shall
constitute a misdemeanor and shall be punishable as defined by law.
   (B)   Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city from taking such other
lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. The actions
may include but are not limited to:
      (1)   In responding to a suspected ordinance violation, the Zoning
Administrator and local government may utilize the full array of enforcement
actions available to it, including, but not limited to prosecution and fines,
injunctions, after-the-fact permits, orders for corrective measures or a
request to the National Flood Insurance Program for denial of flood insurance
availability to the guilty party. The community must act in good faith to
enforce these official controls and to correct ordinance violations to the
extent possible so as not to jeopardize its eligibility in the National Flood
Insurance Program.
      (2)   When an ordinance violation is either discovered by or brought to
the attention of the Zoning Administrator, the Zoning Administrator shall
immediately investigate the situation and document the nature and extent of the
violation of the official control. As soon as is reasonably possible, this
information will be submitted to the appropriate Department of Natural
Resources and Federal Emergency Management Agency Regional Office along with
the community’s plan of action to correct the violation to the degree possible.
      (3)   The Zoning Administrator shall notify the suspected party of the
requirements of this chapter and all other official controls and the nature and
extent of the suspected violation of these controls. If the structure and/or
use is under construction or development, the Zoning Administrator may order
the construction or development immediately halted until a proper permit or
approval is granted by the Community. If the construction or development is
already completed, then the Zoning Administrator may either:
         (a)   Issue an order identifying the corrective actions that must be
made within a specified time period to bring the use or structure into
compliance with the official controls; or
         (b)   Notify the responsible party to apply for an after-the-fact
permit/development approval within a specified period of time not to exceed 30-
days.
      (4)   If the responsible party does not appropriately respond to the
Zoning Administrator within the specified period of time, each additional day
that lapses shall constitute an additional violation of this chapter and shall
be prosecuted accordingly. The Zoning Administrator shall also upon the lapse
of the specified response period notify the landowner to restore the land to
the condition which existed prior to the violation of this chapter.

final plat shall be filed with the City Administrator, 1 of the 4 copies shall
be on a reproducible medium.
      (2)   Consideration by the Planning Commission.
         (a)   The final plat shall be submitted to the City Administrator at
least 10 days prior to the Planning Commission meeting at which the same shall
be considered. The City Engineer or City Administrator shall prepare a report
thereon setting out whether or not the final plat is in substantial agreement
with the preliminary plat, if any, and if not, in which particulars it varies
therefrom, and whether or not it conforms to the requirements of law, and that
the final plat meets all the conditions attached to the final approval of the
preliminary plat.
         (b)   The Planning Commission shall consider the final plat at a
regular, special or adjourned meeting.
         (c)   The Planning Commission shall have the authority to recommend
approval or disapproval of the final plat. If it shall determine that it cannot
approve it unless certain conditions are attached, it shall by findings setting
forth the conditions for approval and forthwith send a copy of such to the
subdivider and all further action on the plat shall be suspended until the
subdivider shall respond thereto; provided that if no further action is taken
by the subdivider within a period of 3 months from the date of the adoption of
the conditions, the plat shall be deemed to be disapproved.
         (d)   Final action by motion on the final plat shall be communicated
forthwith to the subdivider by the Secretary of the Planning Commission, and a
copy of the findings shall be sent to the Council, together with the plat, and
such other data as the Commission shall determine.
      (3)   Consideration by the Council.
         (a)   Upon the adoption of the motion of approval or disapproval by

review.
         (b)   If the Council is not satisfied with the final plat as
presented, it may:
            1.   Disapprove the same;
            2.   Set forth the conditions and requirements as it shall require
to be fulfilled before the same is approved; or
            3.   Refer the same to the Planning Commission for such further
action as it shall determine. Upon the referral, the Planning Commission shall
act thereon at the next meeting and report back to the Council no later than 45
days after the action of the Council.
         (c)   If the Council shall determine to accept the plat, it shall by
resolution so determine, and the resolution shall provide for the acceptance of
all streets, alleys, easements or other public ways, parks, and other spaces
dedicated to public purposes.
         (d)   The action of the Council finally determining the matter shall
be communicated by the City Administrator to the subdivider, and if the plat be
disapproved, the City Administrator shall set forth the reasons given by the
Council for the determination.
      (4)   City Attorney’s approval. Before any such final action shall be
taken, the plat and abstracts of title shall be referred to the City Attorney
for his or her examination and opinion both as to title and proceedings,
together with the date for hearing thereon which shall afford sufficient time
for his or her examination, preparation of opinions, and publication of the
necessary notice of hearing.
      (5)   Hearing. After the City Attorney’s examination of title and
proceedings, he or she shall prepare a notice of time and place for a public
hearing thereon, which notice shall be published once in the official newspaper
at least 10 days prior to the date of hearing. At the public hearing before the
Council all persons interested in the plat shall be heard and the Council may
thereafter approve or disapprove the plat but failure of the Council to act on
the application within 60 days is deemed approval. The grounds for disapproval
shall be set forth in findings served upon the subdivider.
(1998 Code, § 11.06)
§ 152.23 RESTRICTIONS ON FILING AND RECORDING CONVEYANCES.
   (A)   Metes and bounds descriptions. After the date of filing or recording
of the initial subdivision regulations, no conveyance of land shall be filed or
recorded if it is described in the conveyance by metes and bounds or by
reference to an unapproved registered land survey made after the effective date
of these regulations, but this subdivision does not apply to a conveyance if
the land:
      (1)   Was a separate parcel of record on the effective date of these
subdivision regulations, or was the subject of a written agreement to convey
entered into prior to such time; or
      (2)   Was a separate parcel of land of not less than 2.5 acres in area
and 150 feet in width on January 1, 1966, or is a single parcel of land of not
less than 5 acres and having a width of not less than 300 feet.
   (B)   Waiver, penalty and remedies.
      (1)   Waiver. In any case in which compliance with the foregoing
restrictions will create an unnecessary hardship and failure to comply does not
interfere with the purpose of the subdivision regulations, the Council may
waive the compliance by adoption of a resolution to that effect, and the
conveyance may then be filed or recorded.
      (2)   Penalty. Any owner or agent of the owner of land who conveys a lot
or parcel in violation of the provisions of this section shall forfeit and pay
to the city a penalty of not less than $100 for each lot or parcel so conveyed.
      (3)   Remedies. The city may enjoin the conveyance or may recover the
penalty by a civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction.
(1998 Code, § 11.07)
§ 152.24 PERMITS.
   No permit for the erection of a building shall be issued unless the building
is to be located on a parcel of land abutting on a street which has been
designated on an approved plat or on the official map, or which has been
otherwise approved by the Council, and unless the building conforms to the
established building line. This limitation on issuing permits shall not apply
to planned developments approved by the Council pursuant to the Zoning Code. No
permit shall be issued for the construction of a building on any lot or parcel
conveyed in violation of the provisions of this chapter.
(1998 Code, § 11.08)
§ 152.25 EASEMENTS.
   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, all electric and gas
distribution lines or piping, roadways, curbs, walks, and other similar
improvements shall be constructed only on a street, or other public way or
easement which is designated on an approved plat, or properly indicated on the
official map of the city, or which has otherwise been approved by the Council.
(1998 Code, § 11.09)
§ 152.26 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Applications. Applications for any variance may be submitted in
writing to the City Administrator by any aggrieved party at any time stating
fully and clearly all facts relied upon by the petitioner. The petition may be
supplemented with maps, plans, or other additional data which may aid the
Planning Commission in the analysis of the proposed variance. Overall plans for
any development shall be included with the covenants, restrictions, or other
legal provisions necessary. The application shall be forthwith transmitted to
the Planning Commission.
   (B)   Hearing. At the time of its first consideration of the application,
the Planning Commission shall determine whether or not other persons are
affected by the request and if so shall forthwith set a date for hearing and
give the mailed or published notice of hearing that seems reasonable under the
circumstances. Findings shall be made by the Planning Commission and
transmitted to the Council which may review and adopt the same or remand for
rehearing. Upon adoption the findings shall be forthwith transmitted to all
interested parties and served upon them by mail.
   (C)   Grounds. No variance shall be granted unless the Planning Commission
finds:
      (1)   That there are special circumstances affecting the property such
that the strict application of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the
applicant of the reasonable use of his or her land; and
      (2)   That the variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment
of a substantial property right of the petitioner; and
      (3)   That the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the
public welfare or injurious to other property in the territory in which the
property is situated.
(1998 Code, § 11.10)
DESIGN STANDARDS AND REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS
§ 152.40 BLOCKS.
   (A)   Block length. In general, intersecting streets, determining block
lengths, shall be provided at such intervals as to serve cross-traffic
adequately and to meet existing streets. Where no existing plats control, the
blocks in residential subdivisions shall normally not exceed 1,000 feet in
length, except where topography or other conditions justify a departure from
this maximum. In blocks longer than 800 feet, pedestrian ways and/or easements
through the block may be required. The width and location of the pedestrian
ways shall be subject to the approval of the City Engineer and the Planning
Commission. Blocks for business or industrial use should normally not exceed
600 feet in length.
   (B)   Block width. The width of the block shall normally be sufficient to
allow 2 tiers of lots of appropriate depth. Blocks intended for business or
industrial use shall be of such width as to be considered most suitable for
their respective use, including adequate space for off-street parking and
deliveries.
(1998 Code, § 11.03(1)(A))
§ 152.41 STREETS AND ALLEYS.
   (A)   The arrangement of thoroughfares and collector streets shall conform
as nearly as possible to the Comprehensive Plan. Except for cul-de-sacs,
streets normally shall connect with streets already dedicated in adjoining or
adjacent subdivisions, or provide for future connections to adjoining
unsubdivided tracts, or shall be a reasonable projection of streets in the
nearest subdivided tracts. The arrangement of thoroughfares and collector
streets shall be considered in their relation to the reasonable circulation of
traffic, to topographic conditions, to run-off storm water, to public
convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation to the proposed use
of the area to be served.
   (B)   Minor streets should be so planned as to discourage their use by non-
local traffic. Dead-end streets are prohibited, but cul-de-sacs will be
permitted where topography or other conditions justify their use. Permanent
cul-de-sacs shall normally not be longer than 500 feet, including a terminal
turn-around which shall be provided at the closed end, with a right-of-way
radius of not less than 50 feet.
   (C)   Where the plat to be submitted includes only part of the tract owned
or intended for development by the subdivider, a tentative plan of a proposed
future street system for the unsubdivided portion shall be prepared and
submitted by the subdivider.
   (D)   When a tract is subdivided into larger than normal building lots or
parcels, the lots or parcels shall be so arranged as to permit the logical
location and openings of future streets and appropriate resubdivision, with
provision for adequate utility connections for the resubdivision.
   (E)   Under normal conditions, streets shall be laid out so as to intersect
as nearly as possible at right angles, except where topography or other
conditions justify variations. The minimum angle of intersection of streets
shall be 80 degrees. Street intersection jogs with an offset of less than 125
feet shall be avoided.
   (F)   Wherever the proposed subdivision contains or is adjacent to the
right-of-way of a limited access U.S. or state highway or thoroughfare,
provision may be made for a marginal access approximately parallel and adjacent
to the boundary of such right-of-way, or for a street at a distance suitable
for the appropriate use of land between the street and right-of-way. The
distance shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance
required for approach connections to future grade separations, grade crossings
or for lot depths.
   (G)   Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial districts,
except that this requirement may be waived where other definite and assured
provision is made for service access, such as off-street loading, unloading and
parking consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed. Alleys, where
provided, shall not be less than 16 feet wide for residential alleys and not
less than 25 feet wide for commercial and industrial alleys. Dead-end alleys
shall not be permitted, except that this requirement may be waived where an
adequate turn-around is provided.
   (H)   Dedication of half streets will not be approved, except where it is
essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision and in conformity
with the other requirements of these regulations, where it is found that it
will be practical to require the dedication of the other half when the
adjoining property is subdivided, or where it becomes necessary to acquire the
remaining half by condemnation so it may be improved in the public interest.
   (I)   (1)   For all public ways hereafter dedicated and accepted, the
minimum right-of-way widths for streets and thoroughfares shall be as shown in
the Comprehensive Plan, and where not shown therein, the minimum right-of-way
width for streets, thoroughfares, alleys, or pedestrian ways included in any
subdivision shall not be less than the minimum dimensions for each
classification as follows:
Arterial highway            80 feet
Thoroughfare                80 feet
Collector street            75 feet
Minor street                66 feet
Marginal access street      50 feet
Residential alley           16 feet
Industrial-commercial alley 25 feet
Pedestrian way              10 feet
 
      (2)   Where existing or anticipated traffic on thoroughfares warrants
greater widths of right-of-way, these shall be required.
   (J)   All proposed streets shall be offered for dedication as public
streets. No private streets shall be permitted, except as set forth in other
City Code provisions.
(1998 Code, § 11.03(1)(B))
§ 152.42 EASEMENTS.
   (A)   An easement for utilities, at least 6 feet wide, shall be dedicated
along each side of the rear lot line of lots and along any other lot line as
may be deemed necessary to form a continuous right-of-way, at least 12 feet in
width. If necessary for the extension of main water or sewer lines or similar
utilities, easements of greater width may be required along lot lines or across
lots.
   (B)   Utility easements shall connect with easements established in
adjoining properties.
   (C)   Where a subdivision is traversed by a water course, drainage way,
channel, or stream, a storm water easement, drainage right-of-way or park
dedication, whichever the Planning Commission may deem the most adequate, shall
be dedicated.
(1998 Code, § 11.03(1)(C))
§ 152.43 PUBLIC SITES AND OPEN SPACES.
   In subdividing land or resubdividing an existing plat, due consideration
shall be given by the subdivider to the dedication of suitable sites for
schools, parks, playgrounds, conservation areas, or other public or semipublic
recreational areas or open spaces. Areas so dedicated or reserved shall conform
as nearly as possible to the Comprehensive Plan. All areas to be reserved for
or dedicated to public use shall be indicated on the preliminary plat in order
that it may be determined when and in what manner the areas will be dedicated
to or acquired by the appropriate agency.
(1998 Code, § 11.03(1)(D))
§ 152.44 BASIC IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   Approval.
         (a)   Before a final plat may be approved by the Council, the owner
shall execute and submit to the Council an agreement which shall be binding on
his or her heirs, personal representatives and assigns, that he or she shall
cause no private construction on the land, except with approval of the City
Engineer, until all improvements required under this chapter have been
petitioned for, arranged for, or have been constructed.
         (b)   No final plat shall be approved by the Council without first
receiving a report from the City Engineer certifying that the improvements
described herein, together with the agreements and documents required herein
will meet the minimum requirements of all applicable City Code provisions.
         (c)   A certified copy of the plat restrictions shall be filed with
the City Administrator and County Recorder which shall include a provision
that, in all instruments of sale or conveyance given before all street
improvements have been made, the grantee shall agree to and approve the
improvements and the assessment of their cost.
      (2)   City financing. Upon recommendation of the Engineer and with the
approval of the Council, any or all of the required improvements may be
financed and assessed as under the Local Improvement Code.
      (3)   Financing by developer. If deemed advisable and to be in the best
interests of the city, the Council may require the developer to finance and pay
for any or all improvements. Prior to the making of the required improvements,
the owner or subdivider shall deliver to the City Administrator a complete copy
of all plans and specifications for the projected improvement or improvements.
These plans and specifications must be approved by the Council if the developer
contracts the improvements to be done, the contract likewise, must be submitted
to the Council and its approval secured. The city shall have the authority,
from time to time, to examine the progress of the work to insure that it
complies with the plans and specifications.
   (B)   Improvements. The following improvements shall be constructed as
provided for in this subdivision. Programming of improvements shall be approved
by the City Engineer.
      (1)   City obligations. The city will construct, furnish and install at
city expense, the following improvements. Furnishing of these improvements
shall be commensurate with available city funds for such work and according to
programs and priorities as established by the Council. If the developer would
desire any of these improvements sooner than the city would be able to furnish
them, then the costs of the following improvements shall be paid for by the
developer.
         (a)   Storm sewer. Storm sewer mains will be constructed by the city
as funds are available. Connection shall be made at the boundary of the
subdivision, if available, or to some other approved discharge outlet. The
developer shall secure or provide the necessary easements or discharge permits.
This requirement shall not prevent the city from acquiring necessary easements
by eminent domain. Any costs for the easements shall be borne by the developer.
         (b)   Street lighting. Street lighting shall be constructed by the
city, preferably after curb and gutter have been installed. If additional or
other type of lighting is desired by the developer, he or she shall pay the
increased cost thereof.
         (c)   Signs. Street name signs and traffic control signs shall be
installed by the city.
      (2)   Obligation of the developer. The developer shall pay the
proportionate amount of the following improvements on or for his or her
subdivision or development.
         (a)   Site grading. Necessary site grading shall be accomplished by
the subdivider.
         (b)   Street grading. Street grading for the full width of right-of-
way shall be accomplished by the subdivider. If no site grading is to be
accomplished, the street grading will be included with subsequent street
improvements. Street grading shall precede any underground work. Where street
grading is not to be immediately followed by street paving, the developer may
be required to provide permanent grade markers at the right-of-way line of all
streets of a standard approved by the City Engineer.
         (c)   Street improvements. Street improvements, including base, curb
and gutter, boulevard sodding, inlets and leads, and paving, according to
standard city specifications or as approved by the City Engineer, shall be
constructed. All required underground work shall have preceded any permanent
street improvements. Any improvements on a county road shall be approved by the
County Engineer. Temporary construction may, at the discretion of the City
Engineer, be required, for just cause, on any street, streets, or portion
thereof. Reconstruction or alteration in any way of existing streets affected
by the plat or improvements thereupon shall be subject to the approval of the
City Engineer. All costs therein incurred, for either temporary access or
reconstruction, shall be borne by the owner or subdivider. Half streets, if
accepted, shall be improved as directed by the City Engineer.
         (d)   Sanitary sewer. Where city sewer is, or will be, available at
the boundary of the subdivision, it shall be constructed according to city
specifications. The cost of any required pumping stations, deemed necessary by
the Engineer shall be assessed against the benefitting property. Where it is
neither practical nor economical for the city to extend city sewer, private
sewage disposal facilities shall be constructed according to city and state
specifications. Consideration shall be given to future availability of city
sewer in such installations. The information shall be recorded on the plat and
in each deed so affected.
         (e)   Water. Where it is neither practical nor economical for the city
to extend city water, private water supplies shall be constructed according to
city and state specifications.
         (f)   Trees. Boulevard trees, if desired, shall be installed by the
owner or developer in accordance with city standards.

(Ord. 109, 5th Series, passed 6-3-1999)
§ 153.037 ALLOWABLE USES.
   (A)   Uses allowed in any district.
      (1)   Permitted principal uses (“P”): those uses that are allowed as a
matter of right. Permitted multiple family residential, business or industrial
uses are required to submit a site plan in accordance with the requirements in
§§
153.169 through
153.172.
      (2)   Conditional (“C”) or Interim (“I”) Uses: those uses that are
allowed only after issuance of a conditional or interim use permit as required
in §§
153.169 through
153.172. Conditional or interim uses may include:
         (a)   Uses listed as conditional or interim uses on the Land Use
Chart;
         (b)   Uses not listed on the Land Use Chart as either permitted,
conditional or interim uses, but which have been reviewed by the Planning
Commission and designated by the City Council as conditional or interim uses
that are similar to those listed;
         (c)   Multiple operational uses as defined herein, if at least one of
the operations is classified as a conditional use.
      (3)   Accessory uses (“A”): those uses that are incidental to the
principal use of the premises on which it is conducted. Customary accessory
uses such as off street parking and signs and essential services are permitted
in each district.
      (4)   Planned Unit Development - PUD (“D”): those uses allowed only after
issuance of a PUD permit. Uses allowed in a PUD may include permitted uses,
uses by conditional use permit, and accessory uses. The underlying zoning
district(s) establishes the basic allowable uses and the general development
standards.
   (B)   Building and demolition permits required. Building permits must be
secured for any new construction or alteration, and a demolition permit must be
obtained for demolition of any building, pursuant to the provisions of the
State Building Code and the City Code.
   (C)   Accessory use regulations. Accessory uses in each district shall be
permitted where they are customarily incidental to the uses therein set forth.
   (D)   Accessory uses for nonresidential uses in residential districts. The
following accessory uses, in addition to those herein before specified, shall
be permitted in any residence district if the accessory uses do not alter the
character of the premises in respect to their permitted use:
      (1)   The operation of necessary facilities and equipment in connection
with schools, colleges, universities, hospitals and other institutions
permitted in the district;
      (2)   Recreation, refreshment and service buildings in public parks and
playgrounds;
      (3)   Storm/fallout shelters.
   (E)   Accessory building standards.
      (1)   In case an accessory building is attached to the main building, it
shall be made structurally a part of the main building and shall comply in all
respects with the requirements of this chapter applicable to the main building.
An accessory building in a residential district, unless attached to and made a
part of the main building, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.
      (2)   Detached accessory buildings (including garages) may be built or
placed in - but may occupy no more than 30% of - the required rear yard. The
minimum side and rear yard setback therefor shall be 4 feet. No such accessory
building shall have a floor area greater than 1000 sq. ft. (except in “AR”
districts, where this floor area restriction does not apply). The property
owner may build a detached accessory building on an adjoining tract or lot in
certain cases where the property owner owns 2 tracts or lots that are
contiguous to one another and which are similarly zoned to allow detached
accessory buildings. It does not matter if the tracts or lots are in the same
platted subdivision, different platted subdivisions, or are not platted and
described by "metes and bounds." The tracts or lots cannot be separated by a
public or private right-of-way or a natural or manmade physical barrier. The
property owner must apply to the city for an exception, approved by the
Planning Commission and City Council, to insure all other aspects of the city
code will be addressed and to ensure homogeneity in neighborhoods throughout
the city. The exception, if approved, must be recorded in the records of the
Jackson County Minnesota Recorders Office. The exception shall terminate
automatically if the tracts or lots are not owned by the same person(s) or
entity and the detached accessory building can then no longer be maintained and
must be removed. For purposes of this section, corner lots have 2 front yards
and only 1 side yard.
      (3)   Minimum structural requirements for all detached accessory
buildings in residential zoning districts (except the AR District) shall
conform to the following minimum standard requirements:
         (a)   The roof style of the accessory building shall be similar to the
roof style of the dwelling;
         (b)   The height of any accessory building may not exceed the height
of the dwelling;
         (c)   Unpainted metal exterior finishes are prohibited for accessory
buildings that have ground coverage of greater than 120 square feet;
         (d)   The construction shall conform to the Uniform Building Code as
adopted by the City Council;
         (e)   A building, with ground coverage greater than 120 square feet,
shall be constructed on a concrete slab or footing.
      (4)   Conex and truck boxes are not permissible structures and are
prohibited in all districts except that they may be placed and used as follows:
         (a)   Only after issuance of a moving permit therefor;
         (b)   Temporarily (for up to 18 months) in all districts at
construction sites and while, but only so long as, construction is in progress
pursuant to a duly issued and unexpired building permit;
         (c)   Pursuant to an interim use permit authorizing placement of one
or more conex boxes for more than 18 months as an accessory structure in
Planned Industrial (PI), General Industrial (GI), Service Business (SB), and
Agricultural Residence (AR) districts, provided, that each such unit shall be:
            1.   Placed and maintained in compliance with setback requirements
for permanent structures, except when used temporarily during construction as
aforesaid;
            2.   Anchored according to the Minnesota State Building Code and
manufacturer’s specifications; and
            3.   Maintained so that all exterior surfaces are covered with
paint of the same color, with no bare metal exposed to the elements;
         (d)   The total square footage of space occupied by conex boxes shall
not exceed 40% of the developable area of the tract upon which they are placed
(“developable area” means the area of the tract that is or can be developed
with a building or buildings in accordance with the City Code and the Minnesota
State Building Code); and
         (e)   Conex boxes shall not be stacked one on top of the other.

§ 153.039 UNDETERMINED OR QUESTIONABLE CLASSIFICATION OF USES.
   When a question arises as to whether a proposed use falls within a permitted
use, a conditional/interim use, or an accessory use category, or whether a
specific use that is not included on the Land Use Chart should be allowed in a
particular district, the Planning Commission shall consider the questions and
recommend a disposition to the City Council. The City Council shall determine
whether the use should be allowed as similar to other allowable uses in the
district. If the City Council determines that the use is similar to other
allowable uses in the district, it shall initiate proceedings to amend this
chapter accordingly.

§ 153.070 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT (PUD).
   (A)   Purpose. These Planned Unit Development District (“PUD”) provisions
are intended to provide design flexibility by allowing variances from other
sections of this code relating to land use development and subdivision; to
provide an enjoyable environment by preserving existing topography, stands of
trees, ponds, flood plains, and similar natural assets; and to provide a
compatible and stable environment in harmony with that of the surrounding area.
   (B)   Land ownership. To be developed as a PUD, the land must be under the
control:
      (1)   Of a single owner; or
      (2)   Of 2 or more owners who covenant and agree in advance to be bound
by the conditions and regulations which will be effective within the PUD and
who record the covenants.
   (C)   Applicability. The PUD District is an overlay zoning technique. The
basic underlying zoning district establishes the basic allowable uses and the
general standards for development, and the approved PUD plan establishes the
specific regulations for development and governs and takes precedence over the
underlying zoning district regulations. PUDs may be allowed in any district but
are required for multiple family dwellings in the R-3 District. If a zoning
change is required to accommodate the uses or general intensity of development
in the PUD, an application for a zoning district change shall be made
concurrently with the PUD application; and, if approved, the zoning map shall
be changed both as to the underlying zoning district and designation as a PUD
District.
   (D)   Designation.
      (1)   Each “Single Use PUD” shall be designated as a “Residential PURR,”
a “Commercial PUD-C,” or an “Industrial PUD-I,” established by the underlying
zoning district or districts in which the land proposed for the PUD is located.
      (2)   A “Mixed Use PUD” may include a mixture of residential, commercial,
and/or industrial uses, or any combination thereof, as herein provided. Uses
other than uses as permitted in the zoning district or districts in which the
land proposed for the PUD is located must not result in undue adverse effects
on surrounding areas and must be consistent with the intent of this subchapter
and the concept of the proposed PUD.
   (E)   Pre-application conference. Prior to the filing of an application for
approval of a PUD Concept Plan, the applicant shall consult with the city
zoning official to disclose to the city the general terms of the applicant’s
proposal; to determine the procedures and requirements governing approval of a
PUD; and to discuss zoning requirements and city plans which might affect the
proposed development, which shall be disclosed to the applicant.
   (F)   PUD Concept Plans.
      (1)   Prior to submission of a PUD Concept Plan and rezoning application,

reasons for a PUD and benefits to the city. The concept statement should
address the criteria on which the PUD will be evaluated in subsection (H)(2)
(b);
         (b)   A tentative written consent signed by all owners of property
within the proposed PUD.
      (2)   The PUD Concept Plan shall identify:
         (a)   The boundaries of the proposed PUD;

         (j)   Uses of land surrounding the proposed PUD;
         (k)   The tentative development schedule, indicating the start and
completion date.
      (3)   Preliminary approval of the Concept Plan is subject to the
following procedures:
         (a)   Planning Commission. The Planning Commission shall hold a public
information meeting on the PUD Concept Plan and, within 30 days after the
review, shall, by motion, recommend to the Council approval in principle,
approval with modifications, or denial.
         (b)   Council. The Council shall consider the PUD Concept Plan and
either approve in principle, approve with modifications, or deny the concept
statement.
      (4)   Approval of the PUD Concept Plan shall not obligate the city to
approve the PUD Master Plan or Final Plan, or any part thereof, or to rezone
the property to a PUD.
   (G)   PUD Master Plan application. After receiving approval of the PUD
Concept Plan, the applicant shall submit to the Council Secretary the

which were applicable to the land prior to approval of the plan and which are
not inconsistent with the plan shall continue to be applicable.
   (K)   Building permits. No building permit shall be issued for any structure
within the district unless and until the Council Secretary certifies that it
conforms to the provisions of the plan and other applicable zoning
requirements.
   (L)   Construction of public facilities. The applicant shall either:
      (1)   Construct all public facilities and improvements made necessary as
a result of the PUD; or
      (2)   At the election of the city, deliver to the city escrow deposits,
irrevocable letters of credit in a form approved by the city, or performance
bonds to guarantee construction of the required improvements. The uniqueness of
each proposal for a PUD requires that specifications and standards for streets,
utilities and services may be subject to minor modifications from the
specifications and standards established in this and other city ordinances
governing their construction. The City Council may therefore waive or modify
the specifications or standards where it is found that they are not required in
the interests of the residents or of the entire city. The plans and profiles of
all streets, utilities and services shall be reviewed, modified if necessary,
and approved by the City Engineer and Building Official prior to the final
approval of the PUD plan by the City Council. All PUD projects shall be
serviced by public water and sewer systems. All utilities, including
electrical, shall be placed underground.
   (M)   PUD regulations. Although it is the intent of these PUD provisions to
allow flexibility in development and not to impose unnecessary constraints on
PUD projects, there are certain requirements that cannot be waived in order to
offer protection to land owners and the city at large inherent in the zoning
ordinance. Other regulations are necessary to meet the stated purpose of the
PUD District:
      (1)   The following regulations establish the basic types of development
allowed in PUD projects.
         (a)   Permitted uses. Within a PUD, no land or building shall be used
except for 1 or more the following:
            1.   Those uses listed as permitted, conditional or accessory uses
in the district(s) in which the development is proposed;
            2.   A variety of housing types allowable in any of the residential
zoning districts may be provided in a PUD in any of the residential zoning
districts;
            3.   A variety of business types allowable in any of the business
zoning districts may be provided in a PUD in any of the business districts;
            4.   The organizations of various uses and the circulation and
parking pattern and activity areas within the PUD shall fully recognize the
existing and planned development adjoining the PUD site;
            5.   Open space and public recreational uses will be allowed within
a PUD although not specifically allowed as a permitted use in the Zoning
District in which the PUD is located;
            6.   Business uses not occupying over 10% of the area of a
residential PUD may be allowed if the business is designed and intended for use
primarily for residents of the PUD or the immediate surrounding neighborhood;
is not conflict with the intent of the Comprehensive Plan; and is integrated
into the overall PUD Plan. The business uses are not required to be located in
a business district;
            7.   All streets, driveways and parking lots shall be constructed
of an impervious, dust free material such as bituminous or concrete, and all
sidewalks shall be concrete. Trails and paths may be constructed of bituminous,
ag-lime or other durable, dust free material.
         (b)   Density. The overall density of residential PUDs (units per
acre) or the intensity of nonresidential PUDs (lot coverage or floor area
ratios) shall be determined by the underlying zoning district(s) and shall be
maintained for the overall PUD. However, the density or intensity may be
increased on individual parcels within the PUD. Overall residential densities
may be increased in a PUD by 10% if the applicant can show that by
consolidation of open space and hard cover areas, the net usable open space has
been increased by at least 10%. Density shall be based on the net usable area
of the PUD parcel, calculated by subtracting the area in public streets and 50%
of wetlands from the total parcel area, and dividing the net usable area by the
minimum required lot area.
         (c)   Open space. A minimum of 25% of the total PUD area shall be in
open landscaped space, not covered by buildings, walks, drives or parking.
      (2)   The following regulations are not flexible and can only be modified
by the variance procedure established in this chapter.
         (a)   Flood plain management and wetland regulations.
         (b)   Regulations such as front, side and rear yard setbacks, parking
setbacks, signage, size and location, floor area ratios or building coverage
ratios may be modified for interior development and from interior lot lines.
However, the regulations for these same items must be met for the total project
area and for the relationship to perimeter property lines of the PUD project.
         (c)   The minimum size of a single use PUD shall be equal to twice the
area of the minimum lot size permitted in the district in which the PUD is
proposed.
         (d)   The minimum size of a mixed use PUD shall be equal to twice the
sum of the area of the minimum lot size permitted in any district(s) proposed
as part of the PUD.
         (e)   The total number of parking spaces required by uses in the PUD
shall be provided within the overall PUD but may be provided in common parking
areas serving more than one use or structure if reasonable walking distances
and routes are provided.
   (N)   Governance. Final agreements, easements, dedication, provisions or
covenants shall govern the use, maintenance and continued protection of the
PUD.
   (O)   Preparation of Plan. The applicant must have the necessary documents
and supporting evidence for all 3 PUD stages prepared and endorsed by a
qualified professional team, including, but not limited to, a registered
architect, landscape architect or planner and, if the PUD requires the
subdivision of land and the installation of public site improvements, a
registered land surveyor and registered engineer.
   (P)   Occupancy. Occupancy and use of buildings and structures in a PUD may
be permitted when the buildings and structures have been completed to the
satisfaction of the Building Inspector and the access drives and parking areas
are sufficiently completed to support emergency vehicles at all times. The
applicant must keep all access drives and parking areas in a dust-free
condition.
   (Q)   Amendments. Any changes approved by the Council shall be by motion as
an amendment to the final plan.
(Ord. 109, 5th Series, passed 6-3-1999)
§ 153.071 ANTENNAS AND TOWERS.
   (A)   Purpose. To accommodate the communication needs of residents and
businesses while protecting the public health, safety, and general welfare of
the community, the Council finds that these regulations are necessary to:
      (1)   Facilitate the provision of wireless telecommunication services to
the residents and businesses of the city;
      (2)   Restrict the location of antennas and towers and impose design
standards to minimize adverse visual effects of antennas and towers;
      (3)   Require evidence of structural integrity and impose setback
requirements to avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from antenna or
tower failure; and
      (4)   Require applicants for antenna or tower permits to maximize the use
of existing towers and buildings to accommodate new antennas to reduce the
number of towers needed to serve the community.
   (B)   Antennas and towers.
      (1)   Establishment of a conditional or interim use of antennas and
towers. The City Council establishes that the construction and operation of
antennas and towers in any of the City's Zoning Districts is allowable only
after issuance of a conditional or interim use permit.
      (2)   Location of antennas and towers and permit requirements. Except as
set forth in division (B)(3), antennas and towers may be constructed and
operated within the corporate city limits only with and after the property
owner, or a party with a right to possess the property under a valid lease,
obtains a conditional or interim use permit pursuant to this section.
      (3)   Exceptions. The following towers and antennas are not subject to
this section:
         (a)   Towers and antennas the city constructs and operates for city
use;
         (b)   Towers and antennas identified as accessory uses in the city's
Zoning Code; and
         (c)   Towers or antennas that are located entirely within a structure
that complies with the height, bulk, density, and area requirements of the
city's Zoning Code and are not visible from the exterior of the structure.
   (C)   Permit applications and application fee. Applicants for an antenna or
tower conditional or interim use permit must file an application permit with
the City Administrator and pay an application fee to the city.
   (D)   Building permit requirements. In addition to the requirement for a
conditional or interim use permit, no antenna or tower and no accessory
building intended to serve a tower may be erected, constructed or located
within the city until the applicant has obtained a building permit pursuant to
the City Code. As a condition of the city's issuance of the building permit,
the applicant must provide evidence, reasonably acceptable to the city, that
the antenna or tower complies with any applicable Federal Aviation
Administration regulations.
   (E)   Criteria for approval. The Council must consider the following
criteria in determining whether to grant or deny a conditional or interim use
permit for a tower or antenna:
      (1)   The proposed tower or antenna's compliance with the performance
standards described in the City Code;
      (2)   The potential for the tower or antenna to cause a condition that
may pose an unreasonable threat or cause unreasonable damage to any other
property or person;
      (3)   The impact of the proposed tower or antenna on the environment and
on the visual image of the surrounding area;
      (4)   A proposal for a new tower must not be approved unless the City
Council finds that the antenna and other equipment planned for the proposed
tower cannot be accommodated on an existing tower or building within a one mile
radius (0.5 mile radius for towers under 120 feet in height or 0.25 mile radius
for towers under 60 feet in height) of the proposed tower due to one or more of
the following reasons:
         (a)   The antenna and other equipment would exceed the structural
capacity of existing towers or available buildings, as documented by a
qualified and licensed professional engineer, and the existing tower cannot be
reinforced, modified, or replaced to accommodate planned or equivalent
equipment at a reasonable cost;
         (b)   The planned equipment would cause interference impacting the
usability of existing equipment at the tower or building as documented by a
qualified and licensed professional engineer and the interference cannot be
prevented at a reasonable cost;
         (c)   Existing towers and buildings within the search radius cannot
accommodate the planned equipment at a height necessary to function reasonably
as documented by a qualified and licensed professional engineer; and
         (d)   Other unforeseen reasons that make it infeasible to locate the
planned telecommunications equipment upon an existing or approved tower or
building.
   (F)   Performance standards. If a conditional or interim use permit is
granted, the permit holder must at all times comply with the following
requirements.
      (1)   Tower and antenna design requirements. Towers and antennas must
meet the following design requirements:
         (a)   Towers and antennas must be designed to blend into the
surrounding environment through the use of color and camouflaging architectural
treatment, except in instances where the color is dictated by federal or state
authorities such as the Federal Aviation Administration;
         (b)   Towers must be of a mono-pole design unless the City Council
determines that an alternative design is necessary for the proposed use or
would better blend into the surrounding environment.
      (2)   Tower and antenna setback requirements. Antennas and towers must
conform with each of the following minimum setback requirements:
         (a)   Antennas and towers must be set back from structures existing on
the property on which the antenna or tower is located or on adjacent properties
a distance not less than the height of the antenna or tower;
         (b)   Antennas and towers must meet the setbacks of the underlying
zoning district;
         (c)   Antennas and towers must be set back from all existing and
planned public rights-of-way of the city by a minimum distance equal to the
height of the tower;
         (d)   Antennas and towers shall not be located between a principal
structure and a public street with the following exceptions:
            1.   In industrial zoning districts, antennas and towers may be
placed within a side yard abutting an internal industrial street;
            2.   On sites adjacent to public streets on all sides, antennas and
towers may be placed within a side yard abutting a local street;
         (e)   The setback for an antenna or tower may be reduced or its
location in relation to a public street varied, at the sole discretion of the
City Council, to allow the integration of a tower into an existing or proposed
structure such as a church steeple, light standard, power line support device,
or similar structure.
      (3)   Tower lighting. An antenna or tower must not be illuminated by
artificial means and must not display strobe lights unless the lighting is
specifically required by the Federal Aviation Administration or other federal
or state authority for a particular tower. When incorporated into the approved
design of a tower, light fixtures used to illuminate ball fields, parking lots,
or similar areas may be attached to a tower.
      (4)   Signs and advertising. The use of any portion of an antenna or
tower for signs other than warning or equipment information signs is
prohibited.
      (5)   Accessory utility building. All utility buildings, structures, and
equipment accessory to an antenna or tower must be architecturally designed to
blend in with the surrounding environment and must meet the minimum
requirements of the underlying zoning district.
      (6)   Screening requirements. Ground mounted antennas and utility
buildings, structures and equipment accessory to an antenna or a tower must be
screened from view in conformance with the screening requirements in the City
Zoning Code.
      (7)   Location. Any proposed tower must be designed, structurally,
electrically, and in all respects to accommodate both the applicant's antennas
and comparable antennas for at least two additional users if the tower is over
100 feet in height or for at least one additional user if the tower is over 60
feet in height. Towers must be designed to allow for future rearrangement of
antennas upon the tower and to accept antennas mounted at varying heights.
   (G)   Conditions. Unless modified by the City Council, all conditional or
interim use permits for antennas and towers are subject to the following
conditions:
      (1)   The permit holder must obtain all FAA and FCC approvals for the
tower or antenna;
      (2)   The permit holder must remove any abandoned or unused towers or
portions thereof within 12 months of the cessation of operations at the site
unless the City Council approves a time extension;
      (3)   Towers and antennas must not interfere with public safety
telecommunications;
      (4)   No change in the use of a tower or antenna may be made without the
consent of the City Administrator after the applicant provides the City
Administrator with all information the City Administrator may reasonably
require to determine that the modification in service or use will not cause the
antenna or tower to violate the performance standard set forth in this Code or
the conditions of the existing conditional or interim use permit.

NONCONFORMING USES, BUILDING AND LOTS; CONDITIONAL
AND INTERIM USE PERMITS
§ 153.160 PURPOSES.
   (A)   This subchapter regulates and limits the continued existence of uses,
structures and lots established prior to the effective date of this chapter
that do not conform to the regulations of this chapter.
   (B)   The zoning districts established by this chapter are designed to guide
the future use of land within the city; to encourage the development or
maintenance of desirable residential, business, office, institutional and
industrial areas with appropriate groupings of compatible and related uses; and
to promote and protect the public health, safety and general welfare. The
continued existence of nonconformities is frequently inconsistent with the
purposes for which the districts are established; and, thus, the gradual
elimination of such nonconformities is generally desirable.
(Ord. 109, 5th Series, passed 6-3-1999)
§ 153.161 GENERAL SCOPE OF REGULATION.
   (A)   This subchapter establishes restrictions for the following categories
of nonconformity:
      (1)   Nonconforming use of land or buildings;
      (2)   Nonconforming structures;
      (3)   Nonconforming lots;
      (4)   Nonconforming accessory uses;
      (5)   Nonconforming signs;
      (6)   Nonconforming residential alterations.
   (B)   The degree of restriction made applicable to each category of
nonconformity is generally related to the degree of incompatibility with
permitted uses and the amount of investment typically associated with
nonconformities of that type. Pursuant to §§
153.185 and
153.186, provision is made for relief from some of the restrictions of this
subchapter, when practical difficulties or a particular hardship exists.
(Ord. 109, 5th Series, passed 6-3-1999)
§ 153.162 NONCONFORMING USE OF LAND OR STRUCTURES.
   A nonconforming use of land or structures may be continued subject to the
provisions of this subchapter, but it is the intent of this chapter not to
encourage its survival because of its incompatibility with permitted uses in
the zoning district in which it is located.
   (A)   Normal maintenance. Maintenance of a building or other structure
containing or used for a nonconforming use may be permitted when it includes
necessary non-structural repairs and incidental alterations that do not extend
or intensify the nonconforming building or use. Nothing in this chapter shall
prevent making a structure safe when the structure has been declared to be
unsafe by the city.
   (B)   Moving. No structure devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming
use shall be moved in whole or in part for any distance whatsoever, to any
other location on the same or any other lot, unless the entire structure and
the use thereof shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning
district in which it is located after being so moved. No nonconforming use of
land shall be moved in whole or in part, for any distance whatsoever, to any
other location on the same or any other lot, unless the use shall thereafter
conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is located after
being so moved.
   (C)   Change to different nonconforming use. No nonconforming use shall be
changed to a different nonconforming use, enlarged, intensified, increased, or
extended to occupy a greater area of the lot on which it is located.
   (D)   Restoration. No person may restore a building that has been damaged to
the extent of more than 50% of its value by fire, explosion, act of God, or
public enemy, except in conformity with the regulations of this chapter.
   (E)   Discontinuance. In the event that a nonconforming use of any building
or premises is discontinued or its normal operation stopped for a period of at
least 1 year, the use of the same shall thereafter conform to the regulations
of the district in which it is located.
(Ord. 109, 5th Series, passed 6-3-1999)
§ 153.163 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   A nonconforming structure found to be nonconforming because of height,
setbacks or lot area may continue to exist so long as it is used for purposes
permitted in the zoning district in which it is located. Because its
incompatibility is technical in nature it shall be exempt from all of the
provisions of this subchapter, except §
153.162(D) and (E).
(Ord. 109, 5th Series, passed 6-3-1999)
§ 153.164 NONCONFORMING LOTS.
   A single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected in
any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted on any single lot
of record at the effective date of adoption of or amendment to this chapter,
provided that all other requirements are met for the district in which it is
located.
(Ord. 109, 5th Series, passed 6-3-1999)
§ 153.165 NONCONFORMING ACCESSORY USES AND STRUCTURES.
   No use or structure that is accessory to a principal nonconforming use or
structure shall continue after the principal use or structure shall have been
terminated, unless it shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning
district in which it is located.
(Ord. 109, 5th Series, passed 6-3-1999)
§ 153.166 NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
   (A)   Signs existing on the effective date of this chapter that do not
conform to the regulations set forth in this chapter shall become a
nonconforming use. Advertising signs that become nonconforming uses shall be
removed within 3 years after the effective date of this chapter or otherwise be
relocated to comply with all the provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   Business signs on the premises of a nonconforming building or use may
be continued, but the signs shall not expand in number, area, height or
illumination. New signs not to exceed 35 square feet in aggregate sign area may
be erected on a nonconforming building. The new signs may be illuminated but no
flashing, rotating or moving signs shall be permitted.
   (C)   No sign erected before the effective date of this chapter shall be
rebuilt, structurally altered or moved to a new location without being brought
into compliance with the requirements of this chapter, except that the sign
copy may be changed.
(Ord. 109, 5th Series, passed 6-3-1999)
§ 153.167 RESIDENTIAL ALTERATIONS.
   Alterations may be made to a residential building containing nonconforming
residential units when they will improve the livability of the units; provided,
however, that they do not increase the number of dwelling units in the

   The property owner is responsible for determining the legality of any
nonconforming use.
(Ord. 109, 5th Series, passed 6-3-1999)
§ 153.169 CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS.
   (A)   Conditional use permits may be issued:
      (1)   For any of the uses or purposes for which the permits are required
or permitted by the provisions of this chapter;

or welfare;
      (3)   Commercial excavating and storage of natural materials used for
building or construction purposes in any district;
      (4)   To classify as a conforming use any nonconforming institutional use
existing in any district at the time of the establishment of the district;

library, community center, church, hospital, any institution of an educational,
philanthropic or charitable nature, cemetery or mausoleum.
   (B)   Whether issued prior or subsequent to the effective date of this

conditions are not met.
(Ord. 109, 5th Series, passed 6-3-1999)
§ 153.170 INTERIM USE PERMITS.
   Interim use permits may be issued to allow a temporary use of the property
until a particular date, until the occurrence of a particular event, or until
zoning regulations no longer permit the use. In residential districts, interim
uses may be permitted only on property originally constructed as a family
dwelling with attached garage, a detached garage that is accessory to a family
dwelling, a church, or a school.
   (A)   Standards of interim use permits. The Planning Commission shall
recommend, and the Council may grant, an interim use permit for the interim use
property only if:
      (1)   The use conforms to the zoning regulations;
      (2)   The date or event that will terminate the use can be identified
with certainty;
      (3)   Permit of the use will not impose additional costs on the city if
the city must take the property in the future;
      (4)   The owner and user of the property agree in writing to any
conditions that the City Council deems appropriate for permission of the use.
   (B)   Termination of interim use. An interim use permit shall terminate and
expire upon the first to occur of any of the following events:
      (1)   The date of expiration stated in the permit;
      (2)   The event of termination stated in the permit;
      (3)   Violation of any of the terms, conditions, or covenants under which
the permit was issued;
      (4)   A change in the city’s zoning ordinance that renders the use
nonconforming;
      (5)   The abandonment or discontinuance of the use for a minimum of 3
consecutive months.
(Ord. 109, 5th Series, passed 6-3-1999)
§ 153.171 PROCEDURE FOR ISSUANCE OF CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT OR INTERIM USE
PERMIT.
   (A)   Application for the issuance of a conditional use permit or interim
use permit shall be made to the Planning Commission, except that any
proceedings to classify certain uses as conforming uses as provided in this
subchapter may be initiated by the application, by the Council, or by the
Planning Commission.
   (B)   The Planning Commission may hold hearings on the proposal to issue a
use permit as it may consider necessary, but at least 1 public hearing shall be
held on any application for a use permit.
   (C)   Following public hearing, the Planning Commission shall make a report
upon the proposal to the Council and shall recommend to the Council whatever
action it deems advisable. The Planning Commission shall not recommend the
granting of a permit unless it finds that the establishment, maintenance, or
conducting of the use for which a use permit is sought will not be detrimental
to the health, morals, comfort, convenience or welfare of the persons residing
or working in the neighborhood of the use, or to the public welfare, or
injurious to property or improvements in the neighborhood.
   (D)    The Planning Commission may recommend, and the Council may require,
that conditions be met and guarantees be required in the granting of use
permits in the same manner provided in §
32.55 for the granting of adjustments.
   (E)   Upon receipt of the report of the Planning Commission, the Council may
hold whatever public hearings it deems advisable and shall make a decision upon
the application.
   (F)   The Council may grant an interim use permit, regardless of whether the
application was for a conditional or interim use.
(Ord. 109, 5th Series, passed 6-3-1999)
§ 153.172 APPLICATION FEE.
   Each applicant for a use permit shall pay a nonrefundable application fee.
The amount of the fee shall be fixed, determined, and amended by resolution or
ordinance of the Council.
(Ord. 109, 5th Series, passed 6-3-1999)
ADMINISTRATION
§ 153.185 VARIANCES.
   The city may grant variances from the provisions of this chapter in
instances where an applicant shows that strict adherence to the regulations
would cause hardship because of circumstances unique to the individual
property.
   (A)   The applicant shall establish that conforming to the strict letter of
the regulations of this chapter would create a unique and particular hardship.
      (1)   The hardship must be peculiar to the property as compared to other
property subject to the same regulations.
      (2)   The hardship is more than an inconvenience to the property owner.
      (3)   The hardship relates to physical characteristics of the lot or
parcel such as size, shape or unusual terrain which would prohibit reasonable
development on the site equivalent to that generally allowed on other standard
lots in the same district which have no unusual configuration.
      (4)   The hardship is not the result of actions by the applicant or
current landowner.
      (5)   The hardship is not based solely on economic expectations.
   (B)   A variance may be granted if to deny the variance would deprive the
property owner substantial property rights commonly enjoyed by other property
owners in the same district.
   (C)   The variance shall not impair the health, safety, comfort and general
welfare of the public, nor shall it substantially increase congestion of public
streets.
   (D)   The variance shall not be contrary to the intent and purpose of this
chapter, the Comprehensive Plan, and any other ordinances of the city.
   (E)   Other considerations:
      (1)   Whether other variance requests of a similar nature were approved
by the Council and are consistent with the requested variance;
      (2)   Whether the variance requested is greater than necessary to
accomplish the owner’s objective;
      (3)   Whether allowable alternatives exist that would not require a
variance or would create less impact on neighboring properties;
      (4)   Whether the variance will allow a condition that is consistent with
the surrounding neighborhood (areas developed under different standards or
different requirements than current regulations allow);
      (5)   Whether the variance will improve an existing nonconforming
condition, without major demolition and reconstruction.
   (F)   Variances shall not be granted to allow a use that is not otherwise
allowed.
   (G)   The Council may impose conditions to insure compliance and protect
adjacent properties.
   (H)   Application and procedure:
      (1)   Site plan. The applicant for a variance shall provide a site plan
showing lot lines, structures, dimensions, public streets and a specific
drawing of the requested variance, including existing conditions, existing
regulations affecting the proposed activity, and the requested variance.
      (2)   Notice of hearing. The Zoning Administrator shall, at least 10 days
before the hearing date set by him or her, insert a notice in the official
newspaper and have the same published once at least 10 days prior to the date
of hearing. He or she shall also mail the notice to the appellant and any other
known interested parties.
      (3)   Hearing. The hearing before the Planning Commission shall occur
within 30 days after the filing of the application.
         (a)   Any party may appear in person or by attorney at the hearing.
         (b)   The Planning Commission shall keep a complete record of its
proceedings, including minutes of its meetings.
         (c)   Within 5 days after the Planning Commission’s decision on the
application, the Commission shall file with the Council its findings of fact,
the specific conditions of the site that justify or do not justify a variance,
and their conclusions and order. At its next regular or special meeting, the
Council shall consider the Commission’s conclusions and order; may modify or
amend the order in any respects; shall adopt the order as modified, amended, or
recommended by the Commission; and shall direct that the order as adopted be
served by mail forthwith upon the appellant and other parties known to be
interested or heard at the hearing.
         (d)   The order as adopted by the Council shall be final and binding
upon all parties, subject only to judicial review.
(Ord. 109, 5th Series, passed 6-3-1999)
§ 153.186 APPEALS TO ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS.
   (A)   Appeals. The Planning Commission shall hear any appeals where it is
alleged that there is an error in any order, requirements, decision or
determination made by an administrative officer in the interpretation,
application, and/or enforcement of this chapter and shall report its findings
and recommendations to the City Council for action.
   (B)   Effect of determinations. The findings and determinations made by the
Planning Commission shall be advisory only and shall have no binding effect.
The Council shall take such action on the findings and recommendations of the
Commission as it deems proper in the circumstances.
(Ord. 109, 5th Series, passed 6-3-1999)
§ 153.187 AMENDMENT.
   (A)   Procedure. The Council, the Planning Commission, or property owners
claiming to be affected thereby may initiate an amendment to this chapter. If
by petition of the latter, the matter of whether the property owners are
affected shall be a fact question to be determined at the hearing on the
amendment. If an adverse decision is made with reference to the question, the
hearing shall not proceed, but the decision shall mean that the amendment was
improperly initiated and cannot be pursued. An amendment, when not initiated by
the Planning Commission, shall be referred to it for study and report and may
not be acted upon by the Council until it has received the recommendation of
the Planning Commission on the proposed amendment or until 60 days have elapsed
from the date of reference of the amendment without a report from the Planning
Commission.
   (B)   Hearing. No amendment shall be adopted until a public hearing has been
held thereon by the Council. The city shall cause notice of the time, place and
purpose of the hearing to be published in the official newspaper at least 10
days prior to the day of hearing.
   (C)   Notice to be given. When an amendment involves changes in district
boundaries affecting an area of 5 acres or less, a similar notice shall be
mailed at least 10 days before the day of the hearing to each owner of affected
property and property situated wholly or partially within 350 feet of the
property to which the amendment relates. For the purpose of giving mailed
notice, the City Administrator shall be responsible for mailing the notice
using any appropriate records to determine the names and addresses of owners. A
copy of the notice and a list of the owners and the addresses to which the
notice was sent shall be attested to by the City Administrator and shall be
made a part of the records of the proceedings. Failure to give mailed notice to
individual property owners or defects in the notice shall not invalidate the
proceedings, provided that a bona fide attempt to comply with this requirement
has been made.
   (D)   Consistency with Comprehensive Plan. If a proposed rezoning is not
consistent with the Comprehensive Plan, the applicant shall apply for a
Comprehensive Plan amendment concurrently with the application for rezoning.
The applicant shall provide written and graphic documentation showing why the
proposed amendment is superior to the existing Plan and changes that have
occurred that make the amendment appropriate.
   (E)   Action to approve. A 4/5 vote of the full Council is required for
action to rezone property from one district to another and for a Comprehensive
Plan amendment. In the event an application to rezone is approved, an
appropriate amending ordinance shall be executed and published. Rezoning
amendments shall describe the property rezoned by its legal description and
shall be indicated on the Official Zoning Map, but it shall not be necessary to
re-publish the rezoning map to effectuate the rezoning amendment.
(Ord. 109, 5th Series, passed 6-3-1999)
