contrary.
   (B)   It is the intention of the City Council that, when adopting this code

existence at the time this code was enacted, unless there is clear intention

§ 10.20 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Any licensed peace officer of the city’s Police Department, or the
County Sheriff, or any Deputy Sheriff shall have the authority to enforce any
provision of this code.
   (B)   As permitted by M.S. § 626.862, as it may be amended from time to
time, the City Clerk- Administrator shall have the authority to administer and
enforce this code. In addition, under that statutory authority, certain
individuals designated within the code or by the Clerk or City Council shall
have the authority to administer and enforce the provisions specified. All and
any person or persons designated may issue a citation in lieu of arrest or
continued detention to enforce any provision of the code.
   (C)   The City Clerk-Administrator and any city official or employee
designated by this code who has the responsibility to perform a duty under this
code may with the permission of a licensee of a business or owner of any
property or resident of a dwelling, or other person in control of any premises,
inspect or otherwise enter any property to enforce compliance with this code.
   (D)   If the licensee, owner, resident or other person in control of a
premises objects to the inspection of or entrance to the property, the City
Clerk-Administrator, peace officer or any employee or official charged with the
duty of enforcing the provisions of this code may, upon a showing that probable
cause exists for the issuance of a valid search warrant from a court of
competent jurisdiction, petition and obtain a search warrant before conducting
the inspection or otherwise entering the property. This warrant shall be only
to determine whether the provisions of this code enacted to protect the health,
safety and welfare of the people are being complied with and to enforce these
provisions only, and no criminal charges shall be made as a result of the
warrant. No warrant shall be issued unless there be probable cause to issue the
warrant. Probable cause occurs if the search is reasonable. Probable cause does
not depend on specific knowledge of the condition of a particular property.
   (E)   Every licensee, owner, resident or other person in control of property
within the city shall permit at reasonable times inspections of or entrance to
the property by the City Clerk-Administrator or any other authorized city
officer or employee only to determine whether the provisions of this code
enacted to protect the health, safety and welfare of the people are being
complied with and to enforce these provisions. Unreasonable refusal to permit
the inspection of or entrance to the property shall be grounds for termination
of any and all permits, licenses or city service to the property. Mailed notice
shall be given to the licensee, owner, resident or other person in control of
the property, stating the grounds for the termination, and the licensee, owner,
resident or other person in control of the property shall be given an
opportunity to appear before the City Clerk- Administrator to object to the
termination before it occurs, subject to appeal of the Clerk-Administrator’s
decision to the City Council at a regularly scheduled or special meeting.
   (F)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of
the city to enter private property in urgent emergency situations where there
is an imminent danger in order to protect the public health, safety and
welfare.
§ 10.98 ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES.
   (A)   Administrative procedures and penalties.
      (1)   Purpose. The City Council finds that there is a need for
alternative methods to enforce portions of the city code. While criminal fines
and penalties have been used historically as enforcement mechanisms, negative
consequences for both the city and the public can result. The delay inherent in
the criminal justice system does not always ensure prompt resolution of
offenses that immediately impact the livability of the community. Citizens may
resent being labeled criminals for violations of administrative regulations.
The higher burden of proof and the potential of incarceration are not always
appropriate for many administrative violations. The criminal justice system
often cannot give priority to city code violations due to caseloads and more
serious cases in the system. Accordingly, the City Council finds that the use
of administrative citations and the imposition of civil penalties is a
legitimate and necessary alternative method of enforcement and a way to reduce
the burdens on our court system.
      (2)   Scope. The administrative procedures and penalties in this chapter
may be used for violations of the Hinckley City Code. The provisions of this
chapter may be used concurrently with, as an alternative to, or in addition to
any other procedure or remedy, criminal or civil, the city may pursue under
city code, state law, or federal law, including but not limited to the
abatement provisions contained in §
10.98(B). Nothing herein restricts the right of government agents to enter
property or to seek other remedies in emergency or other situations as
authorized by city code, state law or federal law.
      (3)   Definitions.
         BOARD. A quorum of the City of Hinckley Planning Commission.
         CITATION. An administrative citation issued pursuant to this chapter.
         CITY ADMINISTRATOR. The Hinckley City Administrator or designee.
         CITY CODE. The Hinckley City Code of Ordinances.
         CODE COMPLIANCE OFFICIAL. The Hinckley City Administrator or designee.
      (4)   Administrative offenses; schedules of fines and fees.
         (a)   A violation of any provision of city code is an administrative
offense subject to a citation and civil penalties pursuant to this chapter.
Each day a violation exists constitutes a separate offense.
         (b)   Each count of an administrative violation is subject to a civil
penalty not to exceed the maximum fine that may be imposed for the same
violation if it were prosecuted as a misdemeanor offense, abatement, or both
unless otherwise provided.
            1.   The civil penalty for a particular count shall be established
as provided in division (A)(4)(d) hereof;
            2.   If a violator remedies a count of a violation and demonstrates
that fact prior to the compliance date, the civil penalty for that count will
be waived.
         (c)   A second or subsequent citation issued within 180 days of any
same or similar citation is subject to a civil penalty of at least twice the
previously imposed penalty, but within the limits of any fine that could be
imposed if the violation were prosecuted as a misdemeanor offense. If the
violator remedies the violation prior to the compliance date, the full civil
penalty for that particular citation will be waived. Civil penalties for
previous citations will not be waived.
         (d)   The City Council may adopt by resolution a schedule of
recommended fines for offenses initiated by citation, and may designate those
offenses for which a fine must be paid even if the violation is remedied. The
resolution may also identify violations for which a fine only may be imposed
for a first offense occurring within a specified time period, not to exceed
three years. The resolution may also specify a filing fee to appeal to the
board. If no resolution is adopted, the following fees shall apply:
            1.   First administrative citation. One hundred dollars ($100). If
the violation is remedied by the compliance date, the fee will be nullified;
            2.   Second administrative citation. Two hundred dollars ($200)
and/or abatement of nuisance;
            3.   Third administrative citation. Four hundred dollars ($400)
and/or abatement of nuisance;
            4.   Fourth administrative citation. Eight hundred dollars ($800)
and/or abatement of nuisance; and
            5.   Fifth administrative citation. One thousand dollars ($1,000)
and/or abatement of nuisance.
            6.   Appeal filing fee. Five dollars ($5).
         (e)   The City Clerk is authorized to promulgate rules and forms to
affect the procedures herein.
      (5)   Citation; authorization to issue and contents.
         (a)   The Code Compliance Officer is authorized to issue a citation,
in a form adopted by the City Council that minimally complies with this
chapter, upon reasonable belief that a code violation has occurred. The
citation must be issued in one of the following ways:
            1.   By personal service upon the owner of the property or an
occupant of suitable age residing at the property where the violation occurred,
or in the case of a business or corporation, the citation may be served upon an
employee on the premises or to a corporate officer;
            2.   By U.S. first class mail to a person identified in division
(A)(5)(a)1.;
            3.   By posting the citation in a conspicuous place on or near the
main entrance where it reasonably appears the property is occupied but the
occupants are not available or willing to accept personal service; or
            4.   By posting the citation in a conspicuous place on or near the
main entrance and mailing by first class U.S. Mail a notice of the citation to
the owner of record where it reasonably appears the property is vacant or
abandoned.
         (b)   Contents of citation. The citation must state the date, time,
and nature of the offense; the identity of the person issuing the citation; the
amount of the scheduled fine; the manner of paying the fine or appealing the
citation; a date by which the fine must be paid; a compliance date or range of
dates, if any; and the manner and time for taking an appeal. If a compliance
date or range of dates is given, the citation must state the action that must
be taken to achieve compliance, and it must conspicuously state that if
compliance is not achieved within the stated time, the city may thereafter
abate the violation without further warning and with assessment of the costs
therefore to the subject property. Any compliance date must be not less than
seven nor more than 30 days following the date the citation is issued;
provided, however, that in an emergency situation that poses an immediate
threat to public safety, health or welfare, an earlier compliance date may be
set. The compliance date may be extended by the Code Compliance Official for up
to 30 days following the date of the citation upon a determination by the Code
Compliance Official that a reasonable plan for remedying the violation exists.
The plan must be agreed to in writing by the owner of the property for an
extension to be granted. Unless an appeal is taken or compliance is achieved
before the compliance date, no further notice is necessary prior to the entry
on the property by city officials or their agents and assignees to abate the
violation and assess the costs of abatement to the property.
         (c)   The owner or occupant of the property must pay the fine and, if
required, come into compliance, or appeal, in a manner consistent with division
(A)(5)(d), within any time period specified on the citation. Unless the
violation is a second or subsequent violation pursuant to division (A)(4)(c) or
is a violation for which a fine is imposed pursuant to division (A)(4)(d), the
fine will be waived if compliance is achieved by the compliance date. Voluntary
compliance after the citation is issued and/or payment of the fine constitutes
admission of the violation. The Code Compliance Official may extend the time
for appeal only on a showing of good cause. Payment of the fine does not
forgive continued violation of city code.
         (d)   Contents of appeal. The appeal must be in writing and executed
by the owner of the property. The appeal must minimally state the name and
mailing address of the person that caused the violation, that person's
relationship to the property involved, and a brief statement why the citation
is in error.
      (6)   Appeal procedure.
         (a)   The City Clerk, upon receipt of a proper notice of appeal, shall
stay any fine or abatement action until the time for appeals under this chapter
has run.
         (b)   Within ten days of the date of the citation or prior to the
deadline for compliance, whichever is sooner, any party aggrieved by the
citation may appeal the citation to the board. The appeal must comply with
division (A)(5)(d), and must be served in person or by U.S. Mail on the City
Clerk.
         (c)   Upon receipt of a proper appeal under division (A)(6)(b), the
City Clerk shall place the matter before the board for a hearing which shall be
held no earlier than ten days after receipt of the notice, unless otherwise
agreed to by the parties. Notice of the hearing must be served in person or by
U.S. Mail on the person or persons to whom the citation was issued. At the
hearing, the parties may present documents and testimony, and may question
witnesses, and the Planning Commission Chairman shall preside over the hearing.
The board must record the hearing and receive testimony and exhibits. The board
must rule by majority vote on objections, and receive and give weight to
evidence, including reliable hearsay evidence that possesses probative value
commonly accepted by reasonable and prudent people in the conduct of their
affairs. The hearing may be continued from time to time at the discretion of
the board.
         (d)   At any time before the hearing, or before the hearing is
adjourned, the Code Compliance Official may modify the citation to change
counts or include additional counts, with notice to the person bringing the
appeal. If not made during the hearing, the notice must be in writing and given
to the person or served by U.S. Mail.
         (e)   The board must affirm or rescind the citation, as it may have
been modified under division (A)(6)(d), and provide written notice of its
determination to the parties. If a citation consists of more than one count,
the board may consider each count independently. A majority of the members
present must agree in order to affirm a citation or any particular count. A
failure to adopt a motion to affirm constitutes a rescission. The board may
reconsider the motion to affirm at any time before the hearing is finally
adjourned. The board's determination, if the citation or any particular count
of the citation is affirmed, revokes the stay of the applicable fine and
compliance dates, if any, and payment and compliance must occur within ten days
of the date of the notice of determination, unless an aggrieved party perfects
a court-ordered stay with the deposit of an appropriate supersedeas bond under
the Minnesota Rules of Civil Procedure.
         (f)   The board's decision is final without any further right of
administrative appeal. Further appeal shall only be by writ of certiorari to
the Minnesota Court of Appeals.
      (7)   Recovery of civil penalties.
         (a)   If a civil penalty is not paid within the time specified, it
constitutes:
            1.   A personal obligation of the violator; and
            2.   A lien upon the real property upon which the violation
occurred if the property or improvements on the property were the subject of
the violation and the property owner was given notice of the violation.
         (b)   A lien may be assessed against the property and collected in the
same manner as taxes.

or invalidity in any action or proceeding with respect thereto.
      (2)   Taxes. If any portion of a tax imposed by this program, including

action.

annum.
   (B)   Penalties.
      (1)   Taxes. If any tax imposed by this subchapter is not paid within the
time herein specified for payment, or any extension thereof, there shall be
added thereto a specific penalty equal to 10% of the amount remaining unpaid.
      (2)   Returns.
         (a)   In case of any failure to make and file a return within the time

unpaid if the failure is not for more than 30 days, with an additional 5% for
each additional 30 days or fraction thereof during which failure continues, not
exceeding 25% in the aggregate. If the penalty as computed does not exceed $10,
a minimum penalty of $10 shall be assessed. The amount so added to any tax
shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner and as a part of the
tax unless the tax has been paid before the discovery of the negligence, in
which case the amount so added shall be collected in the same manner as the
tax.
         (b)   If any person willfully files a false or fraudulent return or
willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any such tax or payment
thereof, there shall also be imposed as a penalty an amount equal to 50% of any
tax (less amounts paid on the basis of such false or fraudulent return) found
due for the period to which such return related. The penalty imposed by this
division (B)(2) shall be collected as part of the tax and shall be in addition
to any other penalties provided by this chapter.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 50.01 GENERAL OPERATION.
   The city does hereby make provision for the establishment of a municipal
water system (hereinafter called the “water system”) to be operated as a public
utility.
(Prior Code, § 50.01)
§ 50.02 USE OF WATER SERVICE.
   No person other than a city employee shall uncover or make or use any water
service installation connected to the city water system, except in the manner
provided by this chapter. No person shall make or use any such installation
contrary to the regulatory provisions of this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 50.02) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 50.03 USE TO CIRCUMVENT CHAPTER PROHIBITED.
   No person shall permit water from the water system to be used for any
purpose to circumvent this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 50.03) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 50.04 DAMAGE TO WATER SYSTEM.
   (A)   No unauthorized person shall remove or damage any structure,
appurtenance or part of the water system or fill or partially fill any
excavation or move any gate valve used in the water system.
   (B)   No person shall make any connection of an electrical welder to the
city water main, appurtenance or service or use an electric welder for the
purpose of thawing frozen water mains, appurtenances or services, except under
city direction.
(Prior Code, § 50.04) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 50.05 CONNECTIONS BEYOND CITY BOUNDARIES.
   Where water mains of the city are in any street or alley adjacent to or
outside the corporate limits of the city, the City Council may issue permits to
the owners or occupants of properties adjacent or accessible to the water main
to make proper water service pipe connections with the water mains of the city
and to be supplied with water in conformity with the applicable provisions of
this chapter and subject to any contract for the supply of water between the
city and any other municipality.
(Prior Code, § 50.05) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 50.06 CONNECTION TO SYSTEM REQUIRED; USE OF PRIVATE WELLS.
   (A)   Except where municipal water is not available, it shall be unlawful to
construct, reconstruct or repair any private water system which is designed or
intended to provide water for human consumption. Private wells to provide water
for other than human consumption may be constructed, maintained and continued
in use after connection is made to the water system; provided, there is no
means of cross- connection between the private well and municipal water supply
at any time. Hose bibbs that will enable the cross-connection of the two
systems are prohibited on internal piping of the well system supply. Where both
private and city systems are in use, outside hose bibbs shall not be installed
on both systems.
   (B)   All new homes or buildings shall connect to the municipal water system
if water is available to the property. At the time as municipal water becomes
available to existing homes or buildings, a direct connection shall be made to
the public system within a period of time as determined by the City Council. If
the connection is not made pursuant to this chapter, a penalty shall be levied
in an amount set by City Council resolution.
   (C)   Where new homes or buildings do not have water available to the
property, the city shall determine whether and under what conditions the
municipal water system will be extended to serve the property.
   (D)   If the well is not to be used after the time a municipal water
connection is made:
      (1)   The well pump and tank shall be disconnected from all internal
piping;
      (2)   The casing shall be filled with sandy soil from the bottom to a
point eight feet from the top;
      (3)   The remaining eight feet shall be filled with concrete to the floor
level and the well casing cut off as close to the floor level as possible;
      (4)   Within 30 days after the municipal water connection is made, the
owner or occupant must advise the city’s Building Inspector that the well has
been sealed; or
      (5)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, all well abandonment shall be done
in accordance with the state’s Department of Health Well Code.
(Prior Code, § 50.06) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 50.07 USE OF WATER FOR AIR CONDITIONING; PERMITS.
   (A)   All air conditioning systems which are connected directly or
indirectly with the public water system must be equipped with water conserving
and water regulating devices as approved by the City Engineer or City Building
Inspector.
   (B)   Permits shall be required for the installation of all air conditioning
systems to the public water system.
(Prior Code, § 50.07) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 50.08 USE OF WATER FROM FIRE HYDRANTS; TEMPORARY CONNECTIONS.
   (A)   Use of fire hydrants. Except for extinguishment of fires, no person,
unless authorized by the Public Works Director or Public Utilities Department,
shall operate fire hydrants or interfere in any way with the water system
without first obtaining a permit to do so from the city as follows.
      (1)   A permit to use a fire hydrant shall be issued for each individual
job or contract and for a minimum of 30 days and for additional 30-day periods
as the city shall determine. The permit shall state the location of the hydrant
and shall be for the use of that hydrant and none other.
      (2)   The user shall make an advance cash deposit to guarantee payment
for water used and to cover breakage and damage to the hydrant and meter, which
shall be refunded upon expiration of the permit, less applicable charges for
use.
      (3)   The user shall relinquish the use of the hydrant to authorized city
employees in emergency situations.
      (4)   The user shall pay a rental charge as set by City Council
resolution for each day including Sundays and legal holidays, and a fee as set
by City Council resolution for each 1,000 gallons of water used.
   (B)   Temporary connection to fire hydrants. An owner of a private water
system may make a temporary above ground connection to a fire hydrant, subject
to the time periods, conditions, and payment specified in §
50.46 of this chapter. In addition, the method of connection to the private
system shall conform to all existing requirements of this chapter and city
ordinance and the type of meter used shall meet the approval of the Public
Utilities Department.
(Prior Code, § 50.08) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 50.09 WATER DEFICIENCY, SHUT OFF AND USE RESTRICTIONS.
   The city shall not be liable for any deficiency or failure in the supply of
water to consumers, whether occasioned by shutting the water off for the
purpose of making repairs or connections or from any other cause whatsoever. In
case of fire, or alarm of fire, or in making repairs of construction of new
works, water may be shut off without notice at any time and kept off as long as
necessary. In addition, the City Council shall have the right to impose
reasonable restrictions on the use of the city water system in emergency
situations. For non-payment of charges, water service may be discontinued
according to the procedures established in §
50.62 of this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 50.09)
WATER REGULATIONS
§ 50.20 SUPPLY FROM ONE SERVICE.
   No more than one housing unit or building shall be supplied from one service
connection, except by permission of City Council. Each unit served shall have a
separate water meter.
(Prior Code, § 50.25) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 50.21 TAPPING OF MAINS RESTRICTED.
   No person, except persons authorized by the City Council, shall tap any
distributing main or pipe of the water supply system or insert stopcocks or
ferrules therein.
(Prior Code, § 50.26) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 50.22 REPAIRS.
   (A)   Determination of need for repairs. Based on the information supplied
by the property owner or available to the city, the city will make a
determination whether a problem exists in that portion of the service which is
the city’s responsibility. If the problem appears to exist in the areas for
which the city has no responsibility, the private owners will be responsible
for correction of the problem.
   (B)   Thawing of water services. The city will attempt to thaw water
services on request of the resident. If the problem is found within that
portion of the service for which the private owner is responsible, the private
owner thereafter will be responsible for thawing the service and correction of
the problem.
   (C)   Excavation or repair of water service.
      (1)   The city will arrange for the investigative digging up and repair
of any water service where the problem apparently exists within that area for
which the city has responsibility.
      (2)   Unless it is clearly evident, however, that the problem is the
responsibility of the city, the excavation and repair will not be made until
the property owner requests the city in writing to excavate or repair the
service and agrees to pay the cost.
      (3)   The owner further agrees to waive public hearing and be special
assessed the cost of the excavation and repair if the problem is found to be
other than the city’s responsibility. The city will make the determination for
responsibility of the cost of investigation or repair.
      (4)   The matter of whether the dig up is done by city forces or
contracted would depend on the urgency or need of repair and the availability
of city forces to do the work. Recovery by the city for faulty construction
will depend upon the circumstances and the decision of the City Attorney on the
likelihood of recovery.
   (D)   Failure to repair. In case of failure upon the part of any consumer or
owner to repair any leak occurring in his or her service pipe within 24 hours
after verbal or written notice thereof, the water may be turned off by the city
and shall not be turned on until the leak has been repaired and a fee pursuant
to §
50.46 of this chapter has been paid to the city.
(Prior Code, § 50.27) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 50.23 ABANDONED OR UNUSED SERVICES.
   (A)   If the premises served by water have been abandoned, or if the service
has not been used for one year, then the service shall be shut off at the curb
stop box by the city and the water meter will be removed.
   (B)   When new buildings are erected on the site of old ones, and it is
desired to increase or change the old water service, no connections with the
mains shall be made until all the old service has been removed and the main
taps plugged or yoked connections installed by the city at the owner’s expense.
(Prior Code, § 50.28) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 50.24 DISCONNECTION PERMIT.
   A permit must be obtained to disconnect from the existing water service
leads at the curb stop box. The fee for the permit shall be set pursuant to §
50.46 of this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 50.29) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 50.25 SERVICE PIPES.
   Every service pipe shall be laid so as to allow at least one foot of extra
length in order to prevent rupture by settlement. The service pipe must be
placed no less than seven feet below the ground and in a manner as to prevent
rupture by freezing. Service pipes must extend from the curb stop box to the
inside of the building, or if not taken into the building, then to the hydrant
or fixtures which it is intended to supply. Type K copper tubing shall be used
up to and including two-inch services. All underground joints are to be
mechanical, except joints under floors shall be silver soldered, unless
otherwise approved by the city’s Building Inspector. Joints of copper tubing
shall be kept, to a minimum, with not more than one joint used for service for
each 70 feet in length. Splicing may be approved with three-piece unions only.
All joints and connections shall be left uncovered until inspected by the
city’s Building Inspector and tested at normal water line pressure. Unions must
be three- piece type. All services over two inches shall be cast iron or any
material approved by the City Engineer. Connections with the mains for domestic
supply shall be at least three-quarter inch up to the curb stop box.
(Prior Code, § 50.30) (Ord. 6-2007, passed 5-1-2007) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 50.26 EXCAVATION AND CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   No excavation shall be made until a permit for the connection has been
issued by the city.
   (B)   No water service pipe or water connection shall be installed in the
same trench or closer than ten feet horizontally to a sewer trench or drain
laid, or to be laid, either in the street or in private property; except that
the water pipe on private property may be in a common trench with a sewer drain
which is of a material that is in conformance with the current State Plumbing
Code, as adopted by the city, and the state’s Department of Health regulations.
   (C)   Where it is desired to lay the water service pipe and the building
sewer pipe in the same trench, or in separate trenches less than ten feet
apart, the water service pipe shall be above the sewer pipe unless approved by
the City Engineer. It shall be placed at least one foot above the sewer and on
a solid shelf excavated at one side of the trench. The sewer pipe shall be of a
material that is in conformance with the state’s Plumbing Code and the state’s
Department of Health regulations with tested water-tight joints. The water
service pipe shall be water-tight and corrosion resistant. Copper pipe and cast
iron water pipe with specially protected joints is acceptable for this
construction. Cast iron pipe shall conform to the American Water Works
Association specifications for the pipe. Bell joint clamps with rubber gaskets
are provisionally acceptable as extra protection for the joints on cast iron
water pipe. In all cases, precautions shall be taken to assure a firm
foundation for the pipes. The intervening space between the pipes shall be
backfilled with compacted earth.
   (D)   In case the installation is on a surfaced street, the following shall
apply. All backfill materials shall be mechanically compacted in 12-inch layers
to the density of the adjacent material in the roadway area and to the existing
street grades in accordance with the state’s Department of Transportation
standards. Complete surface restoration shall be made.
(Prior Code, § 50.31) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 50.27 CONNECTION TO OTHER WATER SUPPLIES RESTRICTED.
   No water pipe of the water system shall be connected with any pump, well,
tank or piping that is connected with any other source of water supply, except
to service municipal systems.
(Prior Code, § 50.32) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 50.28 WATER CONNECTIONS; APPLICATIONS AND CHARGES.
   (A)   Connection applications.
      (1)   All applications for service installations and for water service
shall be made to the city’s Clerk-Administrator. All applications for service
installations and water service shall be made by the owner or agent of the
property to be served and shall state the size and location of service

§ 51.098 ESTABLISHMENT OF A SEWER SERVICE CHARGE SYSTEM.
   (A)   The city hereby establishes a sewer service charge system whereby all
revenue collected from users of the wastewater treatment facilities will be
used to affect all expenditures incurred for annual operation, maintenance and
replacement and for debt service on capital expenditure incurred in
constructing the wastewater treatment works.
   (B)   Each user shall pay its proportionate share of operation, maintenance
and replacement costs of the treatment works, based on the users proportionate
contribution to the total wastewater loading from all users.
   (C)   Each user shall pay debt service charges to retire local capital costs
as determined by the City Council.
   (D)   Sewer service rates and charges to users of the wastewater treatment
facility shall be determined and fixed in a sewer service charge system
developed according to the provisions of this subchapter. The sewer service
charge system shall be adopted by resolution upon enactment of this subchapter,
shall be published in the local newspaper, and shall be effective upon
publication. Subsequent changes in sewer service rates and charges shall be
adopted by Council resolution and shall be published in the local newspaper.
   (E)   Revenues collected for sewer service shall be deposited in a separate
fund known as the Sewer Service Fund. Income from revenues collected will be
expended to off-set the cost of operation, maintenance and equipment
replacement for the facility and to retire the debt for capital expenditure.
   (F)   Sewer service charges and the sewer service fund will be administrated
in accordance with the provisions of §
51.101 of this chapter.
   (G)   A connection fee as fixed in the sewer service charge system shall be
charged to each user connecting a new service to the sanitary sewer system. The
connection fee shall be due and payable within 90 days of the date the
connection is completed.
(Prior Code, § 51.113) Penalty, see §
51.999
§ 51.099 DETERMINATION OF SEWER SERVICE CHARGES.
   (A)   Users of the city wastewater treatment works shall be identified as
belonging to one of the following user classes: residential; commercial;
industrial; institutional; or governmental. The allocation of users to these
categories for the purpose of assessing user charges and debt service charges
shall be the responsibility of the city’s Clerk-Administrator. Allocation of
users to user classes shall be based on the substantive intent of the
definitions of these classes contained herein.
   (B)   The charges assessed residential users and those users of other
classes who discharge normal domestic strength wastewater shall be calculated
on the basis of wastewater volume. Those industrial users who discharge normal
domestic strength wastewater only can be classified as commercial users for the
purpose of rate determination.
   (C)   The sewer service charge shall consist of a user charge for operation,
maintenance and replacement costs, a debt service charge for recovery of local
capital costs and an administration fee for recovery of administrative related
costs.
   (D)   The charges assessed residential users and those users of other
classes discharging normal domestic strength wastewater shall be established
proportionately according to billable wastewater volume. Billable wastewater
volume shall be calculated as follows.
      (1)   Residential users. Billable wastewater volume for residential users
shall be calculated on the basis of metered water usage. The per quarter
billable wastewater volume shall be equal to quarterly metered water usage as
averaged between the first and last quarters of the calendar year. The city may
require residential users to install water meters for the purpose of
determining billable wastewater volume.
      (2)   Non-residential users. The billable wastewater volume of non-
residential users may be determined in the same manner as for residential
users; except that, if the city determines that there are significant seasonal
variations in the metered water usage of non-residential users resulting in a
proportionate increase or decrease in wastewater volume, then billable
wastewater volume shall be calculated on the basis of quarterly metered water
usage as recorded throughout the year, or calculated on the basis of wastewater
flow meters. The city may, at its discretion, require non-residential users to
install such additional water meters or wastewater flow meters as may be
necessary to determine billable wastewater volume.
      (3)   Non-metered users. For those users who discharge normal domestic
strength wastewater, as defined in this subchapter, and who do not have
existing water meters, wastewater volume will be calculated on the basis of
equivalent dwelling units (EDUs). An equivalent dwelling unit at a volume of
200 gallons per day will be assigned to connections according to §
51.103 of this chapter. Determination of the number of EDUs assigned to a
particular connection, in accordance with §
51.103 of this chapter, shall be the responsibility of the City Council or its
authorized representative. Users may appeal the number of EDUs assigned to a
particular connection by installing and maintaining, at their own expense,
water meters of a type approved by the city. The meters shall be equipped with
remote registering recorders and located at an accessible site on the owner’s
property.
   (E)   Determination of sewer service charges.
      (1)   Generally. The sewer service charge shall consist of an
administration fee for the recovery of administration costs. A user charge for
operation, maintenance and replacement and a debt service charge for the
recovery of local capital costs. These charges shall be determined as follows.
      (2)   Administration fee. The administration fee for each connection to
the wastewater treatment facility shall be determined as follows: calculation
of fixed quarterly fee for administration services:
         AF = AC / (TC × Q)
   Where:
      AF = Administration fee per connection
      AC = Annual administration budget
      TC = Total number of connections to the system
      Q = Number of quarters per year
      (3)   User charge. User charges for normal domestic strength users shall
be determined as follows:
         (a)   Calculation of unit cost for treatment of domestic strength
wastewater.
         UOMR = COMR-A / TBWV
   Where:
      UOMR = Unit cost for OM&R in $/Kgallon
      COMR-A = Total annual OM&R less administration costs
      TBWV = Total annual billable wastewater volume in Kgallon
         (b)   Calculation of user charge.
         UC = UOMR × BWV
   Where:
      UC = User charge
    UOMR = Unit cost for OM&R in $/Kgallon
    BWV = Billable wastewater volume of a particular user in Kgallon
      (4)   Debt service charge. Recovery of local capital costs of the
wastewater treatment facility shall be through a debt service charge calculated
in a manner consistent with the user charge as follows:
         (a)   Calculation of unit cost for debt service.
         UDS = CDS / TBWV
   Where:
    UDS = Unit cost for debt service in $/Kgallon
    CDS = Costs of annual debt service
    TBWV = Total annual billable wastewater volume in Kgallon
         (b)   Calculation of debt service charge.
         DC = UDS × BWV
   Where:
      DC = Debt service charge
    UDS = Unit cost for debt service in $/Kgallon
    BWV = Billable wastewater volume of a particular user in Kgallon
      (5)   Determination of sewer service charge. The sewer service charge for
a particular connection shall be determined as follows:
         SSC = UC + DC + AF
   Where:
      SSC = Sewer service charge
       UC = User charge
       DC = Debt service charge
       AF = Administration fee
   (F)   The sewer service charges established in this subchapter shall not
prevent the assessment of additional charges to users who discharge wastes with
concentrations greater than normal domestic strength or wastes of unusual
character, or contractual agreements with the users, as long as the following
conditions are met:
      (1)   The user pays operation, maintenance and replacement costs in
proportion to the user’s proportionate contribution of wastewater flows and
loadings to the treatment plant, and no user is charged at a rate less than
that of normal domestic strength wastewater; and
      (2)   The measurements of the wastes are conducted according to the
latest edition of the Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and
Wastewater in a manner acceptable to the city as provided for in this chapter.

administrated according to the following provisions.
   (A)   The city’s Clerk-Administrator shall maintain a proper system of
accounts suitable for determining the operation and maintenance, equipment
replacement and debt retirement costs of the treatment works, and shall furnish
the City Council with a report of the costs annually in December. The City
Council shall annually determine whether or not sufficient revenue is being
generated for the effective operation, maintenance, replacement and management
of the treatment works, and whether sufficient revenue is being generated for
debt retirement. The Council will also determine whether the user charges are
distributed proportionately to each user in accordance with §
51.098(B) of this chapter and § 204(b)(2)(A) of the Act, being 33 U.S.C. § 1284
(b)(2)(A), as amended. The city shall thereafter, but not later than the end of
the year, reassess and as necessary revise the sewer service charge system then
in use to ensure the proportionality of the user charges and to ensure the
sufficiency of funds to maintain the capacity and performance to which the
facilities were constructed and to retire the construction debt.
   (B)   In accordance with federal and state requirements, each user will be
notified annually in conjunction with a regular billing of that portion of the
sewer service charge attributable to operation, maintenance and replacement.
   (C)   In accordance with federal and state requirements, the city’s Clerk-
Administrator shall be responsible for maintaining all records necessary to
document compliance with the sewer service charge system adopted.
   (D)   Bills for sewer service charges shall be rendered on a monthly basis
succeeding the period for which the service was rendered. Sewer billing shall
follow the same water billing procedures established in §
50.49. Disconnection of services for late payment shall follow the procedures
established in §
51.102 of this chapter.
   (E)   All accounts shall be carried in the name of the property owner who
personally, or by his or her authorized agent, applied for such service. A
property owner shall be liable for all utility services supplied to the
property by the City, whether or not he or she occupies the property. Any
unpaid charges shall be a lien upon the property in the form of a special
assessment. All bills and notices shall be mailed to the property owner. For
rental properties, a copy of the bill can be mailed to the address where
service is provided at the property owner’s request.

in determining a dangerous or potentially dangerous dog:
         (a)   Whether any injury or damage to a person by the dog was caused
while the dog was protecting or defending a person or the dog’s offspring
within the immediate vicinity of the dog from an unjustified attack or assault.
         (b)   The size and strength of the dog, including jaw strength, and
the animal's propensity to bite humans or other domestic animals.
         (c)   Whether the dog has wounds, scarring, is observed in a fight, or
has other indications that the dog has been or will be used, trained or
encouraged to fight with another animal or whose owner is in possession of any
training apparatus, paraphernalia or drugs used to prepare such dogs to fight
with other animals.
      (2)   Beginning six months after a dog is declared dangerous or
potentially dangerous, an owner may request annually that the city review the
designation. The owner must provide evidence that the dog’s behavior has
changed due to the dog’s age, neutering, environment, completion of obedience
training or other factors. If enough evidence is provided, the city may rescind
the designation.
      (3)   Exceptions.
         (a)   The provisions of this section do not apply to dogs used by law
enforcement.
         (b)   Dogs may not be declared dangerous or potentially dangerous if
the threat, injury, or danger was sustained by a person who was:
            1.   Committing a willful trespass or other tort upon the premises
occupied by the owner of the dog;
            2.   Provoking, tormenting, abusing or assaulting the dog, or who
can be shown to have a history of repeatedly provoking, tormenting, abusing, or
assaulting the dog; or
            3.   Committing or attempting to commit a crime.
   (D)   License required. The owner must annually license dangerous and
potentially dangerous dogs with the city and must license a newly declared
dangerous or potentially dangerous dog within 14 days after notice that a dog
has been declared dangerous or potentially dangerous. Regardless of any appeal
that may be requested, the owner must comply with the requirements of M.S. §
347.52 (a) and (c), as they may be amended from time to time, regarding proper
enclosures and notification to the city upon transfer or death of the dog,
until and unless a hearing officer or court of law reverses the declaration.
      (1)   Process for dangerous dogs. The city will issue a license to the
owner of a dangerous dog if the owner presents sufficient evidence that:
         (a)   There is a proper enclosure;
         (b)   Written proof that there is a surety bond by a surety company
authorized to conduct business in Minnesota in the sum of at least $300,000,
payable to any person injured by a dangerous dog, or receipt of a copy of a
policy of liability insurance issued by an insurance company authorized to do
business in Minnesota in the amount of at least $300,000, insuring the owner
for any personal injuries inflicted by the dangerous dog. Such surety bond or
insurance policy shall provide that no cancellation of the bond or policy will
be made unless the city is notified in writing by the surety company or the
insurance company at least ten days prior to such cancellation;
         (c)   The owner has paid the annual license fee for dangerous dogs.
         (d)   The owner has had a microchip identification implanted in the
dangerous dog. The name of the microchip manufacturer and identification number
of the microchip must be provided to the city. If the microchip is not
implanted by the owner, it may be implanted by the city at the owner’s expense;
and
         (e)   The owner provides proof that the dog has been sterilized. If
the owner does not sterilize the dog within 30 days, the city may seize the dog
and sterilize it at the owner’s expense.
      (2)   Process for potentially dangerous dogs. The city will issue a
license to the owner of a potentially dangerous dog if the owner presents
sufficient evidence that:
         (a)   There is a proper enclosure;
         (b)   The owner has paid the annual license fee;
         (c)   The owner has had a microchip identification implanted in the
potentially dangerous dog. The name of the microchip manufacturer and
identification number of the microchip must be provided to the city. If the
microchip is not implanted by the owner, it may be implanted by the city at the
owner’s expense.
      (3)   Inspection. A pre-license inspection of the premises to insure
compliance with the city code is required. If the city issues a license to the
owner of a dangerous or potentially dangerous dog, the city shall be allowed at
any reasonable time to inspect the dog, the proper enclosure and all places
where the animal is kept.
      (4)   Warning symbol. The owner of a dangerous dog licensed under this
section must post a sign with the uniform dangerous dog warning symbol on the
property in order to inform children that there is a dangerous dog on the
property. The sign will be provided by the city upon issuance of the license.
      (5)   Tags. A dangerous dog licensed under this section must wear a
standardized, easily identifiable tag at all times that contains the uniform
dangerous dog symbol, identifying the dog as dangerous. The tag shall be
provided by the city upon issuance of the license.
      (6)   License fee. The city will charge the owner an annual license fee
for a dangerous or potentially dangerous dog.
   (E)   Properly restrained in proper enclosure or outside of proper
enclosure. While on the owner’s property, an owner of a dangerous or
potentially dangerous dog must keep it in a proper enclosure. Inside a
residential home, there must be a secured area maintained where the dog will
stay when persons other than family members are present. If the dog is outside
the proper enclosure, the dog must be muzzled and restrained by a substantial
chain or leash no longer than four feet and under the physical restraint of an
adult. The muzzle must be made in a manner that will prevent the dog from
biting any person or animal but that will not cause injury to the dog or
interfere with its vision or respiration.
   (F)   Notification requirements to city.
      (1)   Relocation or death. The owner of a dog that has been declared
dangerous or potentially dangerous must notify the City Clerk-Administrator in
writing if the dog is to be relocated from its current address or if the dog
has died. The notification must be given in writing within 30 days of the
relocation or death. The notification must include the current owner’s name and
address, and the new owner’s name and the relocation address. If the relocation
address is outside of the city, the city may notify the local law enforcement
agency of the transfer of the dog into its jurisdiction.
      (2)   Renter’s obligations. A person who owns or possess a dangerous or
potentially dangerous dog and who will rent property from another where the dog
will reside must disclose to the property owner prior to entering the lease
agreement and at the time of any lease renewal periods that the person owns or
possesses a dangerous or potentially dangerous dog that will reside at the
property. A dog owner, who is currently renting property, must notify the
property owner within 14 days of city notification if the owned dog is newly
declared as dangerous or potentially dangerous and the owner keeps the dog on
the property.
      (3)   Transfer of ownership into the city. No dog that has been
previously determined to be dangerous or potentially dangerous by another
jurisdiction shall be kept, owned or harbored in the city unless the dog’s
owner complies with the requirements of this section prior to bringing the dog
into the city. Dogs in violation of this division are subject to impoundment
and destruction.
   (G)   Seizure. Animal control may immediately seize any dangerous or
potentially dangerous dog if:
      (1)   After 14 days after the owner has notice that the dog is declared
dangerous or potentially dangerous, the dog is not validly licensed and no
appeal has been filed;
      (2)   After 14 days after the owner has notice that the dog is dangerous,
the owner does not secure the proper liability insurance or surety coverage as
required or such required insurance is cancelled;
      (3)   The dog is not maintained in a proper enclosure;
      (4)   The dog is outside the proper enclosure and not under proper
restraint, as required by §
90.40(E);
      (5)   After 30 days after the owner has notice that the dog is dangerous,
the dog is not sterilized, as required by §
90.40(D)(1)(e);
      (6)   The dog’s microchip has been removed.
   (H)   Reclamation. A dog seized under §
90.40(G) may be reclaimed by the owner of the dog upon payment of maintenance
costs, and presenting proof to animal control that the requirements of this
section have been met. A dog not reclaimed under this division within seven
days may be disposed of and the owner will be liable to the city for
maintenance costs. A person claiming an interest in a seized dog may prevent
disposition of the dog by posting a security in an amount sufficient to provide
for the dog’s maintenance costs. The security must be posted with the city
within seven days of the seizure inclusive of the date seized.
   (I)   Subsequent offenses: seizure. If a person has been convicted of
violating a provision of this section, and the person is charged with a
subsequent violation relating to the same dog, the dog may be seized. If the
owner is convicted of the crime for which the dog was seized, the court may
order that the dog be destroyed in a proper and humane manner and the owner pay
the maintenance costs. If the owner is not convicted and the dog is not
reclaimed by the owner within seven days after the owner has been notified that
the dog may be reclaimed, the dog may be disposed of in manner permitted by
law.
   (J)   Notice, hearings.
      (1)   Notice. After a dog has been declared dangerous or potentially
dangerous or has been seized for destruction, the city shall give notice by
delivering or mailing it to the owner of the dog, or by posting a copy of it at
the place where the dog is kept, or by delivering it to a person residing on
the property, and telephoning, if possible. The notice shall include:
         (a)   A description of the seized dog; the authority for and purpose
of the declaration and seizure; the time, place, and circumstances under which
the dog was declared; and the telephone number and contact person where the dog
is kept;
         (b)   A statement that the owner of the dog may request a hearing
concerning the declaration and that failure to do so within 14 days of the date
of the notice will terminate the owner’s right to a hearing;
         (c)   A statement that if an appeal request is made within 14 days of
the notice, the owner must immediately comply with the requirements of M.S. §
347.52, paragraphs (a) and (c), as they may be amended from time to time,
regarding proper enclosures and notification to the city upon transfer or death
of the dog, until such time as the hearing officer issues an opinion;
         (d)   A statement that if the hearing officer affirms the dangerous
dog declaration, the owner will have 14 days from receipt of that decision to
comply with all other requirements of M.S. §§ 347.51, 347.515, and 347.52, as
they may be amended from time to time;
         (e)   A form to request a hearing; and
         (f)   A statement that if the dog has been seized, all maintenance
costs of the care, keeping, and disposition of the dog pending the outcome of
the hearing are the responsibility of the owner, unless a court or hearing
officer finds that the seizure or impoundment was not reasonably justified by
law.
      (2)   Right to hearing.
         (a)   After a dog has been declared dangerous, potentially dangerous
or has been seized for destruction, the owner may appeal in writing to the city
within 14 days after notice of the declaration or seizure. Failure to do so
within 14 days of the date of the notice will terminate the owner’s right to a
hearing. The owner must pay a $100 fee for an appeal hearing.
         (b)   The appeal hearing will be held within 14 days of the request.
The hearing officer must be an impartial employee of the city or an impartial
person retained by the city to conduct the hearing.
         (c)   If the declaration or destruction is upheld by the hearing
officer, actual expenses of the hearing up to a maximum of $1,000, as well as
all maintenance costs, will be the responsibility of the dog's owner. The
hearing officer shall issue a decision on the matter within ten days after the
hearing. The decision shall be delivered to the dog’s owner by hand delivery or
registered mail as soon as practical and a copy shall be provided to the city.
The decision of the hearing officer is final.
   (K)   Destruction of certain dogs. The Police Chief and/or hearing officer
are authorized to order the destruction or other disposition of any dog, after
proper notice is given pursuant to §
90.40(J) and upon a finding that:
      (1)   The dog has habitually destroyed property or habitually trespassed
in a damaging manner on property of persons other than the owner;
      (2)   The dog has been declared dangerous, the owner’s right to appeal
hereunder has been exhausted or expired, and the owner has failed to comply
with the provisions of this section;
      (3)   It is determined that the dog is infected with rabies;
      (4)   The dog inflicted substantial or great bodily harm on a human on
public or private property without provocation;
      (5)   The dog inflicted multiple bites on a human on public or private
property without provocation;

         (b)   The strength of the dog, including jaw strength;
         (c)   The dog’s tolerance for pain;

person has been:
         (a)   Convicted of a third or subsequent violation of §
90.40(D), (E) or (F) or similar ordinance in another jurisdiction, or M.S. §§
347.51, 347.515 or 347.52, as they may be amended from time to time;
         (b)   Convicted of 2nd degree manslaughter due to negligent or

609.226, subd. 1, as it may be amended from time to time.
      (2)   Any person who owns a dangerous or potentially dangerous dog and is
found to be in violation of any of the provisions of this section or had owned
a dangerous or potentially dangerous dog but never achieved compliance with
this section may be prohibited from ownership or custody of another dog for a
period of five years after the original declaration. Any dog found to be in
violation, may be impounded until due process is completed, pursuant to §
90.40(J).
      (3)   If any member of a household is prohibited from owning a dog in §
90.40(M)(1) or (2), unless specifically approved with or without restrictions
by the city, no person in the household is permitted to own a dog.
   (N)   Dog ownership prohibition review. Beginning three years after a
conviction under §
90.40(M)(1) that prohibits a person from owning a dog, and annually thereafter,
the person may request in writing to the Police Chief that the city review the
prohibition. The city may consider such facts as the seriousness of the
violation or violations that led to the prohibition, any criminal convictions,
or other facts that the city deems appropriate. The city may rescind the
prohibition entirely or rescind it with limitations. The city also may
establish conditions a person must meet before the prohibition is rescinded,
including, but not limited to, successfully completing dog training or dog
handling courses. If the city rescinds a person’s prohibition and the person
subsequently fails to comply with any limitations imposed by the city or the
person is convicted of any animal violation involving unprovoked bites or dog
attacks, the city may permanently prohibit the person from owning a dog in this
state.

(Ord. 02-2018, passed 4-10-2018)
§ 91.17 RIGHT-OF-WAY PATCHING AND RESTORATION.
   (A)   Timing. The work to be done under the excavation permit, and the
patching and restoration of the right-of-way as required herein, must be
completed within the dates specified in the permit, increased by as many days
as work could not be done because of circumstances beyond the control of the
permittee or when work was prohibited as unseasonable or unreasonable.
   (B)   Patch and restoration. Permittee shall patch its own work. The city
may choose either to have the permittee restore the right-of-way or to restore
the right-of-way itself.
      (1)   City restoration. If the city restores the right-of-way, the
permittee shall pay the costs thereof within 30 days of billing. If following
such restoration, the pavement settles due to the permittee’s improper
backfilling, the permittee shall pay to the city, within 30 days of billing,
all costs associated with having to correct the defective work.
      (2)   Permittee restoration. If the permittee restores the right-of-way
itself, it shall at the time of application for an excavation permit post a
construction performance bond in accordance with the provisions of Minnesota
Rules 7819.3000.
      (3)   Degradation fee in lieu of restoration. In lieu of right-of-way
restoration, a right-of-way user may elect to pay a degradation fee. However,
the right-of-way user shall remain responsible for patching and the degradation

   (C)   Standards. The permittee shall perform patching and restoration
according to the standards and with the materials specified by the city and
shall comply with Minnesota Rules 7819.1100.

patching, or restoration performed by permittee or its agents. The permittee,
upon notification from the city, shall correct all restoration work to the
extent necessary, using the method required by the city. Said work shall be
completed within five calendar days of the receipt of the notice from the city,
not including days during which work cannot be done because of circumstances
constituting force majeure or days when work is prohibited as unseasonable or
unreasonable.
   (E)   Failure to restore. If the permittee fails to restore the right-of-way
in the manner and to the condition required by the city, or fails to
satisfactorily and timely complete all restoration required by the city, the
city at its option may do such work. In that event the permittee shall pay to
the city, within 30 days of billing, the cost of restoring the right-of-way. If
the permittee fails to pay as required, the city may exercise its rights under
the construction performance bond.
(Ord. 02-2018, passed 4-10-2018)
§ 91.18 PERMIT LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   Limitation on area. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the area
of the right-of-way specified in the permit. No permittee may do any work
outside the area specified in the permit, except as provided herein. Any
permittee which determines that an area greater than that specified in the
permit must be obstructed or excavated must before working in that greater
area:
      (1)   Make application for a permit extension and pay any additional fees
required thereby; and
      (2)   Be granted a new permit or permit extension.
   (B)   Obstruction from small wireless facility work. The city will not
require an additional small wireless facility permit fee or require a new
collocation agreement for routine maintenance of a small wireless facility, for
replacement of a small wireless facility with a new facility that is
substantially similar or smaller in size, weight, height, and wind or
structural loading than the small wireless facility being replaced; or for
installation, placement, maintenance, operation, or replacement of micro
wireless facilities that are suspended on cables strung between existing
utility poles in compliance with national safety codes. The city may require
advance notification, however, of these activities if the work will obstruct
the public right-of-way.
   (C)   Limitation on dates. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the dates
specified in the permit. For a small wireless facility permit, the term of the
permit is equal to the length of time that the small wireless facility is in
use, unless the permit is revoked under this section. No permittee may begin
its work before the permit start date or, except as provided herein, continue
working after the end date. If a permittee does not finish the work by the
permit end date, it must apply for a new permit for the additional time it
needs, and receive the new permit or an extension of the old permit before
working after the end date of the previous permit. This supplementary
application must be submitted before the permit end date.

city personnel and to all others as authorized by law for inspection at all
reasonable times during the execution of and upon completion of the work.
   (C)   Authority of city.
      (1)   At the time of inspection, the city may order the immediate
cessation of any work, which poses a serious threat to the life, health,
safety, or well-being of the public.
      (2)   The city may issue an order to the permittee for any work that does
not conform to the terms of the permit or other applicable standards,
conditions, or codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the
violation will be cause for revocation of the permit. Within ten days after
issuance of the order, the permittee shall present proof to the city that the
violation has been corrected. If such proof has not been presented within the
required time, the city may revoke the permit per §
91.30.

occurrence of the emergency, the owner shall apply for the necessary permits,
pay the fees associated therewith and fulfill the rest of the requirements
necessary to bring itself into compliance with this chapter for the actions it
took in response to the emergency.
      (2)   If the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding facilities, the
city will attempt to contact the local representative of each facility owner
affected, or potentially affected, by the emergency. In any event, the city may
take whatever action it deems necessary to respond to the emergency, the cost
of which shall be borne by the person whose facilities occasioned the
emergency.
   (B)   Non-emergency situations. Except in an emergency, any person who,
without first having obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or excavates a
right-of-way must subsequently obtain a permit, and as a penalty pay double the
normal fee for said permit, pay double all the other fees required by this
code, deposit with the city the fees necessary to correct any damage to the
right-of-way and comply with all the requirements of this chapter.
(Ord. 02-2018, passed 4-10-2018)
§ 91.22 SUPPLEMENTARY NOTIFICATION.

or regulation, or any material condition of the permit. A substantial breach by
the permittee shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following:
      (1)   The violation of any material provision of the right-of-way permit;
      (2)   An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the right-
of-way permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit
upon the city or its citizens;
      (3)   Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a
right-of-way permit;
      (4)   The failure to complete the work in a timely manner; unless a

reasons beyond the permittees control; or
      (5)   The failure to correct, in a timely manner, work that does not
conform to a condition of the permit.
   (B)   Written notice of breach. If the city determines that the permittee
has committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any statute,
ordinance, rule, regulation or any condition of the permit, the city shall make
a written demand upon the permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall
state that continued violations might be cause for revocation of the permit.
   (C)   Procedural requirements. If the city decides to revoke the permit, the
revocation must be made in writing and must document the basis for the
revocation. The city must notify the right-of-way user in writing within three
business days of the decision to revoke a permit.

service laterals, other than minor repairs as defined in Minnesota Rules
7560.0150, subpart 2, shall require the permittee’s use of appropriate means of
establishing the horizontal locations of installed service laterals, and the
service lateral vertical locations in those cases where the city reasonably
requires it. Permittees or their subcontractors shall submit to the city
evidence of the installed service lateral locations. Compliance with this
division (B) and with applicable Gopher State One-Call Law and Minnesota rules
governing service laterals install after December 31, 2005, shall be a
condition of any city approval necessary for:

including those under M.S. Ch. 429, as it may be amended from time to time; and
      (2)   City approval of performance under development agreements, or other
subdivision or site plan approval under M.S. Ch. 462, as it may be amended from
time to time. The city shall reasonably determine the appropriate method of
providing such information. Failure to provide prompt and accurate information
on the service laterals installed may result in the revocation of the permit
issued for the work or for future permits to the offending permittee or its
subcontractors.
(Ord. 02-2018, passed 4-10-2018)
§ 91.25 LOCATION OF FACILITIES.
   (A)   Placement. Placement, location and relocation of facilities must

§ 93.01 PURPOSE.
   The City Council has determined that the health of elm trees within the
municipal limits is threatened by “Dutch Elm disease”, caused by the fungus
Ceratocystis ulmi. It is further determined that the loss of elm trees growing
upon public and private property would substantially depreciate the value of
property within the city and impair the safety, good order, general welfare and
convenience of the public. It is declared to be the intention of the Council to
control and prevent the spread of this disease and this subchapter is enacted
for this purpose.
(Prior Code, § 93.01) (Ord. 526, passed 4-5-1977)

take all reasonable precautions to prevent the commission and maintenance of
public nuisances. Except in emergency situations of imminent danger to human
life and safety, no peace officer or designated city official will enter

without the permission of the owner, resident or other person in control of the
property, unless the officer or person designated has obtained a warrant or
order from a court of competent jurisdiction authorizing entry.
(Ord. 01-2016, passed 4-8-2016)
§ 94.09 ABATEMENT PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Procedure. Whenever the peace officer or other designated official
designated that a public nuisance is being maintained or exists on the premises
in the city, the official shall notify in writing the owner of record or
occupant of the premises of such fact and order that the nuisance be terminated
or abated. The notice of violation shall specify the steps to be taken to abate
the nuisance and the time within which the nuisance is to be abated. If the
notice of violation is not complied with within the time specified, the
official shall report that fact forthwith to the City Council. Thereafter, the
City Council may, after notice to the owner or occupant and an opportunity to
be heard, determine that the condition identified in the notice of violation is
a nuisance and further order that if the nuisance is not abated within the time
prescribed by the City Council, the city may seek injunctive relief by serving
a copy of the City Council order and notice of motion for summary enforcement
or obtain an administrative search and seizure warrant and abate the nuisance.
   (B)   Notice. Written notice of the violation; notice of the time, date,
place and subject of any hearing before the City Council; notice of the City
Council order; and notice of motion for summary enforcement hearing shall be
served by a peace officer or designated official on the owner of record or
occupant of the premises either in person or by certified or registered mail.
If the premises is not occupied, the owner of record is unknown or if the owner
of record or occupant refuses to accept notice, notice of the violation shall
be served by positing it on the premises.
   (C)   Emergency procedure; summary enforcement. In cases of emergency, where
delay in abatement required to complete the procedure and notice requirements
as set forth in divisions (A) and (B) above will permit a continuing nuisance
to unreasonably endanger public health, safety or welfare, the City Council may
order summary enforcement and abate the nuisance. To proceed with summary
enforcement, the peace officer or other designated official shall determine
that a public nuisance exists or is being maintained on premises in the city
and that delay in abatement will unreasonably endanger public health, safety or
welfare. The officer or designated official shall notify in writing the
occupant or owner of the premises of the nature of the nuisance, whether public
health, safety or welfare will be unreasonably endangered by delay in abatement
required to complete the procedure set forth in division (A) above and may
order that the nuisance be immediately terminated or abated. If the nuisance is
not immediately terminated or abated, the City Council may order summary
enforcement and abate the nuisance.
   (D)   Immediate abatement. Nothing in this section shall prevent the city,
without notice or other process, from immediately abating any condition that
poses an imminent and serious hazard to human life or safety.
   (E)   Unlawful parties or gatherings.
      (1)   When law enforcement determines that a gathering is creating such a
noise disturbance as prohibited under §
94.04(D) of this chapter, the officer may order all persons present, other than
the owner or tenant of the premises where the disturbance is occurring, to
disburse immediately.
      (2)   No person shall refuse to leave after being ordered to do so by law
enforcement.
      (3)   Every owner or tenant of such premises who has knowledge of the
disturbance shall make every reasonable effort to see that the disturbance is
stopped.
   (F)   Judicial remedy. Nothing in this section shall prevent the city from
seeking a judicial remedy when no other adequate administrative remedy exists.

94.99
§ 94.10 RECOVERY OF COST.
   (A)   Personal liability.
      (1)   The owner of the premises on which a nuisance has been abated by
the city, or a person who has caused a public nuisance on property not owned by
that person, shall be personally liable for the cost to the city of the
abatement, including administrative costs. As soon as the work has been
completed and the cost determined, the City Clerk-Administrator or other city
official shall prepare a bill for the cost and mail it to the owner.
      (2)   Thereupon, the amount shall be immediately due and payable at the
office of the City Clerk-Administrator.
   (B)   Assessment. After notice and hearing as provided in M.S. § 429.061, as
it may be amended from time to time, if the nuisance is a public health or
safety hazard on private property, the accumulation of snow and ice on public
sidewalks, the growth of weeds on private property or outside the traveled
portion of streets, or unsound or insect-infected trees, the City Clerk-
Administrator shall, on or before September 1 next following abatement of the
nuisance, list the total unpaid charges along with all other such charges as
well as other charges for current services to be assessed under M.S. § 429.101,
as it may be amended from time to time, against each separate lot or parcel to
which the charges are attributable. The City Council may then spread the
charges against the property under that statute and any other pertinent
statutes for certification to the County Auditor and collection along with
current truces the following year or in annual installments, not exceeding ten,
as the City Council may determine in each case.
(Ord. 01-2016, passed 4-8-2016)

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 111.01 ADOPTION OF STATE LAW BY REFERENCE.
   The provisions of M.S. Ch. 340A, as they may be amended from time to time,
with reference to the definition of terms, conditions of operation,
restrictions on consumption, provisions relating to sales, hours of sale, and
all other matters pertaining to the retail sale, distribution, and consumption
of intoxicating liquor and 3.2 percent malt liquor are hereby adopted by
reference and are made a part of this chapter as if set out in full. It is the
intention of the City Council that all future amendments to M.S. Ch. 340A, as
it may be amended from time to time, are hereby adopted by reference or
referenced as if they had been in existence at the time this chapter is
adopted.
§ 111.02 CITY MAY BE MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN STATE LAW.
   The Council is authorized by the provisions of M.S. § 340A.509, as it may be
amended from time to time, to impose, and has imposed in this chapter,
additional restrictions on the sale and possession of alcoholic beverages
within its limits beyond those contained in M.S. Ch. 340A, as it may be amended
from time to time.
§ 111.03 DEFINITIONS.
   In addition to the definitions contained in M.S. § 340A.101, as it may be
amended from time to time, the following terms are defined for purposes of this
chapter:
   LIQUOR. As used in this chapter, without modification by the words
“intoxicating” or “3.2 percent malt,” includes both intoxicating liquor and 3.2
percent malt liquor.
   RESTAURANT. An eating facility, other than a hotel, under the control of a
single proprietor or manager, where meals are regularly prepared on the
premises, where full waitress/waiter table service is provided, where a
customer orders food from printed menus and where the main food course is
served and consumed while seated at a single location. To be a “restaurant” as
defined by this section, an establishment shall have a license from the state
as required by M.S. § 157.16, as it may be amended from time to time, and meet
the definition of either a “small establishment,” “medium establishment” or
“large establishment” as defined in M.S. § 157.16, subd. 3(d), as it may be
amended from time to time. An establishment which serves prepackaged food that
receives heat treatment and is served in the package or frozen pizza that is
heated and served, shall not be considered to be a restaurant for purposes of
this chapter unless it meets the definitions of “small establishment”, “medium
establishment” or “large establishment.”
§ 111.04 NUDITY ON THE PREMISES OF LICENSED ESTABLISHMENTS PROHIBITED.
   (A)   The City Council finds that it is in the best interests of the public
health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the city that nudity is
prohibited as provided in this section on the premises of any establishment
licensed under this chapter. This is to protect and assist the owners,
operators, and employees of the establishment, as well as patrons and the
public in general, from harm stemming from the physical immediacy and
combination of alcohol, nudity, and sex. The Council especially intends to
prevent any subliminal endorsement of sexual harassment or activities likely to
lead to the possibility of various criminal conduct, including prostitution,
sexual assault, and disorderly conduct. The Council also finds that the
prohibition of nudity on the premises of any establishment licensed under this
chapter, as set forth in this section, reflects the prevailing community
standards of the city.
   (B)   It is unlawful for any licensee to permit or allow any person or
persons on the licensed premises when the person does not have his or her
buttocks, anus, breasts, and genitals covered with a non- transparent material.
It is unlawful for any person to be on the licensed premises when the person
does not have his or her buttocks, anus, breasts, and genitals covered with a
non-transparent material.
   (C) A violation of this section is a misdemeanor punishable as provided by
law, and is justification for revocation or suspension of any liquor, wine, or
3.2 percent malt liquor license or the imposition of a civil penalty under the
provisions of §
111.99(B).
Penalty, see §
111.99
§ 111.05 CONSUMPTION IN PUBLIC PLACES.
   No person shall consume intoxicating liquor or 3.2 percent malt liquor in a
public park, on any public street, sidewalk, parking lot or alley, or in any
public place other than on the premises of an establishment licensed under this
chapter, in a municipal liquor dispensary if one exists in the city, or where
the consumption and display of liquor is lawfully permitted.
Penalty, see §
111.99
LICENSING
§ 111.20 NUMBER OF LICENSES WHICH MAY BE ISSUED.
   State law establishes the number of liquor licenses that a city may issue.
However, the number of licenses which may be granted under this chapter is
limited to the number of licenses which were issued as of the effective date of
this chapter, even if a larger number of licenses are authorized by law or
election. The Council in its sound discretion may provide by ordinance that a
larger number of licenses may be issued up to the number of licenses authorized
by M.S. Ch. 340A, as it may be amended from time to time. If a larger number of
licenses in a particular category has been authorized by a referendum held
under the provisions of M.S. § 340A.413, subd. 3, as it may be amended from
time to time, but not all of them have been issued, the larger number of
licenses is no longer in effect until the Council by ordinance determines that
any or all of the licenses may be issued. The Council is not required to issue
the full number of licenses that it has available.
§ 111.21 TERM AND EXPIRATION OF LICENSES.
   Each license shall be issued for a maximum period of one year. All licenses,
except temporary licenses, shall expire on December 31 of each year unless
another date is provided by ordinance. All licenses shall expire on the same
date. Temporary licenses expire according to their terms. Consumption and

to time. The Council may in its sound discretion authorize a retail on-sale

convention, banquet, conference, meeting, or social affair conducted on the
premises of a sports, convention, or cultural facility owned by the city, under
the provisions of M.S. § 340A.404, subd. 4(a), as it may be amended from time

§ 111.24 COUNCIL DISCRETION TO GRANT OR DENY A LICENSE.
   The Council in its sound discretion may either grant or deny the application
for any license or for the transfer or renewal of any license. No applicant has
a right to a license under this chapter.
§ 111.25 APPLICATION FOR LICENSE.
   (A)   Form. Every application for a license issued under this chapter shall
be on a form provided by the city. Every application shall state the name of
the applicant, the applicant’s age, representations as to the applicant’s
character, with references as the Council may require, the type of license
applied for, the business in connection with which the proposed license will
operate and its location, a description of the premises, whether the applicant
is owner and operator of the business, how long the applicant has been in that
business at that place, and other information as the Council may require from
time to time. An application for an on-sale intoxicating liquor license shall
be in the form prescribed by the Commissioner of Public Safety and shall also
contain the information required in this section. The form shall be verified
and filed with the city. No person shall make a false statement in an
application.
   (B)   Financial responsibility. Prior to the issuance of any license under
this chapter, the applicant shall demonstrate proof of financial responsibility
as defined in M.S. § 340A.409, as it may be amended from time to time, with
regard to liability under M.S. § 340A.801, as it may be amended from time to
time. This proof will be filed with the city and the Commissioner of Public
Safety. Any liability insurance policy filed as proof of financial
responsibility under this section shall conform to M.S. § 340A.409, as it may
be amended from time to time. Operation of a business which is required to be
licensed by this chapter without having on file with the city at all times
effective proof of financial responsibility is a cause for revocation of the
license.
Penalty, see §
111.99
§ 111.26 DESCRIPTION OF PREMISES.
   The application shall specifically describe the compact and contiguous
premises within which liquor may be dispensed and consumed. The description may

§ 111.27 APPLICATIONS FOR RENEWAL.
   At least 90 days before a license issued under this chapter is to be
renewed, an application for renewal shall be filed with the city. The decision
whether or not to renew a license rests within the sound discretion of the
Council. No licensee has a right to have the license renewed.
§ 111.28 TRANSFER OF LICENSE.
   No license issued under this chapter may be transferred without the approval
of the Council. Any transfer of stock of a corporate licensee is deemed to be a
transfer of the license, and a transfer of stock without prior Council approval
is a ground for revocation of the license. An application to transfer a license
shall be treated the same as an application for a new license, and all of the
provisions of this code applying to applications for a license shall apply.
Penalty, see §
111.99
§ 111.29 INVESTIGATION.
   (A)   Preliminary background and financial investigation. On an initial
application for a license, on an application for transfer of a license and, in
the sound discretion of the Council that it is in the public interest to do so,
on an application for renewal of a license, the city shall conduct a
preliminary background and financial investigation of the applicant or it may
contract with the Commissioner of Public Safety for the investigation. The
applicant shall pay with the application an investigation fee of $500 which
shall be in addition to any license fee. If the cost of the preliminary
investigation is less than $500, the unused balance shall be returned to the
applicant. The results of the preliminary investigation shall be sent to the
Commissioner of Public Safety if the application is for an on-sale intoxicating
liquor license or an on- sale wine license.
   (B)   Comprehensive background and financial investigation. If the results
of a preliminary investigation warrant, in the sound discretion of the Council,
a comprehensive background and financial investigation, the Council may either
conduct the investigation itself or contract with the Commissioner of Public
Safety for the investigation. The investigation fee for this comprehensive
background and financial investigation to be paid by the applicant shall be
$500, less any amount paid for the initial investigation if the investigation
is to be conducted within the state, and $10,000, less any amount paid for the
initial investigation, if the investigation is required outside the state. The
unused balance of the fee shall be returned to the applicant whether or not the
application is denied. The fee shall be paid in advance of any investigation
and the amount actually expended on the investigation shall not be refundable
in the event the application is denied. The results of the comprehensive
investigation shall be sent to the Commissioner of Public Safety if the
application is for an on-sale intoxicating liquor license or an on-sale wine
license.
§ 111.30 HEARING AND ISSUANCE.
   The Council shall investigate all facts set out in the application and not
investigated in the preliminary or comprehensive background and financial
investigations. Opportunity shall be given to any person to be heard for or
against the granting of the license. After the investigation and hearing, the
Council shall in its sound discretion grant or deny the application. No license
shall become effective until the proof of financial security has been approved
by the Commissioner of Public Safety.
§ 111.31 RESTRICTIONS ON ISSUANCE.
   (A)   Each license shall be issued only to the applicant for the premises
described in the application.

   (B)   The Council shall impose a civil penalty of up to $2,000 for each
violation of M.S. Ch. 340A, as it may be amended from time to time, and of this

for the Council to impose the civil penalty. A hearing under the Administrative
Procedures Act, M.S. §§ 14.57 to 14.70, as they may be amended from time to
time, is not required before the penalty is imposed, but the Council shall hold
a hearing on the proposed violation and the proposed penalty and hear any
person who wishes to speak. Non-payment of the penalty is grounds for
suspension or revocation of the license. The following is the minimum schedule
of presumptive civil penalties which must be imposed in addition to any
suspension unless the licenses is revoked:
      (1)   For the first violation within any three- year period, $500.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 112.01 PURPOSE.
   The City Council finds that pawnbrokers and precious metal dealers
potentially provide an opportunity for the commission and concealment of
crimes. Such businesses have the ability to receive and transfer stolen
property easily and quickly. The City Council also finds that consumer
protection regulation is warranted in transactions involving pawnbrokers and
precious metal dealers. The purpose of this chapter is to prevent pawnbroking
and precious metal businesses from being used as facilities for the commission
of crimes and to ensure that such businesses comply with basic consumer
protection standards, thereby protecting the public health, safety and general
welfare of the citizens of the city.

pay the fee specified above; except that, the fee shall be the smaller of the
stated dollar amount or the actual cost of the investigation. There shall be no
refund of the investigation fee for any person after the investigation has
begun.
   (B)   Term; pro rata fee. Each license shall expire on December 31 of the
year in which it is issued. Fees for licenses issued during the license year
shall be prorated according to the number of months remaining in the year. For
this purpose, an unexpired fraction of a month shall be counted as a whole
month which shall have elapsed.
   (C)   Refunds. No refund of any fee shall be made, except as authorized by
ordinance or code provision.
(Prior Code, § 112.18) (Ord. 583, passed 11-6-1996)
§ 112.19 BOND.
   At the time of filing an application for a license, the applicant shall file
a bond in the amount of $5,000 with the Clerk-Administrator. The bond, with a
duly licensed surety company as surety thereon, must be approved as to form by
the City Attorney. Said bond must be conditioned that the licensee shall
observe the ordinances and code provisions of the city in relation to the
business of pawnbroker and precious metal dealer, and that the licensee will
account for and deliver to any person legally entitled thereto any articles
which may have come into the possession of the licensee as pawnbroker or
precious metal dealer, or in lieu thereof such licensee shall pay the person or
persons the reasonable value thereof.
(Prior Code, § 112.19) (Ord. 583, passed 11-6-1996)
§ 112.20 LICENSE ISSUANCE AND TRANSFERABILITY.
   (A)   No new license shall be issued until the County Sheriff’s Department
has conducted an investigation of the representations set forth in the
application, the applicant’s moral character and the applicant’s financial
status. All applicants must cooperate with this investigation.
   (B)   (1)   The City Council may issue a license before an investigation,
for an applicant who:
         (a)   Had a license within the previous five years for the
establishment which is specified in the application and which is continuing to
operate under a license;
         (b)   Wishes to resume operation of the business without sufficient
time, through no fault of his or her own, to meet the normal procedural
requirements;
         (c)   Had no criminal license convictions, or license suspensions or
revocations, during the prior licensed period; and
         (d)   Otherwise qualifies and meets the requirements for a license.
      (2)   In this situation, the City Council may immediately issue an
interim license to the applicant for a period no longer than 90 days. The
applicant must thereafter proceed through the specified requirements for an
investigation. The applicant shall have no greater right to continuation of the
license than he or she would have had to issuance of a new license following
the normal procedure without the interim license.
   (C)   After investigation and hearing, the Council shall, at its discretion,
grant or deny the application. Each application shall require a four-fifths
affirmative vote by the City Council for approval.
   (D)   (1)   Each license shall be issued only to the applicant and for the
premises described in the application.
      (2)   No license may be transferred to another person or place without
application to the Council in the same manner as an application for a new
license. Transfer of 25% or more of the stock of a corporation or of a
controlling interest thereof, whichever is less, shall be deemed a transfer of
the license of a corporate licensee. If the licensee is a corporation which is
wholly owned by another corporation, the same provisions about the transfer of
the stock or a controlling interest shall apply to that parent corporation, any
second parent corporation which wholly owns the parent corporation, and all
other similarly situated parent corporations up through the chain of ownership.
Transfer of this amount of stock without prior Council approval is a ground for
revocation or suspension of the license.
      (3)   In addition, each day the licensee operates under the license after
a transfer has taken place without obtaining Council approval shall be a
separate violation of this chapter.
   (E)   (1)   Any application for a new license may be considered by the City
Council at the same time an applicant is requesting any land use approvals
needed for the site, including site plan review, rezoning or an amendment to
the Comprehensive Guide Plan.
      (2)   Final approval of a license shall not be granted until the City
Council has given at least preliminary approval to any necessary land use
request.
      (3)   If an application is granted for a location where a building is
under construction or not ready for occupancy, the license shall not be
delivered to the licensee until a certificate of occupancy has been issued for
the licensed premises.
   (F)   In the case of the death of a licensee, the personal representative of
a licensee may continue operation of the business for not more than 90 days
after the licensee’s death.
(Prior Code, § 112.20) (Ord. 583, passed 11-6-1996)
§ 112.21 LICENSE SUSPENSION AND REVOCATION.
   (A)   Generally.
      (1)   The Council may either suspend for up to 60 days or revoke any
license or impose a civil fine not to exceed $2,000 for each violation upon a
finding that the licensee or an agent or employee of the licensee has failed to
comply with any applicable statute, regulation, code provision or ordinance
relating to this chapter. No suspension or revocation shall take effect until
the licensee has been afforded an opportunity for a hearing pursuant to M.S. §§
14.57 through 14.69, as they may be amended from time to time, with the
exception of the suspension provided for in division (A)(2) below.
      (2)   Any conviction by the licensee for theft, burglary, robbery,
receiving stolen property or any other crime or violation involving stolen
property shall result in the immediate suspension pending a hearing on
revocation of any license issued hereunder.
   (B)   Delinquent taxes.
      (1)   The City Council may suspend or revoke a license issued under this
chapter for operation on any premises on which real estate taxes, assessments
or other financial claims of the city or of the state are due, delinquent or
unpaid.
      (2)   If an action has been commenced pursuant to the provisions of M.S.
Ch. 278, as it may be amended from time to time, questioning the amount or
validity of taxes, the Council may on application by the licensee waive strict
compliance with this provision; no waiver may be granted, however, for taxes,
or any portion thereof, which remain unpaid for a period exceeding one year
after becoming due unless such one year period is extended through no fault of
the licensee.

§ 114.01 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   Studies conducted by the Minnesota Attorney General, the American
Planning Association and cities such as St. Paul, Minnesota, Indianapolis,
Indiana, Alexandria, Minnesota, Rochester, Minnesota, Phoenix, Arizona, Los
Angeles, California, and Seattle, Washington, have studied the impacts that
adult establishments have in those communities. These studies have concluded
that adult establishments have adverse impact on the surrounding neighborhoods.
Those impacts include increased crime rates, lower property values, increased
transiency, neighborhood blight and potential health risks.
   (B)   Based on these studies and findings, the City Council concludes the
following.
      (1)   Adult establishments have adverse secondary impacts of the types
set forth above.
      (2)   The adverse impacts caused by adult establishments tend to diminish
if adult establishments are governed by zoning requirements, licensing
requirements and health requirements.
      (3)   It is not the intent to prohibit adult establishments from having a
reasonable opportunity to locate in the city.
      (4)   The provisions of M.S. § 462.357, as it may be amended from time to

safety, morals and general welfare.
      (5)   The public health, safety, morals and general welfare will be
promoted by the city adopting regulations governing adult establishments.

   (A)   Purposes and findings.
      (1)   The City Council finds and determines that there has been an
increase in juvenile violence and crime by juveniles in the city.
      (2)   Juveniles are particularly susceptible by their lack of maturity
and experience to participate in unlawful activities, including gang-related
activity, and to be victims of older perpetrators of crime.

presently exist within the city that require special regulation of juveniles
within the city in order to protect them and other persons during the nighttime
hours, to aid in crime prevention, to promote parental supervision and
authority over minors and to decrease juvenile crime rates.
      (4)   In accordance with prevailing community standards, this section
serves to regulate the conduct of minors in public places during nighttime
hours, to be effectively and consistently enforced for the protection of
juveniles from each other and from other persons, in public places during
nighttime hours, for the enforcement of parental control of, authority over and
responsibility for their children, for the protection of the general public
from nighttime mischief by juveniles, for the reduction in the incidents of
juvenile criminal activities, for the furtherance of family responsibility and
for the public good, safety and welfare.
      (5)   It is the intent of the City Council to review and evaluate the
need and effect of nighttime curfew for juveniles set forth in this section on
the incidents of juvenile criminal activity and protection of juveniles against
criminal activity.

LOTS.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to regulate the placement and/
or construction of structures on non-conforming lots so as to maintain the
architectural integrity of the city and its neighborhoods, as well as to ensure
that public safety personnel can easily locate building entrances in emergency
situations.
   (B)   Definition. For purposes of this section, NON-CONFORMING means that
the lot does not meet either the total square footage or the required lot width
per Ch. 155 of this code of ordinances.
   (C)   Procedure. The following procedure shall be followed when placing and/
or constructing a structure on a non-conforming lot.
      (1)   The city’s Building Official will notify the City Planner or, in
the absence of the City Planner, the City Clerk-Administrator, that there is a
building permit application on a non-conforming lot.
      (2)   The City Planner will review the site plan for conformance with the
city’s setback requirements.
      (3)   All building plans must maintain the architectural integrity of the
neighborhood by mandating that the part of the structure facing the street must

door and window(s) must face the street from which the parcel’s address is
derived.
      (4)   The city’s Building Official will not issue a building permit
unless the plan meets the aforementioned provisions.
   (D)   Relief. Relief from the structural requirements of this section may be
met by applying for a non-conforming structure permit. The fee for processing
the permit shall be equal to the fee set by the City Council for a variance

within 350 feet of the outside dimensions of the lot. The hearing will be
before the City Council, with four-fifths of all Council members, whether

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.001 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The legislature of the State of Minnesota has, in M.S. Chs. 103F and 462, as
they may be amended from time to time, delegated the responsibility to local
government units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses.
Therefore, the City Council does ordain the following chapter.
(Ord. 3-2012, passed 3-6-2012)
§ 152.002 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   Flood hazard areas. The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to
periodic inundation which results in potential loss of life, loss of property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures or flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   Methods used to analyze flood hazards. This chapter is based upon a
reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which is consistent with the
standards established by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.
   (C)   National Flood Insurance Program compliance. This chapter is adopted
to comply with the rules and regulations of the National Flood Insurance
Program codified as 44 C.F.R. Parts 59 through 78, as amended, so as to
maintain the community’s eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program.
(Ord. 3-2012, passed 3-6-2012)
§ 152.003 PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize those losses described in §
152.002(A) by provisions contained in this chapter.
(Ord. 3-2012, passed 3-6-2012)
§ 152.004 LANDS TO WHICH CHAPTER APPLIES.
   This chapter shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city
shown on the official zoning map and/or the attachments thereto as being
located within the boundaries of the General Floodplain District.
(Ord. 3-2012, passed 3-6-2012)
§ 152.005 ESTABLISHMENT OF OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.
   The official zoning map together with all materials attached thereto is
hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. The
attached material shall include the Flood Insurance Study, Pine County,
Minnesota and incorporated areas and Flood Insurance Rate Map panels therein
numbered 27115C0564C, 27115C0568C, 27115C0570C and 27115C0775C, all dated April
3, 2012 and prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The official
zoning map shall be on file in the office of the City Clerk and the Zoning
Administrator.
(Ord. 3-2012, passed 3-6-2012)
§ 152.006 REGULATORY FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION.
   The regulatory flood protection elevation shall be an elevation no lower
than one foot above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in
flood elevation caused by encroachments on the floodplain that result from
designation of a floodway.
(Ord. 3-2012, passed 3-6-2012)
§ 152.007 INTERPRETATION.
   (A)   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this
chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation
or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes.
   (B)   The boundaries of the zoning districts shall be determined by scaling
distances on the official zoning map. Where interpretation is needed as to the
exact location of the boundaries of the district as shown on the official
zoning map, as for example where there appears to be a conflict between a
mapped boundary and actual field conditions and there is a formal appeal of the
decision of the Zoning Administrator, the Board of Adjustment shall make the
necessary interpretation. All decisions will be based on elevations on the
regional (100-year) flood profile, the ground elevations that existed on the
site at the time the community adopted its initial floodplain ordinance or on
the date of the first National Flood Insurance Program map showing the area
within the 100-year floodplain if earlier, and other available technical data.
Persons contesting the location of the district boundaries shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to present their case to the Board of Adjustment and to
submit technical evidence.
(Ord. 3-2012, passed 3-6-2012)
§ 152.008 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   It is not intended by this chapter to repeal, abrogate, or impair any
existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this
chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall
prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with this chapter are hereby
repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
(Ord. 3-2012, passed 3-6-2012)
§ 152.009 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   This chapter does not imply that areas outside the floodplain district or
land uses permitted within such district will be free from flooding or flood
damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city or any
officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on
this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 3-2012, passed 3-6-2012)
§ 152.010 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions apply unless the
context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning. Unless specifically
defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as
to give them the same meaning as they have in common usage and so as to give
this chapter its most reasonable application.
   ACCESSORY USE OR STRUCTURE. A use or structure on the same lot with, and of
a nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal use or
structure.
   BASEMENT. Any area of a structure, including crawl spaces, having its floor
or base subgrade (below ground level) on all four sides, regardless of the

of a wetland or lake that results in the inundation of normally dry areas.
   FLOOD FREQUENCY. The frequency for which it is expected that a specific
flood stage or discharge may be equaled or exceeded.
   FLOOD FRINGE. That portion of the floodplain outside of the floodway. FLOOD
FRINGE is synonymous with the term “floodway fringe” used in the Flood
Insurance Study, Pine County, Minnesota and incorporated areas.
   FLOODPLAIN. The beds proper and the areas adjoining a wetland, lake or
watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regional flood.

square feet or less when measured at the largest projection, is designed to be
self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and is designed
primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters
for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. For the purposes of this
chapter, the term RECREATIONAL VEHICLE shall be synonymous with the term travel
trailer/travel vehicle.
   REGIONAL FLOOD. A flood which is representative of large floods known to
have occurred generally in the state and reasonably characteristic of what can
be expected to occur on an average frequency in the magnitude of the 100-year

   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Within any consecutive 365-day period, any
reconstruction, rehabilitation (including normal maintenance and repair),
repair after damage, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of
which equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the
“start of construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures which
have incurred SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE, regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include either:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of an historic structure, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an
historic structure. For the purpose of this chapter, historic structure shall
be as defined in 44 C.F.R. Part 59.1.
   VARIANCE. A modification of a specific permitted development standard
required in an official control including this chapter to allow an alternative
development standard not stated as acceptable in the official control, but only
as applied to a particular property for the purpose of alleviating a hardship,
practical difficulty or unique circumstance as defined and elaborated upon in a
community’s respective planning and zoning enabling legislation.

the city.
(Ord. 3-2012, passed 3-6-2012)
§ 152.012 NONCONFORMING USES.
   A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful before
the passage or amendment of this chapter but which is not in conformity with
the provisions of this chapter may be continued subject to the following
conditions. Historic structures, as defined in §
152.010 of this chapter, shall be subject to the provisions of divisions (A)
through (E) of this section.
   (A)   No such use shall be expanded, changed, enlarged or altered in a way
that increases its nonconformity.
   (B)   Any structural alteration to a nonconforming structure or
nonconforming use in the floodway or flood fringe which would result in
increasing the flood damage potential of that structure or use shall be
protected to the regulatory flood protection elevation in accordance with any
of the flood proofing techniques (such as, FP-1 thru FP-4 floodproofing
classifications) allowable in the State Building Code, except as further
restricted in divisions (C) and (F) of this section. A structural addition to a

with the provisions of this chapter. The applicable provisions for establishing
new uses or new structures in §§
152.025 through
152.028 and
152.040 of this chapter will apply depending upon whether the use or structure
is in the floodway or flood fringe portion of the General Floodplain District.
A substantially damaged nonconforming structure shall not be repaired/
reconstructed if said nonconforming structure is located in the floodway.
   (F)   If a substantial improvement occurs, as defined in §
152.010 of this chapter, from any combination of a structural addition to the
outside dimensions of the existing structure or a rehabilitation,
reconstruction, alteration, or other improvement to the inside dimensions of an
existing nonconforming structure, then the structural addition and the existing
nonconforming structure must meet the requirements of §
152.040 of this chapter for new structures, depending upon whether the
structure is in the floodway or flood fringe portion of the General Floodplain
District. A nonconforming structure shall not be substantially improved if said
structure is located in the floodway.

152.005 of this chapter, then this elevation must be used in calculating the
regulatory flood protection elevation. Procedures consistent with Minnesota
Regulations Parts 6120.5000 - 6120.6200 and 44 C.F.R. Part 65 shall be followed
in this expert evaluation. The designated engineer or expert is strongly
encouraged to discuss the proposed technical evaluation methodology with the
respective Department of Natural Resources’ Area Hydrologist prior to
commencing the analysis. The designated engineer or expert shall:
      (1)   Estimate the peak discharge of the regional flood;
      (2)   Calculate the water surface profile of the regional flood based
upon a hydraulic analysis of the stream channel and overbank areas; and
      (3)   Compute the floodway necessary to convey or store the regional
flood without increasing flood stages more than one-half foot. A lesser stage
increase than one-half foot shall be required if, as a result of the additional
stage increase, increased flood damages would result. An equal degree of
encroachment on both sides of the stream within the reach shall be assumed in
computing floodway boundaries.
   (C)   The Zoning Administrator shall present the technical evaluation and
findings of the designated engineer or expert to the governing body. The
governing body must formally accept the technical evaluation and the
recommended floodway and/or flood fringe boundary or deny the permit
application. The governing body, prior to official action, may submit the
application and all supporting data and analyses to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, the Department of Natural Resources or the Planning
Commission for review and comment. Once the floodway and flood fringe
boundaries have been determined, the governing body shall refer the matter back
to the Zoning Administrator who shall process the permit application consistent
with the applicable provisions of §§
152.025 through
152.028 and
152.040 of this chapter.
(Ord. 3-2012, passed 3-6-2012)
§ 152.028 COMPLIANCE.
   No new structure or land shall hereafter be used and no structure shall be
constructed, located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full
compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations
which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter. Within the
floodway and flood fringe portions of the General Floodplain District, all uses
not listed as a permitted use in §
152.026 of this chapter shall be prohibited. In addition, a caution is provided
here that:
   (A)   New manufactured homes, replacement manufactured homes and certain
travel trailers and travel vehicles are subject to the general provisions of
this chapter and specifically §§
152.085 through
152.087 of this chapter.
   (B)   Modifications, additions, structural alterations, normal maintenance
and repair, or repair after damage to existing nonconforming structures and
nonconforming uses of structures or land are regulated by the general
provisions of this chapter and specifically §
152.012.
   (C)   As-built elevations for elevated or flood proofed structures must be
certified by ground surveys and flood proofing techniques must be designed and
certified by a registered professional engineer or architect as specified in
the general provisions of this chapter.

152.999
STANDARDS FOR FLOOD FRINGE
§ 152.040 PERMITTED USES.
   Permitted uses involving structures, fill, obstructions, excavations, or
storage of materials or equipment shall be subject to the following standards:
   (A)   All structures, including accessory structures, additions to existing
structures and manufactured homes, must be elevated on fill so that the lowest
floor including basement floor is at or above the regulatory flood protection
elevation. The finished fill elevation for structures shall be no lower than
one-foot below the regulatory flood protection elevation and the fill shall
extend at such elevation at least 15 feet beyond the outside limits of the
structure erected thereon.
   (B)   The cumulative placement of fill where at any one time in excess of
1,000 cubic yards of fill is located on the parcel shall be allowable only when
said fill is specifically intended to elevate a structure in accordance with
division (A) of this section.
   (C)   The storage of any materials or equipment shall be elevated on fill to
the regulatory flood protection elevation.
   (D)   All new principal structures must have vehicular access at or above an
elevation not more than two feet below the regulatory flood protection
elevation. If a variance to this requirement is granted, the Board of
Adjustment must specify limitations on the period of use or occupancy of the
structure for times of flooding and only after determining that adequate flood
warning time and local flood emergency response procedures exist.
   (E)   Commercial uses - accessory land uses, such as yards, railroad tracks,
and parking lots may be at elevations lower than the regulatory flood
protection elevation. However, a permit for such facilities to be used by the
employees or the general public shall not be granted in the absence of a flood
warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area would be
inundated to a depth and velocity such that when multiplying the depth (in
feet) times the velocity (in feet per second) the product number exceeds four
upon occurrence of the regional flood.
   (F)   Manufacturing and industrial uses - measures shall be taken to
minimize interference with normal plant operations especially along streams
having protracted flood durations. Certain accessory land uses such as yards
and parking lots may be at lower elevations subject to requirements set out in
division (E) of this section. In considering permit applications, due
consideration shall be given to needs of an industry whose business requires
that it be located in floodplain areas.
   (G)   Fill shall be properly compacted and the slopes shall be properly
protected by the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable method.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for
removing the special flood hazard area designation for certain structures
properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation - FEMA’s
requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection
standards for multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should
be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of
special flood hazard area designation will be requested.
   (H)   Foodplain developments shall not adversely affect the hydraulic
capacity of the channel and adjoining floodplain of any tributary watercourse
or drainage system where a floodway or other encroachment limit has not been
specified on the official zoning map.
   (I)   Standards for recreational vehicles are contained in §
152.087 of this chapter.
   (J)   All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system that resists flotation, collapse and lateral
movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use
of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in
addition to applicable state or local anchoring requirements for resisting wind
forces.
(Ord. 3-2012, passed 3-6-2012)
SUBDIVISIONS
§ 152.055 REVIEW CRITERIA.
   No land shall be subdivided which is unsuitable for the reason of flooding,
inadequate drainage, water supply or sewage treatment facilities. All lots
within the General Floodplain District shall be able to contain a building site
outside of the floodway at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation.
All subdivisions shall have water and sewage treatment facilities that comply
with the provisions of this chapter and have road access both to the
subdivision and to the individual building sites no lower than two feet below
the regulatory flood protection elevation. For all subdivisions in the
floodplain, the floodway and flood fringe boundaries, the regulatory flood
protection elevation and the required elevation of all access roads shall be
clearly labeled on all required subdivision drawings and platting documents.

§ 152.056 FLOODWAY/FLOOD FRINGE DETERMINATIONS.
   In the General Floodplain District, applicants shall provide the information
required in §
152.027  of this chapter to determine the 100-year flood elevation, the
floodway and flood fringe boundaries and the regulatory flood protection
elevation for the subdivision site.
(Ord. 3-2012, passed 3-6-2012)
§ 152.057 REMOVAL OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA DESIGNATION.
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for
removing the special flood hazard area designation for certain structures
properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation. FEMA’s
requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection
standards for multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should
be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of
special flood hazard area designation will be requested.

PUBLIC UTILITIES, RAILROADS, ROADS AND BRIDGES
§ 152.070 PUBLIC UTILITIES.
   All public utilities and facilities such as gas, electrical, sewer, and
water supply systems to be located in the floodplain shall be flood proofed in
accordance with the State Building Code or elevated to above the regulatory
flood protection elevation.
(Ord. 3-2012, passed 3-6-2012)
§ 152.071 PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES.
   Railroad tracks, roads and bridges to be located within the General
Floodplain District shall be permissible if placed in accordance with Minnesota
Regulations Parts 6120.5000 - 6120.6200. Elevation to the regulatory flood
protection elevation shall be provided where failure or interruption of these
transportation facilities would result in danger to the public health or safety
or where such facilities are essential to the orderly functioning of the area.
Minor or auxiliary roads or railroads may be constructed at a lower elevation
where failure or interruption of transportation services would not endanger the
public health or safety.
(Ord. 3-2012, passed 3-6-2012)
§ 152.072 ON-SITE SEWAGE TREATMENT AND WATER SUPPLY SYSTEMS.
   Where public utilities are not provided, on-site water supply systems must
be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the
systems; and new or replacement on-site sewage treatment systems must be
designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems
and discharges from the systems into flood waters and they shall not be subject
to impairment or contamination during times of flooding. Any sewage treatment
system designed in accordance with the state’s current statewide standards for
on-site sewage treatment systems shall be determined to be in compliance with
this subchapter.

(Ord. 3-2012, passed 3-6-2012)
§ 152.086 PLACEMENT OF MANUFACTURED HOME PARKS.
   (A)   The placement of new or replacement manufactured homes in existing
manufactured home parks or on individual lots of record that are located in
floodplain districts will be treated as a new structure and may be placed only
if elevated in compliance with §
152.040 of this chapter. If vehicular road access for preexisting manufactured
home parks is not provided in accordance with §
152.040(D) of this chapter, then replacement manufactured homes will not be
allowed until the property owner(s) develops a flood warning emergency plan
acceptable to the governing body.
   (B)   All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system that resists flotation, collapse and lateral
movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use
of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in
addition to applicable state or local anchoring requirements for resisting wind
forces.

      (3)   The recreational vehicle and associated use must be permissible in
any pre-existing, underlying zoning use district.
   (B)   Areas exempted for placement of recreational vehicles:
      (1)   Individual lots or parcels of record;
      (2)   Existing commercial recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds; and
      (3)   Existing condominium type associations.
   (C)   Recreational vehicles exempted in division (A) of this section lose
this exemption when development occurs on the parcel exceeding $500 for a
structural addition to the recreational vehicle or exceeding $500 for an
accessory structure, such as a garage or storage building. The recreational
vehicle and all additions and accessory structures will then be treated as a
new structure and shall be subject to the elevation requirements and the use of
land restrictions specified in §§
152.025 through
152.028 and
152.040 of this chapter. There shall be no development or improvement on the
parcel or attachment to the recreational vehicle that hinders the removal of
the recreational vehicle to a flood free location should flooding occur.
   (D)   New commercial recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds and new
residential type subdivisions and condominium associations and the expansion of
any existing similar use exceeding five units or dwelling sites shall be

(Ord. 3-2012, passed 3-6-2012)
§ 152.101 PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Permit required. A permit issued by the Zoning Administrator in
conformity with the provisions of this chapter shall be secured prior to the
erection, addition, modification, rehabilitation (including normal maintenance
and repair), or alteration of any building, structure, or portion thereof;
prior to the use or change of use of a building, structure, or land prior to
the construction of a dam, fence, or on-site septic system; prior to the change
or extension of a nonconforming use; prior to the repair of a structure that
has been damaged by flood, fire, tornado, or any other source; and prior to the
placement of fill, excavation of materials, or the storage of materials or
equipment within the floodplain.
   (B)   Application for permit. Application for a permit shall be made in
duplicate to the Zoning Administrator on forms furnished by the Zoning
Administrator and shall include the following where applicable: plans in
duplicate drawn to scale, showing the nature, location, dimensions, and
elevations of the lot; existing or proposed structures, fill, or storage of
materials; and the location of the foregoing in relation to the stream channel.
   (C)   State and federal permits. Prior to granting a permit or processing an
application for a conditional use permit or variance, the Zoning Administrator
shall determine that the applicant has obtained all necessary state and federal
permits.
   (D)   Certificate of zoning compliance for a new, altered or nonconforming
use. It shall be unlawful to use, occupy, or permit the use or occupancy of any
building or premises or part thereof hereafter created, erected, changed,
converted, altered, or enlarged in its use or structure until a certificate of
zoning compliance shall have been issued by the Zoning Administrator stating
that the use of the building or land conforms to the requirements of this
chapter.
   (E)   Construction and use to be as provided on applications, plans,
permits, variances and certificates of zoning compliance. Permits or
certificates of zoning compliance issued on the basis of approved plans and
applications authorize only the use, arrangement, and construction set forth in
such approved plans and applications, and no other use, arrangement, or
construction. Any use, arrangement, or construction at variance with that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of this chapter, and punishable as
provided by §
152.999 of this chapter.
   (F)   Certification. The applicant shall be required to submit certification
by a registered professional engineer, registered architect, or registered land
surveyor that the finished fill and building elevations were accomplished in
compliance with the provisions of this chapter. Flood proofing measures shall
be certified by a registered professional engineer or registered architect.
   (G)   Record of first floor elevation. The Zoning Administrator shall

law.
   (B)   Administrative review. The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide
appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision,
or determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement or
administration of this chapter.
   (C)   Variances. The Board of Adjustment may authorize upon appeal in
specific cases such relief or variance from the terms of this chapter as will
not be contrary to the public interest and only for those circumstances such as
hardship, practical difficulties or circumstances unique to the property under
consideration, as provided for in the respective enabling legislation for
planning and zoning for cities or counties as appropriate. In the granting of
such variance, the Board of Adjustment shall clearly identify in writing the
specific conditions that existed consistent with the criteria specified in this
chapter, any other zoning regulations in the community, and in the respective
enabling legislation that justified the granting of the variance. No variance
shall have the effect of allowing in any district uses prohibited in that
district, permit a lower degree of flood protection than the regulatory flood
protection elevation for the particular area, or permit standards lower than
those required by state law. The following additional variance criteria of the
Federal Emergency Management Agency must be satisfied:
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued by a community within any designated
regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood
discharge would result.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued by a community upon a showing of
good and sufficient cause, a determination that failure to grant the variance
would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and a determination that
the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with
existing local laws or ordinances.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
   (D)   Hearings. Upon filing with the Board of Adjustment of an appeal from a
decision of the Zoning Administrator, or an application for a variance, the
Board of Adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for a hearing and give due
notice to the parties in interest as specified by law. The Board of Adjustment
shall submit by mail to the Commissioner of Natural Resources a copy of the
application for proposed variances sufficiently in advance so that the
Commissioner will receive at least ten days notice of the hearing.
   (E)   Decisions. The Board of Adjustment shall arrive at a decision on such
appeal or variance within 60 days. In passing upon an appeal, the Board of
Adjustment may, so long as such action is in conformity with the provisions of
this chapter, reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or modify the order,
requirement, decision or determination of the Zoning Administrator or other
public official. It shall make its decision in writing setting forth the
findings of fact and the reasons for its decisions. In granting a variance, the
Board of Adjustment may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards which
are in conformity with the purposes of this chapter. Violations of such
conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the
variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this chapter punishable
under §
152.999 of this chapter. A copy of all decisions granting variances shall be
forwarded by mail to the Commissioner of Natural Resources within ten days of
such action.
   (F)   Appeals. Appeals from any decision of the Board of Adjustment may be
made, and as specified in this community’s official controls and also by
Minnesota Statutes.
   (G)   Flood insurance notice and record keeping. The Zoning Administrator
shall notify the applicant for a variance that the issuance of a variance to
construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased
premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of
insurance coverage and such construction below the 100-year or regional flood
level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be
maintained with a record of all variance actions. A community shall maintain a
record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and
report such variances issued in its annual or biennial report submitted to the
Administrator of the National Flood Insurance Program.

§ 152.999 PENALTY.
   (A)   Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with
any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards
established in connection with grants of variances or conditional uses) shall
constitute a misdemeanor and shall be punishable as defined by law.
   (B)   Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the city from taking such other
lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. Such actions
may include but are not limited to:
      (1)   In responding to a suspected ordinance violation, the Zoning
Administrator and local government may utilize the full array of enforcement
actions available to it, including but not limited to, prosecution and fines,
injunctions, after-the-fact permits, orders for corrective measures or a
request to the National Flood Insurance Program for denial of flood insurance
availability to the guilty party. The community must act in good faith to
enforce these official controls and to correct ordinance violations to the
extent possible so as not to jeopardize its eligibility in the National Flood
Insurance Program.
      (2)   When an ordinance violation is either discovered by or brought to
the attention of the Zoning Administrator, the Zoning Administrator shall
immediately investigate the situation and document the nature and extent of the
violation of the official control. As soon as is reasonably possible, this
information will be submitted to the appropriate Department of Natural
Resources’ and Federal Emergency Management Agency Regional Office along with
the community’s plan of action to correct the violation to the degree possible.
      (3)   The Zoning Administrator shall notify the suspected party of the
requirements of this chapter and all other official controls and the nature and
extent of the suspected violation of these controls. If the structure and/or
use is under construction or development, the Zoning Administrator may order
the construction or development immediately halted until a proper permit or
approval is granted by the community. If the construction or development is
already completed, then the Zoning Administrator may either:
         (a)   Issue an order identifying the corrective actions that must be
made within a specified time period to bring the use or structure into
compliance with the official controls; or
         (b)   Notify the responsible party to apply for an after-the-fact
permit/development approval within a specified period of time not to exceed 30
days.
      (4)   If the responsible party does not appropriately respond to the
Zoning Administrator within the specified period of time, each additional day
that lapses shall constitute an additional violation of this chapter and shall
be prosecuted accordingly. The Zoning Administrator shall also upon the lapse
of the specified response period notify the landowner to restore the land to
the condition which existed prior to the violation of this chapter.

§ 153.01 FINDINGS, PURPOSE AND EFFECT.
   (A)   Findings. The City Council hereby finds as follows.
      (1)   Exterior signs have a substantial impact on the character and
quality of the environment.
      (2)   Signs provide an important medium through which individuals may
convey a variety of messages.
      (3)   Signs can create traffic hazards, aesthetic concerns and detriments
to property values, thereby threatening the public health, safety and welfare.
      (4)   The city’s zoning regulations have, since as early as 1966,
included the regulation of signs, in an effort to provide adequate means of
expression and to promote the economic viability of the business community,
while protecting the city and its citizens from a proliferation of signs of a
type,
size, location and character that would adversely impact upon the aesthetics of
the community, and threaten the health, safety and welfare of the community.
The regulation of the physical characteristics of signs within the city has had
a positive impact on traffic safety and the appearance of the community.
   (B)   Purpose and intent.
      (1)   It is not the purpose or intent of this chapter to regulate the
message displayed on any sign; nor is it the purpose or intent of this chapter
to regulate any building design or any display not defined as a sign, or any
sign that cannot be viewed from outside a building.
      (2)   The purpose and intent of this chapter is to:
         (a)   Regulate the number, location, size, type, illumination and
other physical characteristics of signs within the city, in order to promote
the public health, safety and welfare;
         (b)   Maintain, enhance and improve the aesthetic environment of the
city by preventing visual clutter that is harmful to the appearance of the
community;
         (c)   Improve the visual appearance of the city, while providing for
effective means of communication, consistent with constitutional guarantees and
the city’s goals of public safety and aesthetics; and
         (d)   Provide for fair and consistent enforcement of the sign
regulations set for herein under the zoning authority of the city.
   (C)   Effect. A sign may be erected, mounted, displayed or maintained in the
city if it is in conformance with the provisions of these regulations. The
effect of this chapter, as more specifically set forth herein, is to:
      (1)   Allow a wide variety of sign types in commercial zones, and a more
limited variety of signs in other zones, subject to the standards set forth in
this chapter;
      (2)   Allow certain small, unobtrusive signs, incidental to the principal
use of a site, in all zones when in compliance with the requirements of this
chapter;
      (3)   Prohibit signs whose location, size, type, illumination or other
physical characteristics negatively affect the environment, and where the
communication can be accomplished by means having a lesser impact on the
environment and the public health, safety and welfare; and
      (4)   Provide for the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter.

in order to protect the public health, safety, convenience and welfare, or to

§ 153.08 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Conditions of variances.
      (1)   A VARIANCE is a modification of the literal provisions of this
chapter, granted when strict enforcement of such provisions would cause undue
hardship or practical difficulties to the property owner in the use of his or
her land.
      (2)   The crucial points of a variance are:
         (a)   Undue hardship;
         (b)   Unique circumstances; and
         (c)   Applying to property.
      (3)   The hardship must not have been created by actions of the
landowner.
      (4)   The variance will not alter the essential character of the area,
and should be in conformance with the city growth management system. Granting
of the variance shall not allow any use that is neither a permitted or
conditional use within the zoning district on which the subject property is
located.
      (5)   The plight of the landowner must be due to unique circumstances. If
the hardship is common to several properties, the variance must not be granted.
      (6)   The proof that a landowner could realize a higher financial return
for his or her land as a result of the variance is not sufficient grounds for
granting a variance. Economic considerations alone shall not constitute a
hardship if a reasonable use for the property exists under the terms of the
ordinance.
   (B)   Request for variance; fee. A person desiring to secure a variance, or
to appeal the interpretation and application of any provisions of this chapter
by the Zoning Administrator or Building Official, shall fill out and submit to
the Zoning Administrator or City Clerk a variance form, together with the
required filing fee as set by the City Council.
(Prior Code, § 153.08) (Ord. 630, passed 12-7-2004; Ord. 8-2007, passed 7-3-
2007)
§ 153.09 NON-COMMERCIAL SPEECH.
   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, all signs of any size
containing non- commercial speech may be posted from August 1 in any general
election year until ten days following the general election, and 13 weeks prior
to any special election until ten days following the special election. (This
does not mean that the stated times are the only times that non-commercial
signs or political signs may be posted.)
(Prior Code, § 153.09) Ord. 8-2007, passed 7-3-2007)
§ 153.10 SUBSTITUTION CLAUSE.
   (A)   (1)   The owner of any sign otherwise allowed by this chapter may
substitute non- commercial copy in lieu of any other commercial or non-
commercial copy.
      (2)   This substitution of copy may be made without any additional
approval or permitting.
   (B)   The purpose of this section is to prevent the inadvertent favoring of
commercial speech over non-commercial speech or favoring of any particular non-
commercial message over any other non-commercial message.
   (C)   This section prevails over any more specific provision to the
contrary.
(Prior Code, § 153.10) (Ord. 8-2007, passed 7-3-2007)
§ 153.99 PENALTY.
   Any person or business or corporation who violates any provision of this
chapter is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be
punished as provided in §
10.99 of this code of ordinances. Each day the violation is permitted to exist
constitutes a separate offense.

154.09 of this chapter will create an unnecessary hardship and failure to
comply does not interfere with the intent of this chapter; provided that, such
conveyance does not necessitate the dedication of a public right-of-way and the
newly created parcel will not cause the other remaining portion of the property
to be in violation of this chapter or Ch. 155 of this code of ordinances.
      (2)   Where written justification is submitted by an applicant which
clearly indicates that the intent of this chapter can be satisfied without
enforcing all of the procedural requirements of this chapter.

require that the lots in the subdivision be in accordance with the minimum lot
area and lot width requirements of Ch. 155 of this chapter; and that the
subdivider convey two or more lots for the purpose of transfer of ownership or
building development of sufficient size to safely accommodate a private well
and/or disposal system in accordance with applicable state law and regulations

and the newly-created property lines will not cause any resulting lot to be in
violation of these regulations or
Ch. 155 of this chapter, the division may be approved by the governing body,
after submission of a survey by a registered land surveyor showing the original
lot and the proposed subdivision. There shall be only one minor subdivision

(Prior Code, § 154.32) (Ord. passed 6-6-1978)
§ 154.48 PUBLIC USE DEDICATION OR CONTRIBUTION.
   (A)   Generally.
      (1)   Authority. Pursuant to M.S. § 462.358, as it may be amended from
time to time, the City Council may require subdividers requesting platting or
replotting of land or a planned unit development within the jurisdictional
boundaries of this chapter to contribute a percent of the final gross area of
the subdivision to be dedicated to the public for public uses as parks,
playgrounds, public open space or storm water holding areas or ponds; or that
the subdivider contribute an equivalent amount in cash based upon the fair
market value of the undeveloped land as determined by the County Assessor at
the time of final plat approval; or any combination thereof. The form of
contribution (cash, land or any combination) shall be determined based upon the
following conditions outlined below. The determination of such contribution
shall be made during the subdivision review process.
      (2)   Residential subdivisions. In residential subdivisions, the
subdivider shall dedicate 10% of the undeveloped land proposed to be subdivided
for purposes outlined in division (A)(1) above, or an equivalent amount in
cash, or any combination thereof. The contribution shall be based upon a
finding of fact as outlined in division (A)(4) below.
      (3)   Commercial, industrial or other non- residential subdivisions. In
non-residential subdivisions, the city may decide not to require the subdivider
to contribute land, cash or any combination thereof. In those instances,
however, where the city deems it in the public interest to require a
contribution, the subdivider shall dedicate a percent of the undeveloped land
proposed to be subdivided for purposes outlined in division (A)(1) above, or an
equivalent amount in cash, or any combination thereof. The contribution shall
be based upon a finding of fact as outlined in division (A)(4) below.
      (4)   Conditions for contribution. It shall be deemed to be in the public
interest to require land dedication, cash contribution or any combination
thereof when the City Council, after review and recommendation, makes one or
more of the following findings of fact:
         (a)   All or part of the proposed subdivision has been designated as
park, playground, public open space, storm sewer holding areas or ponds on an
adopted city plan;
         (b)   Such contribution is necessary in order to protect adjacent land
uses from potential conflicting land uses which could exist on the land to be
subdivided;
         (c)   The increased number of residents to reside or be employed
within the subdivision will increase the recreational demands upon the city;
         (d)   Such contribution is necessary to provide proper surface water
runoff generated by the uses proposed within the subdivision;
         (e)   The land proposed to be subdivided contains or borders upon
existing unique topographical features including, but not limited to, ponds,
lakes, streams, timber stands, water holding areas, hills, steep slopes,
drainage areas or bluffs which should be preserved to prevent foreseeable
safety, pollution or erosion hazards or to provide unique recreational and
aesthetic qualities and enjoyment to the city; and
         (f)   Such contribution is necessary to comply with or fulfill the
goals, policies and programs of the city.
   (B)   Exception for outlots. In subdivisions which include outlots, the
subdivider may contribute land, cash or any combination thereof as provided in
division (A) above for the entire subdivision, including the land within the
outlots, or for only that land exclusive of the outlots. When such outlots are
subdivided, the contribution requirements shall be met in accordance with then
existing regulations as applicable, unless such contributions have been
previously met.
   (C)   Special fund. All monies collected from cash contributions shall be
placed in a special fund from which only those public uses outlined in division
(A)(1) above may be realized.
   (D)   Delayed contribution. Upon petition by the subdivider, the City
Council may approve a delay in the actual contribution of the cash required in
lieu of land until such time as development occurs on the property being
subdivided provided that a proper legal agreement is executed guaranteeing such
contribution. The subdivider is responsible for all costs in the preparing of
the agreement. Delayed contribution payment shall include 8% interest per year.
   (E)   Land dedication. In such cases where the subdivider is required to
dedicate land area, the City Council shall have the right to determine the
geographical location and configuration of the dedication.
(Prior Code, § 154.33) (Ord. passed 6-6-1978)
§ 154.49 REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Generally. The following improvements shall be complied with and
provided in accordance with city standards and approval and as provided within
the plat agreement as indicated in division (C) below.
   (B)   Improvements. All improvements identified below and as included within
the subdivision agreement shall be installed at the expense of the subdivider
according to standards and specifications approved by the City Council.
      (1)   The full width of all street rights-of-way and utility easements as
approved on the final plat will be finished at rough grade, that is, no more
than six inches from the finished grade.
      (2)   Sanitary sewer, water and drainage facilities, and electric
telephone and gas service lines shall be installed as required by the
subdivision agreement. When extension of trunk lines to the site are necessary,
it is the option of the city to participate in the financing of such
improvements. Where city water and sewer facilities are not available for
extension into the subdivision, the City Council may permit the use of
individual water and sewer systems in accordance with appropriate state and
city laws, ordinances and regulations.
      (3)   Where necessary, all streets shall be curbed, guttered and paved as
required by the subdivision agreement. The city may delay street paving if city
water, sewer or storm sewer facilities are not available but are anticipated in
the foreseeable future. If street paving is not required, all street rights-of-
way shall be finished at final grade.
      (4)   Where feasible, all utility service lines shall be placed
underground within easements or dedicated rights-of-way. All drainage and other
utility installations which traverse privately owned property shall be
protected by proper easements and/or legal agreements.
   (C)   Subdivision agreement. Prior to the approval of the final plat by the
City Council, the owner or subdivider of the land covered by the plat shall
execute and submit to the City Council an agreement, binding on his, her or
their heirs, personal representatives and assigns, including:
      (1)   A provision that no private construction will be made on the plat
or no building permit shall be filed for such construction until all
improvements required under this chapter have been completed in a manner
approved by the City Council;
      (2)   A listing or schedule of when and what improvements shall be
required as recommended by the Planning Commission and approved by the City
Council;
      (3)   A certification by the City Clerk- Administrator or the City
Engineer that the improvements, agreements, and documents meet the minimum
requirements of all applicable ordinances; and

provide public financing to projects which are determined to serve a public
benefit to the city.
      (1)   Residential developments.
         (a)   The total cost of improvements shall be assessed in equal annual
installments over a period not to exceed ten years. After the balance of
principal of assessments is equal to or less than the amount of the security
agreement, the security agreement can be reduced as assessments are paid
thereafter at the rate or $1 for each $1 paid.
         (b)   In addition, the city may reduce the amount of the security
agreement against each lot upon which a building has been constructed, the lot
sold, and the outstanding assessments against the lot assumed by the buyer;
provided, however, that, no principal of assessments together with penalties
and interest is equal to or less than the amount of the security agreement.
      (2)   Non-residential developments.
         (a)   The total cost of the improvements shall be assessed in equal
annual installments over a period not to exceed ten years. After the balance of
principal of assessments is equal to or less than the amount of the security
agreement, the security agreement can be reduced as assessments are paid at the
rate of $1 for each $1 paid. In addition, the city may reduce the amount of the
security agreement by 100% of the unpaid principal of assessments against each
lot upon which a building has been constructed and a certificate of occupancy
issued; provided that, no reduction shall be granted until such time as the
outstanding principal of assessments together with penalties and interest is
equal to or less than the amount of the security agreement.
         (b)   In the event the subdivider fails to pay any installment of
special assessments, the city, at its option, in addition to its rights and
remedies hereunder, may declare all of the unpaid special assessments levied
pursuant to this agreement due and payable in full immediately and may commence
legal action against the subdivider to collect the entire unpaid balance,
including reasonable attorney’s fees. The subdivider shall be personally liable
for such special assessments.

      (1)   Request for amendments or variances, as provided within this
chapter, shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator on an official
application form. The application shall be accompanied by complementary copies
of detailed written and graphic materials fully explaining the proposed change,
development or use. The Zoning Administrator shall refer the application, along
with all related information, to the Planning Commission for consideration and
report at a reasonable time before the next regular meeting.
      (2)   The city’s Clerk-Administrator, on behalf of the Planning
Commission, shall set a date for a public hearing. Notice of such hearing shall
be published in the official newspaper of the city at least ten days prior to
the date of the hearing. In the requests for variances, such notice shall also
be mailed not less than ten days to all property owners of record within 350
feet of the property to which the request relates, and if the variance relates
to land located in a public water, the notice shall also be mailed to the
Commissioner of the Department of Natural Resources at least ten days prior to
such hearings. A copy of the notice and a list of the property owners and
addresses to which the notice was sent shall be attested to by the city’s
Clerk- Administrator and made a part of the official record. The failure to
give mailed notice to individual property owners or defects in the notice shall
not invalidate the proceedings; provided, a bona fide attempt to comply with
the requirements has been made.
      (3)   The Planning Commission shall consider the request and hold a
public hearing at its next regular meeting. The Zoning Administrator shall
refer the application, along with all related information, to the Planning
Commission for consideration. The applicant or a representative thereof shall
appear before the Planning Commission in order to answer questions concerning
the proposed variance or appeal.
      (4)   The Planning Commission and city staff shall have the authority to
request additional information from the applicant concerning operational
factors or to retain expert testimony with the consent and at the expense of
the applicant concerning operational factors, such information to be declared
necessary to establish performance conditions in relation to all pertinent
sections of this chapter.
      (5)   In requests for variances, the Planning Commission may recommend a
variance from the provisions of this chapter when, in its opinion, undue
hardship may result from strict compliance. In recommending any variance, the
Planning Commission shall prescribe only conditions that it deems necessary to
or desirable for the public interest. In making its recommendations, the
Planning Commission shall take into account the nature of the proposed use of
land and the existing use of land in the vicinity, the number of persons to
reside or work in the proposed subdivision and traffic conditions in the
vicinity. A variance shall only be recommended when the Planning Commission
finds:
         (a)   There are special circumstances or conditions affecting the
properties such that the strict application of the provisions of this chapter
would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of his or her land;
         (b)   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the
public welfare or injurious to other property in the territory in which the
property is situated; and/or
         (c)   The variance is to correct inequities resulting from an extreme
physical hardship such as topography, soils, wetlands and the like.
      (6)   Within 60 days from the date of the public hearing, the Planning
Commission shall make a recommendation, and in requests for variances shall
also make a finding of fact to the City Council. In the case that additional
information is requested pursuant to division (A)(4) of this section, the 60-
day period begins upon receipt of the information by the city.
      (7)    Upon receiving the recommendations of the Planning Commission, or
until 60 days after the public hearing at which the request was considered, the
City Council shall place the report and recommendation on the agenda for the
next regular meeting. Such reports and recommendations shall be entered in and
made part of the permanent written record of the City Council meeting.
      (8)   Upon receiving the recommendation of the Planning Commission, the
City Council shall either:
         (a)   Approve or disapprove the request as recommended by the Planning
Commission;
         (b)   Approve or disapprove the recommendation of the Planning
Commission with modifications, alterations or differing conditions. The
modifications, alterations or differing conditions shall be in writing and made
part of the Council’s records; or
         (c)   Refer the recommendations back to the Planning Commission with
future consideration. This procedure shall be followed only one time on a
singular action.
      (9)   Approval of a request shall require passage by majority vote of the
City Council present. The Zoning Administrator shall notify the applicant, in
writing, of the Council’s action. The variance decisions of the City Council
shall be final, subject to judicial review.
   (B)   Lapse of variance. Whenever within one year after granting a variance
the work as permitted by the variance shall not have been completed, then the
variance shall become null and void unless a petition for extension of time in
which to complete the terms has been granted by the City Council. The extension
shall be requested in writing and filed with the Zoning Administrator at least
30 days before the expiration of the original variance. There shall be no
charge for the filling of such petition. The request for extension shall state
facts showing a good faith attempt to complete the work permitted by the
variance. Such petition shall be presented to the City Council for a decision,
and shall be made only one time for a singular action.

of stalls required shall be the sum total of the individual requirements;
provided that, where it is found by the Planning Commission, upon application
thereto, that the parking demand generated by the different uses included in
any joint arrangement to provide parking stalls required herein occurs at
distinctly different times, as in the case of a store generating demand for
parking during its daytime business hours and thereafter generating peak demand
for parking after such daytime hours and, in similar cases, the agency may
recommend to reduce the total number of parking stalls to be jointly provided.

PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS
§ 155.045 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of the Planned Unit Development District (PUD) is
to provide for the integration and coordination of land parcels as well as the
combination of land parcels as well as the combination of varying types of
residential, commercial and industrial uses.
   (B)   Application. All permitted, permitted accessory or conditional uses
contained in other zoning districts of this chapter shall be treated as
permitted uses to eliminate the overlapping procedural requirements of
individual conditional use provisions.
   (C)   Special procedures. The establishment of a Planned Unit Development
District shall be subject to the amendment requirements of §
155.070 of this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 155.50) (Ord. passed 4-1-1997)
§ 155.046 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   The purpose of this subchapter is to provide for the grouping of land
parcels for development as an integrated, coordinated unit as opposed to
traditional parcel by parcel, piecemeal, sporadic and unplanned approach to
development. This subchapter is intended to introduce flexibility of site
design and architecture for the conservation of land and open space through
clustering of buildings and activities through conditional use provisions. It
is further intended that Planned Unit Developments are to be characterized by
central management, integrated planning and architecture, joint or common use
of parking, maintenance of open space and other similar facilities and a
harmonious selection and efficient distribution of uses.
   (B)   Specifically, it is intended to encourage:
      (1)   Innovations in residential development to the end that the demands
for housing of all economic levels may be met by greater variety in tenure,
type, design and siting of dwellings and by the conservation and more efficient
use of land in such developments;
      (2)   Higher standards of site and building design through the use of
trained and experienced engineers, architects, landscape architects and
planners;
      (3)   More convenience in location of accessory commercial and service
area;
      (4)   The preservation and enhancement of desirable site characteristics
such as natural topography and geologic features and the prevention of soil
erosion;
      (5)   A creative use of land and related physical development which
allows a phased and orderly transition of land from rural to urban uses;
      (6)   An efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities
and streets thereby lowering housing costs and public investments;
      (7)   Developments and a development pattern in harmony and consistent
with the objectives of the city’s Comprehensive Plan;
      (8)   A more desirable environment than would be possible through the
strict application of zoning and subdivision regulations of the city; and
      (9)   To allow variation from the provision of this chapter including
setbacks, height, lot area, width and depth, yards and the like, while
continuing to protect the public health, welfare and safety.
(Prior Code, § 155.51) (Ord. passed 4-1-1997)
§ 155.047 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS AND STANDARDS.
   (A)   Ownership. An application for PUD approval must be filed by the
landowner or jointly by all landowners of the property included in a project.
The application and all submissions must be directed to the development of the
property as a unified whole. In the case of multiple ownership, the approval of
the final plat shall be binding on all owners. In absence of an ownership
application, the project developer may submit with the development application
the written consent of all property owners within the proposed PUD. The
financial commitments incurred through any portion of the development shall be
responsibility of the ownership
   (B)   Comprehensive Plan consistency. The proposed PUD shall be generally
consistent with the adopted city Comprehensive Plan.
   (C)   Common open space. Common open space, at least sufficient to meet the
minimum requirements established in this chapter, and such complementary
structures and improvements as are necessary and appropriate for the benefit
and enjoyment of the residents of the PUD, shall be provided within the area of
the PUD.
   (D)   Operating and maintenance requirements for PUD common open space/
facilities. Whenever common open space or service facilities are provided
within the PUD, the PUD plan shall contain provisions to assure the continued
operation and maintenance of such open space and service facilities to a
predetermined reasonable standard. Common open space and service facilities
within a PUD may be placed under the ownership of one or more of the following
or may include a method deemed most appropriate by the City Council:
      (1)   Landlord control, where only use by tenants is anticipated; and
      (2)   Property owners association; provided, all of the following
conditions are met:
         (a)   Prior to the use, occupancy, sale or the execution of contracts
for sale of an individual building unit, parcel, tract, townhouse, apartment or
common area, a declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions or an
equivalent document as specified M.S. Ch. 515B, as it may be amended from time
to time, shall be filed with the City Clerk-Administrator, such filing to be
made prior to the filings of the declaration of documents or floor plans with
the recording officers of the county.
         (b)   The declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions or
equivalent document may specify that deeds, leases or documents of conveyance
affecting buildings, units, parcels, tracts, townhouses or apartments may
subject the properties to the terms of the declaration.
         (c)   The declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions may
provide that an owner’s association or corporation may be formed and if such an
association or corporation is formed property owners may be members of the
association or corporation which shall maintain all properties and common areas
in good repair and which shall assess individual property owners proportionate
shares of joint or common costs. This declaration shall be subject to the
review and approval of the City Attorney. The intent of this requirement is to
protect the property values of the individual owner through establishing
effective private control.
         (d)   The declaration shall additionally, amongst other things,
provide that in the event the association or corporation fails to maintain
properties in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the city
or fails to pay taxes or assessments on properties as they become due and in
the event the city incurs any expenses not immediately reimbursed by the
association or corporation, then the city shall have the right to assess each
property its pro rata share of the expenses. Such assessments, together with
interest thereon and costs of collection, shall be a lien on each property
against which such assessment is made.
         (e)   Membership in the association must be mandatory for each owner,
and any successive buyer.
         (f)   The open space restrictions must be permanent and not for a
given period of years.
         (g)   The association must be responsible for liability insurance,
local taxes and the maintenance of the open space facilities to be deeded to
it.
         (h)   Property owners must pay their pro rata share of the cost of the
association by means of an assessment to be levied by the association which
meets the requirements for becoming a lien on the property in accordance with
state law.
         (i)   The association must be able to adjust the assessment to meet
changed needs.
         (j)   The by-laws and rules of the association and all covenants and
restrictions to be recorded must be approved by the City Council prior to the
approval of the final PUD plan.   
   (E)   Staging of common open space. The con- struction and provision of all
of the common open space and public improvements and recreational facilities
that are shown on the final development plan for a PUD must proceed at the same
rate as the construction of dwelling units or other private facilities.
   (F)   Density. The exact density allowable shall be determined by standards
agreed upon between the applicant and the city staff in accordance with
existing zoning district requirement. An increase/transfer for density shall be
allowed upon proof of the applicant that some of the following conditions
exist:
      (1)   The area where the density is transferred must be within the
project area and owned by the applicant;
      (2)   Density transfer will allow for a greater degree of innovative
design;
      (3)   Density transfer will allow for more efficient use of public
facilities and utilities; and
      (4)   Density transfer will allow for preserva- tion of sensitive
environment areas.
   (G)   Utilities. In any PUD, all permanent utilities, including telephone,
electricity, gas and telecable shall be installed underground.
   (H)   Roadways.
      (1)   Private roadways within the project shall have an improved surface
of 25 feet or more in width and shall be so designated as to permit fire trucks
and emergency medical service vehicles to provide protection to each building.
Parking shall be prohibited within this 25-foot roadway.
      (2)   No portion of the required private road system may be used in
calculating required off-street parking space.
      (3)   The uniqueness of each proposal for a PUD requires that
specifications and standards for streets, utilities and services may be subject
to minor modifications from the specifications and standards established in the
city subdivision ordinance (Ch. 154 of this code of ordinances) governing their
construction. The City Council may therefore waive or modify the specifications
or standards where it is found that they are not required in the interests of
the residents or of the entire city. The plans and profiles of all streets,
utilities and services shall be reviewed, modified if necessary and approved by
the City Engineer and Building Official prior to the final approval of the PUD
plan by the City Council.
   (I)   Landscaping. In any PUD, landscaping shall be provided according to a
plan approved by the City Council, which shall include a detailed planting list
with sizes and species indicated as part of the final plat. In assessing the
landscaping plan, the City Council shall consider the natural features of the
particular site, the architectural characteristics of the proposed structures
and the overall scheme of the PUD plan.
   (J)   Public services. The proposed project shall be served by the city
water and sewer system and fire hydrants shall be installed at such locations
as required by the Fire Marshal to provide fire protection.
   (K)   Building height. Height limitations shall be the same as imposed in
the respective districts.
   (L)   Refuse. Provision for trash pick-up shall be made according to a plan
approved by the Planning Commission and City Council.
   (M)   Site improvement agreement. Prior to the issuance of a building permit
as part of the Planned Unit Development, the permit applicant, builder or
developer shall execute and deliver to the City Council a site improvement
agreement.
   (N)   PUD progress. In the opinion of the city, if development has not
progressed reasonably well according to the approved schedule, the developer
shall be required to submit a statement to the city setting forth reasons for
the lack of progress. The Planning Commission may initiate rezoning to
eliminate the PUD zoning classification if it finds that the development has
not occurred according to the adopted schedule; it shall not be necessary for
the City Council to find that the rezoning to a PUD was in error.
   (O)   Pre-development costs. All pre-development costs will be the
responsibility of the project developer or property owner. The city, according
to the general provisions of this chapter, will require copies of written
notification to all contractors and subcontractors of the project stating such
responsibility prior to approval of PUD.

(Prior Code, § 155.53) (Ord. passed 4-1-1997)
§ 155.049 PROCEDURE FOR PROCESSING.
   (A)   Application conference. Upon filing of an application for PUD, the
applicant of the proposed PUD shall arrange for and attend a conference with
the city staff. At such conference, the applicant shall be prepared to
generally describe their proposal for a PUD. The primary purpose of the
conference shall be to provide the applicant with an opportunity to gather
information and obtain guidance as to the general suitability of the conformity
to the provisions of this code before incurring substantial expense in the
preparation of plans, surveys and other data.
   (B)   General concept plan.
      (1)   Purpose. The general concept plan provides an opportunity for the
applicant to submit a plan to the city showing their basic intent and the
general nature of the entire development without incurring substantial cost.
This concept plan serves as the basis for the informational meeting so that the
proposal may be publicly considered at an early stage. The following elements
of the proposed general concept plan represent the immediately significant
element which the city shall review and for which a decision shall be rendered:
         (a)   Overall maximum PUD density range;
         (b)   General location of major streets and pedestrian walkways;
         (c)   General location and extent of public and common open space;
         (d)   General location of residential and non-residential land uses
with approximate type and intensities of development;
         (e)   Staging and time schedule of development; and
         (f)   Other special criteria for development.
      (2)   Process.
         (a)   Developer attends application conference;
         (b)   File application for a conditional use permit or rezoning
concurrently with the sub- mission of the general concept plan at least 21 days
prior to Planning Commission meeting consisting of the information and
submissions required under the general concept stage;
         (c)   City staff reviews application, prepares report and
recommendations;
         (d)   Planning Commission receives application and report of city
staff;
         (e)   Planning Commission makes a recommendation to the city council
on the general concept plan;
         (f)   City Council holds an informational meeting to inform property
owners within 350 feet of the proposed PUD of the general concept plan; and
         (g)   City Council reviews all recommendations and approves or denies
application on general concept plan.
      (3)   Optional submission of development stage plan. In cases of a single
stage PUD or where the applicant wishes to begin the first stage of a multiple
stage PUD more expeditiously, he or she may, at his or her option, submit
development stage plans for the proposed PUD simultaneously with the submission
of the general concept plan. In such case, the applicant shall comply with all
the provisions of this chapter applicable to submission of the development
stage plan.
      (4)   Limitation of general concept plan approval. Unless a development
stage plan has been filed within nine months from the date City Council grants
general concept plan approval or, in any case, where applicant fails to file
development stage and final plans to proceed with development in accordance
with the provisions of this code and of an approved general concept plan, the
approval may be revoked by City Council action. The City Council, at its
discretion, may extend the filing date for a development stage plan, when for
good cause shown, the extension is deemed appropriate. Approval of the general
concept plan should be limited to the general acceptability of the land uses
proposed and their relationships to the area. The action shall in no way bind
the City Council to subsequent action on more detailed plans.
   (C)   Development stage.
      (1)   Purpose. The purpose of the development stage plan is to provide a
specific and particular plan upon which the Planning Commission will base its
recommendation to the City Council and with which substantial compliance is
necessary for the preparation of the final plan.
      (2)   Submission of development stage plan. Upon approval of the general
concept plan, the applicant shall file with the City Clerk-Administrator a
development stage plan consisting of the information and submissions required
under the development stage for the entire PUD, or for one or more stages
thereof in accordance with a staging plan approved as part of the general
concept plan. The development stage plan shall refine, implement and be in
substantial conformity with the approved general concept plan.
      (3)   Review and action by city staff and Planning Commission. Upon a
receipt of a completed development stage plan, the City Clerk-Administrator
shall refer such plan to the appropriate city staff, Planning Commission and
other review agencies.   
      (4)   Process.
         (a)   Developer makes application for subdivision (first phase of PUD,
development stage plan) at least 21 days prior to Planning Commission meeting.
         (b)   Within 60 days of the submission, or such further time as may be
agreed to by the applicant and city staff, the Planning Commission shall review
the development stage plan and submit a written report and recommendations to
the City Council. If the Planning Commission fails to make a report within 60
days after receipt of the application, then the City Council may proceed
without the report. The report shall contain the findings and recommendations
of the Planning Commission with respect to the conformity of the development
stage plan to the approved general concept plan, with respect to the merit or
lack of merit of any departure of the development stage plan from substantial
conformity with the general concept plan, and with respect to the compliance of
the development stage plan with the provisions of this code and all other
applicable federal, state and local codes and ordinances.
         (c)   Within 30 days of receipt of the report and recommendations of
the Planning Commission, the City Council shall conduct a public hearing on the
plans. Within 60 days of the public hearing, the City Council will either grant
approval, resubmit the plan to the Planning Commission for further
consideration, or deny approval of the plan.
         (d)   Upon City Council approval, the City Attorney shall draw up a
PUD agreement which stipulates the specific terms and conditions established
and approved by the City Council and accepted by the applicant. This agreement
shall be signed by the Mayor, the City Clerk-Administrator and the applicant.
         (e)   Where the development stage plan is denied approval, City
Council action shall be by resolution setting forth the reasons for its action.
A certified copy of the document evidencing City Council action shall be
delivered to the applicant. The applicant will have 60 days to submit a revised
development stage plan to the Planning Commission according to Step 1 of this
process. After the 60-day period, a revised general concept plan must be
submitted to the Planning Commission unless otherwise arranged with the Zoning
Administrator.
         (f)   If the general stage plan is denied approval three times within
one year of the original submission date, the applicant will be required to
submit a revised general concept plan according to division (D)(2) below.
      (5)   Limitation on detailed plan approval. Unless a final plan covering
the area designated in the first stage of the development stage plan has been
filed within six months from the date City Council grants development stage
plan approval, or in any case where the applicant fails to file final plans and
to proceed with development in accordance with the provisions of the code and/
or an approved development stage plan, the approval shall expire. The City
Council may, at its discretion, extend for not more than one additional period
of six months the filing deadline for any final plan when, for good cause
shown, the extension is necessary. In any case where development plan approval
expires, the City Council shall forthwith adopt a resolution repealing the
general concept plan approval and the development stage plan approval for that
portion of the PUD that has not received final plan approval and re-establish
the zoning and other ordinance provisions that would otherwise be applicable.
      (6)   Review and evaluation criteria. The evaluation of the proposed
development stage plan shall include, but not be limited to, the following
criteria.
         (a)   Adequate property control is provided to protect the individual
owner’s rights and property values and the public responsibility for
maintenance and upkeep.
         (b)   The interior circulation plan plus access from and onto public
rights-of-way does not create congestion or dangers and is adequate for the
safety of the project resident and the general public.
         (c)   A sufficient amount of usable open space is provided.
         (d)   The arrangement of buildings, structures and accessory uses does
not unreasonably disturb the privacy or property values of the surrounding
residential uses.
         (e)   The architectural design of the project is visually compatible
with the surrounding area. Architectural style or type of buildings shall not
solely be a basis for denial or approval of the development stage plan.
However, the overall appearance and compatibility of individual buildings to
other site elements of surrounding development will be given primary
considerations in the review stages of the Planning Commission and City
Council.
         (f)   The drainage and utility system plans are submitted to the City
Engineer and shall be subject to approval.
         (g)   The development schedule insures a logical development of the
site which will protect the public interest and conserve land.
         (h)   Dwelling unit and accessory use requirements are in compliance
with the district provisions in which the development is planned.
   (D)   Final plan.
      (1)   Purpose. The final plan is to serve as a complete, thorough and
permanent public record of the PUD and the manner in which it is to be
developed. It shall incorporate all prior approved plans and all approved
modifications thereof resulting form the PUD process. It shall serve in
conjunction with other city ordinances as the land use regulation applicable to
the PUD.
      (2)   Submission of the final plan. Upon approval of the development
stage plan, the applicant shall file with the City Clerk-Administrator a final
plan consisting of the information and submissions required by the final plan
stage, for the entire PUD or for one or more stages. The final plan is intended
only to add detail to, and to put in final form, the information contained in
the general concept plan and the development stage plan which shall conform to
the development stage plan in all respects.
      (3)   Review of final plan. The City Engineer shall review the final
plans to assure their compliance with the general concept and development stage
plans. The City Engineer shall require appropriate revisions by the applicant
wherever they do not so comply. The City Engineer shall report findings to the
City Clerk- Administrator who shall notify the applicant in writing of approval
of the final plan.
      (4)   City Council action. The City Council may approve the PUD final
plan with a majority vote.
      (5)   Recording of final plan. Within 30 days of the City Clerk-
Administrator’s notice of approval, the applicant shall record the final plan,
or such portions thereof as are appropriate, with the county’s Register of
Deeds or Register of Titles.
      (6)   Building and other permits. No building permit shall be granted on
land for which a plan for a PUD is in the process of review or which does not
conform to the approved final plan or for one phase of the final plan. Upon
receiving notice from the City Clerk-Administrator that the approved final plan
has been recorded and upon appropriate application of the applicant, building
and other permits may be issued to the applicant if the following conditions
are met:
         (a)   Public open space, if applicable, has been deeded to the city
and officially recorded;
         (b)   A development contract has been approved and executed by all
parties;
         (c)   The homeowner’s association, if applicable, by-laws, covenants
and deed restrictions have been approved by the City Attorney and officially

      (7)   Limitation of final plan approval. Within one year after the
approval of a final plan for PUD, or such shorter time as may be established by
the approved development schedule, construction shall commence in accordance
with such approved plan. Failure to commence construction within the period
shall, unless an extension has been granted as hereinafter provided,
automatically renders void the PUD permit and all approvals of the PUD plan.
The area encompassed within the PUD shall thereafter be subject to those
provisions of the zoning ordinances, and other ordinances, applicable in the
district in which it is located. In such case, the City Council shall forthwith
adopt a resolution repealing the PUD permit and PUD approvals and re-
establishing the zoning and other ordinance provisions that would otherwise be
applicable.
      (8)   Annual review. The Zoning Administrator shall review each Planned
Unit Development at least once each year and shall make a report through the
Planning Commission to the City Council on the status of the development in
each PUD District. If development is not progressing reasonably well, according
to schedule, the owner shall be required to submit a statement to the Zoning
Administrator setting forth the reasons for the lack of progress. If the City
Council finds that the development has not occurred according to the
established development schedule or is not otherwise reasonable in the view of
the City Council, the City Council may initiate rezonings to remove the Planned
Unit Development district in any event. It shall not be necessary for the City
Council to find the rezoning to a PUD district was in error.

structures may be authorized by the Zoning Administrator if requested, and if
caused by unforeseen circumstances.
      (2)   All other changes in use, rearrangement of lots, blocks and open
space must be authorized by the City Council and Planning Commission under
procedures outlined in this chapter.
   (B)   Authorized changes. Changes may be authorized only under the following
procedures:

(Prior Code, § 155.56) (Ord. passed 4-1-1997)
ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT
§ 155.065 CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS.
   (A)   Purpose. The principal objective of this chapter is to provide for an
orderly arrangement of compatible building and land uses, and for the proper
locations of all types of uses required by the city. To accomplish this
objective, each type and kind of use is classified as permitted in one or more
of the various districts established by this chapter. However, in addition to
those uses specifically classified and permitted in each district, there are
certain additional uses which may be allowed because of their unusual
characteristics or the service they provide the public. These conditional uses
require particular consideration as to their proper location in relation to
adjacent established or intended use and the planned development of the
community; therefore, both staff recommendations and public meetings are
required before granting a conditional use.
   (B)   Authority. The issuance of any permit shall not be approved until the
recommendations of the Planning Commission have been received or until 60 days
have elapsed since the referral of the matter to the Planning Commission, and
unless it shall be found, in each case, that the location of the use for which
the permit is sought, the manner of conducting the same and any building or
facilities or services which are involved will not be dangerous or otherwise
detrimental to persons residing or working in the vicinity thereof, or to the
public welfare, and will not impair the use, enjoyment or value of any property
in the vicinity.
   (C)   Procedure. An application for a conditional use shall be on the form
required by the Planning Commission and may be made by any governmental office,
department, board or commission or by any person having a freehold interest,
applicable to the parcel described in the application. The applicant shall pay
a fee set by City Council to the city before public notice is published or city
staff time is expended. All application for a conditional use shall be
accompanied by a site plan in accordance with city procedures. Public notice
shall be given not more than 30 days, nor less than ten days, in advance by
publishing a notice in the official newspaper of the area. This notice shall
describe the particular conditional use and shall contain a brief description
thereof. The Zoning Administrator shall send written notice to all property
owners or residents within 350 feet of the property. Assessor tax records and
street address shall be deemed sufficient for the location of certification of
ownership of the adjacent properties.
   (D)   Standards. In acting upon a request it may be determined that, in
order to protect the public health, safety, convenience and welfare, or to
avoid traffic congestion or hazard or for promoting conformity of a proposed
use with the character of adjoining property and uses and the district as a
whole, or for protecting such character, the issuance of a permit should be
subject to conditions.
      (1)   In considering conditional use requests, the Planning Agency shall
evaluate the use, utilizing the applicable requirements listed below.
         (a)   The land area and setback requirements of the property
containing such a use or activity shall be at least the minimum established for
the district.
         (b)   When abutting a residential use in a residential district, the
property shall be screened and landscaped as determined by the Planning Agency.
         (c)   Where applicable, all city, state and federal laws, regulations
and ordinances shall be complied with and all necessary permits secured.
         (d)   All signs shall be in compliance with ordinance regulations and
shall not adversely impact adjoining or surrounding residential uses.
         (e)   Adequate off-street parking and loading shall be provided in
accordance with §
155.034 of this chapter. The parking and loading shall be screened and
landscaped from abutting residential uses in compliance with §
155.034(G) of this chapter.
         (f)   The proposed water, sewer and other utilities shall be capable
of accommodating the proposed use.
         (g)   The street serving the use or activity is of sufficient design
to accommodate the proposed use or activity, and the use or activity shall not
generate such additional extra traffic to create a nuisance or hazard to
existing traffic or to surrounding land uses.
         (h)   All access roads, driveways, parking areas and outside storage,
service or sales areas shall be surfaced or grassed to control dust and
drainage.
         (i)   All open and outdoor storage, sales and service areas shall be
screened from view from the public streets and from abutting residential uses
or districts.
         (j)   All lighting shall be designed as to have no direct source of
light visible from adjacent residential areas or from the public streets.
         (k)   The use or activity shall be properly drained to control surface
water runoff.
         (l)   The architectural appearance and functional plan of the building
and site shall not be so dissimilar to the existing buildings or areas as to
cause impairment in property values or constitute a blighting influence.
         (m)   Where structures combine residential and non-residential uses,
the uses shall be separated and provided with individual outside access, and
the uses shall not conflict in any manner.
      (2)   All conditions pertaining to a specific site are subject to change
when the Planning Commission or City Council, upon investigation, finds that
the community safety, health, welfare and public betterment can be served as
well or better by modifying the conditions.
(Prior Code, § 155.70) (Ord. 560, passed 6-6-1978; Ord. 613, passed 3-6-2002;
Ord. 618, passed 5-6-2003)
§ 155.066 HOME OCCUPATIONS.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to prevent competition with
business districts and to provide a means through the establishment of specific
standards and procedures by which home occupations can be conducted in
residential neighborhoods without jeopardizing the health, safety and general
welfare of the surrounding neighborhood or compromise the residential character
of the area. In addition, this section is intended to provide a mechanism
enabling the distinction between permitted home occupations and special or
customarily “more sensitive” home occupations, so that special home occupations
may be reviewed through a hearing process.
   (B)   Application. Subject to the non-conforming use provision of this
section, all occupations conducted in the home shall comply with the provisions
of this section. This section shall not be construed, however, to apply to home
occupations accessory to farming.
   (C)   Procedures and permits.
      (1)   Permitted home occupation. Any permitted home occupation, as
defined in this section, may operate without a specific permit.
      (2)   Special home occupation. Any home occupation which does not meet
the specific requirements for a permitted home occupation as defined in this
section shall require a special home occupation permit which shall be applied
for, reviewed and disposed of in accordance with the provisions of §
155.065(C) of this chapter.
      (3)   Declaration of conditions. The City Council may impose such
conditions on the granting of a special home occupation permit as may be
necessary to carry out the purpose and provisions of this section.
      (4)   Effect of permit. A special home occupation permit may be issued
for a period of one year after which the permit may be reissued for periods of
up to three years each. Each application for permit renewal shall, however, be
processed in accordance with the provisions of §
155.065(C) of this chapter regarding conditional use permits; except that, no
public hearing is required on the permit renewal, unless deemed necessary by
the Planning Commission. However, if the Planning Commission deems a public
hearing necessary, notice of the permit renewal application must be provided to
all property owners of land within 350 feet of the boundary of the property in
question. Failure of a property owner to receive the notice shall not
invalidate any proceedings as set forth within this section.
      (5)   Transferability. Permits are licenses which are personal to the
permittee and shall not run with the land, nor be transferable.
      (6)   Lapse of special home occupation permit by non-use. Whenever within
one year after granting a permit, the use as permitted by the permit shall not
have been initiated, then the permit shall become null and void unless a
petition for extension of time in which to complete the work has been granted
by the City Council, through recommendation by the Planning Commission. The
extension shall be requested in writing and filed with the City Planner at
least 30 days before the expiration of the original permit. The request for
extension shall state facts showing a good faith attempt to initiate the use.
The petition shall be presented to the Planning Commission for a recommendation
to the City Council.
      (7)   Reconsideration. Whenever an application for a permit has been
considered and denied by the City Council, a similar application for a permit
affecting substantially the same property shall not be considered again by the
City Council for at least six months from the date of its denial unless a
decision to reconsider such matter is made by not less than four-fifths vote of
the full City Council.
      (8)   Renewal of permits. An applicant shall not have a vested right to a
permit renewal by reason of having obtained a previous permit. In applying for
and accepting a permit, the permit holder agrees that his or her monetary
investment in the home occupation will be fully amortized over the life of the
permit and that the permit renewal will not be needed to amortize the
investment. Each application for the renewal of a permit will be considered de
novo without taking into consideration that a previous permit has been granted.
The previous granting or renewal of a permit shall not constitute a precedent
or basis for the renewal of a permit.
   (D)   Requirement, general provisions. All home occupations shall comply
with the following general provisions and according to definition, the
applicable requirement provisions.
      (1)   General provisions.
         (a)   No home occupation shall produce light glare, noise, odor or
vibration that in any way have an objectionable effect upon adjacent or nearby
property.
         (b)   No equipment shall be used in the home occupation which will
create electrical interference to surrounding properties.
         (c)   Any home occupation shall be clearly incidental and secondary to

§ 155.067 INTERIM USES.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. The purpose and intent of allowing interim uses
is:
      (1)   To allow a use for a brief period of time until a permanent
location is obtained or while the permanent location is under construction;
      (2)   To allow a use that is presently judged acceptable by the City
Council, but that with anticipated development or redevelopment, will not be
acceptable in the future or will be replaced in the future by a permitted or
conditional use allowed with the respective district; and
      (3)   To allow a use which is reflective of anticipated long range change
to an area and which is in compliance with the Comprehensive Plan; provided
that, the use maintains harmony and compatibility with surrounding uses and is
in keeping with the architectural character and design standards of existing
uses and development.
   (B)   Procedure. Uses defined as interim uses which do not presently exist
within a respective zoning district shall be processed according to the
standards and procedures for a conditional use permit as established in §
155.065(C) of this chapter.
   (C)   General standards. An interim use shall comply with the following:
      (1)   Meet the standards of a conditional use permit set forth in §
155.065 of this chapter;
      (2)   The use is allowed as a conditional use in the respective zoning
district;
      (3)   The date or event that will terminate the use can be identified
with certainty; and
      (4)   The use will not impose additional unreasonable costs on the
public.
   (D)   Termination. An interim use shall terminate on the happening of any of
the following events, whichever occurs first:
      (1)   The date stated in the permit;
      (2)   Upon violation of conditions under which the permit was issued;
      (3)   Upon change in the city’s zoning regulations which renders the use
non-conforming; and
      (4)   The redevelopment of the use and property upon which it is located
to a permitted or conditional use as allowed within the respective zoning
district.
   (E)   Certification of taxes paid. Prior to approving an application for an
interim use permit, the applicant shall provide certification to the city that
there are no delinquent property taxes, special assessments, interest or city
utility fees due upon the parcel or land to which the interim use permit
application relates.

155.069 of this chapter.

provisions of this chapter in instances where their strict enforcement would
cause undue hardship because of circumstances unique to the individual property
under consideration, the Planning Commission will hear such requests for such
variances only when it is demonstrated that such actions will be in keeping
with the spirit and intent of the chapter. The Planning Commission may not
permit as a variance any use that is not permitted under this chapter for
property in the zone where the affected person’s land is located. The Planning
Commission may impose conditions in the granting of variances to insure
compliance and to protect adjacent properties. The fee for a variance
application is set by City Council and is to be paid to the City Clerk-
Administrator before city staff time is utilized and the applications
processed.

accompanied by a site plan in accordance with city procedures.

Administrator on an application in accordance with adopted policies. Each
application for a permit to construct or alter a building shall be accompanied

the size and location of the building and accessory buildings to be erected.
Applications for any kind of building permit shall contain such other
information as may be deemed necessary for the proper enforcement of the
chapter. The fee for a building permit shall be based on the current state
building valuation data. Building permit fees are collected and deposited in
the city’s General Fund.

of this chapter, indicating the nature of the violation and ordering the action
