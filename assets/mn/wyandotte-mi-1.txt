CHARTER
Editor’s note:
   This part contains the Charter of the City of Wyandotte, Michigan, approved
by the electors on 3-2-1926, and filed with the Secretary of State and in
effect on 3-5-1926, as amended.
    In this compilation an original copy of the Charter has been relied upon
together with subsequent amendments. It was impossible to use the Charter as
contained in the city’s prior code of Ordinances as it rearranged, renumbered
and combined sections; however due to     the accidental destruction of older
records it has been impossible to ascertain whether certain Charter amendments
were approved by the electorate. In such situations, the language in the
Charter as compiled in the city’s prior code has been accepted as authoritative
and editorial notes of such reliance have been inserted. The Charter is printed
as enacted and amended; except that, catchlines have been editorially supplied
to facilitate its use.
    Additionally, obvious spelling typographical errors have been corrected and
a uniform system of capitalization has been instituted. Any other changes or
additions are encased in brackets [ ].

   Act 78 of 1935, as amended, was approved by Charter amendment on 4-1-1957,
by a vote of 4,373 to 3,495 to apply to firefighter only. Any portion of 101.1
et seq. inconsistent with said charter amendment was repealed by said

part (101.1-101.19) are a charter amendment approved by the electors on 4-6-
1936 by a vote of 5,459 to 1,790.
    Such amendment purported to amend “paragraphs 98 to 101 of sections 24 to

however no charter sections had been designated for them, the sections being
consecutively numbered “1 through 19”. The editor has added numbering in a

and regulations providing for examinations for positions in the fire

officers effected thereby, and said rules and regulations and modifications
thereof shall also be printed for public distribution. All original
appointments to any position in the fire department within the terms of this

the probationer has not been satisfactory to the appointing officer, the
probationer shall be notified, in writing, that he will not receive permanent
appointment, whereupon his employment shall cease; otherwise, his retention in
the service shall be equivalent to his final appointment.
   (b)   Appointments: Regular. Every position, unless filled by promotion,
reinstatement, or reduction, shall be filled only in the following manner. The
appointing officer shall notify the commission of any vacancy in the service
which he desires to fill, and shall request the certification of eligibles. The
commission shall forthwith certify, from the eligible list, the names of the
person who received the highest average at preceding examinations held under
the provisions of this charter amendment within a period of three (3) years
next preceding the date of such appointment. The appointing officer shall,
thereupon, with sole reference to the relative merit and fitness of the
candidate, make the appointment so certified. As each subsequent vacancy
occurs, in the same or another position, precisely the same procedure shall be
followed. When an appointment is made under the provisions of this section, it
shall be in the first instance for the probationary period of six (6) months,
as provided in this charter amendment. The term “appointing officer” as used in
this charter amendment will be construed to mean the municipal officer in whom
the power of appointment of members of the fire department is vested by the
charter of this city.
   (c)   Appointments: Temporary. Whenever there are urgent reasons for filling
a vacancy in any position in the fire department, and there is no list of
persons eligible for appointment after a competitive examination, the
appointing officer may nominate a person to the civil service commission for a
noncompetitive examination; and if such nominee shall be certified by the said
commission as qualified, after such noncompetitive examination, he may be
appointed provisionally, to fill such vacancy until a selection and appointment
can be made after a competitive examination, and in the manner prescribed in
this charter amendment, but such provisional appointments shall not continue
for a longer period than three (3) months, nor shall successive provisional
appointments be made to the same position, under this provision.
   (d)   Appointments: Special. In event any position as an electrician or
mechanic is to be filled, then the examination to be given to applicants for
either the position of electrician or mechanic shall be so drawn as to test
only the qualification of such applicant in regard to his ability as
electrician or mechanic, such examinations to be special examinations.

All examinations shall be open to all applicants who have fulfilled the
preliminary requirement, stated on other sections of this charter amendment.
Notice of the time and place and purpose of every examination shall be given by

shall adopt reasonable regulations for permitting the presence of
representatives of the press at the examination. The commission shall post in a
public place at its office the eligible list containing the names and grades of
those who have passed examinations for positions or promotions in the fire
department, and shall indicate thereon such appointments as may be made from
said list. No question in any form of application or in any examination shall
be so framed as to elicit information concerning the political or religious
opinions or affiliations of any applicant; nor shall inquiries be made
concerning such opinions or affiliation; and all disclosures thereof shall be
discountenanced. No discrimination shall be exercised, threatened, or promised
by any person in the fire department against, or in favor of an applicant,
eligible or employee in fire department under this charter amendment because of
his political or religious opinions or affiliations.
   Vacancies in positions in the fire department shall be filled so far as
practical by promotions from among persons holding position in the next lower
grade in the department. Promotions shall be based upon merit to be ascertained
by tests to be provided by the commission, and upon the superior qualifications
of the person promoted as shown by his previous service and experience;
provided however, that no person shall be eligible for promotion from the lower
grade to the next higher grade until such person shall have completed at least
two (2) years service in the next lower grade in the department. Whenever a
position becomes vacant for which examinations are held, the appointing power
shall make requisitions upon the commission for the name of the person eligible
for appointment thereto. The commission shall certify the name of the person
highest on the eligible list for the class to which the vacant position has
been allocated, who is willing to accept employment. If more than one vacancy

relative portion of the whole sum to be levied as shall be proportionate to the
estimated benefit resulting to such lot from the improvement. When the city
assessor shall have completed the assessment he shall report the same to the
council. Such report shall be signed by the assessor and may be in the form of
a certificate, indorsed on the assessment roll, as follows:

established for the payment of the principal and interest of said bonds.

sinking funds shall be placed in such depository as the council shall by
resolution determine. No bonds shall be withdrawn from such depository except

indebtedness limit, shall not impose any liability, either as to the interest
or principal, upon the city; but shall be secured only by the property and
revenues of such public utility, including a franchise stating the terms upon
which, in case of foreclosure, the purchaser may operate the same which
franchise shall in no case extend for a longer period than twenty (20) years
from the date of the sale of such utility and franchise on foreclosure.
Same-Vote of qualified electors.

into which shall be paid such percentage of the gross or net earnings of the
public utility as may be deemed necessary and sufficient for the payment of the
mortgage bonds at maturity.
Bonds to satisfy judgment or decree.

Workmen’s compensation.
269-A.   Section 3-A.   The council shall, by ordinance, establish and maintain
a system of compensation for the employees of the city coming under the
provisions of the Workmen’s Compensation Laws of the State of Michigan and
their dependents, in the case of the disability, injury or death of such
employee, which system of compensation shall include the maintenance of a fund
to defray the expenses thereof; out of which no monies shall be expended or
disbursed except for the administration of such system of compensation. The
minimum standards for such system of compensation shall comply with the
standards set by the Workmen’s Compensation Act of the State of Michigan. Such
ordinance, whether existing at the time of the adopting of this section or
thereafter enacted, may be amended or revised from time to time, or a new
ordinance may be substituted therefor, as the best interests of the city and
the requirements of such system of compensation demand, but no such amendment,
revision or substitution shall destroy the existence of such plan of
compensation or alter it or the fund established so that it will not meet the
minimum requirements which are established herein. In case that the annual
earnings of the accumulated funds shall equal the average cost of operation of
the prior three (3) years’ experience, then the workmen’s compensation board of
the city shall be empowered to cancel the annual contribution requirements to
the said fund during that period and in case the earnings of the accumulated
funds shall equal sixty-five (65) per cent of the average cost of operation of
the prior three (3) years’ experience, the workmen’s compensation board of the
city may reduce the annual requirement to the said fund during that period by
an amount equal to the earnings of said fund.

the sections of the code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance
incorporated into the code); and

of the action (which are not limited to the costs taxable in ordinary civil
actions) and may include all expenses, direct and indirect, to which the city
has been put in connection with the municipal civil infraction, up to the entry

   (C)   (1)   The District Court Judge may establish a schedule of civil fines
and costs to be imposed for municipal civil infractions.
      (2)   The schedule need not include all municipal civil infractions and
may exclude a case on the basis of a defendant’s prior record of municipal
civil infractions.
   (D)   A default in the payment of a civil fine, costs or damages or expenses
ordered under this chapter, or an installment of the fine, costs or damages or
expenses may be collected by a means authorized for the enforcement of a
judgment under M.C.L.A. §§ 600.4001 et seq. or M.C.L.A. §§ 600.6001 et seq.

(Prior Code, § 23.5-7) (Ord. 1050, passed 8-17-1998)
§ 11.007 DEFAULT IN PAYMENT OF FINES, COSTS, DAMAGES OR EXPENSES; CIVIL
CONTEMPT; IMPRISONMENT.
   (A)   If a defendant defaults in the payment of a civil fine, costs or, if
applicable, damages or expenses, or any installment, as ordered, the court,
upon the motion of the plaintiff or upon its own motion, may require the
defendant to show cause why the defendant should not be held in civil contempt
and may issue a summons, order to show cause or a bench warrant of arrest for
the defendant’s appearance.
   (B)   If a corporation or an association is ordered to pay a civil fine,
costs or damages or expenses, the individuals authorized to make disbursement
shall pay the fine, costs or damages or expenses, and their failure to do so
shall be civil contempt unless they make the showing required in this section.
   (C)   Unless the defendant shows that the default was not attributable to an
intentional refusal to obey the order of the court or to a failure on his or
her part to make a good faith effort to obtain the funds required for payment,
the court shall find that the default constitutes a civil contempt and may
order the defendant committed until all or a specified part of the amount due
is paid.
   (D)   If it appears that the default in the payment of a fine, costs or
damages or expenses does not constitute civil contempt, the court may enter an
order allowing the defendant additional time for payment, reducing the amount
of payment or of each installment, or revoking the fine, costs or damages or
expenses.
   (E)   (1)   The term of imprisonment on civil contempt for non-payment of a

commitment, and shall not exceed one day for each $30 due.

imprisonment and each day of detention in default of recognizance before
judgment at the rate of $30 per day.

payment of a civil fine, costs or damages or expenses shall not be discharged
from custody until one of the following occurs:

(E) above;
      (2)   The amount due is collected through execution of process or
otherwise; or
      (3)   The amount due is satisfied pursuant to a combination of divisions
(F)(1) and (F)(2) above.
(Prior Code, § 23.5-8) (Ord. 1050, passed 8-17-1998)
§ 11.008 VIOLATIONS AND THE LIKE.
   (A)   If a defendant does not pay a civil fine or costs or an installment
ordered within 30 days after the date on which payment is due in a municipal
civil infraction action brought for a violation involving the use or occupation
of land or a building or other structure, the plaintiff may obtain a lien
against the land, building or structure involved in the violation by recording
a copy of the court order requiring payment of the fine and costs with the
Register of Deeds for the county in which the land, building or structure is
located. The court order shall not be recorded unless a legal description of
the property is incorporated in or attached to the court order. The lien is
effective immediately upon recording of the court order with the Register of
Deeds.
   (B)   The court order recorded with the Register of Deeds shall constitute
notice of the pendency of the lien. In addition, a written notice of the lien
shall be sent by the plaintiff by first-class mail to the owner of record of
the land, building or structure at the owner’s last known address.
   (C)   The lien may be enforced and discharged by a county, city, village or
township in the manner prescribed by its charter, by the General Property Tax
Act, Public Act 206 of 1893, being M.C.L.A. §§ 211.1 through 211.157, or by an
ordinance duly passed by the governing body of the city. However, property is
not subject to sale under § 60 of Public Act 206 of 1893, being M.C.L.A. §
211.60, for non-payment of a civil fine or costs or an installment ordered
under § 8727 unless the property is also subject to sale under § 60 of Public
Act 206 of 1893, being M.C.L.A. § 211.60, for delinquent property taxes.
   (D)   A lien created under this section has priority over any other lien
unless one or more of the following apply:
      (1)   The other lien is a lien for taxes or special assessments;
      (2)   The other lien is created before the effective date of the
amendatory act that added this section;
      (3)   Federal law provides that the other lien has priority; and/or
      (4)   The other lien is recorded before the lien under this section is
recorded.
   (E)   The city may institute an action in a court of competent jurisdiction
for the collection of the fines and costs imposed by a court order for a
municipal civil infraction. However, an attempt by the city to collect the
fines or costs by any process does not invalidate or waive the lien upon the
land, building or structure.
   (F)   A lien provided for by this section shall not continue for a period
longer than five years after a copy of the court order imposing a fine or costs
is recorded, unless within that time an action to enforce the lien is
commenced.

annual percentage increase in a cost-of-living index that is based on prices of
all items and issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics;
            2.   By the increase in compensation for a position held by the
employee at the time of retirement;
            3.   By the amount of a variable or fixed rate paid directly from
the trust. A fixed rate increase may be provided if the rate of increase is
less than 5%. A variable rate increase, based solely on better than assumed
investment performance, is permitted, but only if the assumed interest rate for
calculating the initial level of payments is at least 3%;
            4.   To the extent of the reduction in the amount of the member’s
payments to provide for a survivor benefit upon death, but only if the
beneficiary whose life was being used to determine the distribution period
described in divisions (B)(11) or (B)(12) below dies or is no longer the
member’s beneficiary pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order within
the meaning of I.R.C. § 414(p);
            5.   To provide cash refunds of employee contributions upon the
member’s death; or
            6.   To pay increased benefits that result from a plan amendment.
      (9)   Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date. The
amount that must be distributed on or before the member’s required beginning
date (or, if the member dies before distributions begin, the date distributions
are required to begin under divisions (B)(6)(a) or (B)(6)(b) above) is the
payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not
be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment
interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for
which payments are received (e.g., bimonthly, monthly, semi-annually or
annually). All of the member’s benefit accruals as of the last day of the first
distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of
the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the member’s
required beginning date.
      (10)   Additional accruals after first distribution calendar year. Any
additional benefits accruing to the member in a calendar year after the first
distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with the first payment
interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in
which such amount accrues.
      (11)   Joint life annuities where the beneficiary is not the member’s
spouse. If the member’s interest is being distributed in the form of a joint
and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the member and a non-spouse
beneficiary, annuity payments to be made on or after the member’s required
beginning date to the designated beneficiary after the member’s death must not
at any time exceed the applicable percentage of the annuity payment for such
period that would have been payable to the member using the table set forth in
Q&A-2 of § 1.401(a)(9)-6T of the Treasury regulations. If the form of
distribution combines a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the
member and a non- spouse beneficiary and a period certain annuity, the
requirement in the preceding sentence will apply to annuity payments to be made
to the designated beneficiary after the expiration of the period certain.
      (12)   Period certain annuities. Unless the member’s spouse is the sole
designated beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and no
life annuity, the period certain for an annuity distribution commencing during
the member’s lifetime may not exceed the applicable distribution period for the
member under the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in § 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the
Treasury regulations for the calendar year that contains the annuity starting
date. If the annuity starting date precedes the year in which the member
reaches age 70, the applicable distribution period for the member is the
distribution period for age 70 under the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in §
1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations, plus the excess of 70 over the age
of the member as of the member’s birthday in the year that contains the annuity
starting date. If the member’s spouse is the member’s sole designated
beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and no life
annuity, the period certain may not exceed the longer of the member’s
applicable distribution period, as determined under this division (B)(12), or
the joint life and last survivor expectancy of the member and the member’s
spouse as determined under the Joint and Last Survivor Table set forth in §
1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations, using the member’
      (13)   Member survived by designated beneficiary. If the member dies
before the date distribution of his or her interest begins and there is a
designated beneficiary, the member’s entire interest will be distributed,
beginning no later than the time described in divisions (B)(6)(a) or (B)(6)(b)
above, over the life of the designated beneficiary or over a period certain not
exceeding:
         (a)   Unless the annuity starting date is before the first
distribution calendar year, the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary
determined using the beneficiary’s age as of the beneficiary’s birthday in the
calendar year immediately following the calendar year of the member’s death; or
         (b)   If the annuity starting date is before the first distribution
calendar year, the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary determined
using the beneficiary’s age as of the beneficiary’s birthday in the calendar
year that contains the annuity starting date.
      (14)   No designated beneficiary. If the member dies before the date
distributions begin and there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30
of the year following the year of the member’s death, distribution of the
member’s entire interest will be completed by December 31 of the calendar year
containing the fifth anniversary of the member’s death.
      (15)   Death of surviving spouse before distributions to surviving spouse
begin. If the member dies before the date distribution of his or her interest
begins, the member’s surviving spouse is the member’s sole designated
beneficiary, and the surviving spouse dies before distributions to the
surviving spouse begin, this section will apply as if the surviving spouse were
the member; except that, the time by which distributions must begin will be
determined without regard to division (B)(6)(a) above.
      (16)   Payments to children. Payments made to a member’s child are
treated as payments to the surviving spouse if they cease after the child
reached the age of majority (or upon the death of the child) and are payable to
the surviving spouse thereafter.
      (17)   Designated beneficiary. The individual who is designated as the
beneficiary under this chapter and is the designated beneficiary under I.R.C. §
401(a)(9) and § 1.401(a)(9)-1, Q&A-4, of the Treasury regulations.
      (18)   Distribution calendar year.
         (a)   A calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required.
         (b)   For distributions beginning before the member’s death, the first
distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately preceding the
calendar year which contains the member’s required beginning date. For
distributions beginning after the member’s death, the first distribution
calendar year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin
pursuant to division (B)(6) above.
      (19)   Life expectancy. Life expectancy as computed by use of the Single
Life Table in § 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations.
      (20)   Required beginning date. The date specified in division (B)(1)
above.

(Prior Code, § 2-223) (Ord. 368, passed 9-25-1967)
§ 32.019 DISABILITY ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENT; ALLOWANCE.
   (A)   Disability eligibility requirements.
      (1)   Upon the application of a member, or his or her department head, a
member who has satisfied the applicable service requirement set forth below and
becomes totally and permanently mentally or physically incapacitated for duty
in the employ of the city may be retired by the Commission; provided that,
after a medical examination of the member by the employee’s attending
physician, and also after a medical examination by the city’s physician, if
elected by the city, said physician or physicians, as the case may be, reports
to the Commission in writing that the member is mentally or physically totally
incapacitated for duty in the employ of the city, will likely be so
incapacitated permanently and should be retired:
         (a)   Ten years of credited service for a police officer or
firefighter member;
         (b)   Ten years of credited service for a municipal service member; or
         (c)   Ten years of credited service for a general member.
      (2)   The applicable credited service requirement in division (A)(1)
above shall be waived if the Commission finds that the member’s total and
permanent incapacity is the natural and proximate result of a personal injury
or disease arising out of and in the course of his or her actual performance of
duty in the employ of the city, and that he or she is in receipt of worker’s
compensation on account of his or her total and permanent incapacity.
      (3)   Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, effective
2-1-1990, for a police member, a Police Department command officer, a member of
the F.O.P. police/fire dispatcher/clerical bargaining unit, a fire member or a
general member, should a dispute exist between the said member’s attending
physician and the city’s physician on whether or not said member has satisfied
the requirements of division (A)(1) above, then the city and said member’s
bargaining unit shall mutually select and agree upon a third duly licensed and
qualified physician to examine said member and make a final review and
determination and report to the Commission on whether or not the said member
meets the requirements for a disability retirement under this section.
(Prior Code, § 2-224)
   (B)   Disability retirement allowance.
      (1)   Upon his or her retirement on account of disability, as provided in
division (C) below, a member shall receive a straight life disability
retirement allowance computed according to §
32.016(C) of this chapter if he or she is a police officer or firefighter
member, or computed according to §
32.016(D) of this chapter if he or she is a hospital member, or computed
according to §
32.016(E) of this chapter if he or she is a municipal service member, or
computed according to §
32.016(F) of this chapter if he or she is a general member. Upon his or her
retirement, he or she may elect to receive his or her disability retirement
allowance under an option provided in §
32.016(J) of this chapter in lieu of a straight life annuity. His or her
disability retirement allowance shall be subject to division (C) below and
shall not be less than the applicable amount set forth below:
         (a)   Twenty percent of his or her final average compensation if he or
she is a police officer or firefighter member;
         (b)   The sum of 10% of the first $4,200 of his or her final average
compensation and 15% of the portion, if any, of his or her final average
compensation in excess of $4,200, if he or she is a hospital member;
         (c)   Sixteen and seventy-hundredths percent of his or her final
average compensation if he or she is a municipal service member; or
         (d)   Sixteen and seventy-hundredths percent of his or her final
average compensation if he or she is a general member.
      (2)   If a disability retirant was in receipt of worker’s compensation on
account of his or her city employment, his or her disability retirement
allowance shall be recomputed upon termination of his or her worker’s
compensation period or at his or her attainment of age 65 years, whichever
occurs first, to include the period between the effective date of his or her
disability retirement allowance and the date of recomputation as additional
credited service.
(Prior Code, § 2-225)
   (C)   Reexamination of disability retirants.
      (1)   The Commission may require a disability retirant, who has not
attained his or her applicable voluntary retirement age, to undergo a medical
examination to be made by or under the direction of the Medical Director at
least once a year during the first five years following his retirement and at
least once in each three-year period thereafter. Should the disability retirant
refuse to submit to any such medical examination, his or her disability
retirement allowance may be suspended by the Commission until his or her
withdrawal of such refusal; and should such refusal continue for one year, all
his or her rights in and to a disability retirement allowance shall be
forfeited by him or her. If, upon such medical examination of a disability
retirant, the Medical Director reports to the Commission that the retirant is
physically able and capable of resuming employment with the city, and his or
her report is concurred in by the Commission, the retirant shall be returned to
the employ of the city and his or her disability retirement allowance shall be
terminated. In returning the retirant to city employment, the city shall be
allowed reasonable latitude in placing him or her in a suitable position
commensurate to his or her type of work and compensation at the time of his or
her retirement.
      (2)   A disability retirant who is returned to city employment, as
provided in division (C)(1) above, shall again become a member of the
retirement system. His or her credited service in force at the time of his or
her retirement shall be restored in full force and effect. He or she shall be
given service credit for the period he or she was in receipt of a disability
retirement allowance if within such period he or she was in receipt of worker’s
compensation on account of his or her total and permanent disability arising
out of and in the course of his or her city employment; otherwise, he or she
shall not be given service credit for the period he or she was in receipt of a
disability retirement allowance.
      (3)   If a disability retirant, who has not attained his or her
applicable voluntary retirement age, is or becomes engaged in a gainful
occupation, business or employment, his or her disability retirement allowance
while he or she is so engaged shall not exceed the difference between his or
her annual rate of compensation at the time of his or her retirement and the
amount earned by him or her in such gainful occupation, business or employment.
(Prior Code, § 2-226)
   (D)   Right to waive, maintain or alter disability provisions.
Notwithstanding anything elsewhere in this subchapter to the contrary,
effective 2-1-1990, as it relates to police members, Police Department command
officers, members of the F.O.P. police/fire dispatcher/clerical bargaining
unit, fire members and general members, the city expressly reserves the right
to waive, maintain or alter the requirements of divisions (A), (B) and (C)
above; provided, however, in no event shall any pension benefits payable to
said retirant be less than the normal calculation of benefits for the
applicable credited service rendered.
(Prior Code, § 2-226.1) (Ord. 368, passed 9-25-1967; Ord. 490-A, passed 12-4-
1972; Ord. 541, passed 12-9-1974; Ord. 917, passed 8-19-1991; Ord. 1046, passed

solely and exclusively out and in the course of his or her employment by the
city or a disability retirant dies, while in receipt of worker’s compensation
on account of his or her city employment and prior to his or her attainment of
his or her applicable voluntary retirement age, as the result of the same
injury or disease for which he or she was retired and, in either case, the
Commission finds that his or her death, injury or disease resulting in death is
the result of his or her actual performance of duty in the employ of the city,
the applicable benefits provided in this division (A) shall be paid, subject to
the condition that worker’s compensation is granted on account of the member’s
death.
      (1)   The member’ accumulated contributions standing to his or her credit
in the Annuity Savings Fund at the time of his or her death shall be refunded
in accordance with §
32.023(A)(2) of this chapter.
      (2)   The member’s widow shall receive a pension equal to his or her
weekly worker’s compensation converted to an annual basis. The widow’s pension
shall begin upon termination of his or her worker’s compensation period and
shall terminate upon remarriage or death, whichever occurs first.
      (3)   Each unmarried child of the deceased member who is under the age of
18 years shall receive a pension equal to his or her weekly worker’s
compensation converted to an annual basis. Each such child’s pension shall
begin upon termination of his or her worker’s compensation period and shall
terminate upon his or her adoption, marriage, death or attainment of age 18
years, whichever occurs first. If the widow’s pension is terminated on account
of his or her remarriage or death, the pension of each child shall be increased
by an equal share of the said widow’s pension.
      (4)   Each parent of the deceased member shall receive a pension equal to
his or her weekly worker’s compensation converted to an annual basis. Each such
parent’s pension shall begin upon termination of his or her worker’s
compensation period and shall terminate upon his or her remarriage or death,
whichever occurs first.

member was married at the time his or her employment with the city last
terminated. The term WIDOW shall include a widower whom the Commission finds to
be totally and permanently disabled and to have been dependent upon the
deceased member for at least 50% of his or her financial support.
(Prior Code, § 2-227) (Ord. 368, passed 9-25-1967)
§ 32.021 NON-DUTY DEATH BENEFITS.
   (A)   (1)   A member who has satisfied the applicable age and service
requirement set forth below may at any time prior to the effective date of his
or her retirement, but not thereafter, elect option 2 provided in §
32.016(J) of this chapter and nominate a beneficiary whom the Commission finds
to be dependent upon the member for at least 50% of his or her financial
support:
         (a)   Any age, and ten or more years of credited service, if he or she
is a police officer or firefighter member;
         (b)   Age 60 years and ten or more years of credited service or 25 or
more years of credited service without regard to age if he or she is a hospital
member;
         (c)   Age 60 years and ten or more years of credited service or 25 or
more years of credited service without regard to age if he or she is a
municipal service member; and/or
         (d)   Any age and ten or more years of credited service if he or she
is a general member.
      (2)   Prior to the effective date of his or her retirement, but not
thereafter, a member may revoke his or her election of option 2 and nomination
of beneficiary and he or she may, prior to the effective date of his or her
retirement, again elect said option 2 and nominate a beneficiary as provided in
this division (A)(2). Upon the death of a member who has an option 2 election
in force his or her beneficiary, if living, shall immediately receive a
retirement allowance which is the option 2 equivalent of a retirement allowance
computed according to §
32.016(C) of this chapter if the member was a police officer or firefighter
member, or computed according to §
32.016(D) of this chapter if the member was a hospital member, or computed
according to §
32.016(E) of this chapter if the member was a municipal service member, or
computed according to §
32.016(F) of this chapter if the member was a general member, in the same
manner in all respects as if the member had retired the date preceding the date
of his or her death, notwithstanding that he or she might not have attained his
or her applicable voluntary retirement age. If a member has an option 2
election in force at the time of his or her retirement, his or her said
election of option 2 and nomination of beneficiary shall thereafter continue in
force unless prior to the effective date of his or her retirement he or she
elects to take his or her retirement allowance as a straight life allowance or
under another option provided in §§
32.016(J) or
32.018 of this chapter. No benefit shall be paid under this division (A)(2) on
account of the death of a member if any benefits are paid under §
32.021 of this chapter on account of his or her death.
   (B)   (1)   If a member has satisfied the applicable age and service
requirements set forth below and does not have an option 2 election provided in
division (A) above in force and dies while in the employ of the city and leaves
a widow or a widower, the widow or widower shall immediately be paid a
retirement allowance which is the option 2 equivalent of a retirement allowance
computed according to §
32.016(C) of this chapter if the member was a police officer or firefighter
member, or computed according to §
32.016(D) of this chapter if the member was a hospital member, or computed
according to §
32.016(E) of this chapter if the member was a municipal service member, or
computed according to §
32.016(F) of this chapter if the member was a general member, in the same
manner in all respects as if the member had retired the day preceding the date
of his or her death, notwithstanding that he or she might not have attained his
or her applicable voluntary retirement age, elected option 2 provided in §
32.016(J) of this chapter and nominated his or her widow or widower as
beneficiary:
         (a)   Any age, and ten or more years of credited service, if he or she
is a police officer or firefighter member;
         (b)   Age 60 years and ten or more years of credited service, or 25 or
more years of credited service without regard to age, if he or she is a
hospital member;
         (c)   Age 25 years and ten or more years of credited service, if he is
a municipal service member. The retirement allowance payable on account of the
death of a municipal service member shall terminate upon the remarriage of the
widow or widower unless the member at the time of his death either:
            1.   Had 25 or more years of credited service; or
            2.   Was age 60 years or older and had ten or more years of
credited service.
         (d)   Any age and ten or more years of credited service if he or she
is a general member.
      (2)   No benefit shall be paid under this division (B)(2) on account of
the death of a member if any benefits are paid under §
32.020 of this chapter on account of his or her death. The surviving spouse of
a deceased general member, police member or a fire member may elect in writing,
prior to payment of any pension benefits, to be paid the deceased member’s
accumulated contributions in a lump sum in accordance with §
32.017 of this chapter.

§ 32.022 MOBILITY IN CITY EMPLOYMENT.
   If a member has credited service in force for service rendered as a member
in more than one of the classifications of member defined in §
32.007 of this chapter, his or her retirement allowance or any retirement
allowance payable on his or her behalf shall be computed using his or her final
average compensation at time of retirement, according to §
32.016(C) of this chapter for credited service rendered as a police officer or
firefighter member, according to §
32.016(D) of this chapter for credited service rendered as a hospital member,
according to §
32.016(E) of this chapter for credited service rendered as a municipal service
member, and according to §
32.016(F) of this chapter for credited service rendered as a general member.
The portion of such retirement allowance based upon credited service in each
classification of member shall not become payable prior to the member’s
attainment of his or her voluntary retirement age applicable to the
classification in which the service was rendered, unless the member retired
under §
32.019(A) of this chapter or was considered to have retired as provided in §
32.021 of this chapter.

contributions standing to his or her credit in the Annuity Savings Fund upon
his or her request in writing filed with the Commission. Payment of his or her

this section, shall be made in accordance with such rules and regulations as
the Commission shall from time to time adopt.

member who is in the employ of the hospital on 3-8-1982, may request, on a form
furnished by the hospital personnel office, a refund of the accumulated

the police officer member will be 5% of all compensation included in the final
average compensation;
         (b)   If he or she is a hospital member, no contributions are
required, effective 5-11-1981;
         (c)   If he is an exempt salaried municipal service member or a non-
exempt salaried municipal service member, as determined by the Municipal
Service Commission, no contributions are required effective 6-1-1983. If he or

      (3)   The officer or officers responsible for making the payroll shall
cause the applicable contributions provided in division (A)(2) above to be
deducted from the compensation of each member on each and every payroll, for
each and every payroll period, so long as he or she remains a member in the
employ of the city. The contributions of a member when deducted from his or her
compensation shall be paid to the retirement system and shall be credited to
his or her individual account in the Annuity Savings Fund. The member’s
contributions provided for herein shall be made notwithstanding that the
minimum compensation provided by law for any member shall be thereby changed.
Every member shall be deemed to consent and agree to the deductions made and
provided for herein. Payment of his or her compensation less said deductions
shall be a full and complete discharge and acquittance of all claims and
demands whatsoever for services rendered by the member during the period
covered by such payment, except as to benefits provided under this subchapter.
      (4)   In addition to the contributions deducted from the compensations of
members as hereinbefore provided, a member shall deposit in the Annuity Savings

rendered prior to the date he or she withdrew his or her accumulated
contributions until he or she returns to the Annuity Savings Fund all amounts

apply to amounts withdrawn from the Annuity Savings Fund in accordance with the
provisions of division (B) below.
      (5)   Upon the retirement of a member, his or her accumulated
contributions standing to his or her credit in the Annuity Savings Fund shall
be transferred to the Retirement Reserve Fund. At the expiration of a period of
three years from the date an employee ceases to be a member, any balance
standing to his or her credit in the Annuity Savings Fund, unclaimed by the
member or his or her legal representative, shall remain a part of the assets of

valuation, the excess, if any, of the reported value of retirement allowances
being paid and likely to be paid retirants and beneficiaries over the balance
in the Retirement Reserve Fund shall be transferred from the Pension Reserve
Fund to the Retirement Reserve Fund.
      (3)   The financial objective of this subchapter is to require city
contributions to the retirement system each fiscal year shall be sufficient to
fully fund the cost of benefits likely to be paid on account of service
rendered by members during the year and finance unfunded costs of benefits
likely to be paid on account of service rendered by members prior to the
current year over a period of not more than 40 years. Such contributions shall
be computed by the actuary as legal percents of member payroll in accordance
with generally accepted actuarial principles. The Commission shall annually
certify to the City Council the contributions determined according to this
section, and the City Council shall appropriate and pay to the retirement
system the contributions so certified.
(Prior Code, § 2-234)
   (C)   Retirement Reserve Fund. The Retirement Reserve Fund shall be the fund
from which shall be paid all annuities, pensions and retirement allowances
payable as provided in this article. Should a disability retirant return to the
employ of the city, his or her annuity reserve computed as of the date of his
or her return shall be transferred from the Retirement Reserve Fund to the
Annuity Savings Fund, and his or her pension reserve computed as of the date of
his or her return shall be transferred from the Retirement Reserve Fund to the
Pension Reserve Fund.

effective 6-1-1986, there also shall be paid or transferred from the Income
Fund all amounts, fees and/or charges required to pay for the investment
services and/or investment costs to said city’s employees retirement system. At
the end of each fiscal year, if the balance in the Income Fund is more than
sufficient to cover current charges, the remainder, if any, shall be
proportioned to the Pension Reserve Fund of the various divisions in proportion
to their mean balances in the system during the year.
      (2)   Whenever the balance in the Income Fund is insufficient to meet the
charges to the fund, the amount of such insufficiency shall be transferred from
the Pension Reserve Fund to the Income Fund.
(Prior Code, § 2-236)
   (E)   Expense Fund. The Expense Fund shall be the fund to which shall be
credited all moneys provided by the city, or instrumentalities of the city, to
pay the administrative expenses of the system, and from which such expenses
shall be paid.
(Prior Code, § 2-237)

shortfalls with interest added.
   (B)   The Health and Life Insurance Benefit Reserve created in this section
shall be used exclusively for the funding of negotiated health and life
insurance costs attributable to general member retirees and police and fire
member retirees and regular interest shall be credited to this reserve in the
same manner as it is credited to the reserve for employer contributions, but in
no case less than 7.5% interest compounded annually on the mean average balance

deductions being paid by general city, police and fire retirees or
beneficiaries who are 73 years old or older and have retired on or before 4-30-
1977, and who have met all four of the following criteria (except that,
criteria one will be waived if the beneficiary’s spouse (the employee) died

city, police and fire retirees and beneficiaries, who on 12-31-1992 have or
would have, a monthly pension payroll deduction from the city for the city
complimentary health care coverage. On 1-1-1993 that coverage is commonly
referred to as Complimentary Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Michigan;
         (c)   Criteria Three - Date of retirement: all general city, police

Shield for said current complimentary health care coverage, said increase will
be passed on to the retiree in the month required to make payment for said
benefit. If rate decreases are passed on to the city, the amount paid for by
the retirement system shall be the actual monthly charges being assessed by

monthly payroll check, but any savings from rate decreases will not be passed
on to the retiree.

currently being provided on 1-1-1993, the monthly benefit amounts in division
(D)(2) above will be adjusted to reflect actual current rates being paid for
the substituted health care coverage. If rates increase or decrease after the
substituted coverage has been implemented, then division (D)(3) above will be
utilized to calculate and pay for any increases or decreases in coverage.
      (5)   If a retiree who meets all four eligibility requirements
established in division (D)(1) above elects any other city-sponsored health
care package, the city will only pay the retirees and beneficiaries benefit

               (1)   Rates and charges for the use of the wastewater system of
the City of Wyandotte are hereby established and made against each lot, parcel
of land or premises which may have direct or indirect connections to the system
or which may otherwise discharge wastewater either directly or indirectly into
the system.
               (2)   The rates and charges hereby established shall be based
upon a methodology which complies with applicable federal and state statutes
and regulations. The amount of the rates and charges shall be sufficient to
provide for debt service and for the expenses of operation, maintenance and
replacement of the system as necessary to preserve the same in good repair and
working order. The amount of the rates and charges shall be reviewed annually
and revised when necessary to insure system expenses are met and that all users
pay their proportionate share of operation, maintenance and equipment

   (B)   Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge.
      (1)   Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this subchapter
may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce
an illicit discharge. The City Engineer will notify a violator of the proposed
termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the City Engineer for
a reconsideration and hearing.
      (2)   A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to
premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the
City Engineer.
(Ord. 1490, passed 6-29-2020)
§ 52.037 INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES.
   Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES storm
water discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof
of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the
city, prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4.
(Ord. 1490, passed 6-29-2020)
§ 52.038 MONITORING OF DISCHARGES.

the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the city and shall not be replaced.
The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
      (5)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the city access to a permitted
facility is a violation of a storm water discharge permit and of this section.
A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge
storm water associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the
person denies the authorized enforcement agency reasonable access to the
permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or
required by this section.
      (6)   If the city has been refused access to any part of the premises
from which storm water is discharged, and he or she is able to demonstrate
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this subchapter, or
that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection
and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this subchapter or any
order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and
welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement agency may seek
issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.

remediate or restore within the established deadline, the work will be done by
a designated governmental agency or a contractor, and the expense thereof shall
be charged to the violator.
(Ord. 1490, passed 6-29-2020)
§ 52.040 APPEAL OF NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
   (A)   Generally. Any person receiving a notice of violation may appeal the
determination of the authorized enforcement agency. The notice of appeal must

POST CONSTRUCTION STORMWATER RUNOFF CONTROLS
§ 52.055 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   It is hereby determined that land development projects and associated
increases in impervious cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds
and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream channel
erosion, and sediment transport and deposition. Stormwater runoff contributes
to increased quantities of water-borne pollutants. Stormwater runoff, soil
erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized through
the regulation of stormwater runoff from development sites.
   (B)   Therefore, the City of Wyandotte establishes this set of water quality
and quantity policies applicable to all surface waters to provide reasonable
guidance for the regulation of stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting
local water resources from degradation. It is determined that the regulation of
stormwater runoff discharges from land development projects and other
construction activities in order to control and minimize increases in
stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and
nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public
interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety.
(Ord. 1521, passed 2-7-2022)
§ 52.056 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to establish minimum stormwater management
requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health, safety,
and welfare of the public residing in watersheds within this jurisdiction. This
subchapter seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives:
   (A)   Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from any development located
in separated sewer areas and discharging stormwater to a watercourse in order
to reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream temperature, and streambank
erosion and maintain the integrity of stream channels.
   (B)   Minimize increases in nonpoint source pollution caused by stormwater
runoff from any development located in separated sewer areas and discharging
stormwater to a watercourse which would otherwise degrade local water quality.
   (C)   Minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff which flows
from any specific site during and following any development located in
separated sewer areas and discharging stormwater to a watercourse to not exceed
the pre-development hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable.
   (D)   Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and nonpoint
source pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater management controls and
to ensure that these management controls are properly maintained and pose no
threat to public safety.
(Ord. 1521, passed 2-7-2022)
§ 52.057 APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   This subchapter shall be applicable to all development located in
separated sewer areas and discharging stormwater to a watercourse, unless
eligible for an exemption or granted a waiver by the City of Wyandotte under
the specifications of §
52.062. The subchapter also applies to land development activities that are
smaller than the minimum applicability criteria if such activities are part of
a larger common plan of development that meets the following applicability
criteria, even though multiple separate and distinct land development
activities may take place at different times on different schedules.
   (B)   To prevent the adverse impacts of stormwater runoff, the city has
developed a set of performance standards that must be met at all development
sites. These standards apply to any construction activity disturbing one or
more acres of land. The following activities may be exempt from these
stormwater performance criteria:
      (1)   Construction of, and additions or modifications to, existing
single-family and two-family residential structures.
      (2)   Construction of, and additions or modifications to, existing
multiple unit residential structures that do not disturb more than one acre of
land, provided they are not part of a larger common development plan.
      (3)    Developments that do not disturb more than one acre of land,
provided they are not part of a larger common development plan.
      (4)   Repairs to any stormwater treatment practice deemed necessary by
the City of Wyandotte Department of Engineering and Building.
   (C)   When a site development plan is submitted that qualifies as a
redevelopment project as defined in §
52.060, unless the site development is exempt as described above, or receives a
waiver in accordance with §
52.062, decisions on permitting and on-site stormwater requirements shall be
governed by the Wayne County Stormwater Management Ordinance, Chapter 95
Stormwater Management of the Code of Ordinances of the Charter County of Wayne
as amended (Enrolled Ordinance No. 2021-526a (August 19, 2021)); and the Wayne
County Stormwater Management Administrative Rules, as amended, (Resolution No.
2021-526b (August 19, 2021)); and the most recent version of the Wayne County
Stormwater Standards Manual, which will be collectively referred to as the
Wayne County Stormwater Program.
(Ord. 1521, passed 2-7-2022)
§ 52.058 COMPATIBILITY WITH OTHER PERMIT AND ORDINANCE REQUIREMENTS.
   This subchapter is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any
other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute, or other provision of law. The
requirements of this subchapter should be considered minimum requirements, and
where any provision of this subchapter imposes restrictions different from
those imposed by any other ordinance, rule or regulation, or other provision of
law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective
standards for human health or the environment shall be considered to take
precedence.
(Ord. 1521, passed 2-7-2022)
§ 52.059 DEVELOPMENT OF A STORMWATER DESIGN MANUAL.
   The Wayne County Stormwater Program contains specifications and standards,
including best management practices (BMP) which may be utilized by any
development required to implement this subchapter. The Wayne County Stormwater
Program may be updated and expanded from time to time, at the discretion of the
County of Wayne, based on improvements in engineering, science, monitoring and
local maintenance experience. Stormwater treatment practices that are designed
and constructed in accordance with these design and sizing criteria will be
presumed to meet the minimum water quality performance standards.

(Ord. 1521, passed 2-7-2022)
§ 52.063 GENERAL PERFORMANCE CRITERIA FOR STORMWATER MANAGEMENT.
   Unless judged by the City Engineer to be exempt or granted a waiver as
outlined in sections §§
52.057 and
52.062, the following performance criteria shall be addressed for stormwater
management at all sites:
   (A)   All site designs shall establish stormwater management practices to
control the peak flow rates of stormwater discharge associated with specified
design storms and reduce stormwater runoff. These practices should seek to
utilize pervious areas for stormwater treatment and to infiltrate stormwater
runoff from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots, and landscaped areas
to the maximum extent practical to provide treatment for both water quality and
quantity.
   (B)   All stormwater runoff generated from new development shall not
discharge untreated stormwater directly into a jurisdictional wetland or local
water body without adequate treatment. Where such discharges are proposed, the
impact of the proposal on wetland functional values shall be assessed using a
method acceptable to the County of Wayne. In no case shall the impact on
functional values be any less than allowed by the Army Corp of Engineers (ACE)
or the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy.
   (C)   Annual groundwater recharge rates shall be maintained by promoting
infiltration through the use of structural and non-structural methods. At a
minimum, annual recharge from the post development site shall mimic the annual
recharge from pre-development site conditions.
   (D)   For all development, structural stormwater treatment practices shall
be designed to remove 80% of the average annual post development total
suspended solids load (TSS). It is presumed that a STP complies with this
performance standard if it is:
      (1)   Sized to capture the prescribed water quality volume (WQv), and
designed according to the specific performance criteria required by the Wayne
County Stormwater Program;
      (2)   Constructed properly; and
      (3)   Maintained regularly.
   (E)   For all development, to protect stream channels from degradation,
stormwater management practices shall be designed to meet the specific channel
protection criterion required by the Wayne County Stormwater Program.
   (F)   Stormwater discharges to critical areas with sensitive resources
(e.g., cold water fisheries, shellfish beds, swimming beaches, recharge areas,
water supply reservoirs) may be subject to additional performance criteria, or
may need to utilize or restrict certain stormwater management practices.
   (G)   Certain industrial sites are required to prepare and implement a
stormwater pollution prevention plan, and shall file a notice of intent (NOI)
under the provisions of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) general permit. The stormwater pollution prevention plan requirement
applies to both existing and new industrial sites.
   (H)   Stormwater discharges from land uses or activities with higher
potential pollutant loadings, known as "hotspots," may require the use of
specific structural STPs and pollution prevention practices.
   (I)   Prior to design, applicants are required to consult with the Wayne
County Construction Permits office to determine if they are subject to
additional stormwater design requirements.
   (J)   The calculations for determining peak flows as found in the Wayne
County Stormwater Program shall be used for sizing all stormwater management
practices.

specific storm frequency storage volumes as identified in the Wayne County
Stormwater Program are met, unless the City Engineer grants the applicant a
waiver or the applicant is exempt from such requirements as outlined in §§
52.057 and
52.062.
      (2)   In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions warrant
greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the
City of Wyandotte reserves the right to impose any and all additional
requirements deemed necessary to control the volume, timing, and rate of
runoff.
   (B)   Site design feasibility.
      (1)   Stormwater management practices for a site shall be chosen based on
the physical conditions of the site.
      (2)   Among the factors that should be considered:
         (a)   Topography;
         (b)   Maximum drainage area;
         (c)   Depth to water table;
         (d)   Soils;
         (e)   Slopes;
         (f)   Terrain;
         (g)   Head; and
         (h)   Location in relation to environmentally sensitive features or
ultra-urban areas.
      (3)   Applicants shall consult the Wayne County Stormwater Program for
guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting a
stormwater management practice.
   (C)   Conveyance issues.
      (1)   All stormwater management practices shall be designed to convey
stormwater to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants and reduction in flow
velocities. This shall include, but not be limited to:
         (a)   Maximizing of flow paths from inflow points to outflow points;
         (b)   Protection of inlet and outfall structures;
         (c)   Elimination of erosive flow velocities; and
         (d)   Providing of underdrain systems, where applicable.
      (2)   The Wayne County Stormwater Program shall provide detailed guidance
on the requirements for conveyance for each of the approved stormwater
management practices.
   (D)   Pretreatment requirements. Every stormwater treatment practice shall
have an acceptable form of water quality pretreatment, in accordance with the
pretreatment requirements found in Wayne County Stormwater Program. Certain
stormwater treatment practices, as specified in the Wayne County Stormwater
Program, are prohibited even with pretreatment, in the following circumstances:
      (1)   Stormwater is generated from highly contaminated source areas known
as "hotspots."
      (2)   Stormwater is carried in a conveyance system that also carries
contaminated, non- stormwater discharges.
      (3)   Stormwater is being managed in a designated groundwater recharge
area.
      (4)   Certain geologic conditions exist (e.g., karst) that prohibit the
proper pretreatment of stormwater.
   (E)   Treatment/geometry conditions. All stormwater management practices
shall be designed to capture and treat stormwater runoff according to the
specifications outlined in the Wayne County Stormwater Standards Manual. These
specifications will designate the water quantity and quality treatment criteria
that apply to an approved stormwater management practice.
   (F)   Landscaping plans required. All stormwater management practices must
have a landscaping plan detailing both the vegetation to be in the plan and how
and who will manage and maintain this vegetation. This plan must be prepared by
a registered landscape architect or soil conservation professional.
   (G)   Maintenance agreements. All stormwater treatment practices shall have
an enforceable operation and maintenance agreement to ensure the system
functions as designed. This agreement will include any and all maintenance
easements required to access and inspect the stormwater treatment practices,
and to perform routine maintenance as necessary to ensure proper functioning of
the stormwater treatment practice. In addition, a legally binding covenant
specifying the parties responsible for the proper maintenance of all stormwater
treatment practices shall be secured prior to issuance of any permits for land
disturbance activities.

§ 52.067 MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR OF STORMWATER FACILITIES.
   (A)   Maintenance easement. Prior to the issuance of any permit that has a
stormwater management facility as one of the requirements of the permit, the
applicant or owner of the site must execute a maintenance easement agreement
that shall be binding on all subsequent owners of land served by the stormwater
management facility. The agreement shall provide for access to the facility at
reasonable times for periodic inspection by the City Engineer, or agent, and
for regular or special assessments of property owners to ensure that the
facility is maintained in proper working condition to meet design standards and
any other provisions established by this subchapter. The easement agreement
shall be recorded by the land owner with the Wayne County Register of Deeds.
   (B)   Maintenance covenants. Maintenance of all stormwater management
facilities shall be ensured through the creation of a formal maintenance
covenant that must be approved by the city and recorded by the landowner with
the Wayne County Register of Deeds prior to final plan approval. As part of the
covenant, a schedule shall be developed for when and how often maintenance will
occur to ensure proper function of the stormwater management facility. The
covenant shall also include plans for periodic inspections to ensure proper
performance of the facility between scheduled cleanouts.
   (C)   Requirements for maintenance covenants. All stormwater management
facilities must undergo, at the minimum, an annual inspection to document
maintenance and repair needs and ensure compliance with the requirements of
this subchapter and accomplishment of its purposes. These needs may include:
removal of silt, litter and other debris from all catch basins, inlets and
drainage pipes, grass cutting and vegetation removal, and necessary replacement
of landscape vegetation. Any maintenance needs found must be addressed in a
timely manner, as determined by the City Engineer, and the inspection and
maintenance requirement may be increased as deemed necessary to ensure proper
functioning of the stormwater management facility.
   (D)   Inspection of stormwater facilities. Inspection programs may be
established on any reasonable basis, including but not limited to: routine
inspections; random inspections; inspections based upon complaints or other
notice of possible violations; inspection of drainage basins or areas
identified as higher than typical sources of sediment or other contaminants or
pollutants; inspections of businesses or industries of a type associated with
higher than usual discharges of contaminants or pollutants or with discharges
of a type which are more likely than the typical discharge to cause violations
of state or federal water or sediment quality standards or the NPDES stormwater
permit; and joint inspections with other agencies inspecting under
environmental or safety laws. Inspections may include, but are not limited to:
reviewing maintenance and repair records; sampling discharges, surface water,
groundwater, and material or water in drainage control facilities; and
evaluating the condition of drainage control facilities and other stormwater
treatment practices.
   (E)   Right-of-entry for inspection. When any new drainage control facility
is installed on private property, or when any new connection is made between
private property and a public drainage control system, sanitary sewer or
combined sewer, the property owner shall grant to the City Engineer the right
to enter the property at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner for the
purpose of inspection. This includes the right to enter a property when it has
a reasonable basis to believe that a violation of this subchapter is occurring
or has occurred, and to enter when necessary for abatement of a public nuisance
or correction of a violation of this subchapter.
   (F)   Records of installation and maintenance activities. Parties
responsible for the operation and maintenance of a stormwater management
facility shall make records of the installation and of all maintenance and
repairs, and shall retain the records, and pass them on to succeeding property
owners. These records shall be made available to the City Engineer during
inspection of the facility and at other reasonable times upon request.
   (G)   Failure to maintain practices. If a responsible party fails or refuses
to meet the requirements of the maintenance covenant, the city, after
reasonable notice, may correct a violation of the design standards or
maintenance needs by performing all necessary work to place the facility in
proper working condition. In the event that the stormwater management facility
becomes a danger to public safety or public health, the City Engineer shall
notify the party responsible for maintenance of the stormwater management
facility in writing. Upon receipt of that notice, the responsible person shall
have 30 days to effect maintenance and repair of the facility in an approved
manner. After proper notice, the city may assess the owner(s) of the facility
for the cost of repair work and any penalties, and the cost of the work shall
be a lien on the property, or prorated against the beneficial users of the
property, and may be placed on the tax bill and collected as ordinary taxes by
the county.
§ 52.068 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Violations. Any development activity that is commenced or is conducted
contrary to this subchapter may be restrained by injunction or otherwise abated
in a manner provided by law.
   (B)   Notice of violation. When the City Engineer determines that an
activity is not being carried out in accordance with the requirements of this
subchapter, it shall issue a written notice of violation to the owner of the
property. The notice of violation shall contain:
      (1)   The name and address of the owner or applicant;
      (2)   The address when available or a description of the building,
structure or land upon which the violation is occurring;

the municipality by filing a written notice of appeal within 15 days of service
of notice of violation.
   (C)   Stop work orders. Persons receiving a notice of violation will be
required to halt all construction activities. This "stop work order" will be in
effect until the City Engineer confirms that the development activity is in
compliance and the violation has been satisfactorily addressed. Failure to
address a notice of violation in a timely manner can result in civil, criminal,
or monetary penalties in accordance with the enforcement measures authorized in
this chapter.
   (D)   Restoration of lands. Any violator may be required to restore land to
its undisturbed condition. In the event that restoration is not undertaken
within a reasonable time after notice, the City Engineer may take necessary
corrective action, the cost of which shall become a lien upon the property
until paid.
   (E)   Holds on occupation permits. Occupation permits will not be granted
until corrections to all stormwater practices have been made and accepted by

vehicle identification numbers or because a check with the records of the
secretary of state does not reveal ownership, the police department may sell
the vehicle at public sale pursuant to section 2.5f not less than thirty (30)
days after public notice of the sale has been published.

the person’s ability to operate a motor vehicle was visibly impaired at the
time of the violation.
      (16)    A special verdict described in subsection (14) and (15) is not
required if a jury is instructed to make a finding solely as to either of the
following:
         (a)    Whether the defendant was under the influence of a controlled
substance or a combination of intoxicating liquor and a controlled substance at
the time of the violation.
         (b)    Whether the defendant was visibly impaired due to his or her
consumption of a controlled substance or a combination of intoxicating liquor
and a controlled substance at the time of violation.
         (17)    If a jury or court finds under subsection (14), (15) or (16)
that the defendant operated a motor vehicle under the influence of or while
impaired due to the consumption of a controlled substance or a combination of a
controlled substance and an intoxicating liquor, the court shall do both of the
following:
         (a)    Report the finding to the secretary of state.
         (b)    On a form or forms prescribed by the state court administrator,
forward to the department of state police a record that specifies the penalties
imposed by the court, including any term of imprisonment, and any sanction
imposed under section 5.15n or section 5.62b of this ordinance.
      (18)    Except as otherwise provided by law, a record described in
subsection (17)(b) is a public record and the department of state police shall
retain the information contained on that record for not less than seven (7)
years.
      (19)    In a prosecution for a violation of subsection (4), the defendant
bears the burden of proving that the consumption of intoxicating liquor was a
part of a generally recognized religious service or ceremony by a preponderance
of the evidence.
      (20)    Subject to subsection (22) as used in this section, “prior
conviction” means a conviction for any of the following, whether under a law of
this state, a local ordinance substantially corresponding to a law of this
state, or a law of another state substantially corresponding to a law of this
state:
         (a)    Except as provided in subsection (21), a violation or attempted
violation of MCL 257.625(1), (3), (4), (5), (6), or (7), section 625m, former
section 625(1) or (2), or former section 625b.
         (b)    Negligent homicide, manslaughter, or murder resulting from the
operation of a vehicle or an attempt to commit any of those crimes.
      (21)    Except for purposes of the enhancement described in subsection
(9)(b), only one (1) violation or attempted violation of MCL 257.625(6), a
local ordinance substantially corresponding to subsection (6), or a law of
another state substantially corresponding to subsection (6) may be used as a
prior conviction.
      (22)    If two (2) or more convictions described in subsection (20) are
convictions for violations arising out of the same transaction, only one (1)
conviction shall be used to determine whether the person has a prior
conviction.
   (S)   Section 5.15a. shall be amended as follows
      Sec. 5.15a. Driving under influence of intoxicating liquor or controlled
substance; warrantless arrests; preliminary chemical breath analysis,
administration; evidence, presumptions.
      (1)    A peace officer may arrest a person without a warrant under either
of the following circumstances:
         (a)    The peace officer has reasonable cause to believe the person
was, at the time of an accident in this city, the operator of a vehicle
involved in the accident and was operating the vehicle in violation of section
(1) of this ordinance.
         (b)    The person is found in the driver’s seat of a vehicle parked or
stopped on a highway or street within this city if any part of the vehicle
intrudes into the roadway and the peace officer has reasonable cause to believe
the person was operating the vehicle in violation of section 5.15 of this
ordinance.
      (2)    A peace officer who has reasonable cause to believe that a person
was operating a vehicle upon a public highway or other place open to the public
or generally accessible to motor vehicles, including an area designated for the
parking of vehicles, within this city and that the person by the consumption of
intoxicating liquor may have affected his or her ability to operate a vehicle,
or reasonable cause to believe that a person was operating a commercial motor
vehicle within the city while the person’s blood, breath, or urine contained
any measurable amount of alcohol or while the person had any detectable
presence of intoxicating liquor, or reasonable cause to believe that a person
who is less than twenty-one (21) years of age was operating a vehicle upon a
public highway or other place open to the public or generally accessible to
motor vehicles, including an area designated for the parking of vehicles,
within this city while the person had any bodily alcohol content as that term
is defined in section 5.15(4) of this ordinance may require the person to
submit to a preliminary chemical breath analysis. The following provisions
apply with respect to a preliminary chemical breath analysis administered under
this subsection:
         (a)    A peace officer may arrest a person based in whole or in part
upon the results of a preliminary chemical breath analysis.
         (b)    The results of a preliminary chemical breath analysis are
admissible in a criminal prosecution for a crime enumerated in section 5.15c of
this ordinance or in an administrative hearing for one (1) or more of the
following purposes:
            (i)    To assist the court or hearing officer in determining a
challenge to the validity of an arrest. This subparagraph does not limit the
introduction of other competent evidence offered to establish the validity of
an arrest.
            (ii)    As evidence of the defendant’s breath alcohol content, if
offered by the defendant to rebut testimony elicited on cross-examination of a
defense witness that the defendant’s breath alcohol content was higher at the
time of the charged offense than when a chemical test was administered under
subsection (6).
            (iii)    As evidence of the defendant’s breath alcohol content, if
offered by the prosecution to rebut testimony elicited on cross-examination of
a prosecution witness that the defendant’s breath alcohol content was lower at
the time of the charged offense than when a chemical test was administered
under subsection (6).
         (c)    A person who submits to a preliminary chemical breath analysis
remains subject to the requirements of sections (4), (5), (6), and (7) of this
ordinance for purposes of chemical tests described in those sections.
         (d)    Except as provided in subsection (5), a person who refuses to
submit to a preliminary chemical breath analysis upon a lawful request by a
peace officer is responsible for a civil infraction.
      (3)    A peace officer shall use the results of a preliminary chemical
breath analysis conducted pursuant to this section to determine whether to
order a person out-of-service under section 319d. A peace officer shall order
out-of-service as required under section 319d a person who was operating a
commercial motor vehicle and who refuses to submit to a preliminary chemical
breath analysis as provided in this section. This section does not limit use of
other competent evidence by the peace officer to determine whether to order a
person out-of-service under section 319d.
      (4)    A person who was operating a commercial motor vehicle and who is
requested to submit to a preliminary chemical breath analysis under this
section shall be advised that refusing a peace officer’s request to take a test
described in this section is a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not
more that ninety-three (93) days or a fine of not more than one hundred dollars
($100.00), or both, and will result in the issuance of a 24-hour out-of-service
order.
      (5)    A person who was operating a commercial motor vehicle and who
refuses to submit to a preliminary chemical breath analysis upon a peace
officer’s lawful request is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment
for not more than ninety-three (93) days or a fine of not more than one hundred
dollars ($100.00), or both.
      (6)    The following provisions apply with respect to chemical tests and
analysis of a person’s blood, urine, or breath, other than preliminary chemical
breath analysis:
         (a)    The amount of alcohol or presence of a controlled substance or
both in a driver’s blood or urine or the amount of alcohol in a person’s breath
at the time alleged as shown by chemical analysis of the person’s blood, urine,
or breath is admissible into evidence in any civil or criminal proceeding.
         (b)    A person arrested for a crime described in section 5.15c(1) of
this ordinance shall be advised of all of the following:
            (i)    If he or she takes a chemical test of his or her blood,
urine, or breath administered at the request of a peace officer, he or she has
the right to demand that a person of his or her own choosing administer one (1)
of the chemical tests.
            (ii)    The results of the test are admissible in a judicial
proceeding as provided under this ordinance and will be considered with other
admissible evidence in determining the defendant’s innocence or guilt.
            (iii)    He or she is responsible for obtaining a chemical analysis
of a test sample obtained pursuant to his or her own request.
            (iv)    If he or she refuses the request of a peace officer to take
a test described in subparagraph (i), a test shall not be given without a court
order, but the peace officer may seek to obtain a court order.
            (v)    Refusing a peace officer’s request to take a test described
in subparagraph (i) will result in the suspension of his or her operator’s or
chauffeur’s license and vehicle group designation or operating privilege and in
the addition of six (6) points to his or her driver record.
         (c)    A sample or specimen of urine or breath shall be taken and
collected in a reasonable manner. Only a licensed physician, or an individual
operating under the delegation of a licensed physician under section 16215 of
the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.16215, qualified to withdraw blood
and acting in a medical environment, may withdraw blood at a peace officer’s
request to determine the amount of alcohol or presence of a controlled
substance or both in the person’s blood, as provided in this subsection.
Liability for a crime or civil damages predicated on the act of withdrawing or
analyzing blood and related procedures does not attach to a licensed physician
or individual operating under the delegation of a licensed physician who
withdraws or analyzes blood or assists in the withdrawal or analysis in
accordance with this ordinance unless the withdrawal or analysis is performed
in a negligent manner.
         (d)    A chemical test described in this subsection shall be
administered at the request of a peace officer having reasonable grounds to
believe the person has committed a crime described in section 5.15c(1) of this
ordinance. A person who takes a chemical test administered at a peace officer’s
request as provided in this section shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
have a person of his or her own choosing administer one (1) of the chemical
tests described in this subsection within a reasonable time after his or her
detention. The test results are admissible and shall be considered with other
admissible evidence in determining the defendant’s innocence or guilt. If the
person charged is administered a chemical test by a person of his or her
choosing, the person charged is responsible for obtaining a chemical analysis
of the test sample.
         (e)    If, after an accident, the driver of a vehicle involved in the
accident is transported to a medical facility and a sample of the driver’s
blood is withdrawn at that time for medical treatment, the results of a
chemical analysis of that sample are admissible in any civil or criminal
proceeding to show the amount of alcohol or presence of a controlled substance
or both in the person’s blood at the time alleged, regardless of whether the
person had been offered or had refused a chemical test. The medical facility or
person performing the chemical analysis shall disclose the results of the
analysis to a prosecuting attorney who requests the results for use in a
criminal prosecution as provided in this subdivision. A medical facility or
person disclosing information in compliance with this subsection is not civilly
or criminally liable for making the disclosure.
         (f)    If, after an accident, the driver of a vehicle involved in the
accident is deceased, a sample of the decedent’s blood shall be withdrawn in a
manner directed by the medical examiner to determine the amount of alcohol or
the presence of a controlled substance, or both, in the decedent’s blood. The
medical examiner shall give the results of the chemical analysis of the sample
to the law enforcement agency investigating the accident and that agency shall
forward the results to the department of state police.
         (g)    The department of state police shall promulgate uniform rules
in compliance with the Administrative Procedures Act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL
24.201 to 24.328, for the administration of chemical tests for the purposes of
this section. An instrument used for a preliminary chemical breath analysis may
be used for a chemical test described in this subsection if approved under
rules promulgated by the department of state police.
      (7)    The provisions of subsection (6) relating to chemical testing do
not limit the introduction of any other admissible evidence bearing upon the
question of whether a person was impaired by, or under the influence of,
intoxicating liquor or a controlled substance, or a combination of intoxicating
liquor and a controlled substance, or whether the person had an alcohol content
of 0.10 grams or more per one hundred (100) milliliters of blood, per two
hundred ten (210) liters of breath, or per sixty-seven (67) milliliters of
urine, or if the person is less than twenty-one (21) years of age, whether the
person had any bodily alcohol content within his or her body. As used in this
section, “any bodily alcohol content” means either of the following:
         (a)    An alcohol content of not less than 0.02 grams or more than
0.07 grams per one hundred (100) milliliters of blood, per two hundred ten
(210) liters of breath, or per sixty-seven (67) milliliters of urine.
         (b)    Any presence of alcohol within a person’s body resulting from
the consumption of intoxicating liquor, other than consumption of intoxicating
liquor as a part of a generally recognized religious service or ceremony.
      (8)    If a chemical test described in subsection (6) is administered,
the test results shall be made available to the person charged or the person’s
attorney upon written request to the prosecution, with a copy of the request
filed with the court. The prosecution shall furnish the results at least two
(2) days before the day of the trial. The prosecution shall offer the test
results as evidence in that trial. Failure to fully comply with the request
bars the admission of the results into evidence by the prosecution.
      (9)    Except in a prosecution relating solely to a violation of section
(1)(b) or 5.15(4) of this ordinance the amount of alcohol in the driver’s
blood, breath, or urine at the time alleged as shown by the chemical analysis
of the person’s blood, breath, or urine gives rise to the following
presumptions:
         (a)    If there were at the time 0.07 grams or less of alcohol per one
hundred (100) milliliters of the defendant’s blood, per two hundred ten (210)
liters of the defendant’s breath, or per sixty-seven (67) milliliters of the
defendant’s urine, it is presumed that the defendant’s ability to operate a
motor vehicle was not impaired due to the consumption of intoxicating liquor
and that the defendant was not under the influence of intoxicating liquor.
         (b)    If there were at the time more than 0.07 grams but less than
0.10 grams of alcohol per one hundred (100) milliliters of the defendant’s
blood, per two hundred ten (210) liters of the defendant’s breath, or per
sixty-seven (67) milliliters of the defendant’s urine, it is presumed that the
defendant’s ability to operate a vehicle was impaired within the provisions of
section 5.15(3) of this ordinance due to the consumption of intoxicating
liquor.
         (c)    If there were at the time 0.10 grams or more of alcohol per one
hundred (100) milliliters of the defendant’s blood, per two hundred ten (210)
liters of the breath, or per sixty-seven (67) milliliters of the defendant’s
urine, it is presumed that the defendant was under the influence of
intoxicating liquor.
      (10) A person’s refusal to submit to a chemical test as provided in
subsection (6) is admissible in a criminal prosecution for a crime described in
section 5.15c(1) of this ordinance only to show that a test was offered to the
defendant, but not as evidence in determining the defendant’s innocence or
guilt. The jury shall be instructed accordingly.
   (T)   Section 5.15b. shall be amended as follows:
      Sec. 5.15b. Misdemeanor violations, arraignment; pretrial conference;
time limits, exceptions; adjudication, dismissal; sentencing, screening and
assessment.
      (1)    A person arrested for a misdemeanor violation of section 5.15(1),
(3), or (4) or section 5.15m of this ordinance shall be arraigned on the
citation, complaint, or warrant not more than fourteen (14) days after the
arrest for the violation or, if an arrest warrant is issued or reissued, not
more than fourteen (14) days after the issued or reissued arrest warrant is
served, whichever is later. The court shall not dismiss a case or impose any
other sanction for a failure to comply with this time limit. The time limit
does not apply to a violation joined with a felony charge.
      (2)    The court shall schedule a pretrial conference between the
prosecuting attorney, the defendant, and the defendant’s attorney in each case
in which the defendant is charged with a misdemeanor violation of section 5.15
(1), (3), (4), or section 5.15m. The pretrial conference shall be held not more
than thirty-five (35) days after the person’s arrest for the violation or, if
an arrest warrant is served, whichever is later. If the court has only one (1)
judge who sits in more than one (1) location in that district, the pretrial
conference shall be held not more than forty-two (42) days after the person’s
arrest for the violation or, if an arrest warrant is issued or reissued, not
more than forty-two (42) days after the date the issued or reissued arrest
warrant is served, whichever is later. The court shall not dismiss a case or
impose any other sanction for a failure to comply with the applicable time
limit. The 35- and 42-day time limits do not apply to a violation joined with a
felony charge. The court shall order the defendant to attend the pretrial
conference and may accept a plea by the defendant at the conclusion of the
pretrial conference. The court may adjourn the pretrial conference upon the
motion of a party for good cause shown. Not more than one (1) adjournment shall
be granted to a party, and the length of an adjournment shall not exceed
fourteen (14) days.
      (3)    Except for delay attributable to the unavailability of the
defendant, a witness, or material evidence or due to an interlocutory appeal or
exceptional circumstances, but not a delay caused by docket congestion, the
court shall finally adjudicate, by a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, entry
of a verdict, or other final disposition, a case in which the defendant is
charged with a misdemeanor violation of section 5.15(1), (3), (4) or section
5.15m of this ordinance within seventy-seven (77) days after the person is
arrested for the violation or, if an arrest warrant is issued or reissued, not
more that seventy-seven (77) days after the date the issued or reissued arrest
warrant is served, whichever is later. The court shall not dismiss a case or
impose any other sanction for a failure to comply with this time limit. The 77-
day time limit does not apply to a violation joined with a felony charge.
      (4)    Before accepting a plea of guilty or nolo contendere under section
5.15(1), (2), (3), or (4) of this ordinance the court shall advise the accused
of the maximum possible term of imprisonment and the maximum possible fine that
may be imposed for the violation and shall advise the defendant that the
maximum possible license sanctions that my be imposed will be based upon the
master driving record maintained by the secretary of state under section 204a.
      (5)    Before imposing sentence for a violation of section 5.15(1), (3),
(4), of this ordinance, the court shall order the person to undergo screening
and assessment by a person or agency designated by the office of substance
abuse services to determine whether the person is likely to benefit from
rehabilitative services, including alcohol or drug education and alcohol or
drug treatment programs. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the
court may order the person to participate in and successfully complete one (1)
or more appropriate rehabilitative programs as part of the sentence. If the
person has one (1) or more prior convictions, the court shall order the person
to participate in and successfully complete one (1) or more appropriate
rehabilitative programs as part of the sentence. The person shall pay for the
costs of the screening, assessment, and rehabilitative services.
      (6)    If the judgment and sentence are appealed to circuit court, the
court may ex parte order the secretary of state to stay the suspension,
revocation, or restricted license issued by the secretary of state pending the
outcome of the appeal.
   (U)   Section 5.15c. shall be amended to read as follows:
      Sec.5.15c. Consent to chemical tests; exceptions; administration of
tests.
      (1)    A person who operates a vehicle upon a public highway or other
place open to the general public or generally accessible to motor vehicles,
including an area designated for the parking of vehicles, within this city is
considered to have given consent to chemical tests of his or her blood, breath,
or urine for the purpose of determining the amount of alcohol or presence of a
controlled substance or both in his or her blood or urine or the amount of
alcohol in his or her breath in all of the following circumstances:
         (a)    If the person is arrested for a violation of section 5.15(1),
(3), (4), (5) of this ordinance or section 5.15a(5) of this ordinance or
section 5.15m of this ordinance.
         (b)    If the person is arrested for felonious driving, negligent
homicide, manslaughter, or murder resulting from the operation of a motor
vehicle, and the peace officer had reasonable grounds to believe the person was
operating the vehicle while impaired by or under the influence of intoxicating
liquor or a controlled substance or a combination of intoxicating liquor and a
controlled substance, or while having an alcohol content of 0.10 grams or more
per one hundred (100) milliliters of blood, per two hundred ten (210) liters of
breath, or per sixty-seven (67) milliliters of urine, or if the person is less
that twenty-one (21) years of age while having any bodily alcohol content. As
used in this subdivision, “any bodily alcohol content” means either of the
following:
            (i)    An alcohol content of not less than 0.02 grams or more than
0.07 grams per one hundred (100) milliliters of blood, per two hundred ten
(210) liters of breath, or per sixty-seven (67) milliliters of urine.

intoxicating liquor as part of a generally recognized religious service or
ceremony.
      (2)    A person who is afflicted with hemophilia, diabetes, or a
condition requiring the use of an anticoagulant under the direction of a
physician is not considered to have given consent to the withdrawal of blood.
      (3)    The tests shall be administered as provided in section 5.15a(6) of
this ordinance.
   (V)   Section 5.15d. shall be amended to read as follows:

chemical test offered pursuant to section 5.15a(6) of this ordinance, a test
shall not be given without a court order, but the officer may seek to obtain
the court order.
      (2)    A written report shall immediately be forwarded to the secretary
of state by the peace officer. The report shall state that the officer had
reasonable grounds to believe that the person had committed a crime described

license or permit to drive. The notice shall also state that there is not a
requirement that the person retain counsel for the hearing, though counsel
would be permitted to represent the person at the hearing.

the official record of the proceedings. Proceedings at which evidence was
presented need not be transcribed and transmitted if the sole reason for review
is to determine whether the court will order the issuance of a restricted
license. The parties to the proceedings for judicial review may stipulate that
the record be shortened. A party unreasonably refusing to stipulate to a
shortened record may be taxed by the court in which the petition is filed for
the additional costs. The court may permit subsequent corrections to the
record.

the secretary of state.
         (b)    Except as provided in subsection (2), immediately do all of the

peace officer who requested the person to submit to the test shall comply with
subsection (1)(a) pending receipt of the test report. If the report reveals an
unlawful alcohol content, the peace officer who requested the person to submit
to the test shall immediately comply with subsection (1)(b). If the report does

the person are dismissed, the person pleads guilty or nolo contendere to or is
found guilty of or acquitted of those charges, or the person’s license or
permit is suspended pursuant to section 5.15f of this ordinance, whichever
occurs earlier.
      (4)    As used in this section, “unlawful alcohol content” means any of
the following, as applicable:

section 625(6) may be used as a prior conviction.
      (8)    If two (2) or more convictions described in subsection (6) are
convictions for violations arising out of the same transaction, only one (1)
conviction shall be used to determine whether the person has a prior
conviction.

violation of section 5.15(3) of this ordinance as described in section 5.15(6)
(b) of this ordinance, a violation of section 5.15(3) of this ordinance
described in section 5.15(8)(b) of this ordinance, or a violation of 904(4) or
(5) (felony), may require one (1) of the following with regard to the vehicle
used in the offense if the defendant owns the vehicle in whole or in part or
leases the vehicle:
         (a)    Forfeiture of the vehicle if the defendant owns the vehicle in
whole or in part.
         (b)    Return of the vehicle to the lessor if the defendant leases the
vehicle.
      (2)    The vehicle may be seized pursuant to an order of seizure issued
by the court having jurisdiction upon a showing of probable cause that the
vehicle is subject to forfeiture or return to the lessor.
      (3)    The forfeiture of a vehicle is subject to the interest of the
holder of a security interest who did not have prior knowledge of or consent to
the violation.
      (4)    Within fourteen (14) days after the defendant’s conviction for a
violation described in subsection (1), the prosecuting attorney may file a
petition with the court for the forfeiture of the vehicle or to have the court
order return of a leased vehicle to the lessor. The prosecuting attorney shall
give notice by first-class mail or other process to the defendant and his or
her attorney, to all owners of the vehicle, and to any person holding a
security interest in the vehicle that the court may require forfeiture or
return of the vehicle.
      (5)    If a vehicle is seized before disposition of the criminal
proceedings, a defendant who is an owner or lessee of the vehicle may move the
court having jurisdiction over the proceedings to require the seizing agency to
file a lien against the vehicle and to return the vehicle to the owner or
lessee pending disposition of the criminal proceedings. The court shall hear
the motion within seven (7) days after the motion is filed. If the defendant
establishes at the hearing that he or she holds the legal title to the vehicle
or that he or she has a leasehold interest and that it is necessary for him or
her or a member of his or her family to use the vehicle pending the outcome of
the forfeiture action, the court may order the seizing agency to return the
vehicle to the owner of lessee. If the court orders the return of the vehicle
to the owner or lessee, the court shall order the defendant to post a bond in
an amount equal to the retail value of the vehicle, and shall also order the
seizing agency to file a lien against the vehicle.
      (6)    Within fourteen (14) days after notice by the prosecuting attorney
is given under subsection (4), the defendant, an owner, lessee, or holder of a
security interest may file a claim of interest in the vehicle with the court.
Within twenty-one (21) days after the expiration of the period for filing
claims, but before or at sentencing, the court shall hold a hearing to
determine the legitimacy of any claim, the extent of any co-owner’s equity
interest, the liability of the defendant to any co-lessee, and whether to order
the vehicle forfeited or returned to the lessor. In considering whether to
order forfeiture, the court shall review the defendant’s driving record to
determine whether the defendant has multiple convictions under section 625 or a
local ordinance substantially corresponding to section 625, or this ordinance,
or multiple suspensions, restrictions, or denials under section 904, or both,
or section 5.62a of this ordinance. If the defendant has multiple convictions
under section 625 or this ordinance or multiple suspensions, restrictions, or
denials under section 904, or section 5.62a of this ordinance, or both, that
factor shall weigh heavily in favor of forfeiture.
      (7)    If a vehicle is forfeited under this section, the unit of
government that seized the vehicle shall sell the vehicle and dispose of the
proceeds in the following order of priority:
         (a)    Pay any outstanding security interest of a secured party who
did not have prior knowledge of or consent to the commission of the violation.
         (b)   Pay the equity interest of a co-owner who did not have prior
knowledge of or consent to the commission of the violation.
         (c)    Satisfy any order of restitution entered in the prosecution for
the violation.
         (d)    Pay the claim of each person who shows that he or she is a
victim of the violation to the extent that the claim is not covered by an order
of restitution.
         (e)    Pay any outstanding lien against the property that has been
imposed by a governmental unit and any cost recovery owing to the city under
the city ordinance.
         (f)    Pay the proper expenses of the proceedings for forfeiture and
sale, and storage, including, but not limited to, expenses incurred during the
seizure process and expenses for maintaining custody of the property,
advertising, and court costs.
         (g)    The balance remaining after the payment of items (a) through
(f) shall be distributed by the court having jurisdiction over the forfeiture
proceedings to the unit or units of government substantially involved in
effecting the forfeiture. Seventy-five (75) percent of the money received by a
unit of government under this subdivision shall be used to enhance enforcement
of the criminal laws and twenty-five (25) percent of the money shall be used to
implement the Crime Victim’s Rights Act. 1985 PA 87, MCL 780.751 to 780.834. A
unit of government receiving money under this subdivision shall report annually
to the department of management and budget the amount of money received under
this subdivision that was used to enhance enforcement of the criminal laws and
the amount that was used to implement the Crime Victim’s Rights Act. 1985 PA
87, MCL 780.751 to 780.834.
      (8)    The court may order the defendant to pay to a co-lessee any
liability determined under subsection (6). The order may be enforced in the
same manner as a civil judgment.
      (9)    The return of a vehicle to the lessor under this section does not
affect or impair the lessor’s rights or the defendant’s obligations under the
lease.
      (10)    A person who knowingly conceals, sells, gives away, or otherwise
transfers or disposes of a vehicle with the intent to avoid forfeiture or
return of the vehicle to the lessor under this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than ninety-three (93) days
or a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), or both.
      (11)    The failure of the court or prosecutor to comply with any time
limit specified in this section does not preclude the court from ordering
forfeiture of a vehicle or its return to a lessor, unless the court finds that
the owner or claimant suffered substantial prejudice as a result of that
failure.
      (12)    The forfeiture provisions of this section do not preclude the
prosecuting attorney from pursuing a forfeiture proceeding under any other law
of this state or a local ordinance substantially corresponding to this section.

         (c)   Pickup truck.
      (2)   Such parking and storage of said vehicles (other than as permitted
in the driveway area of the premises) may not be between the front lot line and
nearest line of any residential building on said lot. Any vehicle under this
section may only be parked or stored on a hard surface (such as concrete,
blacktop or other comparable surfaces, but not gravel).
   (D)   (1)   No more than two of the following type vehicles may be parked
and/or stored in permitted areas on residential lots and they shall not be
subject to the length, height and width limits set forth in this section:

      (2)   Such parking and storage of said vehicles is allowed only in a rear
yard. The rear yard shall be as defined in
Ch. 159 of this code of ordinances and is an open space extending the full
width of the lot, the depth of which is the minimum horizontal distance between

this section may only be parked or stored on a hard surface (such as concrete,
blacktop or other comparable surfaces, but not gravel). Any other vehicle not
described above must be housed in a garage when not in use.
      (3)   The city may grant a variance from the requirements of this
division (D) as follows:
         (a)   If a property owner or occupier of the property upon receiving
notice from the city as set forth in the section entitled “enforcement”
believes he or she cannot comply with the requirements of this section, an
application in writing shall be made with the City Engineer’s office within 21
days of receiving the notice from the city. The application shall include the
required application fee and be supplemented with a drawing of the lot in
question showing the lot dimensions and all setbacks from the neighboring
property lines to aid the Zoning Board panel described in division (D)(3)(b)
below in the analysis of the requested variance. The application fee shall be
$50 and this may be adjusted from time to time by Council resolution.
         (b)   The request for a variance, for purposes of this division (D)
only, shall be reviewed by a panel consisting of three or more members from the
Zoning Board of Appeals and, when acting in this capacity, shall be referred to
as the “Appeal Board”. Notice of a public hearing to consider the variance
shall be sent to the immediate neighboring property owners on each side of the
lot in question (including the rear lot neighbor) and to any other neighboring
lot owner that the Engineer’s office finds that the front or side yard view of
the property owner may be adversely affected.
         (c)   Following the public hearing, the Zoning Board panel shall
decide the best location for the parking and storage of the recreational
vehicle, in accordance with the standards below. The Zoning Board panel in
making its decision shall consider the purpose of this division (D) and may
establish requirements or conditions that will secure substantially the
objectives and requirements of this division (D). The Zoning Board panel shall
state the reasons for its finding or decision.
         (d)   The decision on a variance request shall be based on a finding
that practical difficulties result from compliance with specific provisions of
this division (D). In making its finding, the Zoning Board panel shall take
into account the lot configuration where the vehicle is to be parked and
stored, the proximity of neighboring residential homes and how their front or
side yard view may be obstructed by the vehicle, the objections, if any, of the
adjacent property owners, and whether the vehicle has been parked and/or stored
in the location requested by the application prior to adoption of this division
(D). No variance shall be granted unless the Appeal Board panel finds that:
            1.   There are special circumstances or conditions affecting said
property such that the strict application of the provisions of this division
(D) would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of his or her land;
            2.   The variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment
of a substantial property right of the petitioner;
            3.   The vehicle in question is owned by the owner, tenant or
individual who lives at the premises in question and is not being stored for a
person who lives at a different location;
            4.   There is no other practical location on the applicant’s
property to park and store the vehicle in order to meet the purpose of this
division (D); and
            5.   The applicant had been parking or storing the vehicle at such
location at the time of the adoption of this division (D). The applicant bears
the burden of proof on this issue.
      (4)   In no instance shall a vehicle covered by this division (D) be
allowed in the front yard and no more than two of the vehicles covered by this
division (D) may be parked and/or stored on a property.
      (5)   If a complaint is received by the city by an immediate neighbor
concerning the possible violation of this division (D), it will be referred to
a code enforcement officer for inspection. If the code enforcement officer,
upon inspection, finds that the provision of this division (D) is being
violated the offending property owner and/or tenant shall be notified by letter
with a copy of this division (D) and directed to correct the situation in 21
days. If the violator fails to correct the violation or appeal to the City
Engineer’s office in a timely manner, a civil infraction shall be issued to the
violator.
   (E)   Notwithstanding anything elsewhere above in this section to the
contrary, the following vehicles are expressly prohibited from being parked on
any residential lots:
      (1)   Semi-trucks;
      (2)   Buses;
      (3)   Cube trucks/van style vehicles;
      (4)   Stake trucks;
      (5)   Wreckers;
      (6)   Dump trucks; and
      (7)   Other commercial type vehicles.
   (F)   Any permitted vehicles of the type described in divisions (C) and (D)
above owned by the property occupant may be parked or stored on the residential
lot subject to the requirements set forth above in divisions (C) and (D) above
and subject to the following conditions.
      (1)   Vehicles parked or stored shall not have fixed connections to
electricity, water, gas or sanitary sewer facilities, and at no time shall said

§ 74.021 STOPPING VEHICLES FOR WEIGHING; FINES; FAILURE TO STOP.
   (A)   A police officer having reason to believe that the weight of a vehicle
and load is unlawful may require the driver to stop and submit to a weighing of
the vehicle by either portable or stationary scales approved and sealed by the
department of agriculture as a legal weighing device, and may require that the
vehicle be driven to the nearest weighing station of the state’s Transportation
Department for the purpose of allowing an officer to determine whether the
conveyance is loaded in conformity with this subchapter.
   (B)   (1)   When the officer, upon weighing a vehicle and load determines
that the weight is unlawful, the officer may require the driver to stop the
vehicle in a suitable place and remain standing until that portion of the load
is shifted or removed as necessary to reduce the gross axle weight of the
vehicle to the limit permitted under this subchapter. All material unloaded as
provided under this division (B)(1) shall be cared for by the owner or operator
of the vehicle at the risk of the owner or operator. A judge or magistrate
imposing a civil fine and costs under this section which are not paid in full
immediately or for which a bond is not immediately posted in double the amount
of the civil fine and costs shall order the driver or owner to move the vehicle
at the driver’s own risk to a place of safekeeping within the jurisdiction of
the judge or magistrate, inform the judge or magistrate in writing of the place
of safekeeping and keep the vehicle until the fine and costs are paid or
sufficient bond is furnished or until the judge or magistrate is satisfied that
the fine and costs will be paid. The officer who has determined, after weighing
a vehicle and load, that the weight is unlawful, may require the driver to
proceed to a judge or magistrate within the city. If the judge or magistrate is
satisfied that the probable civil fine and costs will be paid by the owner or
lessee, the judge or magistrate may allow the driver to proceed, after the load
is made legal. If the judge or magistrate is not satisfied that the owner or
lessee, after a notice and a right to be heard on the merits is given, will pay
the amount of the probable civil fine and costs, the judge or magistrate may
order the vehicle to be impounded until trial on the merits is completed under
conditions set forth in this section for the impounding of vehicles after the
civil fine and costs have been imposed.
      (2)   Removal of the vehicle, and forwarding care or preservation of the
load shall be under the control of and at the risk of the owner or driver.
Vehicles impounded shall be subject to a lien, subject to a prior valid bona
fide lien of prior record, in the amount of the civil fine and costs and if the
civil fine and costs are not paid within 90 days after the seizure, the judge
or magistrate shall certify the unpaid judgment to the prosecuting attorney of
the city or county in which the violation occurred, who shall proceed to
enforce the lien by foreclosure sale in accordance with procedure authorized in
the case of chattel mortgage foreclosure.
   (C)   An owner of a vehicle or a lessee of the vehicle of an owner-operator,
or other person, who causes or allows a vehicle to be loaded and driven or
moved on a highway, when the weight of that vehicle violates §
74.018 of this chapter is responsible for a civil infraction and shall pay a
civil fine in an amount equal to $0.03 per pound for each pound of excess load
over 1,000 pounds when the excess is 2,000 pounds or less; $0.06 per pound of
excess load when the excess is over 2,000 pounds, but not more 3,000 pounds;
$0.09 per pound for each pound of excess load when the excess is over 3,000
pounds, but not over 4,000 pounds; $0.12 per pound for each pound of excess
load when the excess is over 4,000 pounds, but not over 5,000 pounds; $0.15 per
pound for each pound of excess load when the excess is over 5,000 pounds, but
not over 10,000 pounds; and $0.20 per pound for each pound of excess load when
the excess is over 10,000 pounds. However, the court shall have discretionary
power as to the amount of the civil fine within the schedule provided by this
division (C), and may impose the civil fine provided in § 907(3) of the state’s
Motor Vehicle Act (being M.C.L.A. § 257.907(3)), hereby adopted by reference,
for a civil infraction where, at the time of the violation, either the motor
vehicle, and semi-trailer or trailer did not exceed the total weight which
would be lawful for each unit by a proper distribution of the load upon the
various axles supporting each unit.
   (D)   A driver or owner of a vehicle, truck or truck tractor, truck or truck
tractor with other vehicles in combination, or special mobile equipment who
knowingly fails to stop at or who knowingly bypasses any scales or weighing
station is guilty of a misdemeanor.
   (E)   A driver or owner of a vehicle who knowingly fails to stop when
requested or ordered to do so by a police officer authorized to require the
driver to stop and submit to a weighing of the vehicle and load by means of a
portable scale, is guilty of a misdemeanor.

it is to be valid and the authority granting the permit may restrict or
prescribe conditions of operation of the vehicle or vehicles, if necessary, to
protect the safety of the public or to ensure against undue damage to the road
foundations, structures or installations, and may require a reasonable
inspection fee and other security as may be considered necessary to compensate
for damages caused by the movement. A permit may be issued on an annual basis.
   (E)   A person may transport telephone, telegraph or electric poles of a
greater length than otherwise authorized over the highways in the construction,
maintenance or repair of telephone, telegraph or electric lines, if a permit is

UNREASONABLE USE OF PROPERTY
§ 94.020 UNREASONABLE USE IN RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD.
   It is a violation of this subchapter for any person to store in a motor
vehicle, truck, trailer or any other similar type of vehicle, solid waste,
debris, yard waste, hazardous materials, scrap metal, recyclable items, old
appliances, used items, such as tires or any other type of scrap or junk or
unsightly material on any street, or driveway, or yard in a residential
neighborhood. It is hereby declared that violation of this subchapter makes the
violator responsible for a municipal civil infraction. Proof that the defendant
is the owner of any motor vehicle, truck or trailer described in the citation
creates in evidence a presumption that the vehicle’s registered owner was the
person responsible for the unreasonable use of property. If the motor vehicle,
truck or trailer involved is leased, the lessee and not the owner is presumed
to be responsible for the unlawful use; provided, the owner furnishes proof
that said vehicle or trailer was in the possession or custody of the lessee at
the time of the offense.

§ 95.017 TYPES OF CERTIFICATIONS; FEES AND TAXES; EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, the owner of a vessel
required to be numbered and to display a decal shall file an application for a
certificate of number with the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State shall
prescribe and furnish certificate of title application forms. If a vessel
requiring a certificate of title under M.C.L.A. §§ 324.80301 et seq. part 803
is sold by a dealer, that dealer shall combine the application for a
certificate of number that is signed by the vessel owner with the application
for a certificate of title. The dealer shall obtain the certificate of number
in the name of the owner. The owner of the vessel shall sign the application. A
person shall not file an application for a certificate of number that contains
false information.
   (B)   A dealer who submits an application for a certificate of number as
provided in division (A) above may issue to the owner of the vessel a 15-day
temporary permit, on forms prescribed by the Secretary of State, for the use of
the vessel while the certificate of number is being issued.
   (C)   A dealer may issue a 15-day permit, on a form prescribed by the
Secretary of State, for the use of a vessel purchased in this state and
delivered to the purchaser for removal to a place outside of this state, if the
purchaser certifies by his or her signature that the vessel will be registered
and primarily used and stored outside of the state and will not be returned to
the state by the purchaser for use or storage. A certificate of number shall
not be issued for a vessel holding a permit under this division (C).
   (D)   A 15-day temporary permit issued under divisions (B) or (C) above
shall not be renewed or extended.
   (E)   A person shall operate or permit the operation of a vessel for which a
15-day temporary permit has been issued under this section only if the
temporary permit is valid and displayed on the vessel as prescribed by rule
promulgated in the state’s Administrative Code.
   (F)   Upon receipt of an initial application for a certificate of number in
approved form and payment of the required fee, the Secretary of State shall
enter the information upon the official records and issue to the applicant a
certificate of number containing the number awarded to the vessel, the name and
address of the owner and other information that the Secretary of State
determines necessary. The Secretary of State shall issue a certificate of
number that is pocket size and legible. Except as provided in division (G)
below, a person operating a vessel shall present that vessel’s certificate of
number to a peace officer upon the peace officer’s request.
   (G)   The owner or authorized agent of the owner of a vessel less than 26
feet in length that is leased or rented to a person for non-commercial use for
not more than 24 hours may retain, at the place from which the vessel departs
or returns to the possession of the owner or the owner’s representative, the
certificate of number for that vessel if a copy of the lease or rental is on
the vessel. Upon the demand of a peace officer, the operator shall produce for
inspection either the certificate of number or a copy of the lease or rental
agreement for that vessel. The lease or rental agreement shall contain each of
the following:
      (1)   The vessel number that appears on the certificate of number;
      (2)   The period of time for which the vessel is leased or rented;
      (3)   The signature of the vessel’s owner or that person’s authorized
agent; and
      (4)   The signature of the person leasing or renting the vessel.
   (H)   Upon receipt of a certificate of number for a vessel, the owner of
that vessel shall paint on or attach in a permanent manner to each side of the
forward half of the vessel the number identified in the certificate of number,
in the manner prescribed by the rules contained in the state’s Administrative
Code. The Secretary of State shall assign to the owner of vessels for rent or
lease a block of numbers sufficient to number consecutively all of that owner’s
rental or lease vessels. The owner shall maintain the numbers in a legible
condition. A vessel documented by the United States Coast Guard or a federal
agency that is the successor to the United States Coast Guard is not required
to display numbers under this chapter, but shall display a decal indicating
payment of the fee required by law, and shall otherwise be in compliance with
this chapter. This division (H) does not apply to a non-powered vessel 12 feet
or less in length.
   (I)   Upon receipt of an application for a certificate of number in an
approved form and payment of the fee required by law, the Secretary of State
shall issue a decal that is color-coded and dated to identify the year of its
expiration and the decal shall be displayed as required by state law or
administrative rule.

owner’s address no longer conforms to the address appearing on the certificate
of number. The notice shall consist of a surrender of the certificate of
number, on which the proper information shall be noted on a place to be
provided on the certificate. When the surrender of the certificate is due to
the vessel being destroyed or abandoned, the Secretary of State shall cancel
the certificate and enter that fact in the Secretary of State’s records, and
the number may be reassigned.
   (B)   If the surrender of the certificate of number is due to a change of
the owner’s address, the new address shall be recorded by the Secretary of
State and a certificate of number bearing that information shall be returned to
the owner.
   (C)   The transferee of a vessel register under the state, within 15 days
after acquisition of a vessel, shall make application to the Secretary of State
for transfer to the transferee of the certificate of number issued to the
vessel. The transferee shall provide his or her name, address and the number of
the vessel and pay to the Secretary of State a transfer fee. Unless the
application is made and the fee paid within 15 days after acquisition of the
vessel, the vessel shall be considered to be without certificate of number and
a person shall not operate the vessel until a certificate is issued. Upon
receipt of the application and appropriate fees, the Secretary of State shall
transfer the certificate of number issued for the vessel to the new owner. The
certificate of number shall be valid for a three-year period.
   (D)   If a certificate of number is lost, mutilated or illegible, the owner
of the vessel shall obtain a duplicate of the certificate upon application and

later than 28 days after the end of the period covered by the certification.
      (3)   The certification shall be made upon a form furnished by the
Secretary of State.
   (E)   The court shall not submit, and the Secretary of State shall discard
and not enter on the boating record, an abstract for a conviction of civil
infraction determination for a violation of this part that could not be the
basis for the Secretary of State’s issuance of an order not to operate a vessel
on the waters of the state. The Secretary of State shall discard and not enter
on the boating record an abstract for a bond forfeiture that occurred outside

§ 95.073 OPERATION OF VESSELS; RULES; SPEED; INTERFERENCE WITH USE OF WATERS BY
OTHERS.

operator of the overtaking vessel, unless it is not feasible to do so, shall
pass on the port side of the vessel ahead.
         (c)   When two vessels are approaching each other at right angles or
obliquely so as to involve risk of collision, other than when one vessel is
overtaking another, the operator of the vessel that has the other on his or her
own port side shall hold his or her course and speed, and the operator of the
vessel that has the other on his or her own starboard side shall give way to
the other by directing his or her course to starboard so as to cross the stern
of the other vessel or, if necessary to do so, shall slacken his or her speed,
stop or reverse.

manner that involves a risk of collision, the operator of the motorboat shall
give way to the vessel under sail.
         (e)   When a motorboat and a vessel not propelled by sail or
mechanical means are proceeding in a manner that involves risk of collision,
the operator of the motorboat shall give way to the other vessel.

of a vessel is required to give way to the other, the operator of the other
vessel shall maintain his or her direction and speed.
      (2)   This section does not relieve the operator of a vessel otherwise
privileged by this section from the duty to operate with due regard for the
safety of all persons using the waters of the city.

   (B)   (1)   A person operating or propelling a vessel upon the waters of the
city shall operate it in a careful and prudent manner and at such a rate of

§ 95.213 CHEMICAL TEST AND ANALYSIS OF BLOOD, URINE OR BREATH; COLLECTION OF
SAMPLE OR SPECIMEN; APPLICATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE RULES.
   (A)   The following apply with respect to a chemical test and analysis of a
person’s blood, urine or breath, other than a preliminary chemical breath
analysis:
      (1)   The amount of alcohol or presence of a controlled substance, or
both, in an operator’s blood at the time alleged as shown by chemical analysis
of the person’s blood, urine, or breath is admissible into evidence in any
civil or criminal proceeding; and
      (2)   A person arrested for a crime described in §§
95.210(A) and (C) and 95.214(E)(1) of this chapter shall be advised of all of
the following:
         (a)   If the person takes a chemical test of his or her blood, urine
or breath administered at the request of a peace officer, the person has the
right to demand that someone of the person’s own choosing administer one of the
chemical tests; that the results of the test are admissible in a judicial
proceeding as provided under this subchapter and shall be considered with other
competent evidence in determining the innocence or guilt of the defendant; and
that the person is responsible for obtaining a chemical analysis of a test
sample obtained pursuant to the person’s own request;
         (b)   If the person refuses the request of a peace officer to take the
test described in division (A)(2)(a) above, the test shall not be given without
a court order, but the peace officer may seek to obtain such a court order; and
         (c)   The person’s refusal of the request of a peace officer to take
the test described in division (A)(2)(a) above will result in issuance of an
order that the person not operate a vessel on the waters of the state or city
for at least six months.
   (B)   A sample or specimen of urine or breath shall be taken and collected
in a reasonable manner. Only a licensed physician, or a licensed nurse or
medical technician under the direction of a licensed physician, qualified to
withdraw blood and acting in a medical environment, may withdraw blood at the
request of a peace officer for the purpose of determining the amount of alcohol
or presence of a controlled substance, or both, in a person’s blood, as
provided in this division (B). A qualified person who withdraws or analyzes
blood, or assists in the withdrawal or analysis, in accordance with this
subchapter is not liable for a crime or civil damages predicated on the act of
withdrawing or analyzing blood and related procedures unless the withdrawal or
analysis is performed in a negligent manner.
   (C)   A rule relating to a chemical test for alcohol or a controlled
substance promulgated under the state’s Vehicle Code, Public Act 300 of 1949,
being M.C.L.A. §§ 257.1 through 257.923, applies to a chemical test
administered under this subchapter.
(Prior Code, § 21.5-126) (Ord. 1048, passed 5-18-1998)
§ 95.214 CHEMICAL TESTS; ADMINISTRATION; PROCEDURES; EVIDENCE.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   A chemical test described in §
95.213 of this chapter shall be administered at the request of a peace officer
having reasonable grounds to believe the person has committed a crime described
in §
95.210(A) of this chapter. A person who takes a chemical test administered at
the request of a peace officer, as provided in §
95.213 of this chapter, shall be given a reasonable opportunity to have someone
of the person’s own choosing administer one of the chemical tests described in
§
95.213 of this chapter within a reasonable time after the person’s detention,
and the results of the test are admissible and shall be considered with other
competent evidence in determining the innocence or guilt of the defendant. If
the person charged is administered a chemical test by someone of the person’s
own choosing, the person charged is responsible for obtaining a chemical
analysis of the test sample.
      (2)   If, after an accident, the operator of a vessel involved in the
accident is transported to a medical facility and a sample of the operator’s
blood is withdrawn at that time for the purpose of medical treatment, the
results of a chemical analysis of that sample are admissible in any civil or
criminal proceeding to show the amount of alcohol or presence of a controlled
substance, or both, in the person’s blood at the time alleged, regardless of
whether the person had been offered or had refused a chemical test. The medical
facility or person performing the chemical analysis shall disclose the results
of the analysis to a Prosecuting Attorney who requests the results for use in a
criminal prosecution as provided in this division (A)(2). A medical facility or
person disclosing information in compliance with this division (A)(2) is not
civilly or criminally liable for making the disclosure.
      (3)   If, after an accident, the operator of a vessel involved in the
accident is deceased, a sample of the decedent’s blood shall be withdrawn in a
manner directed by the medical examiner for the purpose of determining the
amount of alcohol or the presence of a controlled substance, or both, in the
decedent’s blood. The medical examiner shall give the results of the chemical
analysis of the sample to the law enforcement agency investigating the accident
and that agency shall forward the results to the state.
(Prior Code, § 21.5-127)
   (B)   Chemical test; introduction of other competent evidence; availability
of test results.
      (1)   The provisions of §
95.213 of this chapter and division (A) above relating to a chemical testing do
not limit the introduction of any other competent evidence bearing upon the
question of whether or not a person was impaired by, or under the influence of,
intoxicating liquor or a controlled substance, or both, or whether the person
had a blood alcohol content of 0.10 grams or more per 100 milliliters of blood,
per 210 liters of breath or per 67 milliliters of urine.
      (2)   If a chemical test described in §
95.213 of this chapter and division (A) above is administered, the results of
the test shall be made available to the person charged or the person’s attorney
upon written request to the prosecution, with a copy of the request filed with
the court. The prosecution shall furnish the results at least two days before
the day of the trial. The results of the test shall be offered as evidence by
the prosecution in that trial. Failure to fully comply with the request bars
the admission of the results into evidence by the prosecution.
(Prior Code, § 21.5-128)
   (C)   Chemical analysis of blood, urine or breath; amount of alcohol in
operator’s blood; presumptions; refusal to submit to chemical test as evidence.
      (1)   Except in a prosecution relating solely to a violation of §
95.210(A)(2) of this chapter, the amount of alcohol in the operator’s blood at
the time alleged as shown by chemical analysis of the person’s blood, urine or
breath gives rise to the following presumptions:
         (a)   If at the time defendant had an alcohol content of 0.07 grams or
less per 100 milliliters of blood, per 210 liters of breath or per 67
milliliters of urine, it shall be presumed that the defendant’s ability to
operate a vessel was not impaired due to the consumption of intoxicating liquor
and that the defendant was not under the influence of intoxicating liquor;
         (b)   If at the time the defendant had an alcohol content of more than
0.07 grams, but less than 0.10 grams per 100 milliliters of blood, per 210
liters of breath, or per 67 milliliters of urine, it shall be presumed that the
defendant’s ability to operate a vessel was impaired within the provisions of §
95.210(C) of this chapter due to the consumption of intoxicating liquor; and
         (c)   If at the time the defendant had an alcohol content of 0.10
grams or more per 100 milliliters of blood, per 210 liters of breath, or per 67
milliliters of urine, it shall be presumed that the defendant was under the
influence of intoxicating liquor.
      (2)   A person’s refusal to submit to a chemical test as provided in §
95.213 and division (A) above is admissible in a criminal prosecution for a
crime described in §§
95.210(A) and (C) and division (F) below only for the purpose of showing that a
test was offered to the defendant, but not as evidence in determining innocence
or guilt of the defendant. The jury shall be instructed accordingly.
(Prior Code, § 21.5-129)
   (D)   Advising defendant of penalties and sanctions; ordering screening;
assessment and rehabilitative services.
      (1)   Before accepting a plea of guilty or nolo contendere under §§
95.210,
95.211 and
95.999 of this chapter, the court shall advise the accused of the maximum
possible term of imprisonment and the maximum possible fine that may be imposed
for the violation, and shall advise the defendant that the maximum possible
sanctions that may be imposed will be based upon the boating record maintained
by the Secretary of State or other evidence of a prior conviction as provided
in §
95.999 of this chapter.
      (2)   Before imposing sentence, other than court ordered operating
sanctions, for a violation of §
95.210(A) and (C) of this chapter, the court shall order the person to undergo
screening and assessment by a person or agency designated by the office of
substance abuse services to determine whether the person is likely to benefit
from rehabilitative services, including alcohol or drug education or treatment
programs. As part of the sentence, the court may order the person to
participate in and successfully complete one or more appropriate rehabilitative
programs. The person shall pay for the costs of the screening, assessment and
rehabilitative services.
(Prior Code, § 21.5-130)
   (E)   Sentencing as multiple offender; consideration of prior convictions;
sanctions; “another boating substance abuse offense” defined.
      (1)   Immediately upon acceptance by the court of a plea of guilty or
nolo contendere or upon entry of a verdict of guilty for a violation of §
95.210(A) and (C) of this chapter whether or not the person is eligible to be
sentenced as a multiple offender, the court shall consider all prior
convictions currently entered upon the boating record of the person or other
evidence of prior convictions established under §
95.999 of this chapter, except those convictions that, upon motion by the
defendant, are determined by the court to be constitutionally invalid, and

enter an adjudication of guilt, or a determination in a juvenile delinquency
proceeding that the individual has committed the offense, and proceed as

of probation, the court shall discharge the individual and dismiss the
proceedings. A discharge and dismissal under this division (C)(2)(a) is without
adjudication of guilt or without a determination in a juvenile delinquency
proceeding that the individual has committed the offense and is not a
conviction or juvenile adjudication for purposes of disqualifications or
disabilities imposed by law on conviction of a crime. An individual may obtain
only one discharge and dismissal under this section. The court shall maintain a
non-public record of the matter while proceedings are deferred and the
individual is on probation and if there is a discharge and dismissal under this

a plea and of the discharge and dismissal under this division (C)(2). These

April every two years. The other five members shall serve four-year terms.
Three shall be appointed on the third Monday in April every two years and two

   (C)   Violations. Any person, firm or corporation who shall violate a
provision of this code or shall fail to comply with any of the requirements

in violation of an approved plan or directive of the code official, or of a
permit or certificate issued under the provisions of this code, shall be cited
for a municipal civil infraction in accordance with Chapter 11 of this code of
ordinances and the defendant, if found responsible, shall be subject to a fine
of not more than $500. Additionally, the court may assess costs incurred in

   (D)   Bonds and insurance. No person shall erect, install, remove or rehang
any sign for which a permit is required under the provisions of this code until
an approved bond executed by the principal and a surety shall have been filed
in the sum of $5,000. A certified copy of a power of attorney must be submitted
to verify the authority of the individual signing or surety on behalf of the
insurance company. Such bond or insurance policy shall protect and hold
harmless the jurisdiction from any and all claims or demands for damages by
reason of any negligence of the sign hanger, contractor or agent, or by any
reason of defects in the construction, or damages resulting from the collapse,
failure or combustion of the sign or parts thereof. The obligation herein
specified shall remain in force and in effect during the life of every sign and
shall not be canceled by the principal or surety until after a 30-day notice to
the code official.
   (E)   Utilities. All new construction shall have all utilities, such as
electrical service wires, cable television wires and telephone wires, installed
underground from the utility source in the public right-of-way to the new
structure. PVC tubing, of the size required by the utility, shall be installed
a minimum 24 inches below grade for this purpose.
   (F)   Moved structures.
      (1)   No permit shall be issued to move any structure until a building
permit has been obtained for the establishment of the structure in its new
location. Before issuing such a moving permit, the code official shall cause an
inspection to be made of the structure and shall refuse a permit unless he or
she finds the structure to be in a safe and sanitary condition and finds that
it will be in compliance with this code and other ordinances and laws when
established in its new location. A structure which has been depreciated 50% or
more by the City Assessor in establishing its assessed valuation shall not be
moved to any site location within the city. No structure shall be moved to a
new location within the city unless the code official determines that it will
correspond and harmonize with the architecture, size and shape of the other
structures in the neighborhood and that it will result in an upgrading of the
immediate area.
      (2)   When it is necessary to use any part of a public street in moving a
structure, a separate approval for the use of public streets shall be obtained
after filing a bond as required in § 3308.3 of the Michigan Building Code. In
applying for such approval, the mover shall furnish in writing a schedule of
the streets to be used and the time at which the structure will reach each
point in its journey. Also, written approval from every public service
corporation whose property, fixtures, or equipment will be affected,
endangered, or disturbed during the moving shall be submitted showing that the
mover has given proper notice of his or her intentions and furnished suitable
security for the repair of all damage caused by the moving. Approvals must also
be obtained from county and state agencies where applicable. No structure shall
be moved across any railroad track, except during daylight hours and in the
presence of a representative of the company operating said railroad.
 
      (3)   When a structure is to be moved to a new location within the city,
the owner of the newly described site shall file a surety bond in favor of the
city in sufficient amount to guarantee that the structure will be completed in
accordance with all applicable permits and ready for occupancy within six
months after arrival on its new location. Said surety bond shall be approved by
the Department of Legal Affairs and the sum of the bond shall be designated by
the code official. When a lot is left vacant from moving a structure, said lot
shall be cleaned, filled, and graded to the approval of the code official
within five days of the structure being moved off the site.
   (G)   Demolition.
 
      (1)   All buildings, accessory buildings, sheds, concrete slabs,
foundations, floors, driveways and approaches, private and service sidewalks,
fences, walls, and the like, shall be wrecked and removed completely. All
sewers, water lines, and the like, shall be plugged and/or capped
satisfactorily to the code official before backfilling. An inspection of sewer
capping and of foundation removal is required.
      (2)   Site backfilling shall be completed within five working days of the
removal of demolished building material and debris. Failure, for any reason, to
backfill the site as specified will require that the person causing the
demolition or excavation install protective fencing around the site to the
satisfaction of the code official.
         (a)   The person causing said demolition or excavation shall maintain
the fencing to ensure the purpose is being accomplished. As soon as practical,
or at the direction of the code official, the fencing shall be removed and the
site properly backfilled the same day.
         (b)   Backfill shall be clean fill dirt, or crushed aggregate as
approved by the code official, free from broken concrete, stones, wood and
other miscellaneous debris. Documentation shall be submitted by the person
causing the demolition or backfilling certifying that the fill dirt is non-
contaminated and non-hazardous and stating the source of the fill dirt. This
must be approved by the code official before backfilling operations may begin.
         (c)   All backfill shall be compacted by a dozer in approximately 12-
inch lifts.
      (3)   All debris and building materials shall be completely removed from
the premises. The property shall be smoothly graded and left in a neat
condition with no low spots in which water might stand. Final grading shall not
create a nuisance to abutting property. The disturbed area shall be seeded to
promote vegetation growth and reduce soil erosion. Any damage to adjacent
property or abutting public right-of-way, including sidewalks, occurring during
the demolition or excavation shall be repaired by the person causing said
demolition or excavation at his or her own expense.
       (4)   All temporary occupancy of public property shall be considered and
treated as being at the will of the city, and will be permitted only by special
permit issued by the Department. No permit will be issued until the applicant
therefore shall have executed and filed with the City Clerk a bond with
property sureties approved by the Council, in an amount to be designated by the
Council but in no case less than $5,000 conditioned to indemnify, save and keep
harmless the city from any and all loss, expense, cost or liability of any kind
whatsoever which the city may suffer or be put to, from or by reason of any act
or thing done or neglected to be done, or by virtue of the authority given in
such permit or the requirements of the city ordinances.

officers, technical assistants, inspectors and other employees as shall be
necessary for the administration of this code and as authorized by the

furnishing of labor, materials or appliances for the construction, alteration
or maintenance of a building, or the preparation of construction documents
thereof, unless that person is the owner of the building; nor shall such
officer or employee engage in any work that conflicts with official duties or
with the interests of the department.

an act performed by that officer or employee in the lawful discharge of duties
and under the provisions of this code shall be defended by the legal
representative of the jurisdiction until the final termination of the
proceedings. The code official or any subordinate shall not be liable for costs

any of the following: overgrown grass or vegetation, accumulation of
newspapers, circulars, flyers or mail, past due utility notices or disconnected

structure does not preclude the city from taking appropriate actions to secure
the property or to issue orders to repair or abate dangerous, hazardous or
unlawful conditions or from acting to eliminate an imminent hazard to public
health and safety.

         (h)   Any plans for restoration, reuse or removal of the structure
with an accompanying timeline and work schedule.
      (2)   An owner shall notify the City Engineer and file an amended form
within seven days of any change in the registration information required by
this section.

time during which such structure remains an abandoned residential structure.
   (B)   Fees under this section shall be established to support the services
rendered by the city in the course of its duties related to abandoned
residential structures. Failure to register an abandoned residential structure
(or pay the annual administrative fee) shall be cause for penalties to be
assessed and are municipal civil infractions.
   (C)   The annual registration fee shall be paid so that it is received by
the city within ten days after the structure has become abandoned.
   (D)   A late fee, in an amount to be established by the City Council, shall
also be payable by an owner of an abandoned residential structure when the
registration fee is not timely paid.

overdue, the city may recover such sums by:
   (A)   Directing the City Assessor to add the amount due to the next tax roll
of the city as a single lot assessment under these codified ordinances and
collect said sum in the same manner as provided by law for collection of taxes
and special assessments;
   (B)   Filing suit against the owner for entry of civil money judgment; or
   (C)   Any other means available by law, including, but not limited to, being
included in any fines and costs assessed by the court for the municipal civil
infraction.

§ 170.115 SECURING STRUCTURES.
   A city order to secure an abandoned residential property shall be complied
with by the owner within 72 hours. If the securing has not been completed or
does not comply with the requirements for securing the structure under this
subchapter, the city shall secure the structure and the city shall bill the
owner of record for all costs incurred, including service fee and
administrative costs. The amount so billed shall constitute a personal debt of
the owner and may be recovered in the same manner as permitted for the recovery
of fees under this subchapter.

      CERTIFICATE OF APPROVAL. A certificate issued by the Department of
Engineering and Building which certifies compliance with the provisions of the
codes and ordinances of the city for residential dwellings.

Engineering and Building in accordance with the provisions of Ch. 190 of this
code of ordinances for an approved use or occupancy.
      DWELLING. A residential structure and accessory uses located in the city.
A rental dwelling as defined in Ch. 123 of this code of ordinances which has a
current certificate of compliance issued to it is not included in this
definition.
      PERSON. Any individual, partnership, corporation or other legal entity.
      TRANSFER. The sale or conveyance of title to another for consideration,
or the execution of a land contract, or the exercise of an option to purchase a
dwelling. A conveyance by lease, gift, devise or lien foreclosure are not
included in this definition.
   (B)   Certificate of approval required. It shall be unlawful for any person
to transfer a dwelling or for any person to act as a broker for the transfer of
a dwelling which does not have a current certificate of approval issued for
said dwelling, except as otherwise allowed by this section.
   (C)   Issuance of a certificate of approval.
      (1)   The Department of Engineering and Building shall issue a
certificate of approval only after it has inspected the dwelling and finds that
the dwelling meets the requirements of all of the applicable codes and
ordinances of the city. An inspection report shall be completed by the
inspector after completing the inspection of the property. The report shall
note all violations found in the dwelling. Before a certificate of approval is
issued, all violations must be corrected and approved. The inspection report
shall be valid for one year from the date of inspection. In lieu of correcting
all violations before occupancy, except as outlined in division (E) below, the
amount of money estimated to correct said violations may be placed in escrow
with the Department of Engineering and Building, as outlined in division (G)
below. Upon re-inspection and approval of the correction of all violations, a
certificate of approval will be issued and remain valid for a five-year period
at which time a new inspection and certificate of approval will be required for
the subsequent sale or transfer of the property; provided that, conditions of
division (C)(3) below are not applicable. The five-year period shall commence
no later than the expiration date of the inspection report or six months from
the date of the affidavit assuming correction of the violations, whichever is
later.
      (2)   A residential dwelling which has never been occupied will be issued
a certificate of approval upon final inspection of the new construction work.
The certificate of approval shall be valid for five years of issuance.
      (3)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a new
inspection and a new certificate of approval shall be required for any transfer
or sale if the property becomes vacant, or is the subject of foreclosure
proceedings, or is the subject of a police report regarding vandalism, breaking
and entering or open structure, or is determined to be a dangerous building by
the Engineer in accordance with the city’s Property Maintenance Code.
   (D)   Disclaimer of liability by city. A certificate of approval is not a
warranty or guarantee that there are no defects in the dwelling and the city
shall not be held responsible for defects not noted in the inspection report.
      (1)   This inspection of the land use, exterior posture and interior
accessories of the structure is limited to visual inspection only. The city
does not guarantee or approve by inference any latent, structural or mechanical
defects thereto, or such other items that are not apparent by such visual
inspection.
      (2)   The city shall not assume any liability to any person by reason of
the inspections required by this section or the code adopted herein or the
issuance of a certificate of approval or a certificate of occupancy.
   (E)   Dangerous conditions. Should the Department of Engineering and
Building, upon inspection, determine that there are conditions which constitute
an imminent danger to health and safety, it may order the conditions to be
remedied and may limit or prohibit occupancy where appropriate.
   (F)   Registration and fees. Any person that is going to transfer a dwelling
must register with the Department of Engineering and Building for the purpose
of setting up an inspection of the dwelling. The fee for the registration and
inspection shall be in the amount of $190 for a one-family dwelling and $285
for a two-family dwelling.
   (G)   Assumption of violations.
      (1)   The buyer of a residential dwelling may assume the responsibility
for correcting the violations noted on the inspection checklist through the
following procedure:
         (a)   There shall be placed in escrow with the Department of
Engineering and Building an amount of money approximately equal to that
required to complete the repairs; or
         (b)   The buyer shall execute a notarized affidavit, provided by the
Department of Engineering and Building, stating their intent to assume the
responsibility of correcting these violations completely within six months of
the date of the affidavit, or on or before the inspection report expiration
date, whichever is later.
      (2)   The money held in escrow may not be claimed by the buyer/owner
until all violations are corrected and the final inspection of the checklist is
approved as complete. However, the Department of Engineering and Building may
elect to refund portions of the escrow money to the buyer upon inspections
which indicate that a significant portion of the violations noted on the
inspection checklist have been corrected; provided, the repairs and inspections
are scheduled within the specified period. If all the violations are not
corrected and approved within the specified period, occupancy may be prohibited
and in addition, any and all costs that the city may incur in overseeing the
file for that particular property while enforcing the city ordinance concerning
inspection of residential dwellings shall be deducted from the escrow amount,
including, but not limited to, any and all costs involved in bringing legal
proceedings to enforce the ordinance. An extension beyond the specified period
may be granted by the City Engineer in those instances when the weather
conditions are such that it would be impractical (as determined by the City
Engineer) to bring the property into compliance. A written request for an
extension must be submitted to the city prior to the expiration of the
specified period setting forth what violations have been corrected to date and
what items cannot be corrected due to the weather. If the City Engineer
determines that the party making the request has been diligent in correcting
the violations and that the weather makes it impractical to complete all
repairs, an extension may be granted.
      (3)   (a)   Commencing 1-1-2003 (beginning with the oldest files by date
and then proceeding forward), a written notice shall be sent to the last known
address to the persons who provided the escrow (and to the buyer of the home if
the buyer did not deposit the escrow) if the corrections have not been made
within a six-year period of the date of affidavit. The notice shall require the
buyer to submit to the Department of Engineering and Building a violation
correction schedule within one month of notice. The schedule shall not exceed
six months in length and shall include the time necessary to make sure all
required permits are obtained to complete the repairs and notify the city to
conduct a final inspection.
         (b)   The notice shall contain a provision that if the buyer does not:
            1.   Submit a schedule within month to the city setting forth the
repair schedule; or
            2.   Complete all required repairs and arrange a final inspection
by the city within six months of the date of the notice, all funds deposited in
escrow shall be forfeited to the city.
         (c)   If the required schedule is not submitted or if the work is not
completed within the submitted scheduled time frame, the owner of the property
shall be issued a ticket. Nothing in this section prohibits the city from
commencing legal proceedings against a violator of this section sooner than the
above stated six-year period.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 176.001 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.
   The City Council hereby finds that the possibility that excessive quantities
of soil may be eroding from certain areas that may undergo development for non-
agricultural uses such as housing developments, industrial areas, recreational
uses and public work construction. This erosion makes necessary costly repairs
to gullies, washed-out fills, roads and embankments. The resulting sediment
clogs storm sewers and road ditches, muddies streams and leaves deposits of
silts in lakes, streams, rivers, wetlands and reservoirs, and is considered a
major water pollutant.
(Prior Code, § 16-1) (Ord. 1311, passed 3-16-2009)
§ 176.002 PURPOSES.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to prevent soil erosion and off-site
sedimentation from earth change activities within the city by requiring proper
provisions for water disposal and the protection of soil surfaces during and
after construction, in order to promote the safety, public health, convenience
and general welfare of the community.
   (B)   This chapter also incorporates by reference the rules promulgated

prescribed in § 399.205(3) of Public Act 169 of 1970, as amended.
(Prior Code, § 28-70)

§ 177.046 PERMIT APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   A permit shall be obtained before any work affecting the exterior
appearance of a resource is performed within a historic district. The person,
individual, partnership, firm, corporation, organization, institution or agency
of government proposing to do that work shall file an application for a permit
with the Building Inspector. Upon receipt of a complete application, the
Inspector of Buildings shall immediately refer the application, along with all

Commission. A permit shall not be issued and proposed work shall not proceed
until the Commission has acted on the application by issuing a certificate of
appropriateness or a notice to proceed as prescribed in this subchapter. A
Commission shall not issue a certificate of appropriateness unless the
applicant certifies in the application that the property where work will be
undertaken has, or will have before the proposed project completion date, a
fire alarm system or a smoke alarm complying with the requirements of the
Stille-DeRossett-Hale Single State Construction Code Act, Public Act 230 of

prescribed by this subchapter.

of a resource the Commission considers valuable to the city, the state or the
nation, and the Commission determines that the alteration or loss of that
resource will adversely affect the public purpose of the city, state or nation,
the Commission shall attempt to establish with the owner of the resource an
economically feasible plan for the preservation of the resource.
   (D)   The failure of the Commission to act on an application within 60
calendar days after the date a complete application is filed with the
Commission, unless an extension is agreed upon in writing by the applicant and
the Commission, shall be considered to constitute approval.
   (E)   The Commission may charge a reasonable fee to process a permit
application.
(Prior Code, § 28-72) (Ord. 1332, passed 9-13-2010)
§ 177.047 DENIALS.

be necessary to substantially improve or correct any of the following
conditions:
   (A)   The resource constitutes a hazard to the safety of the public or to
the structure’s occupants;
   (B)   The resource is a deterrent to a major improvement program that will
be of substantial benefit to the community and the applicant proposing the work
has obtained all necessary planning and zoning approvals, financing and
environmental clearances;
   (C)   Retaining the resource will cause undue financial hardship to the
owner when a governmental action, an act of God or other events beyond the
owner’s control created the hardship, and all feasible alternatives to
eliminate the financial hardship, which may include offering the resource for
sale at its fair market value or moving the resource to a vacant site within
the historic district, have been attempted and exhausted by the owner; and
   (D)   Retaining the resource is not in the interest of the majority of the
community.

rendered under this subchapter may not appeal to the court without first
exhausting the right to appeal to the state’s Historic Preservation Review
Board.

§ 177.050 WORK WITHOUT A PERMIT.
   (A)   When work has been done upon a resource without a permit, and the
Commission finds that the work does not qualify for a certificate of
appropriateness, the Commission may require an owner to restore the resource to
the condition that the resource was in before the inappropriate work or to
modify the work so that it qualifies for a certificate of appropriateness.
   (B)   (1)   If the owner does not comply with the restoration or
modification requirement within a reasonable time, the Commission may seek an
order from the Circuit Court to require the owner to restore the resource to
its former condition or to modify the work so that it qualifies for a
certificate of appropriateness.
      (2)   If the owner does not comply or cannot comply with the order of the
court, the Commission or its agents may enter the property and conduct work
necessary to restore the resource to its former condition or modify the work so
that it qualifies for a certificate of appropriateness in accordance with the
court’s order.
   (C)   The costs of the work done shall be charged to the owner and may be
levied by the city as a special assessment against the property. When acting
pursuant to an order of the Circuit Court, the Commission or its agents may
enter a property for purposes of this section.

threatened with demolition by neglect, the Commission may do either of the
following:
   (A)   Require the owner of the resource to repair all conditions
contributing to demolition by neglect; and/or
   (B)   If the owner does not make repairs within a reasonable time, the
Commission or its agents may enter the property and make such repairs as
necessary to prevent demolition by neglect. The costs of the work shall be
charged to the owner and may be levied by the city as a special assessment
against the property. The Commission or its agents may enter the property for
purposes of this section upon obtaining an order from the Circuit Court.

proposed historic district, the City Council may, at its discretion, adopt a
resolution requiring that all applications for permits within the proposed
historic district be referred to the Historic District Commission, as
prescribed in §
177.046 of this chapter. The Historic District Commission shall review permit
applications with the same powers that would apply if the proposed historic
district was an established historic district. The review may continue in the

(Prior Code, § 28-78) (Ord. 1332, passed 9-13-2010)
§ 177.053 EMERGENCY MORATORIUM.
   If the City Council determines that pending work will cause irreparable harm
to resources located within an established or proposed historic district, the
City Council may, by resolution, declare an emergency moratorium on all such
work for a period not to exceed six months. The City Council may extend the
emergency moratorium for an additional period not to exceed six months, upon
finding that the threat of irreparable harm to resources is still present. Any
pending permit application concerning a resource subject to an emergency
moratorium may be summarily denied.

Council, if considered to be the public interest, may acquire the resource
using public funds, public or private gifts, grants or proceeds from the
issuance of revenue bonds. The acquisition shall be based upon the
recommendation of the Commission. The Commission is responsible for maintaining
publicly owned resources using its own funds, if not specifically designated

reasonably control.
      (4)   The Building Official shall independently determine whether there

use patterns of the areas involved shall provide a desirable environment and
shall be harmonious to the general surrounding uses permitting flexibility in
overall development while ensuring adequate safeguards and standards for public
health, safety, convenience and general welfare.
    It is further the intent of this district to provide for development which
will be carried out in such manner as to preserve natural features such as
waterfront areas and their accessibility to the public and to promote energy
efficient development. Such Planned Development District may embrace a mixture
of one or more uses or zoning categories all in accord with the city’s Master
Plan for Future Land Use.
§ 190.275 PROCEDURE FOR APPLICATION.
   (A)   Application shall be made to the City Council under this district.

non-residential development and the resultant traffic generated and parking
demands created; and
      (7)   Supporting documentation such as, but not limited to: market
studies; supporting land use request; and the intended scheduling of
development.
(Prior Code, App. A, § 2000) (Ord. 1277, passed 4-2-2007)
§ 190.276 STAGE I PRELIMINARY SITE PLAN.
   (A)   The preliminary site plan shall be referred to the City Engineer, or
his or her designee, to other city agencies or consultants to the city as may
be deemed necessary to provide guidance to the Planning Commission and the City
Council in their review of the project.
   (B)   In reviewing and approving the preliminary site plan, the following
procedures and conditions shall be followed.
      (1)   The proposed development in a PD District shall be of such area as
to represent a sound carrying out of the master plan of land use, it not being
the intention of this district that an unrelated parcel-by-parcel development
be effectuated.
      (2)   The preliminary site plan shall be reviewed and a report with
recommendation shall be made by the Planning Commission to the City Council
relative to the plans meeting the intent and the requirements of the Master
Plan of Future Land Use and the requirements of this chapter.
      (3)   Recommendation by the Planning Commission shall be given only after
public hearing. Such hearing shall be carried out in accord with requirements
of Public Act 110 of 2006, as amended.
      (4)   Approval of the preliminary plan by the City Council shall not
constitute approval of the final site plan. It shall be deemed as approval of
the land use plan submitted and shall serve as a guide in the preparation of
the final plan.
      (5)   Acceptance of the preliminary site plan by the City Council shall
be effective for a period of two years.
      (6)   In an area zoned PD District, no development shall take place
therein nor use made of any part thereof, except in accordance with the site
plan as originally approved, or in accordance with an approved amendment
thereto.
(Prior Code, App. A, § 2001) (Ord. 1277, passed 4-2-2007)
§ 190.277 STAGE II FINAL SITE PLAN.
   (A)   The final site plan shall be submitted to the City Council and
referred to the City Engineer or his or her designee, and to other city
agencies or consultants to the city as may be deemed necessary to provide
guidance to the Planning Commission and the City Council in their review of the
project.
   (B)   In reviewing the final site plan, the following conditions shall be
followed.
      (1)   A final overall site plan for the entire area being requested under
this PD District shall be submitted. This plan shall be worked out in detail
showing specific uses, building location, off-street parking, street alignment
changes, open spaces and other physical plan details being proposed. Supporting
documentation in the form of building floor plans, building elevation drawings,
type of building material and schedule of construction shall be submitted.
      (2)   The final plan shall reflect and adhere to those use patterns as
approved in the preliminary plan. Standards for building, density, height,
bulk, setbacks from public streets and the riverfront, and off-street parking
shall be equal to at least the minimum standards set forth for like uses in the
schedule of regulations and off-street parking requirements of this chapter;
provided however, the Planning Commission and City Council may modify these
standards where the objectives of the district can be proved to be better
served by such modifications. Density standards for multiple-family dwellings
shall generally follow the requirements of the RM-1 districts for one-, two-
and three-story buildings and the RM-2 District requirements for buildings
above three stories subject to modification where it can be shown that such
modification will provide a more desirable planned development. In no instance
shall buildings be located closer than 100 feet to the waterfront unless good
cause can be shown that buildings located closer than 100 feet will provide
site amenities which will be beneficial to the overall development and to the
city as a whole. In those instances where mixed uses utilize a PD District, the
Planning Commission may vary setback and height requirements to accomplish a
desirable planned development.
      (3)   A presentation of the final site plan shall be made to the City
Council. Prior to action by the City Council, the final site plan shall be
forwarded to the Planning Commission for review and recommendation.

   In approving the final plan, the following conditions shall be set forth.
   (A)   Approval of the final site plan (Stage II) may be granted by the City
Council after review and recommendation is made by the Planning Commission. A
public hearing shall not be required on the Stage II site plan, however, a
resolution of the City Council is required determining that such Stage II site
plan is in compliance with the planned development representations made at the
time of approval of the Stage I site plan, and also meets the requirements set
forth in §
190.279 of this chapter, which follows. Final approvals may be granted in
stages; provided, such stages are in keeping with previously approved
preliminary site plans.
   (B)   All dedications of public rights-of-way or planned public open spaces
shall be made prior to any construction taking place on the site.

building elevations and other development proposals including the proposed
uses, shall become an integral part of the PD District and for purposes of
recordation, shall be referred to as “Planned Development No. ________ “, which
number shall be recorded on the appropriate properties of the city zoning map.
All approved plans shall be filed with the City Clerk.
   (D)   Approval of the final site plan shall be effective for a period of
three years; providing that, development is commenced within one year, as
evidenced, at a minimum, by issuance of a building permit. If development is
not commenced within one year or not completed within three years, the Planning
Commission shall review progress to date and make a recommendation to the City
Council as to action relative to permitting continuation under original
approval.
(Prior Code, App. A, § 2003) (Ord. 1277, passed 4-2-2007)

shall suspend approval of the overall plan until such changes or amendments
have been reviewed and approved as in the instance of the first submittal, it
being the intent of this section that no other administrative or board of
appeals action shall constitute official approval of such changes or amendments
to the overall plan. Denial by City Council of any requested changes or
amendments shall not void the originally approved plan;
   (D)   A change of occupancy, a change in type of use, or the alteration of a
building or the site in a previously approved PD District shall require the
review of the Building Official. The Building Official may request a review by
the Planning Commission where a question arises relative to whether such change
falls within the intent of the previously approved PD District;

SPECIAL LAND USES
§ 190.305 PURPOSE.
   The development and execution of this subchapter is based upon the division
of the city into districts within which the uses of land and buildings and the
bulk and location of buildings and structures in relation to the land are
substantially uniform. It is recognized, however, that there are special uses
which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be properly classified
in any particular district or districts without consideration, in each case, of
the impact of those uses upon neighboring land. These uses include uses
publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public interest and uses
entirely private in character, but of such an unusual nature that their
operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their impact upon
neighboring property or public facilities.
(Prior Code, App. A, § 2200) (Ord. 1277, passed 4-2-2007)
§ 190.306 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Initiation of special land use. Any person having a freehold interest
in land, a possessory interest entitled to exclusive possession, or a
contractual interest which may become a freehold interest, and which is
specifically enforceable, may file an application to use the land for one or
more of the special uses provided for in this subchapter in the zoning district
in which the land is located.
   (B)   Application of special land use. An application for special land use
shall be filed with the Engineering Department on a form prescribed by the
Department. The application shall be accompanied by any plans or data
prescribed by the Department and shall include as a minimum the requirements
for site plan review as noted in §
190.377 of this chapter. The application shall also include a statement in
writing by the applicant and adequate evidence showing that the proposed
special land use will conform to the standards set forth in this section. The
application shall also be accompanied with a fee to cover the expense of public
hearing. The fee to be determined by resolution of the City Council shall be
based upon the cost of processing the review.
   (C)   Public hearing. Upon receipt of an application for a special land use,
a public hearing shall be held by the Planning Commission. Once notice that a
request for special land use approval has been received, it shall be published
in a newspaper of general circulation in the city and shall be sent by mail or
personal delivery to the owners of property for which approval is being
considered, to all persons to whom real property is assessed within 300 feet of
the boundary of the property in question, and to the occupants of all
structures within 300 feet. The notice shall be given not less than 15 days
before the application will be considered. If the name of the occupant is not
known, the term “occupant” may be used in making notification. Notification
need not be given to more than one occupant of a structure, except that if a
structure contains more than one dwelling unit or spatial area owned or leased
by different individuals, partnerships, businesses or organizations, one
occupant of each unit or spatial area shall receive notice. In the case of a
single structure containing more than four dwelling units or other distinct
spatial areas owned or leased by different individuals, partnerships,
businesses or organizations, notice may be given to the manager or owner of the
structure who shall be requested to post the notice at the primary entrance to
the structure. The notice shall contain the following information:
      (1)   Description of the nature of the special land use request;
      (2)   A site plan in accord with §
190.377 of this chapter has been submitted;
      (3)   Indication of the property, which is the subject of the special
land use request. The notice shall include a listing of all existing street
addresses within the property. Street addresses do not need to be created and
listed if no such addresses currently exist within the property. If there are
no street addresses, other means of identification may be used;
      (4)   Statement of when and where the special land use hearing will be
considered; and
      (5)   Indication of when and where written comments will be received
concerning the request.
   (D)   Standards. No special land use shall be recommended by the Engineering
Department or approved by the Planning Commission unless it shall find the
following:
      (1)   The establishment, maintenance or operation of the special land use
will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety or general
welfare or the natural environment;
      (2)   The special land use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment
of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted,
nor shall it substantially diminish and impair property values within its
neighborhood;
      (3)   The establishment of the special land use will not impede the
normal and orderly development and improvement of the surrounding property for
uses permitted in the district;
      (4)   Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and necessary facilities
have been or are being provided;
      (5)   Adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress or
egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets;
      (6)   The special land use shall, in all other respects, conform to the
applicable regulations of the district in which it is located and to any
additional conditions or procedures as specified in §§
190.305 through
190.307 of this chapter; and
      (7)   A decision on a special land use shall be incorporated in a
statement of findings and conclusions relative to the special land use which
specifies the basis for the decision and any conditions imposed.
   (E)   Conditions and guarantees. Prior to the granting of any special land
use, the Planning Commission shall stipulate the conditions and restrictions
upon the establishment, location, construction, maintenance and operations of
the special land use as deemed necessary for the protection of the public
interest and to secure compliance with the standards and requirements specified
in this section. In all cases in which special land uses are granted, the
Planning Commission shall require any evidence and guarantees as it may deem
necessary as proof that the conditions stipulated in connection therewith are
being and will be complied with. Any conditions imposed shall remain unchanged,
except upon the mutual consent of the Planning Commission and the land owner.
The Planning Commission shall maintain a record of changes granted in the
conditions.
   (F)   Effect of denial of a special land use. No application for a special
land use which has been denied wholly or in part by the Planning Commission
shall be resubmitted for a period of one year from the date of the order of
denial, except on the grounds of new evidence or proof of change of conditions
found to be valid by the engineering department and the Planning Commission.
   (G)   Revocation. In any case where a special land use has not been
established within one year after the date of granting authorization for the
use, the special land use authorization shall automatically be null and void
without further action by the Planning Commission.
   (H)   Revoke special land use. A special land use may be revoked by the
Planning Commission under the following procedures:
      (1)   Mail notice of the proposed action to revoke the special land use
to the owner/operator of the business and outdoor café at least ten calendar
days prior to the hearing;
      (2)   Provide with the notice the reasons for the proposed action;
      (3)   Provide with the notice the date, time and place of the hearing for
the proposed action;
      (4)   Include in the notice a statement that the owner/operator may
present evidence and testimony and question any witness at the hearing; and
      (5)   At the hearing, the City Engineer’s office or planner will present
to the Planning Commission any witnesses, reports, documents and
recommendations concerning the proposed revocation of the special land use.
   (I)   Criteria for revocation. The Planning Commission may revoke a special
land use upon a determination by the Commission that, based upon a
preponderance of evidence presented at the public hearing, any of the following
exists:
      (1)   Violation of any of the restrictions of the special land use set
forth in the city ordinance or in any conditions set by the city when it
approved the special land use.
      (2)   Maintenance of a nuisance upon the premises, including, but not
limited to, any of the following:
         (a)   Existing violations of building, zoning, health, fire or
regulatory codes;
         (b)   A pattern of patron conduct upon or in the neighborhood of the
licensed establishment including outdoor café which is in violation of the law
or disturbs the peace, order and tranquility of the neighborhood;
         (c)   Failure to maintain the grounds and exterior of the licensed
establishment (including outdoor café), including litter, debris, refuse
blowing or being deposited on adjoining properties;
         (d)   Entertainment without a required permit or entertainment which
disturbs the peace, order and tranquility of the neighborhood;
         (e)   Any advertising, promotion or activity which by its nature
causes, creates or contributes to disorder, disobedience to rules, ordinances

instances in which the applicant objects to the decision of the Review
Committee.
      (3)   Requirement for approved design; nature of review. In the Design
Review District, no permit required under the ordinances of the city for a sign
or for the erection, construction, alteration or repair of any building or
structure which involves a major architectural change or a significant change
to an exterior design feature shall be issued by the city unless and until the
Design Review Committee has reviewed and approved such activity. The Building
Official may determine that no major architectural change or significant
exterior design feature is involved in the work for which the approval is
sought, in which case, no review by the Design Review Committee shall be
required. The Building Official may request a review by the Design Review
Committee where a question arises relative to whether proposed exterior changes
fall within the intent of the design review ordinance and guidelines. Design
review shall not apply to repair, ordinary maintenance as defined herein, or

Committee (at least three members) must be present for the review and action on
an application. Should an application be denied, an appeal may be made to the
City Council.
      (5)   Design guidelines. The design guidelines (available in the
engineering and building department) established by the Planning Commission for
the Design Review District shall serve as a guide to the Design Review
Committee in the review of plans.
   (C)   Administration.
      (1)   As a separate and distinct part of site plan review, drawings and
plans shall be submitted to the city at a scale in sufficient detail to
illustrate clearly the design for which approval is sought.
      (2)   Such plans shall show the following:
         (a)   Existing conditions (both public and private) and natural
features, all structures and uses, improvements, public streets rights-of-way,
sidewalks, public and private easements and restrictions for the subject site
and immediately abutting property;
         (b)   Site plans showing buildings in plan view and showing site
features as they relate to property lines and to abutting properties and
buildings;
         (c)   Architectural drawings of all exterior building elevations,
colors of exterior walls, trims and roofs, lighting materials, ornamental,
pictorial or decorative material to be used in or about the exterior of the
structure. Samples of building materials and colors may be required to be
submitted; and
         (d)   Such other information as may be required by the Design Review
Committee to permit reasonable consideration of the application.
   (D)   Design Review Committee action. The Design Review Committee may
approve, conditionally approve or disapprove signs on behalf of the city.
Actions of the Design Review Committee on signs shall be appealable to the City
Council.
      (1)   Upon the granting of an approved design or amendment thereto, the
exterior drawings, sketches, landscape and site plans, renderings and materials
upon which an approved design or amendment was granted shall be turned over to
the Building Official, whose responsibility it shall be to determine, from
time-to-time as the project is in progress and finally upon its completion,
that there have been no deviations therefrom.
      (2)   It shall be the duty of the person, firm or corporation to whom an
approved design has been granted to comply therewith, and to obtain such
inspections as may be necessary in order to assure compliance. The Building
Official may notify such persons of any deficiencies found to exist. Failure to
comply with an approved design will constitute a violation of this chapter.
Before any use may be made of improvements constructed under these provisions
of design review, a final inspection of these premises must be obtained from
the Building Official.
   (E)   Design criteria.
      (1)   Criteria.
         (a)   The purpose of these criteria is to establish a checklist of
those items that affect the physical aspect of the Design Review District
environment. Pertinent to appearance is the design of the site, building and
structures, planting, signs, street hardware and miscellaneous other objects
which are observed by the public. The design guidelines established by the
Planning Commission shall serve as the guidelines for review by the Design
Review Committee.
         (b)   These criteria are not intended to restrict imagination,
innovation or variety, but rather to provide a guide for decision-making and
assist in focusing on design principles, which can result in creative solutions
that will continue to develop and enhance a satisfactory visual appearance
within the Design Review District.
      (2)   Relationship of building site.
         (a)   Parking areas where provided shall be treated with decorative
elements, building wall extensions, plantings, berms or other innovative means
so as to largely screen parking areas from view from public ways.
         (b)   To the extent reasonably feasible, the height and scale of each
building shall be compatible with its site and adjoining buildings. A building
may exceed the height of adjoining buildings up to the maximum height permitted
by ordinance, but said building shall be compatible with adjoining buildings in
regards to architectural style and exterior design features to the extent
reasonably feasible.
      (3)   Relationship of building and site to adjoining area.
         (a)   Adjacent buildings of different architectural styles that are in
harmony with the overall design guidelines shall be respected in the design or
alterations of a building site.
         (b)   To the extent reasonably feasible, harmony in texture, lines and
masses are required.
         (c)   To the extent reasonably feasible, the building and site shall
not be inconsistent with the character (as defined in this chapter) of the
area.
      (4)   Building design.
         (a)   Architectural style is not restricted. Evaluation of appearance
of a project shall be based on quality of its design and relationship to
surroundings.
         (b)   To the extent reasonably feasible, buildings shall have good
scale and be in harmonious conformance with permanent neighboring development.
         (c)   Materials shall have good architectural character and shall be
selected for harmony of the building with adjoining buildings.
         (d)   Materials shall be selected for suitability to the type of
buildings and the design in which they are used. Buildings shall have the same
materials, or those that are architecturally harmonious, used for all building
walls and other exterior building components wholly or partly visible from
public ways.
         (e)   Inappropriate materials and methods, and those which will
produce inconsistency with the structure of those building, shall be avoided.
         (f)   Materials shall be of durable quality.
         (g)   Building components, such as windows, doors, eaves and parapets,
shall have good proportions and relationship to one another.

(e.g., serving as a sign).
         (i)   Mechanical equipment or other utility hardware on roof, ground
or buildings shall be screened from public view with materials harmonious with
the building, or they shall be located so as not to be visible from any public
ways.
         (j)   Exterior lighting shall be part of the architectural concept.
Fixtures, standards and all exposed accessories shall be harmonious with
building design.
         (k)   Refuse and waste removal areas, service yards, storage yards’
and exterior work areas shall be screened from view from public ways, using
materials as stated in criteria for equipment screening.
         (l)   Inappropriate, incompatible, bizarre and exotic designs shall be
avoided.
         (m)   To the extent reasonably feasible, the building design shall not
be inconsistent with the character (as defined in this chapter) of the area.
   (F)   Signs. The provisions of this chapter in regard to signs shall be part
of the criteria of this division (F). In addition to zoning ordinance
standards, the design guidelines (available in the Engineering and Building
Department) established by the Planning Commission shall serve as a guide for
sign design.
      (1)   Wall signs shall be part of the architectural concept. Size, color,
lettering, location, and arrangement shall be harmonious with the building
design, and shall be compatible with signs in conformance with zoning standards
on adjoining buildings. Signs shall have good proportions.
      (2)   Identification signs of a prototype design shall conform to the
criteria for signs.
      (3)   Materials used in signs shall have good architectural character and
be harmonious with building design and surrounding landscape.
      (4)   Every sign shall have good scale in its design and in its visual
relationship to buildings and surroundings.
      (5)   Colors shall be used harmoniously. Brilliant colors shall be
avoided. Lighting shall be harmonious with the design. If external spot or
ground lighting is used, it shall be arranged so that the light source is
shielded from view.
   (G)   Miscellaneous structures and street hardware.
      (1)   Miscellaneous structures include any structures, other than
buildings, visible to view from any public way or ways. Street hardware
includes all objects not commonly referred to as structures and located in
streets and public ways and outside of buildings.
      (2)   Miscellaneous structures and street furniture located on private
property shall be designed to be part of the architectural concept of design
and landscape. Materials shall be compatible with buildings, scale shall be
good, colors shall be in a harmony with buildings and surroundings, and
proportions shall be attractive.
      (3)   Miscellaneous structures and street hardware located in public ways
and other public property shall be harmonious with design of adjacent buildings
and other structures and landscape.
      (4)   Lighting in connection with miscellaneous structures and street
hardware shall meet the criteria applicable to site, landscape, buildings and
signs.
      (5)   The provisions of this chapter in regard to area and bulk
regulations and standards, and of those portions of the Building Code which
directly affect appearance, shall be part of the criteria of this division (G).
   (H)   Maintenance; planning and design factors.
      (1)   Continued good appearance depends upon the extent and quality of
maintenance. The choice of materials and their use, together with the types of
finishes and other protective measures, must be conducive to easy maintenance
and upkeep.
      (2)   Materials and finishes shall be selected for their durability and
wear as well as for their beauty. Proper measures and devices shall be
incorporated for protection against the elements, neglects, damage and abuse.
      (3)   Provision for washing and cleaning of buildings and structures, and
control of dirt and refuse, shall be included in the design. Such
configurations that tend to catch and accumulate debris, leaves, trash, dirt
and rubbish shall be avoided.
   (I)   Exceptions. Existing single-family, two-family and multiple-family
dwellings shall be exempt from design review.

§ 190.321 CONFLICTING REGULATIONS.
   Wherever any provision of this chapter imposes more stringent requirements ,
regulations, restrictions or limitations than are imposed or required by the
provisions of any other law or ordinance, then the provisions of this chapter
shall govern. Whenever the provisions of any other law or ordinance impose more
stringent requirements than are imposed or required by this chapter, then the
provisions of such law or ordinance shall govern.
(Prior Code, App. A, § 2400) (Ord. 1277, passed 4-2-2007)
§ 190.322 NON-CONFORMITIES.
   No building or structure, or part thereof, shall hereafter be erected,
constructed or altered and maintained, and no new use or change shall be made
or maintained of any building, structure or land, or part thereof, except in
conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
   (A)   Intent.
      (1)   It is recognized that there exists within the districts established
by this chapter or amendments that may later be adopted, lots, structures and
uses of land and structures which were lawful before this chapter was passed or
amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms
of this chapter.
      (2)   It is the intent of this chapter to permit these non-conformities
to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. Such
uses are declared by this chapter to be incompatible with permitted uses in the
districts involved. It is further the intent of this chapter that non-
conformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as
grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same
district.
      (3)   A non-conforming use of a structure, a non-conforming use of land,
or a non- conforming use of a structure and land shall not be extended or
enlarged after passage of this chapter by attachment on a building or premises
of additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by the
addition of other uses of a nature which would be prohibited generally in the
district involved.
      (4)   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to
require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building
on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this chapter and upon which actual building
construction has been diligently carried on. Actual construction is hereby
defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position
and fastened in a permanent manner; except that where demolition or removal of
an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding,
such demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided
that work shall be diligently carried on until completion of the building
involved.
   (B)   Non-conforming lots. In any district in which single-family dwellings
are permitted, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this
chapter, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be
erected on any single lot of record or parcel with a minimum of 40 feet in
width, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter. This
provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for
area that are generally applicable in the district; provided that, yard
dimensions and other requirements not involving the area of the lot shall
conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located.
   (C)   Non-conforming uses of land. Where, at the effective date of adoption
or amendment of this chapter, lawful use of land exists that is made no longer
permissible under the terms of this chapter as enacted or amended, such use may
be continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions.
      (1)   No such non-conforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor
extended, to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this chapter.
      (2)   No such non-conforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to
any other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this chapter.
      (3)   If such non-conforming use of land ceases for any reason for a
period of more than 30 days, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to
the regulations specified by this chapter for the district in which such land
is located.
   (D)   Non-conforming structures. Where a lawful structure exists at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter by reason of
restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards or other characteristics of
the structure or its location on the lot, such structure may be continued so
long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions.
      (1)   No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which
increases its non- conformity.
      (2)   Should such structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of
more than 50% of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, it shall not
be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
      (3)   Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in
which it is located after it is moved.
   (E)   Non-conforming uses of structures and land. If a lawful use of a
structure, or of structure and land in combination, exists at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this chapter, that would not be allowed in the
district under the terms of this chapter, the lawful use may be continued so
long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions.
      (1)   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this
chapter in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered, except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located.
      (2)   Any non-conforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use, and which
existed at the time of adoption or amendment of this chapter, but no such use
shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building.
      (3)   If no structural alterations are made, any non-conforming use of a
structure, or structure and premises, may be changed to another non-conforming
use; provided that, the Board of Appeals, either by general rule or by making
findings in the specific case, shall find that the proposed use is equally
appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing non-
conforming use. In permitting such change, the Board of Appeals may require
appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with the purpose and intent of
this chapter.
      (4)   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which
a non- conforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter
conform to the regulations for the district in which such structure is located,
and the non-conforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
      (5)   When a non-conforming use of a structure, or structure and premises
in combination, is discontinued or ceases to exist for six consecutive months,
the structure, or structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter
be used, except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it
is located. Structures occupied by seasonal uses shall be excepted from this
provision.
      (6)   Where non-conforming use status applies to a structure and premises
in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
non-conforming status of the land.
   (F)   Repairs and maintenance.
      (1)   On any building devoted in whole or in part to any non-conforming
use, work may be done in any period of 12 consecutive months on ordinary
repairs, or on repair or replacement of non- bearing walls, fixtures, wiring or
plumbing to an extent not exceeding 50% of the true cash value of the building,
provided that the cubic content of the building as it existed at the time of
passage or amendment of this chapter shall not be increased. The repair and
maintenance or remodeling of buildings located in O-S, B-1, CBD or B-
2 Districts for uses allowed in such districts shall not be prohibited due to
inadequate off-street parking as required in §
190.324 of this chapter.
      (2)   Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the
strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof
declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public
safety, upon order of such official.
   (G)   Uses under special use provisions not conforming uses. Any existing
use for which a general exception or special approval is permitted as provided
in this chapter shall not be deemed a non- conforming use, but shall without
further action be deemed a conforming use in such district.
   (H)   Change of tenancy or ownership. There may be a change of tenancy,
ownership or management of any existing non-conforming uses of land, structures
and premises; provided, there is no change in the nature or character of such
non-conforming uses.
(Prior Code, App. A, § 2401) (Ord. 1277, passed 4-2-2007)
§ 190.323 ACCESSORY BUILDINGS AND USES.
   Accessory buildings, except as otherwise permitted in this chapter, shall be
subject to the following regulations.
   (A)   Where the accessory building is structurally attached to a main
building, it shall be subject to all regulations applicable to main buildings.
   (B)   To construct or replace an accessory building with a floor area of 200
square feet or less, a site plan shall be submitted, approved and a zoning
permit issued by the engineering and building department to the homeowner or
contractor to ensure proper placement as regulated by this chapter. The
accessory building must have a four-inch wide by 24-inch deep rat wall or a
four-inch concrete floor slab.
   (C)   Accessory residential buildings shall not be erected in any required
yard, except a rear yard.
   (D)   An accessory building shall not exceed 40% of the total rear yard in a
residential district; provided that, in no instance shall the accessory

accordance with an approved planting plan, planted to completion and approved
by the City Engineer prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy,
certificate of compliance, certificate of approval or certificate of conformity
unless the structure or required paving construction is completed in an off
planting season, in which case temporary certificates will be issued; however,
all required plantings shall be placed to completion within 60 days of the next
planting season. Failure to place the required plantings within 60 days of the
next planting season shall be grounds for termination or revocation of a
temporary certificate and subject the property owner to the fines and penalties
of §

      (3)   Sign permit fee. It shall be unlawful for any person to erect or
alter any sign, except those signs specifically exempted herein, unless a
permit shall first have been obtained from the Building Department for such
erection or alteration, and a permit fee paid to the city according to the
schedule as may be established from time to time by resolution of the City
Council.
      (4)   Sign permit revocable at any time. All rights and privileges
accrued under the provisions of this chapter or any amendment thereto are mere
licenses and may be voided upon the violation of any of the conditions
contained herein. If the work authorized under a sign or electrical permit has
not been completed within six months after date of issuance, said permit shall
become null and void and a new permit shall be necessary to continue the
project. Partially completed signs, if abandoned, shall be removed immediately
by the erector upon notice from the city.
   (I)   All existing signs that do not conform to the provisions of this
chapter shall be permitted to continue as non-conforming signs until such time
as they are removed or until there is a change in occupancy, at which time they
shall conform to the provisions of this chapter. The provision of this division
(I) shall not apply to maintenance and repainting.
   (J)   This chapter shall be enforced by the Building Official or an employee
designated by the City Council.
   (K)   (1)   Maintenance. All signs for which a permit is required, together
with all their supports, braces, guys and anchors, shall be maintained in good
working order, and when not galvanized or constructed of approved corrosion-
resistant, non-combustible materials, shall be painted when necessary to
prevent corrosion. The exteriors of all signs, supporting members, painted
surfaces, advertising materials and lettering shall be kept painted and in good
repair, so as to present a neat and orderly appearance. All bulbs or component
parts of the sign, including the electrical switches, boxes and wiring used in
the illumination of the sign must be well maintained.
      (2)   Housekeeping. It shall be the duty and responsibility of the owner
or lessee of every sign to maintain the immediate premises occupied by the sign
in a clean, sanitary and healthful condition.
   (L)   (1)   Signs shall be subject to inspections and when the condition of
the sign is questionable, the owner or occupant shall obtain a professional
engineer’s report, certifying the sign condition. Failure to submit the report
and make any specified correction will result in an order for the sign to be
removed.
      (2)   Sign support structures abandoned and no longer supporting a sign
shall be removed by the building owner within 30 days after receiving notice to
do so from the city. Should the owner fail to comply, the city, at the owner’s
expense, may order the work done on the owner’s behalf and the cost will be
assessed against the property.

§ 190.331 LOT AND PARCEL SPLITS.
   In no instance shall a certificate of occupancy be approved for a lot or
parcel split without the approval of the city. The sale or transfer of
ownership of a portion of such a lot or parcel or the detachment of a portion

to be less than the requirements of §
190.290 of this chapter, shall not be allowed. The following procedure shall be
followed in the undertaking of any lot or parcel split and any transfer of one
part of a lot or parcel to an abutting lot or parcel.
   (A)   Submissions. The developer or petitioner shall submit to the City
Engineer:
      (1)   One copy of an application for review of the proposed lot or parcel
split; and
      (2)   One copy of a sketch drawn to scale of the proposed lot or parcel
split indicating the following data:
         (a)   Name and address of the owner, subdivider or petitioner;
         (b)   Date, north arrow and scale, written and graphic;
         (c)   Boundary lines of the lot or parcel to be split;

      (1)   Should the City Engineer find that the proposed lot or parcel split
will not impair or does not create or increase the non-conforming condition or
create a lot or parcel which cannot be used under the terms of the zoning
ordinance, such lot or parcel split shall be approved.
      (2)   All lots or parcels resulting from a lot or parcel split shall be
suitable for development as zoned.
      (3)   Should the City Engineer find that the proposed lot or parcel split

appeal to the Zoning Board of Appeals.
(Prior Code, App. A, § 2410) (Ord. 1277, passed 4-2-2007)
§ 190.332 AREA, HEIGHT AND USE EXCEPTIONS.
   The regulations in this chapter shall be subject to the following
interpretations and exceptions.
   (A)   Essential services. Essential services shall be permitted as
authorized and regulated by law and other ordinances of the city; it being the
intention hereof to exempt such essential services from the application of this
chapter.
   (B)   Voting place. The provisions of this chapter shall not be so construed
as to interfere with the temporary use of any property as a voting place in
connection with a municipal or other public election.
   (C)   Height limit. The height limitations of this chapter shall not apply
to chimneys, church spires, flag poles or public monuments.
   (D)   Lots adjoining alleys. In calculating the area of a lot that adjoins a
vacated alley or lane, for the purpose of applying lot area requirements of
this chapter, one-half the width of such alley abutting the lot shall be
considered as part of such lot so long as the alley is part of the same
subdivision as the lot.
   (E)   Multiple-dwelling side yard. For the purpose of side yard regulations,
a two-family, a terrace, a row house or a multiple dwelling shall be considered
as one building occupying one lot.
   (F)   Projections into required open spaces.
      (1)   Outside stairways, fire escapes, vestibules, balconies, decks and
similar projections from a wall of a building and detached decks extending more
than two feet above the established grade shall not extend into any required
yard. A landing required for exit from a building of a maximum area of ten
square feet is allowed.
      (2)   Fences, walls, chimneys, bay windows or other obstructions more
than four feet above the established grade required for the proper maintenance
of the land, may occupy parts of the side yard but may not extend more than 16

line may occupy part of the rear yard, but not a side yard.
         (b)   Such occupancy shall not exceed 40% of the total rear yard in a
residential district.
         (c)   Accessory buildings attached to a principal building shall be
treated as a principal building.
         (d)   In a business district or industrial district, accessory
buildings, if not used for dwelling purposes, may occupy only the lot coverage
area allowed for the principal building.
      (4)   Unenclosed vehicle storage or loading space may occupy parts of a
side or rear yard and the area thus used shall not be computed in the total
percentage of lot coverage as long as it remains unenclosed.
      (5)   Structures four feet in height or less shall not be considered in
computing maximum per cent of lot coverage in residential districts.
      (6)   An unenclosed terrace porch may project six feet into a required
front yard and may include a fixed canopy or awning, but this shall not be
interpreted to include enclosed sides. An existing porch within a required
front yard or required side yard may be replaced, but may not be extended any
closer to the front or side property line. To construct or replace a deck or
porch with an area enclosed below the floor level with an access door for
storage, a four-inch wide by 24-inch deep ratwall or a four-inch concrete floor
slab is required.
      (7)   (a)   No more than two of the following type vehicles may be parked
and/or stored in permitted areas on residential lots:
            1.   Recreational type vehicles including travel trailers;
            2.   Non-recreational type vehicles including travel trailers;

horizontal distance between the rear lot line and the nearest line of the main
building. Any vehicle under this section may only be parked or stored on a hard
surface (such as concrete, blacktop or other comparable surfaces, but not
gravel). Any other vehicle not described above must be housed in a garage when
not in use.
      (8)   (a)   Private swimming pools shall not encroach on any front yard

feet from any rear or side property line or five feet from any street property
line, or ten feet from any transmission line.
         (c)   When a swimming pool is located on a corner lot, the side lot
line of which is substantially a continuation of the front lot line of the lot
to its rear, said swimming pool shall not be located closer to the street side
lot line than the existing front yard setback of the lot to the rear; provided,
the setback need not exceed ten feet.
      (9)   Mechanical equipment installed outside of one- or two-family
dwellings and their attached structures shall not be installed in any front
and/or side yard and shall be installed behind the structure and a minimum of

CONDITIONAL REZONING
Editor’s note:
   It is recognized that there are certain instances where it would be in the
best interests of the city, as well as advantageous to property owners seeking
a change in zoning boundaries, if certain conditions could be proposed by
property owners as part of a request for rezoning. It is the intent of this
subchapter to provide a process consistent with the provisions of § 405, State
Zoning Enabling Act 110 of 2006 (M.C.L.A. § 125.3405) by which an owner seeking
a rezoning may voluntarily propose conditions regarding the use and/or
development of land as part of the rezoning request.
§ 190.345 APPLICATION AND OFFER OF CONDITIONS.
   (A)   An owner of land may voluntarily offer in writing conditions relating
to the use and/or development of land for which a rezoning is requested. This
offer may be made either at the time the application for rezoning is filed, or
may be made at a later time during the rezoning process.
   (B)   The required application and process for considering a rezoning
request with conditions shall be the same as that for considering rezoning
requests made without any offer of conditions, except as modified by the
requirements of this section.
   (C)   The owner’s offer of conditions may not purport to authorize uses or
developments not permitted in the requested new zoning district.
   (D)   The owner’s offer of conditions shall bear a reasonable and rational
relationship to the property for which rezoning is requested.
   (E)   Any use of development proposed as part of an offer of conditions that
would require a special land use permit under the terms of the ordinance may
only be commenced if a special land use permit for such use or development is
ultimately granted in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
   (F)   Any use or development proposed as part of an offer of conditions that
require variance under the terms of this chapter may only be commenced if a
variance for such use or development is ultimately granted by the Zoning Board
of Appeals in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
   (G)   Any use or development proposed as part of an offer of conditions that
would require site plan approval under the terms of this chapter may only be
commenced if site plan approval for such use or development is ultimately
granted in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
   (H)   The offer of conditions may be amended during the process of rezoning
consideration; provided that, any amended or additional conditions are entered
voluntarily by the owner. An owner may withdraw all or part of its offer of
conditions any time prior to final rezoning action provided that, if such
withdrawal occurs subsequent to the Planning Commission’s public hearing on the
original rezoning request, then the rezoning application shall be referred to
the Planning Commission for a new public hearing on the original rezoning
request, then the rezoning application shall be referred to the Planning
Commission for a new public hearing with appropriate notice and a new
recommendation.

25-2010)
§ 190.346 PLANNING COMMISSION REVIEW.
   The Planning Commission, after public hearing and consideration of the
factors for rezoning, recommends approval, approval with recommended changes or
denial of the rezoning; provided, however, that, any recommended changes to the
offer of conditions are acceptable to and thereafter offered by the owner.

§ 190.347 CITY COUNCIL REVIEW.
   After receipt of the Planning Commission’s recommendations, the City Council
shall deliberate upon the requested rezoning and may approve or deny the
conditional rezoning request. The City Council’s deliberations shall include,
but not be limited to, a consideration of the factors for rezoning of this
chapter. Should the City Council consider amendments to the proposed
conditional rezoning advisable and if such contemplated amendments to the offer
of conditions are acceptable to and thereafter offered by the owner, then the
City Council shall, in accordance with § 405 of the state’s Zoning Enabling Act
(M.C.L.A. § 125.3405), refer such amendments to the Planning Commission for a
report thereon within a time specified by the City Council and proceed
thereafter in accordance with said statute to deny or approve the conditional
rezoning with or without amendments.

1-25-2010)
§ 190.348 APPROVAL.
   (A)   If the City Council finds the rezoning request and offer of conditions
acceptable, the offered conditions shall be incorporated into a formal written
statement of conditions acceptable to the owner and conforming in form to the
provisions of this section. The statement of conditions shall be incorporated
by attachment or otherwise as an inseparable part of the ordinance adopted by
the City Council to accomplish the requested zoning.
   (B)   The statement of conditions shall:
      (1)   Be in a form recordable with the Register of Deeds of the county
or, in the alternative, be accompanied by a recordable affidavit or memorandum
prepared and signed by the owner giving notice of the statement of conditions
in a manner acceptable to the City Council;
      (2)   Contain a legal description of the land to which it pertains;
      (3)   Contain a statement acknowledging that the statement of conditions
runs with the land and is binding upon successor owners of the land;
      (4)   Incorporate by attachment or reference any diagram, plans or other
documents submitted or approved by the owner that are necessary to illustrate
the implementation of the statement of conditions. If any such documents are
incorporated by reference, the reference shall specify where the documents may
be examined;
      (5)   Contain a statement acknowledging that the statement of conditions
or an affidavit or memorandum giving notice thereof may be recorded by the city
with the Register of Deeds of the county; and
      (6)   Contain the notarized signatures of all of the owners of the
subject land preceded by a statement attesting to the fact that they
voluntarily offer and consent to the provisions contained within the statement
of conditions.
   (C)   Upon rezoning taking effect, the zoning map shall be amended to
reflect the new zoning classification along with a designation that the land
was rezoned with a statement of conditions. The City Clerk shall maintain a
listing of all lands rezoned with a statement of conditions.
   (D)   The approved statement of conditions or an affidavit or memorandum
giving notice thereof shall be filed by the city with the Register of Deeds of
the county. The City Council shall have authority to waive this requirement if
it determines that, given the nature of the conditions and/or the time frame
within which the conditions are to be satisfied, the recording of such a
document would be of no material benefit to the city or to any subsequent owner
of the land.
   (E)   Upon the rezoning taking effect, the use of the land so rezoned shall
conform thereafter to all the requirements regulating use and development
within the new zoning district as modified by any more restrictive provisions
contained in the statement of conditions.

§ 190.349 COMPLIANCE WITH CONDITIONS.
   (A)   Any person who establishes a development or commences a use upon land
that has been rezoned with conditions shall continuously operate and maintain
the development or use is in compliance with all of the conditions set for in
the statement of conditions. Any failure to comply with a condition contained
within the statement of conditions shall constitute a violation of this chapter
and be punishable accordingly. Additionally, any such violation shall be deemed
a nuisance per se and subject to judicial abatement as provided by law.
   (B)   No permit or approval shall be granted under this chapter for any uses
or development that is contrary to an applicable statement of conditions.

§ 190.350 TIME PERIOD FOR ESTABLISHING DEVELOPMENT OR USE.
   (A)   Unless another time period is specified in the ordinance rezoning the
subject land, the approved development and/or use of the land pursuant to
building and other required permits must be commenced upon the land within 18
months after the rezoning took effect and thereafter proceed diligently to
completion.
   (B)   This time limitation may upon written request be extended by the City
Council if:
      (1)   It is demonstrated to the City Council’s reasonable satisfaction
that there is a strong likelihood that the development and/or use will commence
within the period of extension and proceed diligently thereafter to completion;
and
      (2)   The City Council finds that there has not been a change in
circumstances that would render the current zoning with statement of conditions
incompatible with other zones and uses in the surrounding area or otherwise
inconsistent with sound zoning policy.

§ 190.351 REVERSION OF ZONING.
   If approved development and/or use of the rezoned land do not occur within
the time frame specified under §
190.350 of this chapter, then the land shall revert to its former zoning
classification as set forth in the state’s Zoning Enabling Act (M.C.L.A. §
125.3405). The reversion process shall be initiated by the City Council
requesting that the Planning Commission proceed with consideration of rezoning
of the land to its former zoning classification. The procedure for considering
and making this reversionary rezoning shall thereafter be the same as applies
to all other rezoning requests.

   When land that is rezoned with a statement of conditions is thereafter
rezoned to a different zoning classification or to the same zoning
classification, but with a different or no statement of conditions, whether as
a result of a reversion of zoning pursuant to §
190.351 of this chapter or otherwise, the statement of conditions imposed under
the former zoning classification shall cease to be in effect. Upon the owner’s
written request, the City Clerk shall record with the Register of Deeds of the
county that the statement of conditions is no longer in effect.

   Nothing in the statement of conditions nor in the provisions of this section
shall be deemed to prohibit the city from rezoning all or any portion of land
that is subject to a statement of conditions to another zoning classification.
Any rezoning shall be conducted in compliance with this chapter and the state’s
Zoning Enabling Act (M.C.L.A. § 125.3405).

   (A)   The Board shall adopt general rules and regulations governing its
procedure and shall make rules for the filing of appeals and other matters
requiring its attention which shall not cause unreasonable delays in the
transaction of its business. Hearings shall be held on all appeals. The Board
shall cause to be given notice to all owners of property as required by Public

(Prior Code, App. A, § 2702) (Ord. 1277, passed 4-2-2007)
§ 190.393 APPEALS, HOW TAKEN.
   Appeals shall be taken within such time as shall be prescribed by the Board

Zoning Board of Appeals and with the official from whom an appeal is taken who
shall forthwith transmit to the Board all papers constituting the record upon
which the appeal is taken. An appeal stays all the proceedings in furtherance
of the action appealed from unless the official from whom the appeal was taken
certifies to the Board, after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with
him or her, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in
his or her opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property, in which case
proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may
be granted by the Board, Circuit Court or other court of jurisdiction or notice
on application to the official from whom the appeal was taken and on due cause
shown.
(Prior Code, App. A, § 2703) (Ord. 1277, passed 4-2-2007)
§ 190.394 POWERS AND DUTIES.
   (A)   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall not have the power to alter or
change the zoning district classification of any property, nor to make any
change in the terms of this chapter, but does have power to act on those
matters where this chapter provides for an administrative review,
interpretation and to authorize a variance as defined in this section and laws
of the state.
   (B)   Said powers include:
      (1)   Administrative review. To hear and decide appeals where it is
alleged by the appellant that there is an error in any order, requirement,
permit, decision or refusal made by the Building Official or any other
administrative official in carrying out or enforcing any provisions of this
chapter; and
      (2)   Exceptions and special approvals. To hear and decide in accordance
with the provisions of this chapter, requests, for interpretations of the
zoning text and zoning map, and for decisions on special approval situations on
which this chapter specifically authorities the Board to pass. Any exception or
special approval permit shall be subject to such conditions as the Board may
require to preserve and promote the character of the zone district in question
and otherwise promote the purpose of this chapter.
   (C)   Variance: to authorize the following upon an appeal:
      (1)   A non-use variance from the strict applications of the provisions
of this chapter where by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, shape
or area of a specific piece of property at the time of enactment of this
chapter or by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other
extraordinary or exceptional conditions of such property, the strict
application of the regulations enacted would result in peculiar or exceptional
practical difficulties in the use of the property in question upon the owner of
such property; provided, such relief may be granted without substantial
detriment to the public good and without substantially impairing the intent and
purpose of this chapter. In granting a variance, the Board may attach thereto
such conditions regarding the location, character and other features of the
proposed use as it may deem reasonable in furtherance of the purpose of this
chapter. A non-use variance shall require a majority vote of the membership of
the Board to reverse a determination of an administrative official. The
applicant must show practical difficulty by demonstrating that:
         (a)   Strict compliance with area, setbacks, frontage, height, bulk or
density would unreasonably prevent the owner from using the property for a
permitted purpose, or would render conformity unnecessarily burdensome;
         (b)   A variance would do substantial justice to the applicant as well
as to other property owners in the district, or whether a lesser relaxation
would give substantial relief and be more consistent with justice to others;
         (c)   The plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances of the
property; and
         (d)   The problem is not self-created.
      (2)   A use variance for a use not permitted in the zoning district in
which the property is located subject to the following procedure.
         (a)   Procedure. A request for rezoning of the property in question
shall be made in accord with zoning ordinance amendment procedure before a
request for a use variance is made.
         (b)   Information required. In addition to the information required
for other variance requests, an application for a use variance under this
section shall include a plan drawn to scale detailing the specific use and
improvements proposed by the applicant, and a summary of the facts which must
support all of the following conclusions to demonstrate the showing of
unnecessary hardship:
            1.   Applicant’s property cannot be used for the purposes permitted
in the zoning districts;
            2.   Applicant’s plight is due to unique circumstances peculiar to
his or her property and not to general neighborhood conditions;
            3.   Applicant’s suggested use would not alter the essential
character of the area;
            4.   Applicant’s problem has not been self-created; and
            5.   Unavailability of administrative relief which may afford
reasonable use of applicant’s property.
         (c)   Pre-hearing conference. Prior to the scheduling of a hearing,
the applicant shall contact the Building Official for the purpose of scheduling
a pre-hearing conference between the applicant, the city’s Building Official
and the City Attorney and others as may be deemed appropriate by the city. The
purpose of the pre-hearing conference shall be to:
            1.   Review the procedure for the hearing and identify all persons
who will testify (directly or through affidavit) and the evidence to be offered
on behalf of the applicant;
            2.   Attempt to secure a statement of agreed-upon facts to be used
to narrow the matters of dispute and shorten the hearing;
            3.   Explore a means of providing relief by way of non-use variance
from the Zoning Board of Appeals, or other relief which may require action by
persons or bodies other than the Zoning Board of Appeals which will afford an
adequate remedy for the applicant; and
            4.   The pre-hearing conference shall be scheduled and conducted on
an expeditious basis so as to avoid unreasonable delay to the applicant.
Sufficient time shall be taken, however, to achieve the purposes of the pre-
hearing conference stated above.
         (d)   Use variance decision by the Board of Appeals.
            1.   A use variance shall require a two-thirds vote of the
membership of the Board to reverse a determination of an administrative
official.
            2.   The Zoning Board of Appeals may deem it appropriate in any
given case to provide an opportunity for anyone presenting testimony or
evidence to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions.
            3.   At the conclusion of the hearing, the Zoning Board of Appeals
may make its decision at that meeting, or it may adjourn the hearing to a new
date for the purpose of reviewing the testimony and evidence, and reviewing
proposed findings and conclusions submitted by hearing participants, in
preparation for making its decision.
            4.   If the Zoning Board of Appeals determines to grant variance
relief, it shall be the minimum relief required to allow reasonable use of the
property, while maintaining the essential character of the area. Such relief
may be in the form of one or more non-use variances and/or in the form of a use
variance. The motion may include conditions that are authorized by law.
            5.   If the Zoning Board of Appeals adopts a motion to grant
variance relief, such motion may be made as a tentative grant of relief subject
to review by the Planning Commission or other person or official with
expertise, with a view of obtaining recommendations on any conditions that may
be relevant and authorized by law, and for the further purpose of ensuring that
the grant of relief would not violate applicable law. If such a tentative grant
of relief is approved, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall request the completion
of all reviews by other commissions or persons by a specific date.
   (D)   Permit the modification of automobile parking space requirements
where, in the particular instance, such modification will not be inconsistent
with the purpose and intent of such requirements, or where the provision of the
required amount of parking spaces would create undue hardship or practical
difficulty in existing business areas, in the opinion of the Board.
   (E)   The Board may issue temporary building or use permits during periods
of construction.
(Prior Code, App. A, § 2704) (Ord. 1277, passed 4-2-2007)
§ 190.395 STANDARDS.
   (A)   Each case before the Zoning Board of Appeals shall be considered as an
individual case and shall conform to the detailed application of the following
standards in a manner appropriate to the particular circumstances of such case.
All uses as listed in any district requiring board approval for a permit shall
be of such location, size and character that, in general, it will be in harmony
with the appropriate and orderly development of the district in which it is
situated and will not be detrimental to the orderly development of adjacent
districts and to adjacent uses.
   (B)   The Board shall give consideration to the following:
      (1)   The location and size of the use;
      (2)   The nature and intensity of the operations involved in or conducted
in connection with it;
      (3)   Its size, layout and its relation to pedestrian and vehicular
traffic to and from the use;

intensity of development of the neighborhood;
      (7)   The location and height of buildings, the location, nature and
height of walls, fences and the nature and extent of landscaping of the site
shall be such that the use will not hinder or discourage the appropriate
development and use of adjacent land and buildings or impair the value thereof;
      (8)   The nature of filling or excavation which may be necessary to
utilize the site, shall be such that the use will not hinder or discourage the
appropriate development and use of adjacent land and buildings or impair the
value thereof, and such filling or excavation shall not be injurious to the
surrounding neighborhood and not contrary to the spirit and purpose of this
chapter;
      (9)   The nature, location, size and site layout of the uses shall be
such that it will be a harmonious part of the district in which it is situated
taking into account, among other things, prevailing shopping habits,
convenience of access by prospective patrons and the physical and economic
relationship of one type of use to another;
      (10)   The location, size, intensity and site layout of the use shall be
such that its operations will not be objectionable to nearby dwellings, by
reason of noise, fumes or flash of lights to a greater degree than is normal
with respect to the proximity of commercial to residential uses, nor interfere
with an adequate supply of light and air, nor increase the danger of fire or
otherwise endanger the public safety; and
      (11)   Where a variance is granted, the requirements of the Building Code
shall be met.
