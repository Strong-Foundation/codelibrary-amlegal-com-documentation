Chapter 1 - Code Introduction
Section 100 - General Provisions
100.01   Code Designation; Citation.
   The chapters, articles, sections and subdivisions embraced in this Code of
Ordinances shall constitute and be designated as "The Code of Ordinances of the
City of Arden Hills," and may be so cited. This code may also be cited as the
"Arden Hills City Code." Internal references to the Arden Hills City Code may
be made as "this code" or "the code." All references and citations to this code
shall be deemed to include all additions and amendments to the code. All
references to chapters or sections are to the chapters and sections of this
code unless otherwise specified.
   State law reference - Authority to codify ordinances, M.S. §§ 412.191 (5),
415.021
100.02   Additions.
   New ordinances proposing amendments or additions to the code shall be
assigned appropriate code numbers and shall be incorporated into the code as of
their effective date. Reference or citation to the code shall be deemed to
include such amendments and additions. When an ordinance is integrated into the
code, there may be omitted from the ordinance the title, enacting clause,
section numbers, definitions of terms identical to those contained in this
code, the clause indicating date of adoption, and validating signatures and
dates. In integrating ordinances into the code, the city administrator, in
cooperation with the city attorney, may correct obvious grammatical,
punctuation and spelling errors; change reference numbers to conform with
sections, articles and chapters; substitute figures for written words and vice
versa; substitute dates for the words "the effective date of this ordinance";
and perform like actions to insure a uniform code of ordinances without,
however, altering the meaning of the ordinances enacted.
100.03   Numbering.
   Each section number of this code consists of two component parts separated
by a decimal. The first digit of the number refers to the chapter number and
the digits after the period refer to the position of the section within the
chapter. If the chapter is divided into parts, the figure immediately to the
left of the decimal corresponds to the part number.
100.04   Title Headings; Cross References.
   Chapter, part, section, subdivision and other titles shall not be considered
part of the subject matter of this code but are intended for convenience only
and not necessarily as comprehensive titles.
100.05   Copies.
   Copies of this code shall be kept in the office of the city administrator
for public inspection or sale for a reasonable charge, as determined by the
City Council.
100.06   Existing Rights and Liabilities.
   The repeal of prior ordinances and adoption of this code are not to be
construed to affect in any manner rights and liabilities existing at the time
of repeal and the enactment of this code. Insofar as provisions in this code
are substantially the same as pre existing ordinances, they shall be considered
as continuations and not as new enactments. Any act done, offense committed or
right accruing or liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment incurred or
assessed prior to the effective date of this code is not affected by the
enactment of the code.
100.07   Effect of Repeals or Amendments.
   The repeal or amendment of any portion of this code shall not revive any
ordinance in force before or at the time the code or amendment took effect. The
repeal of any section shall not affect any punishment or penalty incurred
before the repeal took effect, nor any suit, prosecution or proceeding pending
at the time of such repeal, for an offense committed or cause of action arising
under the section repealed.
100.08   Severability of Parts of Code.
   The sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses and phrases of this code are
severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section of this
code shall be declared invalid, unenforceable or unconstitutional by the valid
judgment of decree of a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity,
unenforceability or unconstitutionality shall not affect any of the remaining
phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs or sections of this code.

Section 240 - Background Investigations
(added 1/21/09)
240.01   Background Investigations.
   The purpose and intent of this section is to establish regulations that will
allow law enforcement access to Minnesota's Computerized Criminal History
information for specified non-criminal purposes of employment background checks
for the positions described below and for licensing background checks for the
licenses listed below.
   The Ramsey County Sheriff's Department is authorized, as the exclusive law
enforcement agency for the City of Arden Hills, to do a criminal history
background investigation on the applicants and contractors for the following
positions and licenses within the City:
   ∙   Regular full-time and part-time positions
   ∙   Associate positions
   ∙   Volunteer positions
   ∙   Independent contractors for the Recreation Division
   ∙   Liquor License
   ∙   Tobacco License
   ∙   Massage Therapy License
   ∙   Gambling License
   ∙   Solicitor License
   In conducting the criminal history background investigation in order to
screen employment applicants, volunteers, certain independent contractors, and
license applicants, the Ramsey County Sheriff's Department is authorized to
access data maintained in the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension's (BCA)
Computerized Criminal History information system in accordance with BCA policy.
Any data that is accessed and acquired shall be maintained at the Ramsey County
Sheriff's Department under the care and custody of the chief law enforcement
official or his or her designee. A summary of the results of the Computerized
Criminal History data may be released by the Ramsey County Sheriff's Department
to the hiring/licensing authority, to include the City Administrator or their
designee and/or consultants as appropriate.
   Before the investigation is undertaken, the applicant/volunteer/independent
contractor/license applicant must authorize the Ramsey County Sheriff's
Department by written consent to undertake the investigation. Failure to
provide consent may disqualify the individual from the prospective position or
may disqualify the license applicant from the prospective license. The written
consent must fully comply with the provisions of Minnesota Statute Chapter 13
regarding the collection, maintenance and use of the information. For positions
of employment, background checks will only be conducted on finalists.
   Except for the positions set forth in Minnesota Statutes Section 364.09, the
City will not reject an applicant for employment on the basis of the
applicant's prior conviction unless the crime is directly related to the
position of employment sought. If the City rejects the applicant's request on
this basis, the City shall notify the applicant in writing, including all of
the information as required in Minnesota Statute 364.05.

Section 335 - Residential Rental Unit Registration (revised 6/8/09)

residential rental properties with less than five dwelling units in order to

will not foster blight and deterioration; and/or will not create a disincentive
to reinvestment in the community. Furthermore, the operation or rental units
entails certain responsibilities. Owners of rental units are required to take
the reasonable necessary steps to ensure that the citizens who occupy rental
units may pursue the quiet enjoyment of the normal activities of life in the
surrounding area that are: safe, secure, and sanitary; free from crimes and
criminal activity, noise, nuisances or annoyances; free from unreasonable fears

Section 350 - Tobacco Products
350.01   Purpose and Intent.
Because the City recognizes that:
   Tobacco use has been shown to be the cause of several serious health
problems which subsequently place a financial burden on all levels of
government; this ordinance is intended to regulate the sale of tobacco,
tobacco-related devices, electronic delivery devices, and nicotine or lobelia
delivery products for the purpose of enforcing and furthering existing laws,
and to protect youth and young adults against the serious effects associated
with use and initiation.
   The use of tobacco products has devastating health and economic
consequences. Tobacco use is the foremost preventable cause of premature death
in America. It causes half a million deaths annually and has been responsible
for 20.8 million premature deaths in the U.S. over the past 50 years since the
first Surgeon General’s report on smoking in 1964. This leads to more than $300
billion in health care and lost worker productivity costs each year. In
Minnesota, smoking was responsible for $3.19 billion in excess medical
expenditures and the deaths of 6,312 individuals in 2014.
   Youth and young people are particularly susceptible to the addictive
properties of tobacco products, and are particularly likely to become lifelong
users. An estimated 5.6 million youth aged 0 to 17 are projected to die
prematurely from a tobacco-related illness if prevalence rates do not change.
National data show that about 95 percent of adult smokers begin smoking before
they turn 21. The ages of 18 to 21 are a critical period when many smokers move
from experimental smoking to regular, daily use. Electronic delivery device use
among youth has recently tripled. Young minds are particularly susceptible to
the addictive properties of nicotine. As a result, approximately 3 out of 4
teen smokers end up smoking into adulthood.
   Public health research and tobacco industry documents and marketing reveal
that tobacco companies have used fruit, candy, and alcohol flavors as a way to
target youth and young adults. The presence of flavors such as menthol in
tobacco products can make it more difficult for youth, young adults, and adult
tobacco users to quit.
   This ordinance is intended to regulate the sale of tobacco, tobacco-related
devices, electronic delivery devices, and nicotine or lobelia delivery products
to protect the public, especially youth and young adults, and to further the
official public policy of the state in regard to preventing young people from
starting to smoke as stated in Minn. Stat. § 144.391, as it may be amended from
time to time.
   In making these findings, the City Council accepts the conclusions and
recommendations of the U.S. Surgeon General reports, “E-cigarette Use Among
Youth and Young Adults” (2016), “The Health Consequences of Smoking—50 Years of
Progress” (2014) and “Preventing Tobacco Use Among Youth and Young Adults”
(2012); a BlueCross BlueShield of Minnesota report, “Health Care Costs and
Smoking in Minnesota: The Bottom Line” (2017); the Institute of Medicine in
their study, “Public Health Implications of Raising the Minimum Age of Legal
Access to Tobacco Products” (2015); the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in their studies, “Tobacco Use Among Middle and High School
Students—United States, 2011– 2015,” and “Selected Cigarette Smoking Initiation
and Quitting Behaviors Among High School Students, United States, 1997”; and of
the following scholars in these scientific journals: Xin Xu et al., Annual
Healthcare Spending Attributable to Cigarette Smoking: An Update, Am. J. Prev.

United States,” Oncogene (2002) 21, 7326-40; Khuder SA, et al., “Age at Smoking

satisfactorily and timely complete all restoration required by the City, the
City at its option may do such work. In that event the permittee shall pay to

permit, registrants must agree among themselves as to the portion each will pay
and indicate the same on their applications.
   Subd. 3   With City Projects. Registrants who join in a scheduled
obstruction or excavation performed by the City, whether or not it is a joint
application by two or more registrants or a single application, are not
required to pay the excavation or obstruction and degradation portions of the

360.14   Supplementary Applications.
   Subd. 1   Limitation on Area. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the
area of the right-of-way specified in the permit. No permittee may do any work
outside the area specified in the permit, except as provided herein. Any
permittee which determines that an area greater than that specified in the
permit must be obstructed or excavated must before working in that greater
area:

required thereby; and
      B.    Be granted a new permit or permit extension.

permit or an extension of the old permit before working after the end date of
the previous permit. This supplementary application must be submitted before
the permit end date.
360.15   Other Obligations.
   Subd. 1   Compliance With Other Laws. Obtaining a right-of-way permit does
not relieve permittee of its duty to obtain all other necessary permits,
licenses and authority and to pay all fees required by the City or other
applicable rule, law or regulation. A permittee shall comply with all
requirements of local, state and federal laws, including M.S. §§ 216D.01
through 216D.09, as amended from time to time, (Gopher One Call Excavation
Notice System). A permittee shall perform all work in conformance with all
applicable codes and established rules and regulations, and is responsible for
all work done in the right-of-way pursuant to its permit, regardless of who
does the work. A permittee seeking the placement of a new wireless support
structure for the siting of a small wireless facility in a right-of-way as
authorized by law, may also be required to obtain a conditional use permit
under this Code if the siting is proposed in a district zoned for single-family
residential use or within a historic district so designated at the time of
application.
   Subd. 2   Prohibited Work. Except in an emergency, and with the approval of
the City, no right-of-way obstruction or excavation may be done when seasonally
prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable for such work.

a right-of-way that the natural free and clear passage of water through the
gutters or other waterways shall be interfered with. Private vehicles of those

area, unless parked in conformance with City parking regulations. The loading
or unloading of trucks must be done solely within the defined permit area
unless specifically authorized by the permit.
360.16   Denial of Permit.
   The City may deny a permit for failure to meet the requirements and
conditions of state or federal law, this section or other provisions of City
Code, or if the City determines that the denial is necessary to protect the
health, safety, and welfare or when necessary to protect the right-of-way and
its current use. The City shall notify the telecommunications right-of-way user
in writing within three business days of the decision to deny and the basis for
the denial. The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the City and
resubmit its application. If the applicant resubmits the application within 30
days of receiving written notice of the denial, it shall not be charged an
additional filing or processing fee. The City shall approve or deny the revised
application within 30 days after the revised application is submitted.
360.17   Installation Requirements.

      A.    At the time of inspection the director may order the immediate
cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the life, health, safety
or well-being of the public.
      B.    The City may issue an order to the permittee for any work which
does not conform to the terms of the permit or other applicable standards,
conditions or codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the
violation will be cause for revocation of the permit. Within ten (10) days
after issuance of the order, the permittee shall present proof to the City that
the violation has been corrected. If such proof has not been presented within
the required time, the City may revoke the permit pursuant to Subsection
360.21.
360.19    Work Done Without a Permit.
   Subd. 1   Emergency Situations.
      A.   Each registrant shall immediately notify the director of any event
regarding its facilities which it considers to be an emergency. The registrant
may proceed to take whatever actions are necessary to respond to the emergency.

registrant shall apply for the necessary permits, pay the fees associated
therewith and fulfill the rest of the requirements necessary to bring itself
into compliance with this section for the actions it took in response to the
emergency.
      B.   If the City becomes aware of an emergency regarding a registrant's
facilities, the City will attempt to contact the local representative of each
registrant affected, or potentially affected, by the emergency. In any event,
the City may take whatever action it deems necessary to respond to the
emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the registrant whose facilities
occasioned the emergency.
   Subd. 2   Non-Emergency Situations. Except in an emergency, any person who,
without first having obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or excavates or
places any facility or structure in a right-of-way must subsequently obtain a
permit, and as a penalty pay double the normal fee for said permit, pay double
all the other fees required by the City code, deposit with the City the fees
necessary to correct any damage to the right-of-way and comply with all of the
requirements of this section.
360.20    Supplementary Notification.
   If the project, obstruction or excavation of the right-of-way begins later
or ends sooner than the date given on the permit, permittee shall notify the
City of the accurate information as soon as this information is known.
360.21   Revocation of Permits.
   Subd. 1   Substantial Breach. The City reserves its right, as provided
herein, to revoke any right-of-way permit, without a fee refund, if there is a
substantial breach of the terms and conditions of any statute, ordinance, rule
or regulation, or any material condition of the permit. A substantial breach by
permittee shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following:
      A.   The violation of any material provision of the right-of-way permit;
      B.   An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the right-
of-way permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit
upon the City or its citizens;
      C.   Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a
right-of-way permit;
      D.   The failure to complete the work in a timely manner; unless a permit
extension is obtained or unless the failure to complete work is due to reasons
beyond the permittee's control; or
      E.   The failure to correct, in a timely manner, work that does not
conform to a condition indicated on an order issued pursuant to 360.18.
   Subd. 2   Written Notice of Breach. If the City determines that the
permittee has committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any
statute, ordinance, rule, regulation or any condition of the permit the City
shall make a written demand upon the permittee to remedy such violation. The
demand shall state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the
permit. A substantial breach, as stated above, will allow the City, at his or
her discretion, to place additional or revised conditions on the permit to
mitigate and remedy the breach.
   Subd. 3   Response to Notice of Breach. Within twenty-four (24) hours of
receiving notification of the breach, the permittee shall provide the City with
a plan, acceptable to the City, that will cure the breach. The permittee's
failure to so contact the City, failure to timely submit an acceptable plan, or
failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be cause for immediate
revocation of the permit. Further, the permittee's failure to so contact the
City, failure to submit an acceptable plan, or failure to reasonably implement
the approved plan, shall automatically place the permittee on probation for one
(1) full year.
   Subd. 4   Cause for probation. From time to time, the City may establish a
list of conditions of the permit, which if breached will automatically place
the permittee on probation for one full year, such as, but not limited to,
working out of the allotted time period or working on right-of-way grossly
outside of the permit authorization.
   Subd. 5   Automatic Revocation. If a permittee, while on probation, commits
a breach as outlined above, permittee's permit will automatically be revoked
and permittee will not be allowed further permits for one full year, except for
emergency repairs. Notice of the revocation shall be mailed to the permittee
within three business days of the decision.
   Subd. 6   Reimbursement of City Costs. If a permit is revoked, the permittee

otherwise available to cities.
   Subd. 2   The City may assign specific area within the right-of-way, or any
particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of facilities
that is or, pursuant to current technology, the City expects will someday be
located within the right-of-way. All excavation, obstruction or other permits
issued by the City involving the installation or replacement of facilities
shall designate the proper corridor for the facilities at issue. Any registrant
who has facilities in the right-of-way in a position at variance with the
corridors established by the City shall, no later than at the time of the next
reconstruction or excavation of the area where the facilities are located, move
the facilities to the assigned position within the right-of-way, unless this
requirement is waived by the City for good cause shown, upon consideration of
such factors as the remaining economic life of the facilities, public safety,
customer service needs and hardship to the registrant.
   Subd. 3   One year after the passage of this section, any facilities found
in a right-of-way that have not been registered shall be deemed to be a
nuisance. The City may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in
equity, including, but not limited to, abating the nuisance or taking
possession of the facilities and restoring the right-of-way to a useable
condition.
   Subd. 4   Limitation of Space. To protect health, safety and welfare or when
necessary to protect the right-of-way and its current use, the City shall have
the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional facilities
within the right-of-way. In making such decisions, the City shall strive to the
extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the right-
of-way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the public interest,
the public's needs for the particular utility service, the condition of the
right-of-way, the time of year with respect to essential utilities, the
protection of existing facilities in the right-of-way, and future City plans
for public improvements and development projects which have been determined to
be in the public interest.
360.24   Pre-excavation Facilities Location.
   In addition to complying with the requirements of M.S. §§ 216D.01 through

facilities or equipment in the area to be excavated shall mark the horizontal
and vertical placement of all said facilities. Any registrant whose facilities
are less than twenty (20) inches below a concrete or asphalt surface shall
notify and work closely with the excavation contractor to establish the exact
location of its facilities and the best procedure for excavation.
360.25   Damage to Other facilities.
   When the City does work in the right-of-way and finds it necessary to
maintain, support or move a registrant's facilities to protect it, the City
shall notify the local representative as early as is reasonably possible. The
costs associated therewith will be billed to that registrant and must be paid
within thirty (30) days from the date of billing. Each registrant shall be
responsible for the cost of repairing any facilities in the right-of-way which
it or its facilities damages. Each registrant shall be responsible for the cost
of repairing any damage to the facilities of another registrant caused during
the City's response to an emergency occasioned by that registrant's facilities.
360.26   Right-of-Way Vacation.
   If the City vacates a right-of-way which contains the facilities of a
registrant, the registrant's rights in the vacated right-of-way are governed by
Minnesota Rules 7819.3200.
360.27   Indemnification and Liability.
   By registering with the City, or by accepting a permit under this section, a
registrant or permittee agrees to defend and indemnify the City in accordance
with the provisions of Minnesota Rule 7819.1250.
360.28   Abandoned and Unusable Facilities.
   Subd. 1   Discontinued Operations. A registrant who has determined to
discontinue all or a portion of its operations in the City must provide
information satisfactory to the City that the registrant's obligations for its
facilities in the right-of-way under this section have been lawfully assumed by
another registrant.
   Subd. 2   Removal. Any registrant who has abandoned facilities in any right-
of-way shall remove it from that right-of-way if required in conjunction with
other right-of-way repair, excavation or construction, unless this requirement
is waived by the City.

   Subd. 1   Has been denied registration;
   Subd. 2   Has been denied a permit;
   Subd. 3   Has had permit revoked; or
   Subd. 4   Believes that the fees imposed are invalid, may have the denial,
revocation or fee imposition reviewed, upon written request, by the City
Council. The City Council shall act on a timely written request at its next
regularly scheduled meeting. A decision by the City Council affirming the
denial, revocation or fee imposition will be in writing and supported by
written findings establishing the reasonableness of the decision.
360.30   Maintenance of the Right-of-Way.
   Subd. 1   Purpose. The right-of-way is public or private land dedicated for
public use for the purposes of pedestrian and vehicular movement, snow storage,
road reconstruction projects, drainage, and utilities. The area dedicated for
public use generally includes both improved (paved) and unimproved (landscaped)
portions of land. Property owners adjacent to the right-of-way are responsible
for maintaining the unimproved portion of the right-of-way. The City of Arden
Hills has adopted this Section to ensure the integrity of its streets, to
ensure appropriate use of the right-of-way, and to regulate the private use and
maintenance of the unimproved portion of the right-of-way between an adjacent
property and the edge of the pavement of a roadway, also called a "boulevard".
   Subd. 2   Scope.
      A.   The following activities shall be deemed maintenance of the right-
of-way, and shall be allowed without a permit, provided the activities are
conducted within the boulevard, between a person's property and the edge of the
improved portion of the right-of-way, and the maintenance activities do not
impede the City's use of the right-of-way:
         1.   Planting and maintaining perennial and/or annual flowers,
shrubberies, gardens, and rain gardens;
         2.   Installing and maintaining private driveways, sidewalks, curb and
gutter, or parking lots, which are allowed with an approved permit from the
City;

employee of such person.
   Person. Any individual, corporation, partnership, association, estate,

thereof as the case may be.
   Rent. The total consideration valued in money charged for lodging whether
paid in money or otherwise, but shall not include any charges for services
rendered in connection with furnishing lodging other than the room charge
itself.
380.02   Imposition of Tax:
   There is hereby imposed a tax of three (3%) percent on the rent charged by
an Operator for providing lodging to any person. The tax shall be stated and
charged separately and shall be collected by the Operator from the Lodger. The
tax collected by the Operator shall be a debt owed by the Operator to the City
and shall be extinguished only by payment to the City. In no case shall the tax
imposed by this section upon an Operator exceed the amount of tax which the
Operator is authorized and required by this Chapter to collect from a Lodger.
380.03   Collections:
   Each Operator shall collect the tax imposed by this Chapter at the time Rent
is paid. The tax collections shall be held in trust by the Operator for the
City. The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the Rent charged for
the Lodging.
380.04   Exemptions:
   An exemption shall be granted to any person as to whom or whose occupancy it
is beyond the power of the City to tax. No exemption shall be granted except
upon a claim therefore made at the time the Rent is collected and such a claim
shall be made in writing under penalty of perjury on forms provided by the
City. All such claims shall be forwarded to the City when the returns and
collections are submitted as required by this Chapter.
380.05   Advertising No Tax:
   It shall be unlawful for any Operator to advertise or hold out or state to
the public or any customer, directly or indirectly, that the tax or any party
thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the Operator, or that it will not be
added to the Rent or that, if added, it or any part thereof will be refunded.
Operator must collect. In computing the tax to be collected, amounts of tax
less than one cent ($0.01) shall be considered an additional cent ($0.01).
380.06   Payments and Returns:
   The taxes imposed by this Chapter shall be paid by the Operator to the City
not later than twenty-five (25) days after the end of the month in which the
taxes were collected. At the time of payment, the Operator shall submit a
return upon such forms and containing such information as the City may require.
The return shall contain the following minimum information:

during such reporting period, but only in proportion to the portion of such
consideration which became uncollectible.
380.07   Examination of Return, Adjustments, Notices and Demands:
   The Director may rely upon the "Minnesota State Sales and Use Tax Return"
filed by the Operator with the State of Minnesota in determining the accuracy
of a return filed under this Chapter. However, the Director shall be authorized
to make any investigation or examination of the records and accounts of the
person making the return, if the Director reasonably determines that such steps
are necessary for determining the correctness of the return. The tax computed
on the basis of such examination shall be the tax to be paid. If the tax due is
found to be greater than that paid, such excess shall be paid to the City
within ten (10) days after receipt of a notice thereof, given either personally
or sent by registered mail to the address shown on the return. If the tax paid
is greater than the tax found to be due, the excess shall be refunded to the
person who paid the tax to the City within ten (10) days after determination of
such refund.
380.08   Refunds:
   Any person may apply to the Director for a refund of taxes paid for a
prescribed period in excess of the amount legally due for that period, provided
that no application for refund shall be considered unless filed within one (1)
year after such tax was paid, or within one (1) year from the filing of the
return, whichever period is the longer. The Director shall examine the claim
and make and file written findings thereon denying or allowing the claim in
whole or in part and shall mail a notice thereof by registered mail to such
person at the address stated upon the return. If such claim is allowed in whole
or in part, the Director shall credit the amount of the allowance against any
taxes due under this Chapter from the claimant and the balance of said
allowance, if any, shall be paid by the Director to the claimant.
380.09   Failure to File a Return:

do so within the time prescribed, or shall make, willfully or otherwise, an
incorrect, false, or fraudulent return, the Operator shall, upon written notice
and demand, file such return or corrected return within five (5) days of
receipt of such written notice and shall at the same time pay any tax due on
the basis thereof. If such person shall fail to file such return or corrected
return, the Director shall make a return or corrected return, for such person
from such knowledge and information as the Director can obtain, and assess a
tax on the basis thereof, which tax, less any payments theretofore made on
account of the tax for the taxable period covered by such return shall be paid
within five (5) days of the receipt of written notice and demand for such
payment. Any such return or assessment made by the Director shall be prima
facie correct and valid, and such person shall have the burden of establishing
its incorrectness or invalidity in any action or proceeding in respect thereto.
   B.   If any portion of a tax imposed by this Chapter, including penalties
thereon, is not paid within thirty (30) days after it is required to be paid,
the City may institute such legal action as may be necessary to recover the
amount due plus interest, penalties, the costs and disbursements of any action.
   C.   Upon a showing of good cause, the Director may grant an operator one
30-day extension of time within which to file a return and make payment of
taxes as required by this Chapter provided that interest during such period of
extension shall be added to the taxes due at the rate of ten (10%) percent per
annum.
380.10   Penalties:
   If any tax imposed by this Chapter is not paid within the time herein
specified for the payment, or an extension thereof, there shall be added
thereto a specific penalty equal to ten (10%) percent of the amount remaining
unpaid. The amount of tax not timely paid, together with any penalty provided
by this section, shall bear interest at the rate of ten (10%) percent per annum
from the time such tax should have been paid until it is paid. Any interest and
penalty shall be added to the tax and be collected as part thereof.
380.11   Administration of Tax:
   The Director shall administer and enforce the assessment and collection of
taxes imposed by this Chapter. The Director shall cause to be prepared blank
forms for the returns and other documents required by this Chapter and shall
distribute the same throughout the City and furnish them on application, but
failure to receive or secure them shall not relieve any person from any
obligation required of him/her under this Chapter.
380.12   Examination of Records:
   The Director and those persons acting on behalf of the Director, authorized
in writing by the Director, may examine the books, papers and records of any
Operator in order to verify the accuracy of any return made, or if no return
was made, to ascertain the tax as provided in this Chapter. Every such Operator
is directed and required to give to the Director, or such other authorized
agent or employee, the means, facilities and opportunity for such examinations
and investigations as are hereby authorized.
380.13   Violations:
   Any person who shall willfully fail to make a return required by this
Chapter; or who shall fail to pay the tax after written demand for payment; or
who shall fail to remit the taxes collected or any penalty or interest imposed
by this Chapter, after written demand for such payment; or who shall refuse to

local convention, tourism, or visitors bureau for the purpose of marketing and
promoting the City as a tourist or convention center. Any local bureau
receiving proceeds shall, for its most recent calendar year, provide an annual
year-end report of its operations and its financial condition to the City

   The provisions of Minnesota Statutes Sections 347.50 through and including
347.56 are hereby adopted as the potentially dangerous and dangerous dog
regulations for the City of Arden Hills. Every provision contained in the
foregoing Minnesota Statutes is hereby adopted and made a part of this chapter
by reference as if fully set forth herein. Where a conflict exists between the
provisions of the City Code and the provisions of Minnesota Statutes Sections
347.50 through and including 347.56, the latter provisions shall apply.
   Subd. 1   Process. A City Animal Control Officer of other law enforcement
official shall be responsible for determining whether a dog is a potentially
dangerous dog or dangerous dog.
   Subd. 2   Notice. Upon a determination by the Animal Control Officer or
other law enforcement officials that a dog is a potentially dangerous or
dangerous dog, the City shall provide the owner with notice of the
determination by personally serving the owner or a person of suitable age at
the residence of such owner. The notice shall describe the dog deemed to be a
potentially dangerous or dangerous dog; shall identify the officer making the
determination; and shall specify the facts relied upon by the officer in making
the potentially dangerous or dangerous dog determination. If the officer
determines that the dog is a potentially dangerous or a dangerous dog, the
notice shall also inform the owner of the owner's rights to appeal the
determination.
   Subd. 3   Appeal. An owner may appeal a determination that a dog is a

thirty (30) days after the City's receipt of the appeal. The City Administrator
shall assign a hearing examiner to hear the appeal. The hearing examiner may be
a City employee, provided the employee has not been involved in determining if
the dog was potentially dangerous or dangerous. During the hearing the
Minnesota rules of evidence do not need to be strictly followed and the records
of the Animal Control Officer or law enforcement officer shall be considered
without further foundation. After considering all of the evidence submitted,
the hearing examiner shall make written findings of fact and shall determine
whether the dog is a potentially dangerous or a dangerous dog. The findings and
conclusions shall be made within ten (10) working days after the hearing and
shall be thereafter personally served upon the owner or a person of suitable
age at the residence of such owner. The decision of the hearing examiner shall
be the final decision of the City. If a timely appeal is not filed, the owner

602.03. Such officers shall have the power to inspect private premises and take
all reasonable precautions to prevent the commission and maintenance of such
public nuisances.
602.05   General Abatement Procedure.
   Whenever the officer charged with enforcement determines that a public
nuisance, as defined in Section
602.02 and Section
602.03, is being maintained or exists on property within the city, the
following code enforcement procedure shall apply:
   Subd. 1   Notice of Violation. Written notice of violation shall be served
by the officer charged with enforcement on the owner of record or occupant of
the premises either in person or by certified or registered mail. If the
premises are not occupied, the owner of record is unknown, or the owner of
record or occupant refuses to accept notice of violation, notice of violation
shall be served by posting it on the premises. The notice shall describe the
facts which are in violation of the City's public nuisance regulation; the
specific City regulation which have been violated; the type of action necessary
to abate the violation; and deadline for compliance.
   Subd. 2   Notice of Council Hearing. If a property owner fails to comply
with the notice of violation requirements, the officer charged with enforcement
shall serve the owner of record and occupant of premises either in person or by
certified or registered mail with a notice of a council hearing. If the
premises is not occupied, and the owner of record is unknown, or other owner of
record or occupant refuses to accept notice of council hearing, the notice of
council hearing shall be served by posting it on the premises. Notice of
council hearing shall specify the time, date and place of the hearing and
indicate that the property owner can appear at that time. At the conclusion of
the hearing, the City Council shall determine whether to issue an abatement
order.

council order to abate shall be served upon the owner of record, or the owner's
agent, if an agent is in charge of the building or property, and upon the
occupying tenant, if there is one, and upon all lien holders of holder of
record in the manner provided for service of a summons in a civil action. If
the owner cannot be found, the order shall be served upon the owner by posting
it at the main entrance to the building, or if there is no building, in a
conspicuous place on the property and by four (4) weeks publication in the
official newspaper of the City. A copy of the order with proof of service shall
be filed with the court administrator of the district court. At the time of
filing of the city council's order, the City shall file for record with the
county recorder or registrar of titles a notice of the pendency of the
proceeding, describing with reasonable certainty the lands effected and the
nature of the order. In all other respects, the City's service and order shall
comply with the provisions of Minn. Stat. 463.17.
602.06   Emergency Abatement Procedure/Summary Enforcement.
   In the case of an emergency, where a delay in abatement of a nuisance will
occur because of the time necessary during normal review procedures as defined
in section
602.05 will permit a continuing nuisance to unreasonably endanger public
health, safety or welfare, the city council may order summary enforcement and
abate the nuisance. To proceed with summary enforcement, the officer charged
with enforcement shall determine that a public nuisance exists or is being
maintained on premises in the city and that delay in abatement of the nuisance
will unreasonably endanger public health, safety, or welfare. The enforcement
officer shall notify in writing the occupant or owner of the premises of the
nature of the nuisance and of the city's intention to seek summary enforcement
and the time and place of the council meeting to consider the question of
summary enforcement. The City Council shall determine whether or not the
condition identified in the notice to the owner or occupant is a nuisance,
whether public health, safety, or welfare will be unreasonably endangered by
delay in abatement required to complete the procedure set forth in subdivision
602.05, and may order that such nuisance be immediately terminated or abated.
If the nuisance is not immediately terminated or abated, the city council may
order summary enforcement and abate the nuisance.
602.07   Accelerated Abatement Procedure.
   In order to more efficiently abate the recurring general nuisances which are
defined in this section, the City Council's abatement order may indicate that
it will remain in effect for a two (2) year period and will authorize the
City's code enforcement officers to take corrective actions during such period
in regard to the removal of tall grass, nuisance weeds and other vegetative
growth; the removal of snow and/or ice within public rights-of-way; the removal
of accumulations of debris and garbage; the trimming and care of trees and the
removal of unsound trees from public rights-of-way; the removal of insect
infested or diseased trees on private property; and the enforcement of housing
code violations. The accelerated abatement procedure shall include the
following:
   Subd. 1   Notice of Violation. Whenever the officer charged with enforcement
determines that a nuisance prescribed under Section
602.07 is being maintained or exists on premises in the City, written notice by
certified mail or registered mail shall be provided to the property owner or
occupant. If the premises are not occupied and the property owner is not known,
the notice may be served by posting it on the premises. The notice shall
include the following information:
   A description of the nuisance to be abated.
      A.   The nuisance shall be abated within seven (7) working days;
      B.   If the nuisance is not abated within seven (7) working days, the
City Council will hold a hearing, and the date of the hearing shall be
included;
      C.   The owner has the right to appear at the hearing;
      D.   The City will have the nuisance abated if corrective action is not
taken, and the order to abate may continue for up to two years; and
      E.   125 percent of the cost of the abatement, including administrative
costs will be charged to the property owner and certified against the property
for collection with taxes if the bill is not paid.
   Subd. 2   Abatement by City. If the owner or occupant fails to comply with
the Council's Order to Abate a reoccurring nuisance within seven (7) days of
the date of the Council's Order, the City shall provide for the abatement of
the nuisance and may continue to abate at intervals it deems appropriate for up
to two years. The officer charged with enforcement shall keep records of the
cost of the abatement including administrative costs and shall provide this
information to the City Administrative for billing and assessment against the
property pursuant to section
602.08.
   Subd. 3   Reoccurring Nuisance. If the nuisance reoccurs within two years of
the Council's Order to Abate, the officer charged with enforcement shall send a
notice requiring compliance within seven (7) working days. If the owner or
occupant fails to comply with the notice, the City shall provide for the
abatement of the nuisance. An additional public hearing shall not be required
within two years of the Council's original Order to Abate. The officer charged
with enforcement shall keep records of the cost of the abatement including
administrative costs and shall provide this information to the City
Administrative for billing and assessment against the property pursuant to
section
602.08.
602.08   Recovery of Cost.
   Subd. 1   Personal Liability. The owner of premises on which a nuisance has
been abated by the city shall be personally liable for the cost to the city of
the abatement, including administrative costs. As soon as the work has been
completed and the cost determined, the city administrator or other official
designated by the council shall prepare a bill for the cost and mail it to the
owner. Thereupon the amount shall be immediately due and payable at the office
of the city clerk.
   Subd. 2   Assessment. If the nuisance is a public health or safety hazard on
private property, the accumulation of snow, ice, or rubbish on public
sidewalks; removal or elimination of public health or safety hazard (excluding
structures under MN Statute 463.15 and 463.26); the growth of weeds on private
property or outside the traveled portion of streets, or unsound or insect-
infected trees, the city administrator shall, on or before September 1 next
following abatement of the nuisance, list the total unpaid charges along with
all other such charges as well as other charges for current services to be
assessed under Minn. Stat. 429.101 against each separate lot or parcel to which
the charges are attributable. The council may then spread the charges against
such property under that statute and other pertinent statutes for certification
to the county auditor and collection along with current taxes the following
year or in annual installments, not exceeding 10, as the council may determine
in each case.
Section 610 - Abandoned Property
610.01   Disposition of Abandoned Property.

this section. Abandoned and junked vehicles shall be disposed of according to

property shall arrange for its storage. If City facilities are unavailable or
inadequate, the department may arrange for storage at a privately-owned

satisfactory proof of ownership and paying the City any storage or maintenance
costs incurred by it. A receipt for the property shall be obtained upon release

sold.
   Subd. 5   Disposition of Proceeds. The proceeds of the sale shall be placed
in the general fund of the City. If the former owner makes application and

former owner shall be paid the proceeds of the sale of the property less the
costs of storage and the proportionate part of the cost of published notice and
other costs of the sale.
   State law reference - Sale of unclaimed property, see M.S. § 471.195
610.02   Findings and Purpose.
   Abandoned motor vehicles constitute a hazard to the health and welfare of
the people of the City in that such vehicles can harbor noxious diseases,
furnish shelter and breeding places for vermin, and present physical dangers to
the safety and well-being of children and other citizens. Abandoned motor
vehicles and other scrap metals also constitute a blight on the landscape of
the City and therefore a detriment to the environment. The abandonment and
retirement of motor vehicles and other scrap metals constitutes a waste of a

government may be reimbursed by the MPCA for reasonable costs incurred which

Section 650 - Clandestine Drug Lab Sites
(adopted 4/25/05)
650.10   Purpose and Intent;
   The purpose of Chapter
650 is to protect public health, safety and welfare, and reduce public exposure
to health risks where law enforcement authorities have determined that
hazardous chemicals from a suspected clandestine lab site or associated

hazardous chemicals, substances, or residues that place people, particularly
children or women of child-bearing age, at risk of exposure through inhabiting
or visiting the site or being exposed to contaminated personal property.
   Chemicals used in the production of illicit drugs can condense, penetrate

11/28/11)
710.12.1   Protection of Shade Trees* (adopted 8/29/05)
   Subd. 1   Declaration of Policy. The City Council has determined that the
health of oak, elm, and ash trees, hereinafter sometimes collectively referred
to as "shade trees," within the municipal limits are threatened by fatal tree
diseases commonly known as "Oak Wilt Disease", "Dutch Elm Disease", and
"Emerald Ash Borer" respectively, here-inafter sometimes collectively referred
to as "shade tree diseases." It has further determined that the loss of shade
trees growing upon public and private property would substantially depreciate
the value of property within the City and impair the safety, good order,
general welfare and convenience of the public. Accordingly, it is hereby
declared to be the intention of the Council to control and prevent the spread
of shade tree diseases and other epidemic diseases, by enacting this subsection
for that purpose.
   Subd. 2   Penalties. Any person violating the provisions of this subsection
shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be
punished by a fine, imprisonment or both, not to exceed the maximums provided
by state law for a misdemeanor. Each day following the date on which the person
was to have removed any diseased shade tree or wood as specified in written
notice given pursuant to the provisions of this subsection, the person has
allowed the tree to remain on his or her property, or has allowed the parts or
brush there from to remain on his or her property, shall constitute a separate
violation.
   Subd. 3   Forester. The position of city forester is hereby continued and
the powers and duties of the officer are hereby conferred upon the person as
designated from time to time by the Mayor with the concurrence of the Council.
It shall be the duty of the forester to coordinate, under the direction and
control of the Council, all activities of the City relating to the control and
prevention of shade tree diseases. He or she shall recommend to the Council the
details of a program for the control and prevention of the diseases and perform
the duties incident to such a program as adopted by the Council. Inspections
may be performed by a designated tree inspector(s).
   Subd. 4   Interference Prohibited. It shall be unlawful for any person to
prevent, delay or interfere with the forester or his or her tree inspector(s)
or designee while they are engaged in the performance of duties imposed by this
subsection.
   Subd. 5.   Epidemic Disease Program. It is the intention of the City Council
to conduct a program of pest control pursuant to the authority granted by
Minnesota statues section 18G.13, as amended, directed at the control and
elimination of Dutch elm disease, oak wilt disease, and elimination of other
tree diseases and is undertaken at the recommendation of the Minnesota
Commissioner of Agriculture.
   Subd. 6.   Shade Tree Nuisances Declared. (amended 11/28/11)
      A.   The following are hereby declared to be public nuisances whenever
and wherever they may be found within the City:
         1.   Any elm tree or part thereof infected to any degree with the
Dutch elm disease fungus Ceratocystis Ulmi (Buisman) Moreau or which harbors
any of the elm bark beetles Scolytus Multistriatus (Marsham) or Hylurgopinus
Rufipes (Eichhoff);
         2.   Any dead elm tree or part thereof, including stems, branches,
stumps, firewood or other elm material from which the bark has not been removed
and burned or sprayed with an effective elm bark beetle insecticide; and
         3.   Any northern red oak (Quercus rubra, Quercus ellipsoidalis, and
Q. palustris), or part thereof, infected to any degree with the oakwilt
disease, Ceratocystis fagacearum.
         4.   Any living or standing white oak (Quercus alba), bur oak (Quercus
macrocarpa), and swamp white oak (Quercus bicolor), that poses a threat of
transmission of the oak wilt disease to other trees.
         5.   Red oak species deemed by the City forester or designated tree
inspector to be a potentially diseased spore producing tree (PSPT) must be
removed before March 15th of the year following complete tree wilt. Any removed
red oak tree should be disposed of at an approved wood utilization site or
properly treated, i.e. main stems cut into firewood length sections, split if
appropriate, stacked and covered in clear plastic with the edges sealed at the
ground line to prevent vector entry or escape.
         6.   Other shade trees with epidemic diseases or epidemic insect
infestations.
   Subd. 7   Shade Tree Nuisances Prohibited. (amended 11/28/11) It is unlawful
for any person to permit the spread of a public nuisance as defined in this
chapter across his or her property lines in any specified control areas as
established by the city. Such nuisances shall be abated in a manner prescribed
in this chapter.
   Subd. 8    Inspection by Certified Tree Inspector.
      A.   The forester shall engage one or more persons, each of whom shall
have been issued a certificate from the Minnesota Department of Agriculture
pursuant to M.S. § 89.63, as amended from time to time, certifying that he or
she is a qualified or certified tree inspector, for the purposes of inspecting
any public or private properties, upon prior notification, to detect shade
trees harboring shade tree diseases, which inspector(s) shall act as the duly
authorized agent(s) of the forester. Nothing herein shall preclude the forester
from being certified by the State Department of Agriculture as a qualified tree
inspector and acting as such on behalf of the City.
      B.   The tree inspector(s) shall inspect all premises and places, both
public and private, within the City as often as is practicable to detect and
mark the location of all shade trees infected with shade tree diseases and
report the results of the inspections to the forester immediately after each
inspection has been conducted. The forester, or the tree inspector(s), may send
appropriate specimens or samples to the State Department of Agriculture for
analysis, or take such other steps for diagnosis as may be recommended by the
Department. In addition to the foregoing inspections, it shall be the duty of
the tree inspector(s) to investigate all reported incidents of infestation by
Dutch elm fungus, elm bark beetles, emerald ash borer or any other
manifestations of shade tree diseases.
      C.   A property owner or contractor who becomes aware of any tree
infestation within the City shall notify the City Forester within seven (7)
days.
      D.   The City forester and tree inspector(s) shall have the right to
enter upon all private premises within the City at any reasonable time for the
purpose of carrying out the duties assigned to them under this subsection,
including inspection, treatment, cutting, burning or removing of diseased shade
trees.
   Subd. 9   Notices to Property Owners.
      A.   After each inspection and investigation, whenever the forester or
the tree inspector(s) has found with a reasonable certainty that a shade tree
or any wood that harbors shade tree disease to such an extent that the same
constitutes a threat of infestation of shade trees in proximity thereto, the
tree inspector(s) shall mark the diseased shade trees or wood or both, as the
case may be, in a visible manner and notify each owner of real estate within
the City whereon the diseased shade trees or wood, or both as the case may be,
are located, which notice shall contain the inspection information with respect
to the diseased shade trees upon the property and shall further advise that, in
accordance with the provisions of this subsection, the owner is required to
remove the trees or wood, or both, as the case may be, within (20) (amended 11/
28/11) days for elm and ash trees and (30) days for oak trees and other trees
species from the date of the letter being sent to the property owner. The
notices shall be sent by certified mail with return receipt requested to the
last known address of the owner. In the event that the certified mail is not
delivered, mailing by ordinary mail to the address shall be deemed sufficient
notice.
      B.   The notices to be sent under the provisions of this subdivision
shall be sent to the occupant of premises upon which the diseased shade trees
or wood, or both as the case may be, are located, if those premises are
occupied, and also to the owner of the premises, if the owner has an address
different from the subject premises and the address is disclosed by the records
of the county department of property taxation. Reasonable inquiry by the
forester or the tree inspector(s) shall be sufficient to meet this requirement,
and telephone inquiry of the office of the county department of property
taxation shall be deemed reasonable inquiry for the purpose of ascertaining the
addresses. If the subject premises are unoccupied, then mailing to the address
of the owner as shown by the records of the county department of property
taxation shall be deemed sufficient.
      C.   No person shall allow, permit the spread of, or fail to abate a
public nuisance as defined in this code. Such nuisances shall be abated in the
manner prescribed in this code.
   Subd. 10    Removal of Diseased Shade Trees.
      A.   An owner of real estate in the City who is notified of the existence
on his or her property of shade trees or wood therefrom, or both as the case
may be, harboring shade tree disease shall within the time specified in the
written notice cut down or have cut down each of the diseased trees, remove or
have removed all parts, branches and brush there from, and transport or have
transported all the parts, branches and brush from the diseased trees and any
diseased wood from the premises to an authorized disposal or chipping site.
With respect to the transportation of wood from diseased elms or ash trees, it
shall be unlawful for any person to transport within the City any bark bearing
elm or ash wood.
      B.   The City Forester shall enforce the treatment of nuisance by
requiring the performance of one or more of the following disease control
methods listed in subsection C in order to destroy and prevent the spread of
epidemic diseased of shade trees, including, but not limited to, Dutch elm
disease, emerald ash borer, or oak wilt disease. Such abatement may be
designated by the Minnesota Commissioner of Agriculture or the University of
Minnesota.
      C.   The following abatement procedures are recommended by the City of
Arden Hills:
         1.   Root graft barrier installation at least 60 inches in the soil to
isolate the diseased trees;
         2.   Removal of trees;
         3.   Stump grinding;
         4.    Burning, chipping, debarking or properly covering and sealing
the potentially hazardous wood and/or stumps.
      D.   To prevent root graft transmission of tree related diseases, a
barrier must be created between diseased and healthy trees, either by cutting
the root system with a 54-inch blade or longer by using a vibratory cable plow,
or by digging a trench to a minimum depth of 60 inches in the soil surrounding
the diseased trees. Such abatement procedures will be carried out in accordance
with current technical and expert opinions and plans as designated by the State
Commissioner of Agriculture.
      E.   In addition the owner may poison or have poisoned the stumps of
trees diseased with oak wilt and shall debark or have debarked to the ground
line the stumps of trees diseased with Dutch elm disease or emerald ash borer
in such manner as may be approved by the forester.
   Subd. 11   Abatement by City. In the event the owner fails or refuses to
abate the nuisances as so required, then the forester shall upon orders from
the Council, abate the nuisance by cutting down diseased shade trees and
removing all parts, branches and brush thereof, together with any diseased wood
of any diseased shade trees located on the premises, from the premises to an
authorized disposal or chipping site. The cost of the City's abating the
nuisance shall be billed to the owner or occupant of the premises upon which
the nuisances existed.
   Subd. 12   Assessment for Nuisance Abatement. If the owner or occupant fails
to pay the bill, as provided for in Subd. 9, within thirty (30) days of the
date thereof, the Council may then assess the amount due, plus interest,
against the property as a special assessment under M.S. Ch. 429.101 (amended
11/28/11), as amended from time to time, installments of which assessment shall
in no event be payable over a period exceeding five (5) years from the date the
same have been levied. On or before October 1 of each year, the city
administrator shall list the total unpaid charges for each such abatement
against each separate lot or parcel to which the same is attributable.
Thereafter, the charges may then be spread by the Council as a special
assessment against the property benefited by the abatement, and the assessment
certified to the county as provided by law.
   Subd. 13   Request for Laboratory Testing. Any owner of real estate in the
City who receives a notice as provided in Subd. 7 to the effect that shade
trees or wood, or both as the case may be, on his or her property harbor shade
tree disease and must be removed within the time specified in the notice, may
request the forester to obtain a laboratory test of one or more of the trees.
The request must be made no later than the date on which the trees or diseased
wood are to be removed from the premises, as specified in the written notice
from the City to the owner as provided herein, by written notice from the owner
to the forester sent by certified mail with return receipt requested. Upon
receipt of the request, the forester shall promptly engage the services of the
State Department of Agriculture or a qualified laboratory to make analyses of
appropriate specimens or samples of the allegedly diseased shade trees. If the
analyses confirm the original diagnosis that the shade trees are infected or
the wood thereof diseased, or both whichever the case may be, the requesting
owner shall pay all expenses and charges incurred for the analyses by the City.
If the test discloses that the trees or wood are not so diseased, the City
shall bear all the costs and the forester shall remove the trees or wood from
the list of diseased trees. If the test confirms the original diagnosis that
the trees or wood or both as the case may be, are diseased, notice thereof
shall be sent the owner by the forester, and the owner shall remove the
diseased trees or wood or both as the case may be, within one week after
receipt of the notice.
   Subd. 14   Spraying or Treatment of Shade Trees.
      A.   Whenever the forester determines that any shade tree or shade tree
wood within the City is infected with shade tree disease, he or she may spray
or treat all nearby high value shade trees by such chemical or mechanical means
as will be effective to prevent as fully as possible the spread of shade tree
disease thereto. The forester may also cause the diseased shade trees or wood
to be sprayed or treated by chemical or mechanical means so as likewise to
control the possible spread of shade tree disease to neighboring, high value
shade trees. Such procedure shall be carried out in accordance with current
technical and expert opinions and plans of the State Department of Agriculture
and under the supervision of the Department whenever possible.
      B.   As determined necessary by the City Forester, the City may utilize
chemical means of treatment. If chemical treatments are deemed necessary, the
cost for this service shall be borne by the City. The costs of the mechanical
means of treatment shall be borne by the owner or occupant of the premises, the
shade trees upon which have been mechanically treated by the City. The owner or
occupant of the premises shall be billed the costs of the mechanical treatment,
and in the event of nonpayment of the bill within thirty (30) days of the date
thereof, the Council may then assess the amount due, plus interest, in the
manner provided in Subd. 10.
      C.   The forester shall notify, in the manner provided in Subd. 9, each
owner or occupant of real estate within the City of the date after which shade
trees on his or her property shall be mechanically treated, which date shall
not be less than five (5) days from the date of mailing the notice.
   Subd 15.   Transportation of Epidemic Diseased Wood. It is unlawful for any
person to transport within the City any diseased wood that is determined to be
hazardous, as described in Subd. 6.
   Subd 16.   Public Tree Care. The City has the right to plant, prune,
maintain, remove or perform any other arboricultural practices as necessary on
all public property including the street right-of-way to ensure public safety
and to preserve or enhance the symmetry and beauty of such public grounds.
   Subd 17.   Abuse or Mutilation of Public Trees. Unless specifically
authorized by the City Forester, no person shall intentionally damage, cut,
carve, transplant, remove any tree, attach any rope, wire, nails, advertising
poster, or other contrivance to any tree, allow any gaseous liquid or solid
substance which is harmful to come in contact with any tree, or set fire or
permit any fire to burn when the heat could injure any portion of any tree, or
top a tree by severely cutting back the tree canopy to a stub.
   Subd 18.   Violation of Penalty. Any person, firm or cooperation who
violates any section of this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon
conviction, thereof, shall be subject to a misdemeanor penalty as then by
defined by Minnesota law. Additionally, the City may exercise any civil remedy
available under Minnesota law for the enforcement of this code including civil
action, mandamus, injunctive relief, declaratory action, or the levying of
assessments.

within sixty (60) days after the permit is obtained.
   Subd. 5   Property Assessments. Before a permit for water main tapping shall
be issued, the following conditions shall be complied with:
      A.   A connection permit to service, directly or indirectly, any lot or
tract of land shall not be issued until the City Administrator shall have
certified to one of the following:
         1.   That the lot or tract of land has been assessed for the cost of
construction of the water main with which the connection is to be made;
         2.   If no assessment has been levied for the construction cost, the
proceedings for levying the assessment have been or will be completed in due
course; or
         3.   If no assessment has been levied and no assessment proceedings
will be completed in due course, that the City has been paid an amount equal to
the estimated assessment against the lot or tract for the construction of the
main.
      B.   If for any reason the City Administrator cannot issue a certificate
as provided in this subdivision, and there has been an assessment proceeding in
connection with the construction of the main, then the City Engineer shall
compute the assessment which would have been levied against the subject lot or
parcel on the same basis as assessments previously levied against other
property for the main, and the City Administrator's certificate may be issued
upon payment of the amount to the City Administrator. In the event that there
has been no assessment proceeding in connection with the laying of the main,
the City Engineer shall compute the charge to be made for the connection on the
basis of the benefit to the property from the construction of the main, and the
City Administrator's certificate shall be issued upon payment of the charge.
      C.   In lieu of requiring payment of the charge as computed under this
subdivision at the time the connection permit is issued, the Council may, upon
request of a property owner desiring the connection, certify the amount to the
county auditor, together with a legal description of the premises served, to
the end that the connection charge shall be paid in equal installments over a
period of twenty (20) years, with interest thereon at the rate of eight (8%)
percent per annum, in the same manner as provided for collection of assessments
in M.S. Ch. 429, as amended from time to time.

water service for property in the City may be more economically and
conveniently obtained from water systems outside of the City.
      B.   In the event a City property owner requests water service of this
City, and the City Engineer advises this City that the property concerned is a
border area to which water service may be best supplied, on a practical and
economic basis, from a water system other than that of this City, upon
recommendation of the City Administrator of this City the Council may permit
connection to the outside water system and permit payment of connection charges
in the manner provided in this section, which could be the other city's charge
or Arden Hills charge, whichever is greater.

issued on the following basis:
         1.   The charge shall be payable on the issuance of each building
permit for new construction issued.
         2.   A charge shall be payable on the issuance of a building permit
for alterations or additions to existing buildings if the alteration or
addition will require additional reserve capacity, and the service availability
charge (SAC) unit shall be determined on the same basis as for new buildings.
      C.   The charge for each building shall be the product of the number of
units of sewage volume which it will discharge and the dollar figure
established by Ordinance adopted by the Council for the year in which the
building permit is issued. A unit of sewage volume shall be one hundred
thousand (100,000) gallons per year and shall be assigned as follows:
         1.   Single family houses, townhouses and duplex units shall each
comprise one unit.
         2.   Condominiums and apartments shall each comprise eighty (80%)
percent of a unit.
         3.   Mobile homes shall each comprise eighty (80%) percent of a unit.

each one hundred thousand (100,000) gallons of flow or part thereof which it is
estimated they will discharge.
         5.   Public housing units and housing units subsidized under any
federal program for low and moderate income housing shall be counted as seventy
five (75%) percent of the unit equivalent for that type of housing.
   Subd. 3   Administration. The City Administrator shall prepare or revise
building permit or sewage connection permit application forms to provide
information necessary for the computation of the number of SAC units assignable
to the building or structure in question, and shall collect the applicable
charge before issuance of a permit. The City Administrator shall make such
information available to the MCES upon request. If upon filing a report
covering the permit with the metropolitan MCES. They may determine that a
greater number of units is assignable to the building or structure in question,
any additional amount of cost allocated to the City as a result shall be paid
by the person or company to whom the permit was granted.

1010.14   Surface Water Management Utility.
   Subd. 1   General Operation. The municipal surface storm water runoff system
shall be operated as a public utility, hereinafter called the "surface water
management utility," pursuant to M.S. § 444.075, as amended from time to time,
from which revenues will be derived subject to the provisions of this chapter
and Minnesota Statutes.
   Subd. 2   Definitions.
      A.   Quarterly Surface Water Management Budget. The estimated quarterly
expenditures for planning and inventories, capital expenditures, personnel and
equipment and operation of the surface water utility, in accordance with
established City policy. This budget shall be established from time to time by
City Council resolution.
      B.   Surface Water Management Fee. The quarterly charge developed for
each parcel of land pursuant to City regulations and zoning classifications and
shall be established by Ordinance adopted by the Council.
      C.   Utility Factor. The ratio of runoff volume, in inches, for a
particular land use, to the runoff volume, in inches, for a 1/3 -acre
residential lot, assuming a two-inch rainfall and soil conservation service, or
(SCS), "Type B" soil conditions.
   Subd. 3   Establishment of Fees. Surface water management fees shall be
established by Ordinance adopted by the Council. The following steps shall be
taken to determine the quarterly fee to be charged to each property:
      A.   A calculation shall be made of the total area, in acres, of all
zoned property within the City.
      B.   A determination shall be made whether each individual property
within these zoning classifications is developed or undeveloped.
      C.   The total number of developed acres of property within these zoning
classifications shall be calculated.
      D.   The total acreage of developed property zoned as R 1, single family
residential, shall be divided by the total acreage calculated in Step C. This
yields the percentage of total developed property that is zoned R 1.
      E.   The City Council shall establish, by resolution, the quarterly
budget for the revenue to be generated.
      F.   The portion of the quarterly budget to be charged against properties
zoned R 1 shall be calculated by multiplying the percentage found in Step D. by
the budge amount in Step E.
      G.   The rate per acre for property zoned R 1 shall be calculated by
dividing the revenue for R 1 properties in Step F, by the total acreage of
developed properties found in Step C. This rate shall be the basis for all
rates charged to any other zoned properties within the City.
      H.   The volume of storm water runoff shall be calculated for all
properties zoned R-1, R-2, R 3, R 4, I 1, I 2, B 1 and B 2. The methods used
for these calculations shall follow the U.S. Department of Agriculture Soil
Conservation Service guideline for soil types common to Arden Hills. A curve
number shall be chosen for each zoning classification, which shall be an
approximate measure of the percentage of impervious surface on the property.
The volume of runoff for each zoning classification shall be calculated using
the following equation.
   Q = (P - 0.2S)5
      P + 0.8S
   Where   Q = runoff, cfs
   S = (1000/cn) 10, dimensionless
   P = 2, inches
      I.   The runoff value calculated in Step H for R 1 properties shall be
considered the base rate. The runoff value for each of the other zoning
classifications shall then be divided by the base rate to yield a utility
factor for each zoning classification. This utility factor shall be a measure
of the additional runoff created from the property as compared to a single
family lot. The utility factors for each zoning classification shall be listed
in the following subdivision.
      J.   The rate per acre for all zoning classifications, except R 1, shall
be calculated by multiplying the utility factor found in step I by the base
rate determined in Step G.
      K.   The owner(s) of any premise(s) shall be solely responsible for the
payment of any storm water runoff charge calculated for the property.
   Subd. 4   Factors for Determining Fees for Various Land Uses. The utility
factors for various land uses used to determine the surface water management
fees are assigned as follows:

   Subd. 5   Adjustment of Fees. The City Council may adopt an Ordinance for
the adjustment of the surface water management fees. Information to justify a
fee adjustment shall be supplied by the property owner. Surface water
management fees shall be adjusted under the following conditions:
      A.   The estimated expenditures for the management of surface water shall
be revised at a frequency specified in this code. The fees shall be adjusted
accordingly and will follow established City procedures for this adjustment of
utility (water and sewer) rates.
      B.   Changes in developed conditions of parcels.
      C.   If it can be demonstrated that an individual parcel retains all or a
portion of the rainfall that it receives, the surface water management fee
shall be reduced by a percentage equal to that percent of the parcel which
produces no external runoff. A fee reduction of 20 percent or greater must be
demonstrated.
   Subd. 6   Undeveloped Land. Undeveloped properties, without regard to zoning
classification, shall be assessed at one-half the rate, charged to developed
property zoned as R 1.

the surface water management fee believes that a particular assigned fee is
incorrect, such a person may request that the fee be recomputed. Appeals shall
be heard by the Council once a year in accordance with the schedule established
for credit applications, in established City policy.
   Subd. 10   Penalties for Delinquent Payments of Fees. A penalty equal to
eight percent (8%) of the amount due shall be added to accounts not paid in
full on or before the first day of the second month following the billing
periods and to each quarterly billing thereafter until the amount of the
delinquent account plus accrued penalty is paid in full or otherwise certified
to the county auditor as a delinquent account.
   Subd.11   Collection. Any amounts due for sanitary sewer charges in excess
of 90 days past due may be collected in a civil action brought for that purpose
in the name of the City; or the City Administrator, upon direction by the
Council, may certify to the county auditor the amount due, together with the
legal description of the premises served, and the City Administrator in so
certifying, shall add to the amount as a separate item, in addition to the
delinquency penalty an additional delinquency penalty of eight (8%) percent of
the original unpaid amount, inclusive of any previous delinquency penalty. The
county auditor shall enter the amount as part of the tax levied on the premises
to be collected during the ensuing year. No additional delinquency penalties
shall be added to unpaid bills after certification to the county auditor.

1020.02   Definitions.
      ∙   Best Management Practices (BMPs). Schedules of activities,
prohibitions of practices, general good housekeeping practices, pollution
prevention and educational practices, maintenance procedures, and other
management practices to prevent or reduce the discharge of pollutants directly
or indirectly to stormwater, receiving waters, or stormwater conveyance
systems. BMPs also include treatment practices, operating procedures, and
practices to control site runoff, spillage or leaks, sludge or water disposal,
or drainage from raw materials storage.
         ∙   Practices that focus on preserving open space, protecting natural
systems, and incorporating existing landscape features such as wetlands and
stream corridors to manage storm water at its source. Other practices include
clustering and concentrating development, minimizing disturbed areas, and
reducing the size of impervious areas.

amount due is not paid within a timely manner as determined by the decision of
the municipal authority or by the expiration of the time in which to file an
appeal, the charges shall become a special assessment against the property and
shall constitute a lien upon the property, and the City shall have the right to
assess such cost against the property owned by such violator(s) pursuant to
Minnesota Statute § 429.101.
   Subd. 5   Injunctive Relief. It shall be unlawful for any person to violate
any provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this ordinance.
If a person has violated or continues to violate the provisions of this
ordinance, the City may petition for a preliminary or permanent injunction
restraining the person from activities which would create further violations or
compelling the person to perform abatement or remediation of the violation.
   Subd. 6   Compensatory Action. In lieu of enforcement proceedings,
penalties, and remedies authorized by this ordinance, the City may impose upon

enforcement agency to seek cumulative remedies.
Chapter 11 - Subdivisions
Section 1100 - General Provisions
1100.01   Purpose and Interpretation.
   Each new subdivision becomes a permanent unit in the basic physical
structure of the future community, a unit to which the future community will of
necessity be forced to adhere. Piecemeal planning of such subdivisions without
correlation to the City plan, will bring a disastrous disconnected patchwork of
plats and poor circulation of traffic. in order that new subdivisions will
contribute toward an attractive, orderly, stable and wholesome community
environment, adequate municipal services and safe streets, all subdivisions
platted within the incorporated limits of the City following the adoption of
this code, shall in all respects, fully comply with the regulations set forth
in this chapter. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of
this chapter shall be the minimum requirements adopted for the protection of
the public health, safety and general welfare.

nor is it intended by this chapter to impair or interfere with existing
provisions of other laws or provisions of this code except those specifically
repealed by, or in conflict with, this chapter, or with private restrictions
placed upon property by deed, covenant or other private agreement, or with
restrictive covenants running with the land to which the City is a party;
provided however, that such private restrictions or restrictive covenants may
impose stricter requirements than established by this chapter, but may not
decrease the requirements imposed in this section.
   Subd. 2   In any case where the division of a parcel of land into two (2) or
more lots or parcels for the purpose of transfer of ownership or building
development does not come within the definition of subdivision as defined by

(100) feet, and a street property line diameter of at least one hundred twenty
(120) feet.
   Subd. 10   Streets Abutting Arterial Streets. Where a subdivision abuts or
contains an existing or planned arterial street, the City Council may require a
local residential or neighborhood street parallel and adjacent to the arterial
street or other such treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of
residential properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic.
   Subd. 11   Half Streets. Half streets shall be prohibited, except where
essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with
the other requirements of these regulations and then only when the City Council
finds it will be practicable to require the dedication of the other half when
the adjoining property is subdivided. Wherever there is an existing half street
adjacent to a tract which is to be subdivided, the other half of the street
shall be platted within the proposed tract. Half streets providing access to a
lot shall not receive a building permit until the other half of the street has
been platted.

water easement or drainage right of way conforming substantially with the lines
of the watercourse, together with any further width or construction or both, as
shall be adequate for storm water run off.
   Subd. 3   Ponding. Ponding easements shall be required for storm water
ponding areas and shall be taken to two (2) feet above the emergency overflow
elevation or 100-year flood elevation if no emergency overflow elevation is
provided. In addition, if the easement is not adjacent to a public right-of-
way, adequate public access to the easement for maintenance purposes is
required.
   Subd. 4   Utility Easements. Easements for storm sewer, sanitary sewer or
water mains shall be a minimum of twenty (20) feet in width. Additional width
shall be provided when more than one utility is in the same easement, or

adjacent lot must be within a drainage easement.
1130.08   Public Use Dedications.
(revised 12/14/15)
   Subd. 1 Public Use Dedications Required.
      A.   Pursuant to Minn. Stat. Section 462.358, Subd. 2b, except as
otherwise provided in this section, the City requires all owners or developers,
as a prerequisite to approval of a subdivision to convey to the City or
dedicate to the public use a reasonable portion of any such proposal for public
use as streets, roads, sewers, electric, gas, and water facilities, storm water
drainage and holding areas or ponds and similar utilities and improvements,
parks, recreational facilities, playgrounds, trails, wetlands, or open space,
in such portions to be approved and acceptable to the City.
      B.   As a condition of any conditional use permit or planned unit
development under City Code Section 1355.06, the City may require as a term and
condition of approval, the dedication of land or payment in lieu of dedication
and park improvement fees if the project is determined to result in an
increased demand for park land or park improvements. In establishing the amount
required the City will take into consideration land and facilities provided by
the developer and previous payments or dedications.
   Subd. 2   Suitability of dedicated land. As determined by the City, land
shall be reasonably suitable for its intended use and shall be at a location
convenient to the people to be served. Factors used in evaluating the adequacy
of proposed park and recreation areas shall include size, shape, topography,
geology, hydrology, tree cover, access, and location.
   Subd. 3   Park, trails, and open space land dedication and development. This
subsection is adopted for the purpose of providing for the recreation, health,
and well-being of the public through the orderly development of an
interconnected system of parks, trails, and open spaces. The City finds that
the dedication and improvement requirements as defined in this subsection are
necessary to meet the minimum needs for parks, trails, wetlands, and open
spaces resulting from development subject to Section 1130.08. At its
discretion, the City may require subdividers or developers to satisfy the land
dedication requirement or the park development fee requirement, or both. In
evaluating the land dedication and park development requirements for a specific
application, the City may consider whether in conjunction with a previous
subdivision an adequate area of land was conveyed or dedicated to the City to
meet the minimum needs for parks, trails, wetlands, and open spaces resulting
from the subject development proposal.
      A.   Residential dedication.
         1.   In residential subdivisions where a land dedication is required,
the following formula shall be used to determine the parkland dedication:
 
Category                   Units Per Acre       Percentage Park Dedication/
                                                Acres of Development
Low Density Residential    Up to 2.5            10 percent
Medium Density Residential More than 2.5 to 8.0 15 percent
High Density Residential   More than 8.0        20 percent
 
         2.   A cash contribution in lieu of land dedication may be required at
the discretion of the City. The cash payment shall be determined based on the
fair market of the land that would otherwise be dedicated to the City.
      B.   Commercial and industrial dedication.
         1.   In commercial or industrial subdivisions where a land dedication
is required, the following formula shall be used to determine the parkland
dedication: seven and a half (7.5) percent of the gross area of the
subdivision.
         2.   A cash contribution in lieu of land dedication may be required at
the discretion of the City. The cash contribution fee shall be seven and a half
(7.5) percent of the fair market value of the unimproved land.
      C.   Park development. In addition to the land dedication requirements as
defined in this subsection, the City may require a park development fee for
subdivisions subject to Section
1130.08 for the purpose of making certain improvements needed to develop parks,
playgrounds, trails, and open spaces, including but not limited to finished
grading, ground cover, landscaping, recreational facilities and equipment,
paving, and utilities. The City may consider a proportionate reduction in the
required park development fee in cases where the subdivider or developer
commits to making certain required park, trail, or open space improvements
within the subdivision area as agreed upon in the development agreement.
         1.   Residential park development fee. In residential subdivisions
where a park development fee is required, the City shall apply the fee on a per
unit basis. The park development fee shall be established by ordinance on a
regular basis.
         2.   Commercial and industrial park development fee. In commercial or
industrial subdivisions where a park development fee is required, the fee shall
be seven and a half (7.5) percent of the fair market value of the unimproved
land.
      D.   Trail connections. In cases where a subdivision borders a trail
identified in the City’s comprehensive plan, the subdivider or developer shall
be responsible for constructing trail improvements that provide connections
from the subdivision area to this trail. The location and specifications of the
trail connections shall be determined by the City Engineer and Community
Development Director.
      E.   Contribution combination. The City may, at its discretion, require
the subdivider or developer to make a combination of cash and land dedication
for parkland. Where a combination of land and cash dedication is made, the land
dedicated will be deducted from the total park dedication land requirement, and
the balance of required dedication acreage will be converted into a cash
contribution in lieu of land dedication pursuant to the fair market value of
the property in the subdivision.
      F.   Miscellaneous requirements. The following requirements apply to all
dedications or conveyances for park, playground, trails, or public open space
purposes:
         1.   City staff recommendation. In each case City staff shall
recommend to the City Council the total area and location of such land that
should be conveyed or dedicated within the development for park, trails, or
open space purposes, or whether a cash contribution in lieu of land dedication
should be required. Such recommendation may take into consideration items such
as the zoning classification of the land to be developed, the particular use
proposed for such land, amenities to be provided and factors of density and
site development as proposed by the developer.
         2.   Acquisition of sites proposed on official map or comprehensive
plan. Where a proposed park, playground, trail, open space or other
recreational area that has been indicated on the official map or comprehensive
plan is located in whole or in part within a proposed subdivision, such
proposed site shall be designated as such on the plat and be dedicated to the
City. If the subdivider chooses not to dedicate an area in excess of the land
required hereunder for such proposed public site, the City may consider
acquiring the site through purchase or condemnation.
         3.   Calculating density. Land area conveyed or dedicated to the City
shall not be used in calculating density requirements of the City Zoning Code
and shall be in addition to and not in lieu of private open space requirements
prescribed in the Zoning Code.
         4.   Park dedication and development fund. Cash contributions shall be

            (iii)   If the City disputes such appraisal, the City may, at the
subdivider’s expense, obtain an appraisal of the property by a qualified real

market value of the land.
         6.   Property being subdivided without an increase in the number of

Chapter 12 - Sign Code
Section 1200 - Purpose and Intent
1200.01   Recitals.
   This Chapter shall be known, cited and referred to as the Arden Hills Sign
Code, except as referred to herein, where it shall be known as "this Chapter."
1200.02   Purpose and Findings.
   The purpose and findings of this Chapter are as follows:
   Subd. 1 Purpose. This Sign Code is intended to establish a comprehensive and
balanced system of sign control that accommodates the need for a well-
maintained, safe, and attractive community, and the need for effective
communications, including business identification. It is the intent of these
sign regulations, to promote the health, safety, general welfare, aesthetics,
and image of the community by regulating signs that are intended to communicate
to the public in all areas of the City. It is not the purpose or intent of this
Chapter to regulate the message displayed on any sign. The purpose of this
Chapter is to authorize:
   A.   Permanent signs which establish a high standard of aesthetics and are
appropriate for the planned character in each sign district as established in
Section 1240;
   B.   Signs which are compatible with their surroundings;
   C.   Signs which are designed, constructed, installed and maintained in a
manner that does not adversely impact public safety or create a hazard to
motorists, pedestrians, or cyclists;
   D.   Signs that are proportioned to the scale of, and are architecturally
compatible with, principal structures;
   E.   Permanent signs which give preference to the on-premise owner or
occupant;
   F.   Temporary commercial signs and advertising displays which provide an
opportunity to advertise while restricting signs that create visual clutter and
hazards at public right-of-way intersections;
   G.   Minimize adverse effects on nearby property; and,
   H.   Provide for fair and consistent enforcement of the sign regulations set
forth herein under the authority of the City.
   Subd. 2 Findings. The City finds it is necessary for the promotion and
preservation of the public health, safety, welfare, and aesthetics of the
community to control the construction, location, size, and maintenance of
signs. Further, the City finds:
   A.   Permanent and temporary signs have a direct impact on and relationship
to the image and aesthetic of the community;
   B.   The manner of installation, location and maintenance of signs affects
the public health, safety, welfare and aesthetics of the community;
   C.   An opportunity for viable identification of community businesses,
residences, and institutions must be established;
   D.   The safety of motorists, cyclists, pedestrians and other users of
public streets and property is affected by the number, size, location and
appearance of signs that create a hazard for drivers, particularly from dynamic
display signs;
   E.   Installation of signs suspended from, projecting over, or placed on the
tops of buildings, walks or other structures may constitute a hazard during
periods of high winds and an obstacle to effective fire-fighting and other
emergency service;
   F.   Uncontrolled and unlimited signs and sign types, particularly dynamic
display signs, adversely impact the image and aesthetic attractiveness of the
community and thereby undermine economic value and growth;
   G.   Uncontrolled and unlimited signs, particularly temporary signs which
are commonly located within or adjacent to public right-of-way or are located
at driveway/street intersections, result in roadside clutter and obstruction of
views of oncoming traffic. This creates a hazard to drivers and pedestrians and
also adversely impacts a logical flow of information;
   H.   Commercial signs are generally incompatible with residential uses and
should be strictly limited in residential zoning districts; and
   I.   The right to express noncommercial opinions in any zoning district must
be protected, subject to reasonable restrictions on size, height, location and
number.
1200.03   Scope of Regulations.
   The sign regulations set forth in this Chapter shall apply to all structures
and all land uses. This Chapter describes the signage standards for the nine
sign districts that overlay the zoning districts of the City. Specific
additional regulations are established for signs which are unique in purpose
and not easily addressed by district regulations. No person, property owner,
lessee shall place, erect, alter, modify, enhance or change in any way a sign
that does not conform to the requirements of this Chapter and all other
applicable regulations.
1200.04   Severability.
   If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phase, or other part of this
Chapter is for any reason held to be invalid, such invalidity shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remaining portion of this Chapter. The
City Council hereby declares that it would have adopted the Chapter in each
section, subsection, sentence, or phase thereof, irrespective of the fact that
any one or more sections, subjections, sentences, clauses, or phrases are
declared invalid.

   Subd. 1   General Purpose. The Planned Unit Development (PUD) District
promotes the development of land in a unified manner by treating the entire
development as a single entity and relaxing the strict application of standard
zoning and subdivision requirements, in exchange for a project that better
forwards the goals and purpose of the City's Comprehensive Plan. The purpose of
the PUD process is to achieve a higher quality, better project than would
otherwise be possible if the strict application of the zoning and subdivision
requirements were met. While PUD's may be allowed in any district, they are
required for some types of development in certain districts.
   Subd. 2   Applicability. The PUD District is an overlay zoning technique,
whereby the basic underlying zoning district establishes the basic allowable
uses and the general standards for development and the approved PUD plan
establishes the specific regulations for development and shall govern and take
precedence over the underlying Zoning District regulations. If a zoning change
is required to accommodate the uses or general intensity of development in the
PUD, an application for a Zoning District change shall be made concurrently
with the PUD application and, if approved, the Zoning Map shall be changed both
as to the underlying zoning district and designation as a PUD district.

would now or in the future materially impede the clear vision area or other
driveway between a height of two and one-half (2-1/2) and ten (10) feet in the
clear vision area.  (revised 3/18/09)
         9.   Completion Deadline. All plants required for screening purposes
shall be planted to completion within six months from date of issuance of a
building permit unless otherwise approved by the city due to the time of the
year or if an alternative schedule is set in a development agreement. In no
case shall the period exceed six months from issuance of the certificate of
occupancy.

visible from residentially zoned property, a maximum of twenty-five (25)
percent of the facade visible from such residential property may be illuminated
by direct lighting from spot lights or flood lights.
   Subd. 4   Screening.
      A.   Definition and Purpose. Screens and buffers are designated units of
yard or open area where setbacks, landscaping, berming, walls, and fencing help
minimize adverse impacts of public nuisances, such as: noise, glare, activity,
or dust, which are often times associated with parking, storage, signs or
buildings.
      B.   Types of Screening. The screening required in this section shall
consist of a fence, wall or landscaping, subject to the approval of the
Council. Landscaping may include a combination of any of the following: berms,
shrubs, deciduous or coniferous trees or hedge materials. The height and depth
of the screening shall be consistent with the height and size of the area to be
screened. When natural materials, such as trees or hedges, are used to meet the
screening requirements, density and species of planting shall be such as to
achieve 60 percent opacity year round at maturity.
      C.   General Screening Requirements
         1.   Screening in Proximity to Residential Lots. Screening shall be
required where:
            a)   Any business or industrial use is adjacent to any zoned
residential or along the boundary of any such residential lot;
            b)   Any business, parking lot or industrial use is across the
street from a residential district, but not on that side of a business or
industrial use considered to be the front.
            c)   Any non-residential use in residential districts by
Conditional Use Permit or PUD, such as schools, houses of worship, day care
facilities over ten (10), residential facilities over six (6), or public uses
other than parks, adjoins or is located across the street from any single or
two family residential lot.

shall be screened and buffered from all public streets and adjacent differing
land use.
         3.   Screening of Mechanical Operating Equipment. On non-residential
properties, screening shall also be provided where mechanical operating
equipment is located on the ground or on the roof of the premises, such
screening shall be constructed and located so as to completely screen from view
of adjacent streets and differing land uses. Mechanical operating equipment
shall include all exterior devices used to service the building or its
occupants, including but not limited to electrical, HVAC, plumbing,
communications (including telephone and dish antennae) and storage tanks.
         4.   Exception to requirements. Screen and buffer requirements may be
waived or modified by the city where the intent is otherwise satisfied by
significant change in elevation, an existing screening, significant distance or
similar circumstances.
         5.   Intersection Visibility. On all lots, nothing shall be placed in
the clear vision area, and nothing shall be allowed to grow in such a manner as
to materially impede vision now or in the future between a height of two and
one-half (2-1/2) and ten (10) feet in the clear vision area. (revised 3/18/09)
         6.   Responsibility for Screening. The owner or occupant of the
premises containing the use or features to be screened shall provide the
required screening and maintenance.
      D.   Fence Regulations.
         1.   Height of Fences in Side and Rear Yards. Fences in side or rear
yards may not exceed six (6) feet in height in all residential districts.
Fences may be up to six (6) feet in height if placed in the secondary front
yard of corner lots in residential districts provided that the fence does not
exceed three (3) feet in height within the structure setback of the primary
front yard and the fence does not encroach on the clear vision area. (revised
3/18/09)
         2.   Height of Fences, Solid Walls and Hedges in Front Yards. Fences,
solid walls and hedges in excess of three (3) feet in height in the minimum
front yard building setback area are prohibited in all R-1 and R-2 Residential
Districts.
         3.   Fences in residential districts shall be comprised of chain-link,
aluminum, wood, vinyl, composite, or other material as approved by the Zoning
Administrator. Alternate fencing materials may be allowed in business and
industrial zoning districts subject to conformance with Section 1325.05.
         4.   Height of Fences in Business and Industrial Districts. Fences may
be up to eight (8) feet in height in the side and rear yards up to the front
building line of the principal structure. Fences abutting residential districts
shall conform to those regulations applicable to the residential district.
Fences, solid walls and hedges in the minimum front yard setback may be allowed
through Site Plan Review or as part of a Planned Unit Development as determined
appropriate by the City Council based on site suitability to allow for
additional screening and/or as a buffer for noise reduction.
         5.   Electric Fences and Barbs or Spikes on Fences. No above grade
fence shall have barbs or spikes or be of metal construction, which is charged
or connected with electrical current within any district of the City. These
fencing types shall only be permitted through a Conditional Use Permit.
         6.   Placement of Fences Along Lot Lines. Fences may be placed along
lot lines provided no damage of any kind results to the abutting property.

property.
         8.   Fences in Public Rights-of-way. No fence, wall or hedge may be
placed in a public right-of-way.
         9.   Fences in Non-Residential Situations and Exceptional and Unusual
Circumstances in Residential Districts. Deviation from these require-ments for
fences, walls and landscape screening may be permitted after Planning
Commission review and Council approval of a site plan with documentation
showing the unusual circumstances justifying the proposed deviation and plans
for the proposed fence, wall, or landscape screening. This provision is
intended to allow flexibility in meeting the purpose and intent of this
subdivision without the necessity of proving a hardship as is required in the
variance procedure. The objective of this provision is to improve the
livability, appearance, and security of properties and their relationships to
one another.
         10.   Fences which are temporary in nature shall be allowed seasonally
for the purpose of protecting gardens or lawns from natural elements. Temporary
fences that are 48 inches or less shall be allowed without a zoning permit and
temporary fences over 48 inches are prohibited. Other purposes for temporary
fencing may be permitted on a case-by-case review subject to the approval of
the Zoning Administrator. Temporary fencing may be installed for a duration not
to exceed 150 days with snow fencing to be removed no later than April 1st each
year. Examples of temporary fencing materials allowed are snow or safety fence
(i.e. plastic), silt fence (i.e. fabric), or wire fence. Temporary fencing
shall be subject to all other fence regulations listed within the ordinance.
Silt fencing or fencing utilized at a construction site associated with an
active grading and erosion control or building permit issued by the City is
allowed as an exception to this provision for duration and height. Temporary
fencing installed in conjunction with a City permit is subject to removal prior
to the final inspection.  (revised 8/28/2023)
   Subd. 5   Restrictions on Nonresidential Uses Located in Residential
Districts. In the granting of Conditional Use Permit or Planned Unit
Development permits for nonresidential uses other than detached single family
homes (i.e. uses such as houses of worship, day care facilities (over 10),
residential facility (over 6), public uses, schools of any kind, multiple
family dwellings, boarding houses and dormitories to be located in a
residential district on a site of one (1) acre or more), the Council shall not
permit access from that site to a cul-de-sac or local street and also shall not
permit any structure or hard surface area to be constructed on said site closer
than seventy-five (75) feet from any adjacent residential lot.
   Subd. 6   Aesthetics.
      A.   Evaluation of Impact. The proposed design, scale, massing,
materials, height and other aspects of the subject matter of any permit
requested hereunder shall be evaluated by the Planning Commission and the
Council with respect to structures and properties in the surrounding area. To
this end, the Planning Commission and the Council shall consider, prior to the
issuance of any permit hereunder, whether the appearance of the subject matter
is so at variance with the structures and properties in the surrounding area as
to cause a substantial depreciation in the property values in the surrounding
area or to unreasonable detract from the appearance of the area or the city as
a whole.
      B.   Applicability. The foregoing considerations shall be applicable to
any permit applications other than detached dwelling units.
   Subd. 7   Design Standards for Principal Structures in Residential Zoning
Districts.
      A.   Minimum Width. All principal structures in residential zoning
districts, except mobile homes in approved mobile home parks, shall have a

exterior walls.
      B.   Foundation. All principal structures in residential districts,
except manufactured home in approved manufactured home parks, shall be placed
on permanent foundations that comply with the requirements of the State
Building Code and are continuous and solid for the entire perimeter of the
structure.
      C.   Permitted encroachments in Section
1325.03 Subd 2 shall be exempt from subparts 1 and 2 above.
   Subd. 8   Additional Design Standards for New Development, Redevelopment,
and Modifications to Existing Sites in the B2 and B3 Districts. (revised  04/
27/15) Unless preempted by the standards in this section, all other zoning
provisions shall apply:
      A.   Purpose and Intent. The purpose of these additional design standards
is to promote a high level of architectural, landscaping, and site design in
the business districts of Arden Hills. The City seeks to create a unified,
harmonious, and high-quality environment to foster a distinct, positive, and
successful image for the City. The criteria by which new development,
redevelopment, and site modifications in the Districts shall be judged are as
follows:
         1.   Consistency with provisions of the comprehensive plan and other
guiding plans as amended from time to time; provisions of the zoning ordinance
and subdivision ordinance; and all other applicable regulations.
         2.   Use of appropriate materials, lighting, textures, colors, and
architectural and landscape forms to create a unified, high-quality design
concept for each site that is compatible with adjacent and neighboring
structures and functions.
         3.   Creation of unified site designs, each with a sense of internal
order, that provide desirable environments for site users and visitors and the
community as a whole and that consider all site elements.
         4.   Provision of safe and adequate access from public streets to
sites giving ample consideration to the location and number of access points,
the safety and convenience of merging and turning movements, and traffic
management and mitigation.
         5.   Provision of on-site vehicular, bicycling, and pedestrian
circulation by way of interior drives, parking areas, pathways, and walkways
adequate to handle anticipated needs and to safety buffer pedestrians and
cyclists from motor vehicles. Ample consideration shall be given to the width
of interior drives, internal traffic movement and flow, separation of
pedestrian, cycling, automobile; and delivery traffic, and the safe,
convenient, and practical arrangement of parking spaces.
      B.   Application. The standards in this Section should apply only to the
building or site elements being developed or altered (i.e. a proposal for
changes to a building would be required to meet only those standards that
pertain to buildings while changes to a parking area would be required to meet
the standards for parking areas but not for buildings). The design standards
shall be applied proportionately to the degree of change proposed. Upon
recommendation from the Planning Commission, the City Council may waive
specific design standards based on the scale of the project. The City Council
shall make the final determination on the compatibility and consistency with
the design standards.
      C.   Architectural Style and Building Character. Evaluation of a project
shall be based on the quality of its design and on its relationship to its
surroundings. Site characteristics to be evaluated for this purpose include,
but are not limited to, building and landscaping materials, colors, textures,
shapes, massing, building components, height, roof-line, and setback. Monotony
of design, both within projects and between projects and its surrounding, is
prohibited. Variation in detail, form, and arrangement shall provide visual
interest. (revised 11/25/13)
      D.   Buildings shall be constructed of materials that are enduring,
timeless, and well-detailed. Other new materials of equal or better quality to
those listed may be approved by the Community Development Department. (revised
11/25/13)
         1.   At least seventy-five percent (75%) of the exterior building
materials shall be of brick masonry, tile masonry, natural stone (or synthetic
equivalent), decorative concrete plank, transparent glass or any combination
thereof. (revised 11/25/13)
         2.   Trim and other accent or decorative features may be metal, wood,
split faced block, EIFS, or stucco. Metals shall have a matte finish and have
visible corner moldings and trim when used on exterior walls. EIFS shall be
located at least twelve (12) feet above the ground line. (revised 11/25/13)
         3.   Undesirable materials shall include simulated brick, vinyl or
aluminum siding, sheet or corrugated metal siding, plain concrete blocks or
panels, brightly colored metal roofing or canopies, pre-cast tilt-up walls,
mirrored or reflective glass, and materials that represent corporate colors or
logos not in conformance with approved building materials. (revised 11/25/13)
      E.   Building Design. The arrangement, massing, materials and colors
shall work to create a high quality development that is responsive to existing
buildings, site features, and site design on adjoining sites in the district.
(revised 11/25/13)
         1.   At least fifty percent (50%) of the largest building on each site
shall be constructed at the front setback line.
         2.   Façade treatment shall be carried around all sides. Architectural
elements such as, but not limited to, windows, shutters, awnings, doors,
masonry exterior veneers, cornice detailing, window casings, and other
architectural details should demonstrate consistency on all sides of the
structure that are reasonably visible to the general public. Plain flat walls
shall not be permitted when viewable from the public right-of-way or public
areas.
         3.   To avoid long unbroken expanses and to increase visual interest
from the street, buildings of more than 40 feet in width shall be divided into
smaller increments (between 20 and 40 feet) through articulation of the facades
to convey the impression of individually-constructed small storefronts or, in
the case of housing, housing units. This can be achieved through the
combination of the following techniques:
            a)   The use of windows and doors;
            b)   Façade modulation-stepping backward or forward or extending a
portion of the façade;
            c)   Vertical divisions into storefronts with separate display
windows and entrances;
            d)   Recesses and projections such as porches, dormers and bays
that create shadows and add visual interest;
            e)   Variation in the rooflines by using multiple roof and ridge
lines perpendicular to one another, offsetting single roof lines, stepped
roofs;
            f)   Providing a lighting fixture, trellis, tree, or other
landscape feature with each interval.
         4.   Awnings or overhangs shall be provided at the primary entryway
and at all entrances fronting a public street to provide protection for
pedestrians. Awnings shall be opaque so as not to create a glowing effect with
lights under the awnings. Awnings shall be constructed of durable and
protective material, and shall be properly maintained. Plastic or fiberglass
awnings shall not be permitted. (revised 11/25/13)
         5.   Any multi-level building shall distinguish the ground floor level
from the upper floors by use of any or a combination of these techniques: an
intermediate cornice line, difference in building materials or details, awnings
trellis or arcade, special window details, or brick corbels or quoins. A strong
base and top for multi-story buildings shall be established; middle layers
shall be simpler. Detail shall be an integral part of the architecture rather
than a series of applied elements.
         6.   Standardized corporate or franchise architecture identified with
a particular chain shall be discouraged unless it is compatible with
surrounding architecture and conforms to these design standards. (revised 11/
25/13)
         7.   Entrances shall have convenient access to the street frontage and
to parking serving the use. For those properties along County Road E, access to
the street frontage shall be given priority where feasible.
      F.   Window and Door Openings (revised 10/25/21)
         1.   Commercial Façade Transparency.
            a)   Fifty percent (50%) of all first level building façades that
front a public street shall be comprised of transparent windows or doors in
order to allow views of interior uses and activities.
            b)   If the building is a one story design and the first floor
elevation exceeds twelve (12) feet, then only the first twelve (12) feet shall
be included in calculating the façade area. (revised 11/30/15)
            c)   The City may consider a proportional reduction in the
transparent window and door requirement on the public street façade if
additional transparent glass is used on the remaining sides. (revised 11/30/15)
         2.   Residential Façade Transparency. Twenty percent (20%) of all
residential building façades that front a public street shall be comprised of
transparent windows or doors in order to allow views of interior uses and
activities. Transparency requirement may be waived by the City where privacy
concerns warrant. (revised 11/30/15)
         3.   Configurations. The shape, size, and placement of windows and
doors shall emphasize the intended organization and articulation of the façade.
Windows and doors shall be recessed at least one inch rather than being flush
with the building façade. (revised 11/25/13)
         4.    Materials. Acceptable materials for window trim include anodized
aluminum, steel, wood, and clad wood. Door trim shall be made of steel, wood,
or clad wood. (revised 11/25/13)
         5.   For buildings with a use or function that does not readily allow
windows (e.g. cooler or freezer areas, mechanical rooms, security areas,
storage areas) the transparent window standards may be reduced at the
discretion of the City Council. However, aesthetic interest must be provided by
the use of upper level windows or architectural detailing that provides arches,
patterning, recesses, and shadowing. Architectural detailing may include such
things as change in materials, change in color and other significant visual
relief provided in a manner or at intervals in keeping with the size, mass, and
scale of the wall. (revised 11/25/13)
      G.   Building Color. Building colors shall be muted. Recommended colors
include browns, grays, tans, beiges, and dark or muted green, blues, and reds.
Bright or brilliant colors and sharply contrasting colors may be used for only
accent purposes occupying a maximum of five percent (5%) of building façades.
(revised 11/25/13)
      H.   Fences. Fences shall blend into the landscape, be compatible with
other materials used on site, and be made of a material that minimizes
corrosion. Finished and treated wood, brick, stone or wrought iron is
encouraged.
      I.   Signs.
         1.   Business signs shall be architecturally compatible with the
style, materials, colors and details of the building. Signs shall be
incorporated into the façades of the buildings rather than extending past the
roof line and should not project more than twelve (12) inches beyond the plane
of the façades. Retail business wall signs shall be located in a position above
the front window that is located consistently among stores. (revised 11/25/13)
 
         2.   All other provisions in
Chapter 12, Sign Code, shall apply.
      J.   Site Furnishings and Seating Areas.
         1.   Site furnishings shall be provided based on the scale of the
project. The site furnishings may be spread out on the site or clustered to
provide a more formal area. Placing site furnishings near landscaped areas is
encouraged. These areas may be shared by multiple tenants on a property or
adjacent properties and may include tables, chairs, benches, plantings, and
other outdoor amenities such as a plaza. These areas shall be maintained for
year round use. Creativity is highly encouraged. These spaces shall be
connected to the sidewalk system.
         2.   Benches and decorative plantings shall be provided near the
primary entrance of all buildings on a site.

         3.   Truck docks and delivery areas shall face away from the public
street and shall be integrated into the architecture of the building.
      L.   Landscaping. A minimum of one tree shall be placed along the right-
of-way every forty (40) feet. The tree shall not interfere with the roadway and
shall be on private property. (revised 11/25/13)
      M.   Parking.  (revised 10/25/21)
         1.   Sufficient parking shall be provided to accommodate the
reasonable hourly peak on a given site. Shared parking is encouraged to reduce
land devoted to parking. Hourly variations among different types of land use
may be considered when estimated parking demands.
         2.   Plantings shall be used to soften and shade parking lots and
parking structures. Parking adjacent to streets should be screened from view
with landscaping, including but not limited to trees, hedges, flowers and other
bushes and/or decorative masonry walls. Berms shall be discouraged. (revised
11/25/13)
         3.   Parking lot islands shall be used to distribute large parking

indicators through door placement, signage, striping, raised pathways, and
integrating landscaping components.  (revised 11/25/13)
         2.   An internal sidewalk system shall link the primary entrance of
each building on site with the public sidewalk or trail network. In the event a
building is subdivided into multiple separated tenant spaces, a sidewalk must
link the primary entrance of each separated tenant space with the public
sidewalk network. (revised 11/25/13)
         3.   Where there is new building construction or renovation where the
renovation value is thirty percent (30%) or more of the pre-renovation value of
the structure, a minimum six foot concrete sidewalk adjacent to or in all
rights-of-way shall be provided. The location of the sidewalk shall be
prescribed by the Public Works Director. The new sidewalks shall connect to
sidewalks on adjacent properties if they exist. At the discretion of the City
Council, the property owner may, in lieu of constructing the sidewalk, pay the

1325.055   Tree and Landscaping Preservation.
(Adopted 4/28/08; revised 11/28/2022)
   Subd. 1   Findings, Purpose and City Authority.
      A.   Findings and Purpose. The purpose of this section is to identify
trees that are to be saved when development or land disturbing activity is
occurring. It is the City's intent to protect, preserve, and enhance the
natural environment of Arden Hills and to encourage a resourceful and prudent
approach to development. The city council finds it is in the best interest of
the city to protect, preserve, and enhance the natural environment of the
community and to encourage a resourceful and prudent approach to development
and property alteration. In the interest of achieving these objectives, the
city has established the comprehensive tree preservation regulations herein to
promote the furtherance of the following:
         1.   Protect and preserve the environment and natural beauty of the
City;
         2.   Minimize tree and habitat loss during development and
construction;
         3.   Establish minimum standards for tree preservation, landscaping,
and the mitigation of environmental impacts resulting from landscape tree
removal;
         4.   Enforce tree preservation and landscaping standards to promote
and protect the public health, safety and welfare of the community;
         5.   Increase and maintain property values;
         6.   Enhance energy conservation through natural insulation and
shading;
         7.   Prevent or reduce soil erosion, sedimentation and stormwater
runoff;
         8.   Protect privacy by maintaining buffers between land uses; and
         9.   Preserve the variety and extent of trees which exist in the City
and which are an integral part of this City's identity.
      B.   City Authority. To preserve protected trees, the City may:
         1.    Require and enforce a tree preservation plan as described below;
         2.    Specify trees or groups of trees for preservation;
         3.    Specify grading limits;
         4.    Require the clustering of buildings or the relocation of roads,
drives, buildings, utilities or storm water facilities when this would preserve
protected trees;
         5.    Specify time periods in which tree cutting, trimming or injury
may not occur in order to prevent the spread of disease; and
         6.    Require easements to ensure that groups of significant trees are
not destroyed after the development has been approved.
   Subd. 2   Tree Preservation Plan.
      A. Scope. A Tree Preservation Plan is required as part of an application
for:
         1.    New building construction in any zoning district;
         2.    An expansion of an existing building or hard surface by ten
percent or greater, where an approved tree preservation plan is not on file
with the city;
         3.    Any project for which a city grading permit or erosion control
permit is required
         4.    A plat or minor subdivision.
      B.    Tree Preservation Plan Submission Requirements. A Tree Preservation
Plan must include a tree survey certified by a registered land surveyor,
landscape architect, or forester. See Appendix A for details on the
requirements of a Tree Preservation Plan. Projects on residential sites of
fewer than two lots are not required to have tree surveys certified. Applicants
are encouraged to consult with city staff concerning preservation of protected
trees before developing a Tree Preservation Plan.
      C.    Review Process. The tree preservation plan shall be reviewed by the
city to assess the best possible layout to preserve significant trees and to
enhance the efforts to minimize damage to significant trees. The applicant
shall meet with city staff prior to submission of the development application
or prior to application for the grading permit, whichever is sooner, to
determine the most feasible and practical placement of buildings, parking,
driveways, streets, storage and other physical features, in order that the
fewest significant trees are destroyed or damaged.
   Subd. 3   Performance Guarantee.
      A.   Any applicant required to submit a tree preservation plan shall
provide the required performance guarantee following preliminary approval of
the tree preservation plan and prior to any construction and/or grading to
insure completion and maintenance of all landscaping and trees in accordance
with the approved tree preservation plan required hereunder.
      B.   The amount of a bond or other approved financial surety shall be
125% of the cost of materials and installation.
      C.   The bond or other financial surety shall be provided prior to the
issuance of any building or grading permits and shall be valid for two full
years, from the date of installation.
      D.   For any tree that is not in accordance with the approved tree
preservation plan at the end of two growing seasons, the applicant shall
replace the material to the satisfaction of the city before the guarantee is
released. Where this is not done, the city, at its sole discretion, may use the
proceeds of the performance guarantee to accomplish performance.
   Subd. 4   Compliance with Plan. The applicant shall implement the tree
preservation plan prior to and during any construction. The tree protection
measures shall remain in place until all grading and construction activity is
terminated.
      A.   Tree Removal Prior to Approval. No significant trees shall be
removed until a tree preservation plan is approved by the city and except in
accordance with the approved tree preservation plan.
      B.   Inspection. The city shall have the right to inspect the development
and/or building site in order to determine compliance with the approved tree
preservation plan. The city shall determine whether compliance with the tree
preservation plan has been met.
      C.   Unapproved Tree Loss. If a tree that was required to be preserved is
removed or damaged so that it is in a state of decline within two growing
seasons from date of project closure, it must be mitigated at a rate of 2:1, or
two caliper inches of trees replaced for every caliper inch of tree removed.
This provision also applies to an easement area that is disturbed during or
after development. The City may use the performance guarantee to accomplish
this.
   Subd. 5   Tree Removal and Preservation.
      A.   Tree Removal Allowance. Mitigation shall not be required for
removing, cutting, or killing trees when:
         1.   Fewer than ten (10) percent of the caliper inches of the
significant trees on the property are cut, removed, or killed
         2.   There is an existing principal use on the property and no
construction, grading, or development is to occur in the location of the
removed tree(s) within two years thereafter.
         3.   The trees to be removed, cut, or killed are identified as
diseased or nuisance trees.
      B.   Reduced Requirements. Mitigation requirements can be reduced as
determined by the City Council when there is a greater public good such as;
         1.   Allowing for LEED Certified architectural practices;
         2.   Providing affordable housing;
         3.   Allowing for a public road or trail; or
         4.   Providing for a public utility service.
      C.   Planned Unit Developments. A PUD plan for a new subdivision will be
approved only if it demonstrates that the new subdivision has a reasonable
number of lots or units and has lot lines and building pads that minimize tree
loss. Mitigation must be provided for any removal of significant trees.
      D.   Diseased and Nuisance Trees. Prior to grading, all diseased and
nuisance trees on the subject property shall be removed from the property at
the time of grading and prior to the commencement of building construction.
Diseased and nuisance trees shall not count toward calculation of significant
tree inventory.
      E.   Removal of Trees Prior to Application Submittal. A tree that was
removed or otherwise destroyed by unnatural causes within two years before a
development application will be regarded as if it were present at the time of
construction or a development application.
   Subd. 6   Approved Tree Mitigation.
      A.   Mitigation Standards. Mitigation for tree removal of significant
trees must meet the following specific standards;
         1.   Mitigation Rate. Significant live trees lost or reasonably
anticipated to be lost as a result of building, construction, or grading
immediately or in the future, shall be replaced by the property owner by
planting that number of caliper inches of trees ("replacement trees")
determined at a rate of 1:2 or one inch replaced for every two inches lost. The
trees required to be replaced pursuant to this Section shall be in addition to
any other trees required to be planted pursuant to any other provision of the
Code.
         2.   Mitigation Species. Replacement trees shall be of a species
similar to the trees which are lost or removed and shall include those species
pre-approved in writing by the City. The City maintains a list of trees
provided for guidance in selection of trees and shrubs.
         3.   General Mitigation Standards.
            a)   All replacement trees shall meet the American Standards for
Nursery Stock relating to quality of stock and appropriate sizing of the root
ball for balled and burlapped and spade-moved trees.
            b)   Trees planted in accordance with mitigation requirements shall
not be comprised of more than 25 percent of the same species or size unless
approved by the city.
            c)   Replacement trees shall be planted on the same property from
which the trees were removed. If the City determines, at its sole discretion,
that the number of replacement trees to be planted exceeds the number of trees
that can be accommodated practically on-site, off-site planting may occur at
locations to be determined by the City, or a landscaping fee in lieu of off-
site planting may be required as provided in paragraph d below.
            d)   Where tree replacement on-site in satisfaction of Subd. 6.A
above is not practical and a suitable off-site location cannot be determined by
the City, a landscaping fee in lieu thereof may be assessed for the replacement
required. The landscaping fee amount shall be the cost of materials and
installation of tree(s), plus ten (10) percent, and shall be provided by the
applicant and approved by the City. All landscaping funds collected shall be
expended exclusively towards landscaping, as defined by the ordinance, for
implementation of the goals listed in Subd. 1 of this section and Section
1325.05, Subd. 1.A.
            e)    Development that is subject to the landscape requirements in
Section
1325.05 of the Zoning Code may count preserved trees towards the required
landscaping plan. The planting of trees for mitigation shall be in addition to
the landscape requirements of Section
1325.05 and shall be replaced in accordance with paragraph c and/or d above.
            f)   The required mitigation trees shall be replaced by the
property owner or original developer if they have died or have severely
declined after the second full growing season following installation. A tree
shall be considered to be severely declined if more than 25 percent of the
crown has died.
   Subd. 7   General Tree Protection Standards.
      A.   Prior to Construction. Before construction, grading or land clearing
begins; trees or tree areas that are to be preserved shall be visibly marked
and the city-approved tree protection fencing or other method shall be
installed and maintained at the critical root zones of the trees to be
protected. The location of the fencing shall be in conformance with the
approved tree preservation plan. This fencing shall be inspected by city staff
before site work begins.
      B.   During Construction. The following activities shall be prohibited
within the critical root zone areas of trees to be protected.
         1.   Trenching;
         2.   Temporary storage of any construction materials or chemicals; and
         3.   The routing or parking of heavy equipment, including cars,
trucks, bulldozers and construction trailers.
         4.   Sediment and erosion control. All sediment and erosion-control
silt fencing or straw bales shall be placed at the limits of grading or where
needed to minimize the deposition of sediment within the drip line of the
protected tree(s).
         5.    Attaching protective devices, signs, etc., to trees is
prohibited. No protective devices, signs, utility poles or lines, or other
objects shall be nailed or attached to any trees that are to be preserved.
         6.   Other actions prohibited. Any other action within the drip line
of the protected tree(s) that may result in the severing of roots or compaction
of soil, or that may impede the free access of air and water to tree roots,
shall be prohibited.
      C.   Ponding. Water retention ponding may not be located where there are
significant trees, unless approved by the city. The water retention ponding
must be created in a manner that prevents erosion into any nearby water
resource.
      D.   Amendments to Plan. An amendment to the tree preservation plan shall
be required prior to the removal of trees that were designated for preservation
on the original tree preservation plan. The amendment shall be subject to City
approval prior to implementation.
1325.06   Requirements for Parking, Loading and Circulation. (revised 4/28/08)

Code, a parking space shall be not less than three hundred (300) square feet
per vehicle of standing and maneuvering area. Individual spaces shall be at
least nine (9) feet in width and eighteen (18) feet in length.
      B.   Access. All off-street parking spaces shall have access driveways
and access directly to public streets or alleys. Curb cuts for uses other than
single family homes shall require approval from the Council. The number of curb
cuts along arterial and collector roads shall be held to a minimum whenever
possible. Any residential lot, which has frontage on both a local street and a
collector street or a major or minor arterial (as defined by the Comprehensive
Plan of Arden Hills) shall gain access only from the local street.
      C.   Construction Standards. These standards shall apply to all
development:
         1.   Surfacing. Off-street parking areas and drives shall be improved
with a paved surface. Such areas shall be so graded and drained so as to
dispose of all surface water accumulation within the area as required by the
City and the Rice Creek Watershed District.
         2.   Curbs. A concrete curb and gutter shall be constructed for all
developments according to the requirements of the City Engineer except
driveways for single and two-family residences.
      D.   Location. All off-street parking spaces herein required shall be
located according to the following:
         1.   Spaces required for one and two family dwellings shall be on the
same lot as the principal structure.
         2.   Spaces required for multiple-family dwellings shall be on the
same lot as the principal structure served or within two hundred (200) feet of
the main entrance if not located on the same lot.
         3.   Spaces required for business and industrial uses should be within
eight hundred (800) feet of the main entrance to the principal building served.
         4.   No off-street parking space, with the exception of the driveways,
shall be within twenty (20) feet of the right-of-way line of any public street,
except in the GB District where the setback shall be fifty (50) feet.
         5.   In no case shall off-street parking areas containing four (4) or
more parking spaces be closer than five (5) feet from any side or rear lot
lines, except in the GB District where no such parking shall be closer than
twenty (20) feet to any exterior project lot lines other than for joint
facilities as permitted herein, or as otherwise permitted in this Code.
         6.   If required parking is located on a site other than the site on
which the principal building or use is located, a properly drawn legal
instrument, executed by the parties involved, must be executed and filed with
the City and the proper county office, if deemed necessary by the City
Attorney, which provides for such parking and which shall not be terminated
without approval by the City Council.
      E.   Joint Facilities. The required off-street parking spaces for two (2)
or more uses may be located jointly on the same lot, adjoining lot, or in the
same structure when
         1.   The number of spaces provided is equal to or greater than the sum
of the separate requirements for each use; and
         2.   The joint facility is reasonably related to the destination of
the user; and
         3.   It can be demonstrated that there will be no substantial conflict
in the principal operating hours of the uses to be served; and
         4.   Setbacks for such joint parking facilities meet the minimum
parking setback requirement from any lot lines other than the common lot lines
between the lots involved in the joint parking where setback requirements may
be waived; and
         5.   A properly drawn legal instrument, executed by the parties
involved, is filed with the City and the proper county office, if deemed
necessary by the City Attorney, which provides for such mutual parking
agreement which shall be terminated without the approval of the Council.
      F.   Reduction in Number of Required Spaces. The number of spaces
required for a specific use may be reduced if the owner or occupant provides
documentation that a lesser number of spaces will actually be needed than
normally required by this Code and the City Council authorizes such lesser
number after recommendation by the Planning Commission. The difference in the
number of spaces provided and those required shall be shown on the approved
site plan as "proof-of-parking" and shall be constructed if and when the need
for such additional spaces arises.
      G.   Conversion or Alteration of Approved Uses. Commercial or industrial
buildings for a use, or uses, which is proposed to be converted, remodeled, or
modified to accommodate another allowable use, or uses, which has a greater
off-street parking requirement shall be required to apply for Site Plan Review
and approval to assure the adequacy of off-street parking.
      H.   Parking Structures. The minimum setbacks of parking structures shall
be the same as for principal buildings in the district and the exterior finish

conditional accessory uses or structures. They are therefore allowed only on
property containing a principal use or structure to which the antenna, dish
antenna or tower is accessory or secondary. (revised 11/30/15)
      B.   Towers that were in existence prior to April 8, 2010 are allowed as
conditional uses and may be the primary use on a property. New antennas may be
added to said towers subject to the limitations of the conditional use permit
for each tower.
      C.   Antennas, dish antennas, and towers located on property owned by the
City of Arden Hills shall not require a conditional use permit and shall not be
subject to the height regulations in Subd. 5, Height, of this section.
   Subd. 5   Height. (revised 5/6/10) The height of an antenna or tower shall
be measured from the ground at the base of the antenna, tower, or other
structure that the antenna is attached to, to the highest point of the antenna
or tower. No antenna or tower shall exceed the following height limitations:
      A.   A dish antenna shall not exceed fifteen (15) feet in height if
ground or pole mounted and shall not extend more than twelve (12) feet above
the roof if it is roof mounted. Regardless of these height limitations, the

Section 1330 - Shoreland Regulations
1330.01   General Provisions.
   Subd. 1   Intent. The uncontrolled use of shorelands within the City of
Arden Hills affects the public health, safety and general welfare not only by
contributing to pollution of public waters, but also by impairing the local tax
base. Therefore, it is in the best interest of the public health, safety and
welfare to provide for the wise development of shorelands of public waters. The
Legislature of Minnesota has delegated responsibility to the municipalities of
the State to regulate the subdivision, use, and development of the shorelands
of public waters and thus preserve and enhance the quality of surface waters,
preserve the economic and natural environmental values of shorelands, and
provide for the wise utilization of waters and related land resources. This
responsibility shall hereby be recognized by the City of Arden Hills.
   Subd. 2   Purpose. To achieve the policies described in the City's
Comprehensive Plan and State and Federal policies and statutes, the City
intends to determine, control and guide future development within and
surrounding those land areas which are contiguous to designated bodies of
public water and areas of as herein defined and regulated. Specifically, the
City of Arden Hills Purports to:
   A.    Regulate the placement of sanitary and storm water disposal facilities
on lots;
      B.   Regulate the area of a lot, the length of water frontage suitable
for a building site, and setbacks;
      C.   Regulate alteration of the shorelands and wetlands of public waters;
      D.   Control natural environment areas of ecological value to maintain
existing aquatic, vegetation, and wildlife conditions to the maximum extent
possible;
   E.    Promote the use of native vegetation as a means to increase stormwater
infiltration, provide natural view sheds, and screen structures and parking
areas as viewed from public waters.
      1.    Statutory Authorization. This Section is adopted pursuant to the
authorization contained in furtherance of the policies declared in Minnesota
Statutes Chapters 105 and 462 and Minnesota Regulations Parts 6120.2500-
6120.3900.
      2.    Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It shall not be intended by
this Section to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or
deed restrictions. However, where this Section imposes greater restrictions,
the provisions of this Section shall prevail.
      3.    Jurisdiction. This Section shall apply to all lands located within
the boundaries of the shoreland.
1330.02   Shoreland Management Districts and Uses.
   Subd. 1   Classification of Lakes. In order to guide the wise development
and utilization of shorelands of protected waters for the preservation of water
quality, natural characteristics, economic values and general health, safety
and welfare, certain protected waters in the City have been given a shoreland
management classification. These protected waters of the City have been
classified below consistent with the criteria found in Minnesota Regulations,
Part 6120.3300, and the Protected Waters Inventory Map for Ramsey County,
Minnesota.

   Subd. 2   Establishment of Shoreland Management Districts; Zoning Map. The
boundaries of the Shoreland Management Districts are hereby continued as shown
on the map entitled "Official Zoning Map of Arden Hills, Minnesota," which map
shall be properly approved and filed in the office of the City Administrator.
The shoreland management districts overlay existing zoning districts of the
City also shown on the official zoning map pursuant to this Code and the City
of Arden Hills Zoning Code. As indicated in this Section, certain portions of
the shorelands in the shoreland management districts are classified general
development, recreational development, or natural environment lakes. The map
and all of the notations, references and other information shown thereon shall
have the same force and effect as if set forth in this Section at length.
   Subd. 3   Boundaries of Shoreland Management Districts. The boundaries of
the shoreland management districts shall be determined by scaling distances on
the official zoning map. Where interpretation is needed as to the exact
location of the boundaries of a shoreland management district shown on the
official zoning map, for example where there appears to be a conflict between a
mapped boundary and actual field conditions, the City Council shall make the
necessary interpretation based upon topographic elevations and other available
technical data. Persons contesting the location of the shoreland management
district boundaries shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present their
case to the City Council and to submit technical evidence.
1330.03   General Provisions.
(revised 6/28/21)

permit under the procedures of Minnesota Statutes.
      D.    Permeable Surface Credit. At the discretion of the Zoning
Administrator, up to five percent of a lot's required landscaped area, but not
exceeding 700 square feet, may be covered with pervious hard surfaces subject
to the approval of a Shoreland Mitigation Plan.
      E.    Shoreland Mitigation. A shoreland mitigation plan must be submitted
for residential development that requires land use approval including, but not
limited to, variances; conditional use permits; subdivisions; rezonings; or a
permeable surface credit. The plan shall be designed to mitigate the adverse
effects land development has on water quality and the lake environment. The
mitigation plan shall be signed by the property owner, approved by the Zoning
Administrator, and a Mitigation Affidavit recorded with the Register of Deeds
prior to the commencement of development activity. Furthermore, mitigation
plans shall be completed within one year of the plan's approval unless
otherwise approved by the City. An escrow fee that shall be held for a minimum
of two years shall also be submitted. The mitigation plan shall include at a
minimum two of the following practices:
         1.    Vegetation Restoration. Vegetation restoration areas may be
established which at a minimum shall include land within the shore and the
bluff impact zones or steep slopes. Land area shall be restored from lawn,
beach or other disturbances using native or natural landscaping.

are vegetated with turf may be restored with deciduous and ornamental trees,
evergreens and shrubs that are native to the area.
            b)   Shoreline Buffer Restoration. A buffer zone of at least 25
feet from and parallel to the ordinary high water mark shall be planted or
restored and maintained with vegetation native to the area to fullest
practicable extent possible with effective erosion and sediment control.
Existing natural beaches or beaches which have been permitted by the DNR shall
be allowed to continue and be maintained. A minimum of 30 percent of the lot's
shoreline area shall be restored. This restoration area shall be contiguous
unless otherwise approved as part of the mitigation plan.
         2.    Architectural Mass. The use of natural color(s) and/or materials
on the exterior of the structure shall be used to reduce the visual impact.
Natural colors are shades of brown, gray, and green. Natural materials include
wood or stone that complement the setting of the structure.
         3.    Removal of Nonconforming Structures. The mitigation plan may
include the removal of structures that do not comply with the required
structure setbacks from the ordinary high water line or are located within a
shore impact zone or bluff impact zone.
         4.    Reduction of Impervious Surface Coverage. The mitigation plan
may include a minimum five percent reduction of the existing impervious surface
coverage. The preferable location of this reduction is within that portion of
the lot that drains to the lake.
         5.    Other Practices. At the discretion of the Zoning Administrator,
other restoration or protection activities may be approved as part of a
mitigation plan provided they meet the objectives of this ordinance. Examples
include the removal of artificial sand beaches, stormwater management and
replacement of seawalls with bioengineering structures.
   Subd. 8   Subdivisions. No land shall be subdivided which shall be held
unsuitable by the City for the proposed use because of flooding, inadequate
drainage, soil and rock formations with severe limitations for development,
severe erosion potential, unfavorable topography, inadequate water supply or

public dedications, or other methods.
   B.    The following factors shall be carefully evaluated to ensure the
increased density of development shall be consistent with the resource
limitations of the protected water:
         1.    Suitability of the site for the proposed use;
         2.    Physical and aesthetic impact of increased density;
         3.    Level of current development;
         4.    Amount and ownership of undeveloped shoreland;
         5.    Levels and types of water surface use and public accesses;
         6.    Possible effects on overall public use.
1330.04   Notification of the Commissioner of Natural Resources.
   Subd. 1   Variances. A copy of any request for a variance to the provisions
of this Section or plats which propose any lots which require variances to the
lot area and dimensional requirements of this Section or the notice of a public
hearing to consider a conditional use permit or planned unit development permit
shall be sent to the Commissioner of Natural Resources such that notice shall
be received by the commissioner at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing or
action on the request.

         3.   As an alternative, and consistent with Paragraph 2 above, dredge
spoil disposal and sand and gravel operations may allow temporary, onsite
storage of fill or other materials which would have caused an increase to the
stages of the one hundred (100) year or regional flood
but only after the City has received an appropriate plan which assures the
removal of the materials from the floodway based upon the flood warning time
available. The Conditional Use Permit shall be title registered with the
property in the Office of the County Recorder.
      E.   Accessory Structures.
         1.   Accessory structures shall not be designed for human habitation.
         2.   Accessory structures, if permitted, shall be constructed and
placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the flow
of flood waters.
            a)   Whenever possible, structures shall be constructed with the
longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow; and
            b)   So far as practicable, structures shall be placed
approximately on the same flood flow lines as those of adjoining structures.
         3.   Accessory structures shall be elevated or fill or structurally
dry flood proofed in accordance with the FP-1 or FP-2 flood proofing
classifications in the State Building Code. As an alternative, an accessory
structure may be flood proofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 flood proofing
classification in the State Building Code provided the accessory structure
constitutes a minimal investment, does not exceed five hundred (500) square
feet in size at its largest projections, and for a detached garage, the
detached garage shall be used solely for parking of vehicles and limited
storage. All flood proofed accessory structures shall meet the following
additional standards:

structure having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every
square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. There must be openings on at
least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings must be no
higher than one foot above the lowest adjacent grade to the structure. Using
human intervention to open a garage door prior to flooding will not satisfy
this requirement for automatic openings.
      F.   Storage of Materials and Equipment.
         1.   The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of
flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or
plant life shall be prohibited.

removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning and in
accordance with a plan approved by the City Council.
      G.   Structural works for flood control that will change the course,
current or cross section of protected wetlands or public waters shall be
subject to the provisions of Minnesota Statute, Section 103G. Community-wide
structural works for flood control intended to remove areas from the regulatory
flood plain shall not be allowed in the floodway.
      H.   A levee, dike or floodwall constructed in the floodway shall not
cause an increase to the 100-year or regional flood and the technical analysis
shall assume equal conveyance or storage loss on both sides of a stream.
1335.16   Flood Fringe District.
   Subd. 1   Permitted Uses. Permitted uses shall be those uses of land or
structures listed as Permitted Uses in the underlying zoning use district(s).
If no preexisting, underlying zoning use districts exist, then any residential
or non-residential structure or use of a structure or land shall be a Permitted
Use in the Flood Fringe District provided such use does not constitute a public
nuisance. All Permitted Uses shall comply with the standards for Flood Fringe
"Permitted Uses" listed in this Section and the "Standards for all Flood Fringe
Uses" listed in this Subsection.
   Subd. 2   Standards for Flood Fringe Permitted Uses.
      A.   All structures, including accessory structures, shall be elevated on
fill so that the lowest floor including any basement floor is at or above the
Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation. The finished fill elevation for
structures shall be no lower than one (1) foot below the Regulatory Flood
Protection Elevation and the fill shall extend at an elevation of at least
fifteen (15) feet beyond the outside limits of the structure erected thereon.
      B.   As an alternative to elevation on fill, accessory structures that
constitute a minimal investment and that do not exceed five hundred (500)
square feet at its largest projection for the outside dimension at ground level
may be internally flood proofed in accordance with this Section.
      C.   The cumulative placement of fill where at any one time in excess of
one thousand (1,000) cubic yards of fill is located on the parcel shall be
allowable only as a conditional use, unless the fill is specifically intended
to elevate a structure in accordance with this Section.
      D.   The storage of any materials or equipment shall be elevated on fill
to the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation.
   Subd. 3   Conditional Uses. Any structure that is not elevated on fill or
flood proofed in accordance with this Section or any use of land that does not
comply with the standards in this Subsection shall only be allowable as a
conditional use. An application for a conditional use shall be subject to the
standards and criteria and evaluation procedures specified in this Section.
   Subd. 4   Standards for Flood Fringe Conditional Use
      A.   Alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill may be
utilized to elevate a structure's lowest floor above the Regulatory Flood
Protection Elevation. These alternative methods may include the use of stilts,
pilings, parallel walls, etc., or above-grade, enclosed areas such as crawl
spaces or tuck under garages. The base or floor of an enclosed area shall be
considered above-grade and not a structure's basement or lowest floor if:
         1.   The enclosed area is above-grade on at least one side of the
structure;
         2.   It is designed to internally flood and is constructed with flood
resistant materials; and
         3.   It is used solely for parking of vehicles, building access or
storage.
      B.   The above-noted alternative elevation methods shall be subject to
the following additional standards:
         1.   Design and Certification. The structure's design and as-built
condition shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect
as being in compliance with the general design standards of the State Building
Code and, specifically, that all electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and
air conditioning equipment and other service facilities shall be at or above
the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation or be designed to prevent flood water
from entering or accumulating within these components during times of flooding.
         2.   Specific Standards for Above-Grade, Enclosed Areas. Above grade,
fully enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages shall be
designed to internally flood and the design plans shall stipulate:
            a)   The minimum area of openings in the walls where internal
flooding is to be used as a flood proofing technique. There shall be a minimum
of two openings on at least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all
openings shall be no higher than one-foot above grade. The automatic openings
shall have a minimum net area of not less than one square inch for every square
foot of enclosed area subject to flooding unless a registered professional
engineer or architect certifies that a smaller net area would suffice. The
automatic openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
flood waters without any form of human intervention; and
            b)   That the enclosed area shall be designed of flood resistant
materials in accordance with the FP-3 or FP-4 classifications in the State
Building Code and shall be used solely for building access, parking of vehicles
or storage.
      C.   Basements, as defined by this Section, shall be subject to the
following:
         1.   Residential basement construction shall not be allowed below the
Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation.
         2.   Non-residential basements may be allowed below the Regulatory
Flood Protection Elevation provided the basement is structurally dry flood
proofed in accordance with this Section.
      D.   All areas of non-residential structures including basements to be
placed below the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation shall be flood proofed
in accordance with the structurally dry flood proofing classifications in the
State Building Code. Structurally dry flood proofing shall meet the FP-1 or FP-
2 flood proofing classification in the State Building Code and this shall
require making the structure watertight with the walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of
buoyancy. Structures flood proofed to the FP-3 and FP-4 classification shall
not be permitted.
      E.   When at any one time more than one thousand (1,000) cubic yards of
fill or other similar material is located on a parcel for such activities as
on-site storage, landscaping, sand and gravel operations, landfills, roads,
dredge spoil disposal or construction of flood control works, an erosion/
sedimentation control plan shall be submitted unless the community is enforcing
a State-approved shoreland management ordinance. In the absence of a State-
approved shoreland ordinance, the plan shall clearly specify methods to be used
to stabilize the fill on site for a flood event at a minimum of the 100-year or
regional flood event. The plan shall be prepared and certified by a registered
professional engineer or other qualified individual acceptable to the City. The
plan may incorporate alternative procedures for removal of the material from
the flood plain if adequate flood warning time exists.
      F.   Storage of Materials and Equipment.
         1.   The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of
flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or
plant life shall be prohibited.
         2.   Storage of other materials may be allowed if readily removable
from the area within the time available after a flood warning and in accordance
with a plan approved by the City Council.
   Subd. 5   Standards for All Flood Fringe Uses.
      A.   All new principal structures shall have vehicular access at or above
an elevation not more than two (2) feet below the Regulatory Flood Protection
Elevation. If a variance to this requirement is granted, the Board of
Adjustment shall specify limitations on the period of use or occupancy of the
structure for times of flooding and only after determining that adequate flood
warning time and local flood emergency response procedures exist.
      B.   Commercial Uses. Accessory land uses, such as yards, railroad
tracks, and parking lots may be at elevations lower than the Regulatory Flood
Protection Elevation. However, a permit for such facilities to be used by the
employees or the general public shall not be granted in the absence of a flood
warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area would be
inundated to a depth and velocity such that when multiplying the depth (in
feet) times velocity (in feet per second) the product number exceeds four (4)
upon occurrence of the regional flood.
      C.   Manufacturing and Industrial Uses. Measures shall be taken to
minimize interference with normal plans operations especially along streams
having protracted flood durations. Certain accessory land uses such as yards
and parking lots may be at lower elevations subject to requirements set out in
Paragraph B above. In considering permit applications, due consideration shall
be given to needs of an industry whose business requires that it be located in
flood plain areas.
      D.   Fill shall be properly compacted and the slopes shall be properly
protected by the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable method.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for
removing the special flood hazard areas designation for certain structures
properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation - FEMA's
requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection
standards for multi-structure or multi-lot developments. FEMA's standards
should be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change
of special flood hazard area designation will be requested.
      E.   Flood plain developments shall not adversely affect the hydraulic
capacity of the channel and adjoining flood plain of any tributary watercourse
or drainage system where a floodway or other encroachment limit has not been
specified on the Official Zoning Map.
      F.   Standards for recreational vehicles are contained in Section
1325.12.
      G.   All manufactured homes shall be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system that resists flotation, collapse and lateral
movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use
of over-the-top or frame times to ground anchor. This requirement shall be in
addition to applicable state of local anchoring requirements for resisting wind
forces.
1335.17   General Flood Plain District.
   Subd. 1   Permitted Uses.
      A.   The uses listed as permitted uses for Floodway Districts, shall be

Elevation. Procedures consistent with Minnesota Regulations 1983, Parts
6120.5000-6120.6200 and 44 Code of Federal Regulations Part 65 shall be
followed in this expert evaluation. The designated engineer or expert is
strongly encouraged to discuss the proposed technical evaluation methodology
with the respective Department of Natural Resources' Area Hydrologist prior to
commencing the analyst. The designated engineer or expert shall:
         1.   Estimate the peak discharge of the regional flood.
         2.   Calculate the water surface profile of the regional flood based
upon a hydraulic analysis of the stream channel and overbank areas.
         3.   Compute the floodway necessary to convey or store the regional
flood without increasing flood stages more than 0.5 foot. A lesser stage
increase than 0.5 foot shall be required if, as a result of the additional
State increase, increased flood damages would result. An equal degree of
encroachment on both sides of the stream within the reach shall be assumed in
computing floodway boundaries.
      C.   The City Administrator shall present the technical evaluation and
findings of the designated engineer or expert to the City Council. The City
Council shall formally accept the technical evaluation and the recommended
Floodway and/or Flood Fringe District boundary or deny the permit application.
The City Council, prior to official action, may submit the application and all
supporting data and analyses to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the
Department of Natural Resources or the Planning Commission for review and
comment. Once the Floodway and Flood Fringe Boundaries have been determined,
the City Council shall refer the matter back to the City Administrator who
shall process the permit application consistent with the applicable provisions
of this Section.
1335.18   Zone A Lakes.
   Procedures for determining 1% annual chance flood elevations (100-YR flood
elevations) for lakes located in Zone A:
   Subd. 1   Upon receipt of an application for a permit or other approval
within a Zone A, the Zoning Administrator will use the 1% annual chance flood
elevation for that basin that has previously been determined in accordance with
approved FEMA methods, if available. If the 1% annual chance flood elevation
has not been previously determined, the applicant shall be required to furnish
all necessary information as deemed necessary by the Zoning Administrator for
the determination for the 1% annual chance flood elevation in accordance with
approved FEMA methods.
   Subd. 2   The applicant shall be responsible to submit one copy of the above
information to a designated engineer or other expert person or agency for
technical assistance in determining whether the proposed use is in the Floodway
or Flood Fringe District and to determine the 1% annual chance flood elevation
(100-year flood elevation). Procedures consistent with Minnesota Regulations
1983, Parts 6120.5000 - 6120.6200 and 44 Code of Federal Regulations Part 65
shall be followed in this expert evaluation. The designated engineer or expert
is strongly encouraged to discuss the proposed technical evaluation methodology
with the respective Department of Natural Resources' Area Hydrologist prior to
commencing the analysis.
   Subd. 3   Once the 1% annual chance flood elevation (100-year flood
elevation) has been determined, the Zoning Administrator shall process the
permit application consistent with the applicable provisions of this Section.
1335.18   Subdivisions.
   Subd. 1   Review Criteria. No land shall be subdivided which is unsuitable
for the reason of flooding, inadequate drainage, water supply or sewage
treatment facilities. All lots within the flood plain districts shall be able
to contain a building site outside of the Floodway District at or above the
Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation. All subdivisions shall have water and
sewage treatment facilities that comply with the provisions of this Section and
have road access both to the subdivision and to the individual building sites
no lower than two (2) feet below the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation. For
all subdivisions in the flood plain, the Floodway and Flood Fringe boundaries,
the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation and the required elevation of all
access roads shall be clearly labeled on all required subdivisions drawings and
platting documents.
   Subd. 2   Floodway/Flood Fringe Determinations in the General Flood Plain
District. In the General Flood Plain District applicants shall provide the
information required to determine the one hundred (100) year flood elevation,
the Floodway and Flood Fringe District boundaries and the Regulatory Flood
Protection Elevation for the subdivision site.
   Subd. 3   Removal of Special Flood Hazard Area Designation. The Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for removing the
special flood hazard area designation for certain structures properly elevated
on fill above the one hundred (100) year flood elevation. FEMA's requirements
incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection standards for
multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These FEMA standards should be
investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of special
flood hazard area designation will be requested.
1335.19   Public Utilities, Railroads, Roads, and Bridges.
   Subd. 1   All public utilities and facilities such as gas, electrical,
sewer, and water supply systems to be located in the flood plain shall be flood
proofed in accordance with the State Building Code or elevated to above the
Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation.
   Subd. 2   Public Transportation Facilities. Railroad tracks, roads, and
bridges to be located within the flood plain shall comply with this code.
Elevation to the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation shall be provided where
failure or interruption of the transportation facilities would result in danger
to the public health or safety of where such facilities are essential to the
orderly functioning of the area. Minor or auxiliary roads or railroads may be
constructed at a lower elevation where failure or interruption of
transportation services would not endanger the public health or safety.
   Subd. 3   On-Site Sewage Treatment and Water Supply Systems. Where public
utilities are not provided:
      A.   On-site water supply systems shall be designated to minimize or
eliminate infiltration of flood waters in the systems; and
      B.   New or replacement on-site sewage treatment systems shall be
designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems
and discharges from the systems into flood waters and they shall not be subject
to impairment of contamination during times of flooding. Any sewage treatment
system designed in accordance with the State's current statewide standards for
on-site sewage treatment systems shall be determined to be in compliance with
this Section.
1335.21   Manufactured Homes.
   The placement of new or replacement manufactured homes in existing
manufactured home parks or on individual lots of record that are located in
flood plain districts will be treated as a new structure and may be placed only
if elevated in compliance with Section 5.0 of this Ordinance. If vehicular road
access for pre-existing manufactured home parks is not provided in accordance
with Section 5.51, then replacement manufactured homes will not be allowed
until the property owner(s) develops a flood warning emergency plan acceptable
to the Governing Body.
   Subd. 1   New manufactured home parks and expansions to existing
manufactured home parks shall be subject to the provisions placed on
subdivisions by this code.
   Subd. 2   All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system that resists flotation, collapse and lateral
movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use

      A.   In responding to a suspected Code violation, the City Administrator
and City Council may utilize the full array of enforcement actions available to
it, including but not limited to, prosecution and fines, injunctions, after-
the-fact permits, orders for corrective measures or a request to the National
Flood Insurance Program for denial of flood insurance availability to the
guilty party. The City shall act in good faith to enforce these official
controls and to correct Code violations to the extent possible so as not to
jeopardize its eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program.
      B.   When a Code violation is either discovered by or brought to the

investigate the violation of the official control. As soon as is reasonably
possible, this information shall be submitted to the appropriate Department of
Natural Resources' and Federal Emergency Management Agency Regional Office
along with the City's plan of action to correct the violation to the degree
possible.
      C.   The City Administrator shall notify the suspected party of the
requirements of this Section and all other Official Controls and the nature and
extent of the suspected violation of these controls. If the structure and/or
use is under construction or development, the City Administrator may order the
construction or development immediately halted until a proper permit or
approval is granted by the City. If the construction or development is already
completed, then the City Administrator may either:
         1.   Issue an order identifying the corrective actions that shall be
made within a specified time period to bring the use of structure into
compliance with the official controls, or
         2.   Notify the responsible party to apply for an after-the-fact
permit/development approval within a specified period of time not to exceed
thirty (30) days.
      D.   If the responsible party does not appropriately respond to the City
Administrator within the specified period of time, each additional day that
lapses shall constitute an additional violation of this Section and shall be
prosecuted accordingly. The City Administrator shall also upon the lapse of the
specified response period notify the land owner to restore the land to the
condition which existed prior to the violation of this Section.
1335.37   Amendments.

Section 1340 - Adult Uses
1340.01   Findings and Recitals.
   Subd. 1   On March 9, 1998, the City Council enacted an interim ordinance
(Ordinance #305) creating a moratorium on the establishment of adult uses
within the City and directing the City Staff to conduct a study to determine
how best to regulate such uses. The scope of the study was to include, but not
be limited to, the following:
   A.    The particular zoning districts in which adult establishments should
be allowed as either permitted or conditional uses;
   B.    The density and concentration of adult uses; and,
   C.    The effect of adult uses on other uses in the surrounding area.
   Subd. 2   Upon completion of the study, the matter was to be considered by
the Planning Commission for its review and recommendation to the City Council.
   The study has been completed and the Planning Commission has reviewed the
study and has passed its recommendation to the City Council for review. The
City Council has also reviewed the staff's study and duly considered the
recommendation of the Planning Commission.
   The staff's study contained copies of certain reports specifically including
a report which was prepared by the State Attorney General entitled "Report of
the Attorney General's Working Group on Regulation of Sexually Oriented
Businesses", dated June 6, 1989 (the "Report"). The Report considered evidence
from studies conducted in Minneapolis, St. Paul, and many other cities
throughout the country relating to sexually oriented businesses. The City
Staff, Planning Commission, and City Council have reviewed the Report.
   The Report, based upon the above referenced studies and the testimony and
evidence it concluded, among other things,". . . that sexually oriented
businesses are associated with high crime rates and depression of property
values. . . ." Prior to the issuance of the Report, the State Attorney
General's Working Group also heard testimony that " . . . the character of a
neighborhood can dramatically change when there is a concentration of sexually
oriented businesses adjacent to residential property." The Report found and
concluded that:
      A.   Adult uses have an impact on the neighborhoods surrounding them,
which is distinct from the impact caused by other commercial uses;
      B.   Residential neighborhoods located within close proximity to adult
theaters, bookstores and other adult uses experience increase crime rates (sex-
related crimes in particular), lowered property values, increased transiency,
and decreased stability of ownership;
      C.   The adverse impacts which adult uses have on surrounding areas
diminish as the distance from the adult uses increases;
      D.   Studies of other cities have shown that among the crimes which tend
to increase either within or in the near vicinity of adult uses are rapes,
prostitution, child molestation, indecent exposure and other lewd and
lascivious behavior;
      E.   The City of Phoenix, Arizona study confirmed that the sex crime rate
was on the average five hundred (500) percent higher in areas with sexually
oriented businesses;
      F.   Many members of the public perceive areas within which adult uses
are located as less than other areas which do not have such uses;
      G.   Studies of other cities have shown that the values of both
commercial and residential properties either are diminished or fail to
appreciate at the rate of other comparable properties when located in proximity
to adult uses; and
      H.   The Indianapolis, Indiana study established that professional real
estate appraisers believe that an adult bookstore would have a negative effect
on the value of both residential and commercial properties within a one to
three block area of the store.
   Subd. 3   The Arden Hills City Council finds the characteristics of Arden
Hills are substantially similar to those of the cities cited by the Report when
considering the affects of adult uses.
   The Arden Hills City Council finds, based upon the Report and the studies
cited therein, that adult uses may have adverse secondary effects upon certain
pre-existing land uses within the City, and that the public health, safety, and
general welfare will be promoted if the City adopts regulations regarding adult
uses.
   The Arden Hills City Council finds that the adverse secondary effects tend
to diminish if adult uses in the City are regulated by locational and licensing
requirements.
   Subd. 4   It is not the intent of the City to prohibit adult uses from
having a reasonable opportunity to locate within the City.
   The City's current zoning ordinance does not address such adult uses, which
have been found by other municipalities to cause similar adverse secondary
effects. Specifically, the City Council is concerned that the City's zoning
ordinance may be inadequate in its scope and in its restrictions to accomplish
the purpose for which it was intended.
   Subd. 5   In addition to the proper zoning classification of such uses,
there are a number of significant planning and land use issues pertaining to
the regulation of such uses, including the following:
      A.   The particular zoning districts in which such uses should be allowed
as either permitted or conditional uses.
      B.   The concentration and density of such uses in the City and its
neighborhoods.
      C.   The effect of such uses on other uses in the surrounding area.

Section 1345 - Conditional Uses
1345.01   Purpose and Intent.
   It is recognized that certain uses, although generally compatible with the
basic use classification of a particular zoning district, should not be
permitted generally and as a matter of right to be located in every area
included within the zoning district because of hazards inherent in the use
itself or special problems which its proposed location may present. Such a use
of a particular site may, nevertheless, be conditionally permitted by means of
a conditional use permit, granted by the Council, after the procedures set
forth in this Code and the City's Policy Manual on Land Use Procedures have
been complied with, and the Council, on the basis of the guidelines and
criteria set forth in Chapter
1355.04 Subd 3, has determined that the facts and circumstances of the
particular case warrant granting the permit. The permit shall be granted solely
for the proposed use of a particular site, not for a particular person or firm.
Uses for which Conditional Use Permits may be issued are classified either as
Conditional Accessory Uses or Conditional Principal Uses and are found in
Section 1320 along with the zoning districts in which they may be located.
1345.02   General Criteria.
   In determining whether to grant a conditional use permit for the proposed
principal or accessory use of a particular site, the planning commission and
council shall follow the procedure as set forth in Appendix A, Procedure
Manual, and in
Section 1355 of this ordinance.
1345.03   Changes in Conditionally Permitted Use.
   After the conditional use permit has been granted, the use conditionally
permitted thereunder shall be established, conducted and maintained in
conformity with the terms thereof, including all conditions set forth therein.
Any structural alteration, enlargement or intensification thereof, or similar
change not specifically permitted by the permit, shall require an amended
permit and all procedures shall apply as if a new permit were being requested;
provided, however, that when such changes are deemed to be insignificant by the
zoning administrator, the requirements of a public hearing may be waived.
1345.04   Comprehensive Plan and Zoning Map Consistency.
   In the granting of conditional use permits for medium- and high-density
residential uses and business or industrial uses the council shall first find
that the proposed development is in compliance with the adopted comprehensive
development plan and the Zoning Map for Arden Hills, both in terms of the
various policy statements and the site location set forth therein. If such
proposal is not in compliance with the comprehensive development plan and
zoning map, a comprehensive plan amendment and zoning map amendment application
must accompany the application for a conditional use permit.
Section 1350 - Nonconforming Uses, Buildings, and Lots
1350.01   Intent.
   Subd. 1   Nonconforming Use of Land or Buildings. A nonconforming use of
land or buildings may be continued subject to the provisions of this Section,
but it is the intent of this Code not to encourage its survival because of its
incompatibility with permitted uses in the zoning district in which it is
located.
   Subd. 2   Nonconforming Buildings. A building found to be non-conforming
because of height, setbacks or lot area, may continue to exist so long as it is
used for purposes permitted in the zoning district in which it is located and
is in conformance with Section
1350.02.
1350.02   Continuation of Nonconforming Uses and Buildings.
   Any nonconformity, including the lawful use or occupation of land or
premises shall not be expanded but may be continued, including through repair,
replacement, restoration, maintenance, or improvement, unless:
   Subd. 1   The nonconforming use or occupancy is discontinued or ceases to
exist for any reason for a one-year period. The building or structure
constituting or containing the nonconforming use, or the land upon which the
nonconforming use is being conducted, shall thereafter be used in conformance
with the regulations of this Code applicable to the zoning district in which it
is located.
   Subd. 2   The nonconforming use or occupancy is destroyed by fire or other
peril to the extent of greater than fifty (50) percent of its market value on
the date immediately prior to the date on which such damage or destruction
occurred as determined by the Building Official, and no building permit has
been applied for within one hundred and eighty (180) days of when the property
is damaged. In this case, the City may impose reasonable conditions upon a
building permit in order to mitigate any newly created impact on adjacent
property.
1350.03   Prohibited Activities: Nonconforming Use.
   Nonconforming uses shall not be changed to a different nonconforming use,
enlarged, intensified, increased, extended to occupy a greater area of the lot
on which it is located, or moved to any other part of the lot or building on
which it is located.
1350.04   Prohibited Activities: Nonconforming Building.
   Nonconforming buildings shall not be increased, enlarged, altered,
intensified, or extended to occupy a greater area or height on the lot on which
the building is located, or moved to any other part of the lot on which the
building is located in a way that augments its nonconformity.
1350.05   Unsafe Building or Structure.
   Nothing in this Code shall be deemed to prevent the restoration to a safe
condition of any building or structure, or portion thereof, constituting or
containing a nonconforming use, which has been declared unsafe by the building
inspector or other administrative officer.
1350.06   Construction Approved and Begun Prior To Effective Date.
   To avoid hardship, nothing in this Code shall be deemed to require a change
in the plans, construction or designated use of any building for which a
building permit has been issued and the construction of which has begun prior
to the effective date of this Code or any amendment hereto.

(125%) percent of the estimated cost, as determined by the City Engineer, of
improvements to be constructed in accordance with the permit to insure
completion thereof within the time limit specified in the permit. The
conditions so imposed by the City Council shall be specifically stated in the
permit and maybe subject to periodic review as determined by the City Council.
The violation of any special or general condition set forth in a conditional
use permit shall constitute a violation of this Code.
      D.   Permit for Particular Site. A conditional use permit is granted for
a specific use at a specific site, not for a person or firm.
      E.   Designated Uses. Uses for which conditional use permits are required
and the zoning districts in which they are allowed are designated in the land
use chart as set forth in
Section 1320 hereof. No building permit shall be issued for any use in a zoning
district which requires the issuance of a conditional use permit before it can
be located in the particular district, until after the conditional use permit
has been granted by the City Council.
      F.   Discontinuance of a Conditional Use. If the use for which any
conditional use permit has been granted has ceased or has been discontinued for
a period of ninety (90) consecutive days, the permit shall automatically expire

   Subd. 4   Variances.
   A.    Public Hearing. A public hearing is not required but neighboring
property owners shall be notified.
   B.    Action to Approve. Three affirmative votes of the City Council are

purpose and intent provisions of City's Zoning Regulations and with the
policies of the City's Comprehensive Plan.
         2.   Practical Difficulties. The applicant for a variance shall
establish that there are practical difficulties in complying with the
provisions of the Arden Hills Zoning Regulations. The term "Practical
Difficulties" as used in the granting of a variance means:
            a)   Reasonable Use. The property owner proposes to use the
property in a reasonable manner not permitted by the Zoning Ordinance.
            b)   Unique Circumstances. The plight of property owner is due to
circumstances unique to the property not created by the landowner.
            c)   Character of Neighborhood. The variance, if granted, will not
alter the essential character of the neighborhood.
         3.   Economic Consideration. Economic consideration alone does not
constitute a practical difficulty.
         4.   Access to Sunlight. Inadequate access to direct sunlight for
solar energy systems shall be considered a practical difficulty.
         5.   Earth Sheltered Housing. Earth sheltered construction, as defined
in Minnesota Statutes §216(C).06, Subd. 14, shall be considered a practical
difficulty if the property is otherwise in compliance with the Arden Hills
Zoning Regulations.
         6.   Non Permitted Use. A variance shall not be granted if it would
allow a use, which is not otherwise permitted in the zoning district where the
property is located.
         7.   Temporary Double Family. A variance may be granted to allow
temporary use of a one family dwelling as a two family dwelling.
   D.    Conditions to Insure Compliance. The City Council may impose
conditions in granting a variance. A condition must be directly related to and
must bear a rough proportionality to the impact created by the variance.

significant site modification for a permitted or established use within a
Multiple Dwelling Zoning District or any business or industrial zoning district
shall require site plan approval by the City Council according to the procedure
defined in Chapter
1355.04.
   Subd. 6   Planned Unit Development (PUD).
   A.    . The PUD application and review procedure involves a Concept Plan
(optional), a Master Plan Stage, and a Final Plan Stage.
   B.    Public Hearing. A public hearing is required at the Master Plan Stage.
The public hearing may be combined with the public hearing for a zoning
district change if a zoning district change is required and for a preliminary
plat if a preliminary plat of the PUD property is proposed.
   C.    Action to Approve. Four affirmative votes of the City Council are
required for approval of the Master Plan.
   D.    Effect of Concept Plan Review. The applicant for a PUD Concept Plan,
which has been reviewed by the City Council, has no limitation on the period of
time in which to apply for Master Plan approval.
   E.    Effect of PUD Master Plan Approval. The applicant for a PUD Master
Plan which has been approved by the City Council shall apply for a PUD Final

Procedure Manual, and the Site Plan Review procedure in Chapter
1355.04 Subd 5 shall be followed.
   Subd. 7   Interim Use Permits.
   A.    Purpose and Intent. The purpose and intent of allowing interim uses
is:
         1.    To allow a use that is presently acceptable, but that with
anticipated development or redevelopment, will not be acceptable in the future
or will be replaced by a permitted or conditional use allowed within the
respective zoning district.
         2.    To allow a use which is reflective of anticipated long range
change to an area and which is in compliance with the Comprehensive Plan
provided that said use maintains harmony and compatibility with surrounding
uses and is in keeping with the architectural character and design standards of
existing uses and development.
   B.    Public Hearing. A public hearing is required.
   C.    Action to Approve. Three affirmative votes of the City Council are
required to approve an interim use permit, and the City Council must include a
determination that the facts and circumstances of the particular case warrant
granting the permit.
   D.    Permit Evaluation. When reviewing the interim use permit application,
the City Council shall consider the factual findings, ability to meet the
special requirements of the interim use, and the conclusions and
recommendations of the Planning Commission. An interim use permit may be
granted only if the City Council finds the following:
         1.    The use is allowed as an interim use in the underlying zoning
district and conforms to the zoning regulations;
         2.    Permission of the interim use will not impose additional costs
on the public if it is necessary for the public to take the property in the
future;
         3.    The use will not adversely impact nearby properties through
nuisance, noise, dust, glare, or unsightliness, and will not otherwise
adversely impact the health, safety, and welfare of the community;
         4.    The use will not adversely impact traffic and parking;
         5.    The use will not adversely impact implementation of future
amendment to the City's Comprehensive Plan;
         6.    The date or event that will terminate the use is identified with
certainty;
         7.    The applicant has signed a consent agreement agreeing that the
applicant, owner, operator, tenant, and/or user has no entitlement to an
extension of the Interim Use Permit;
         8.    The user agrees to all conditions that the City Council deems
appropriate for permission of the use including the requirement of appropriate
financial surety to cover the cost of removing the interim use and any interim
structures upon expiration of the interim use permit;
         9.    There are no delinquent property taxes, special assessments,
interest, or City utility fees due upon the subject parcel;
         10.    The term of the interim use does not exceed three (3) years;
         11.    The property has not been a recipient of a previous interim use
permit. A property that has received an interim use permit for an interim use
listed in
1320.05, Land Use Chart, shall not be eligible for another interim use permit
of the same use; and,
         12.    Any special requirements in
Section 1320 for a particular interim use are met.
   E.    Imposition of Conditions. In the granting of an interim use permit,
the City Council may impose such conditions, in addition to the general
conditions and requirements of this Code to which every interim use permit
shall be subject, as it deems necessary to serve and protect the health,
safety, convenience and general welfare of the community.
   F.    Permit for Particular Site. An interim use permit is granted for a
specific use at a specific site, not for a person or firm.
   G.    Designated Uses. Uses for which an interim use permits are required
and the zoning districts in which they are allowed are designated in the land
use chart as set forth in
Section 1320 hereof. No building permit shall be issued for an interim use
until after the interim use permit has been granted by the City Council.
   H.    Termination. An interim use shall terminate on the occurrence of any
of the following events, whichever occurs first:
         1.    The date stated on the permit;
         2.    Upon violation of conditions under which the permit was issued;
         3.    Upon change in the City's zoning regulations which renders the
use nonconforming;
         4.    The redevelopment of the use and property upon which it is
located to a permitted or conditional use as allowed within the underlying
zoning district; and
         5.     If the use for which the interim use permit has been granted
has ceased or has been discontinued for a period of ninety (90) consecutive
days, the permit shall automatically expire and become void at the end of such
ninety-day period.
   I.    Suspension and Revocation. The City Council may suspend or revoke an
interim use permit upon finding that the activities allowed under the permit
adversely affect the public health, safety, or welfare in ways not anticipated
during approval of the permit. A suspension or revocation of an interim use
permit shall be preceded by written notice to the permittee and a hearing. The
notice shall provide at least ten (10) days notice of the time and place of the
hearing and shall state the nature of the violation(s). The notice shall be
mailed to the permittee at the most recent address listed on the application.

action beyond one hundred twenty (120) days. Nothing in this paragraph shall
prohibit the City Council from holding additional hearings as it deems
necessary within the review period. In considering applications for
Comprehensive Plan amendments, Zoning Code amendments, rezoning, conditional
and interim use permits, planned unit developments, site plan reviews and
variances, the City Council shall consider the advice and recommendations of
the Planning Commission and may grant the request if it determines that the

be denied by motion of the City Council, and such motion shall constitute a
finding and determination that the conditions required for approval do not
exist.
   Subd. 3   Optional Actions. City Council action may include approval in
whole or in part, denial in whole or in part, tabling for a specified period of
time, or referral back to the Planning Commission for its further consideration

zoning administrator, the requirements of a public hearing may be waived.
   Subd. 5   Periodic Review. A periodic review of the permit and its
conditions shall be maintained. A violation of any condition set forth in the
permit shall be a violation of this Code, and shall be cause for revocation of
the permit. In the event that the Zoning Administrator recommends to City

Section 1380 - TCAAP Redevelopment Code
(Ord. 2016-11, passed 12-12-2016; Ord. 2016-012, passed 12-12-2016; Ord. 2023-
14, passed 2-12-2024; Ord. 2024-001, passed 1-8-2024; Ord. 2024-002, passed 4-

Section 1: Introduction
Introduction
In 2013, the City of Arden Hills hired the consultant team to create a Master
Plan for the Twin Cities Army Ammunition Plant (TCAAP) site, to conduct an
Alternative Urban Area Wide Review (AUAR), and to draft local regulations and
policies to implement the Master Plan. The Master Plan will amend the City of
Arden Hills 2030 Comprehensive Plan in an effort to successfully integrate the
TCAAP site into the rest of the City. This plan will also help ensure that
appropriate development and economic growth occurs and is in line with the
vision set forth by the City of Arden Hills and the owner of the property,
Ramsey County.
It is the goal of this project to “Develop TCAAP in a way that accommodates a
mix of land uses that is sensitive to the natural environment, economically
sustainable, and a benefit to the community” (Arden Hills 2030 Comprehensive
Plan, 4). This initiative will be economically and environmentally sustainable
and provide for a range of uses and development types.
A comprehensive community process resulted in a long-term vision for the
redevelopment of this brownfield ammunitions plant site into a true mixed-use
development area that incorporates regional employment, shopping and dining and
a variety of housing options. This document provides the regulatory tools for
redevelopment consistent with the TCAAP Master Plan for this area.
1.1   Purpose and Intent
The purpose of the TCAAP Redevelopment Code (TRC) is to implement the vision
for a walkable, mixed-use, resilient, and vibrant TCAAP development
(hereinafter, “Plan Area”) by:
   (a)   Creating regulations that realize market potential and promote the
creation of jobs and economic development;
   (b)   Developing a regulatory process that encourages quality growth and
saves time in the development process;
   (c)   Focusing on predictability for both developers and the community; and
   (d)   Providing a Natural Resources Corridor that offers active and passive
recreational features and is an amenity to the site.
Therefore, the goals of the TRC are to promote and to provide a more functional
and attractive community through the use of recognized community design
principles and to allow property owners, applicants or developers flexibility
in land use, while prescribing a higher level of detail in building design and
form than in the current standards of the Arden Hills City Code (AHC). The
standards in this code are not intended to stifle creativity nor over-regulate
building design but rather encourage better functional building patterns and to
create higher quality pedestrian environments along most streets.
1.2   Relationship to Adopted Plans
   (a)   Arden Hills Comprehensive Plan: In addition to implementing several
goals of the Arden Hills Comprehensive Plan, the TRC specifically implements
the following goals:
   1.   Develop and maintain a land use pattern that strengthens the vitality,
quality, and character of the residential neighborhoods, commercial districts
and industrial areas, while protecting the community’s natural resources to
develop a sustainable pattern for future development.
   2.   Develop TCAAP in a way that accommodates a mix of land uses that is
sensitive to the natural environment, economically sustainable and a benefit to
the community.
   3.   Promote the development, redevelopment and maintenance of a viable,
innovative and diverse business environment that serves Arden Hills and the
metropolitan area.
   4.   Develop and maintain a strong, vital, diverse and stable housing supply
for all members of the community.
   5.   Enhance the health, safety and well-being of all who live, work and
play in the City.
   6.   Create a comprehensive, maintained and interconnected system of parks,
pathways and open spaces, as well as a balanced program of recreational
activities for residents of all ages, incomes and abilities.
   7.   Preserve, protect and restore the community’s natural resources,
including open spaces, lakes, wetlands other significant natural features, and
historic resources.
2.0   Components of the Code
2.1   The Regulating Plan
The TCAAP Redevelopment Regulating Plan map (herein known as the Regulating
Plan) (Attachment 1) is hereby adopted as the official zoning map for the Plan
Area. Within any area subject to the approved Regulating Plan, this TRC becomes
the exclusive and mandatory regulation unless specified in Section 3.2. It
shall establish the following development standards for all properties within
the Plan Area:
   (a)   Establishment of TCAAP Zoning Districts – The Plan Area is
distinguished into different specialized zoning districts. Each zoning district
is intended to create a distinct development pattern based on the TCAAP Master
Plan for different sections within the Plan Area. Each zoning district shall
establish use and building development standards including standards for
building height, bulk, location, functional design and parking. The Regulating
Plan classifies all lots within the Plan Area into one of the following seven
(7) zoning districts:
   1)   Campus Commercial (CC) – The Campus Commercial Zoning District
facilitates a building format that allows multiple, single tenant buildings or
campuses within the northern “Thumb” site of the Plan Area. The goal is to
allow for an individual plan approach for each campus or building, based on
user preferences within a range of requirements.
   2)   Town Center (TC) – The Town Center Zoning District creates a vibrant
commercial and residential environment that maximizes the potential for an
outdoor experience. This district promotes walkability through allowing for
housing, office, retail, restaurant, and civic uses all within close proximity
of each other.
   3)   Office Mixed-Use (OMU) – The Office Mixed-Use Zoning District creates a
flexible zone that allows and promotes a seamless transition from Retail Mixed-
Use but focuses on employment and other compatible uses. This district promotes
employment as a primary use, but allows for other commercial, and up to ten
percent retail uses.
   4)   Retail Mixed-Use (RMU) – The Retail Mixed-Use Zoning District creates a
flexible zone that allows and promotes a seamless transition from Office Mixed-
Use but focuses on retail and compatible uses. This district promotes retail as
a primary use, but allows for other commercial uses.
   5)   Flex Office (FO) – The Flex Office Zoning District creates an
opportunity for large scale development for employment and manufacturing uses
that take advantage of the highway frontage and automobile access.
   6)   Civic District (C) – The Civic District is intended to allow civic and
community uses.
   7)   Neighborhood (NR) – The Neighborhood Zoning District provides for a
range of attached and detached single-family residential uses including multi-
family residential uses.
   (b)   Street Designations – The Streets within TRC shall be classified in
two different ways.
   1)   Street Cross Sections shall address vehicular lane widths, number of
lanes, pedestrian accommodation, street tree requirements, on-street parking,
snow storage and parkway and median standards. These standards are laid out in
Section 8.0 and Attachment 4.
   2)   Street Priority shall establish the phasing significance (Required or
Recommended) of different street segments within the Plan Area. Refer to
Section 8.0: Street Design Standards and Attachment 5 for the detailed
regulations.
   (c)   Building Frontage Standards – Building Frontage designations shall
classify different block frontages based on the pedestrian priority goals of
the TCAAP Master Plan on the Regulating Plan (Attachment 1). They shall be
classified into one of three frontage designations: (i) Pedestrian Priority
Frontage with the highest quality standards for pedestrian-oriented building
design; (ii) Pedestrian-Friendly Frontage that balances pedestrian-oriented
building design standards while accommodating some service and parking
functions; and (iii) General Frontage which mainly accommodates service,
utilities and parking functions.
   (d)   Open Space Designation – Open Space within the TRC shall be
categorized as Required Open Space. The detailed Open Space Standards for
different open space types are included in Section 9.0 and Attachment 2 of this
Code. These standards include general character, typical size, frontage
requirements and typical uses.
   (e)   Gateway Overlay Designation – The Gateway Overlay District indicates
where additional aesthetic treatments are required to create a welcoming
environment that establishes the character of the TCAAP Redevelopment Area. The
specific standards are included in Section 7.6 of this Code.
2.2   Development Standards:
The TRC text portion of this Code enumerates the development standards with

2.3   Using This Code
The following basic steps should be followed to determine the uses and
development standards applicable on property within the Plan Area:
   (a)   Review Table 3-1 to evaluate the applicability of the TRC based on
scope of the proposed development.
   (b)   Locate the subject property on the Regulating Plan (Attachment 1).
   (c)   Identify the Zoning District in which the property is located.
   (d)    Review the Schedule of Uses by Zoning District as listed in Table 5-
1 to determine allowed uses.
   (e)   Examine the corresponding zone standards in the Building and Site
Development Standards in Section 6 to determine the applicable development
standards and any Frontage standards.
   (f)   Refer to Section 7.0 for Building Design Standards
The information listed in these graphics explain where the building will sit on
the lot, the limits on its physical form, the range of uses and the palette of
materials that will cover it.

3.3   JDA Development Review Process
   (a)   Pre-submittal Meeting Required: All projects shall have a pre-
submittal meeting with the JDA Development staff prior to submitting the
approved application form for development in the Plan Area. At the pre-
submittal meeting, the staff shall provide information on the requirements for
development and submittal within the Plan Area, including related necessary
City building permit and related final construction approvals.
   (b)   Site Plan Required: A Site Plan shall be required for all proposed
developments within the Plan Area. Requirements for Site Plans are listed per
Section 1355.03 of the AHC. A site plan is reviewed by staff prior to
preliminary plat submittal.
   (c)   JDA Review Generally: Projects that comply with all standards of the
TRC and projects that require Permitted Adjustments shall be processed by the
Joint Development Authority (JDA). The JDA shall review and consider projects
which meet all TRC standards as recommended by staff, with approval of such
projects subject to a majority vote of all the members of the JDA. Please refer
to Attachment 3 Development Review flow chart for information on the
development review process. The JDA may amend its development review process at
any time, subject to any applicable requirements of the Joint Powers Agreement
(the “JPA”).
   (d)   JDA Permitted Adjustments: The JDA may approve Permitted Adjustments
per the criteria set in Table 3-3 below, subject to a three-fifths (3/5) vote
of the JDA. The Permitted Adjustment process may be used only to authorize a
less restrictive standard and may not be used to impose a higher standard than
is established under the TRC on the subject property. A JDA Development staff
report and recommendation is required for the JDA to make a determination on a
Permitted Adjustment. Public notices shall be issued for all Permitted
Adjustment hearings; however, such hearings may be combined with any other JDA
hearing process, such as for consideration of approval of a project and its
related transactional documents.
   (e)   In reviewing any Permitted Adjustment request, the JDA shall use the
following criteria:
      i.   The goals, intent and vision of the adopted Regulating Plan Map and
TCAAP Master Plan;
      ii.   The extent to which the proposal fits the adjoining design context
by providing appropriate building scale and use transitions;
      iii.   The extent to which the proposal provides public benefits such as
usable civic and open spaces, livable streets, affordable housing, living wage
jobs, structured and/or shared parking and linkages to transit;
      iv.   The extent to which the proposal does not hinder future
opportunities for higher intensity development;
      v.   The extent to which the proposal provides a demonstration of
advanced energy resilience which may have an educational value; and
      vi.   Considerations of health and welfare to the general public.
   (f)   In reviewing any Permitted Adjustment, the JDA shall not grant
flexibility for the following:
      i.   Deviation from requirements of Section 5.0 (Schedule of Uses);
      ii.   Building height;
      iii.   Definitions included in Section 4.0;
      iv.   Density parameters for residential land uses;
      v.   Clear height;
      vi.   Minimum Multi-Family Unit Sizes

structure that consists of three to eight (3-8) houses attached horizontally,
not stacked vertically. This type of residential building is typically located
in a location that transitions from a single-family neighborhood into a
commercial corridor. This type of building enables appropriately-scaled, well-
designed residential infill and is important for providing a broad choice of
housing types and promoting walkability. A townhouse/rowhouse is a single
structure and does not require adjacent townhomes/rowhomes to maintain
stability.
Triplex/Quadplex
A Triplex/Quadplex building is a medium-sized attached structure that consists
of three to four (3-4) houses placed side-by-side and/or stacked dwelling
units. This residential building type is typically located in a location that
transitions from a primarily single-family neighborhood into a commercial
corridor. This building type enables appropriately-scaled, well-designed
residential infill and is important for providing a broad choice of housing
types and promoting walkability.

Twin Home
The Twin Home, also known as a duplex, is a small- to medium-sized structure
that consists of two side-by-side or stacked dwelling units, both facing the
street, and within a single building structure. This residential building type
has the appearance of a medium to large single-family home and is
appropriately-scaled to fit within primarily single-family neighborhoods or
medium-density neighborhoods. It enables appropriately-scaled, well-designed
residential infill and is important for providing a broad choice of housing
types and promoting walkability.

6.0    Building and Site Development Standards
All parcels within the TRC are assigned to one of seven (7) Zoning Districts:
1.   Campus Commercial
2.   Town Center
3.   Office Mixed-Use
4.   Retail Mixed-Use
5.   Flex Office
6.   Civic
7.   Neighborhood
In addition to standards that apply to all Zoning Districts, Building and Site
Development standards applicable to each Zoning District are described in
Sections 6.2 – 6.8.
The images and graphics in the first subsection of each zoning district
standards are provided as illustrative of intent and are advisory only without
the power of law. Refer to the standards on the following pages for the
specific Building and Site Development Standards.
In addition, the graphics used to illustrate the building and development
standards in each Zoning District are NOT intended to indicate exact conditions
within each Zoning District. Rather, illustrations are conceptual and standards
are to be applied based on the specific frontage types designated along the
subject property or site. For example, a specific site may not have frontages
along all streets as indicated in the illustrations and only the standards
applicable to designated building frontages on the property should be used. In
addition, the illustrations may depict other site elements to establish context
and only the standards regulated by the specific subsection shall apply. For
example, the Building Placement graphics may depict sidewalks for context
purposes only and the graphic should only be used to establish standards for
building placement on the site. Building form graphics in these sections are
NOT TO SCALE.
6.1    General to All Zoning Districts
   (a)   Building Frontage Designations: The Building Frontage designations are
established on the Regulating Plan (Attachment 1) to specify certain building
and site development standards along each street based on the priority placed
on pedestrian-orientation. The Regulating Plan illustrates the Building
Frontage designations within the TRC. For the purposes of this code, all
Building Frontages are classified into one of the following three categories:
      i.   Pedestrian Priority Frontages – Pedestrian Priority Frontages are
intended to provide the most pedestrian-friendly and contiguous development
context. Buildings and sites along Pedestrian Priority Frontages shall be held
to the highest standard of pedestrian-oriented design and few, if any, gaps
shall be permitted in the ‘Street Wall’. Breaks in the street wall may be
permitted for courtyards, forecourts, sidewalk cafes and pedestrian connections
between the individual sites and the public sidewalk. These street frontages
are the main retail, restaurant, entertainment streets, or are important
neighborhood connectors, as identified in the Regulating Plan.
         1.   Specific to Pedestrian Priority Frontages: The area between the
building facade and property line or edge of any existing sidewalk along any
street with Pedestrian Priority Frontage shall be designed such that the
sidewalk width shall be a minimum as determined by the street type (see
Attachment 4) and the remainder of any setback area shall be paved flush with
the public sidewalk. Sidewalk cafes, public art, landscaping within tree-wells
or planters may be incorporated within this area.

IMAGES/0-0-0-1377.png]                    only
 
      ii.   Pedestrian-Friendly Frontages – Pedestrian-Friendly Frontages are
also intended to be pedestrian-oriented with a mostly contiguous development
context. However, in some locations, where access to a General Frontage street
or Alley is not available, Pedestrian-Friendly Frontages may need to
accommodate driveways, parking, service/utility functions, and loading and
unloading. In such cases, Pedestrian-Friendly Frontages may balance pedestrian
orientation with automobile accommodation. Typically, they shall establish a
hybrid development context that has a more pedestrian-supportive development
context at street intersections and accommodates auto-related functions and
surface parking in the middle of the block. Surface parking shall be screened
from the roadway following the Street Screen Standards in Section 10.4.
Pedestrian-Friendly Frontages are designated on the Regulating Plan.
      iii.   General Frontages – General Frontages are intended to accommodate
more auto-oriented uses, surface parking and service functions on a site with a
more suburban/automobile orientation. The General Frontages shall be building
frontages not designated as either a Pedestrian Priority or Pedestrian-Friendly
Frontage on the Regulating Plan. Surface parking shall be screened following
the Street Screen Standards in Section 10.4.

   (b)   Treatment of Street Intersections:
      i.   Corner building street facades along intersections of Pedestrian
Priority Frontages and Pedestrian-Friendly Frontages shall be built to the BTZ
for a minimum of twenty feet (20’) from the intersection along each street or
the width of the corner lot, whichever is less regardless of the building
frontage percentage required along that street. This requirement shall not
prohibit incorporation of curved, chamfered building corners or recessed
entries or civic/open spaces at such intersections. In addition, this standard
shall apply regardless of the frontage requirement along the intersecting
street even if it is a General Street.

Illustration showing minimum frontage requirements at street intersections
      ii.   Corner Building Height Allowance: Corner buildings may exceed the
maximum building height by 25% along no more than 20% of the building’s
frontage along each corresponding street façade. The purpose of the allowance
is to encourage inclusion of architectural features and no mechanical equipment
shall be located on top of a roof area that takes advantage of this allowance.
Corner Building Height Allowances are not permitted in the Neighborhood Zone.

   (c)   Parking and Service Access:
      i.   Location of parking (both structured and surface) shall be per the

The required fence shall NOT be chain link or vinyl. A 6-foot
wide landscape buffer with evergreen shrubs planted at 3’ on
center and 6’ min. in height at maturity shall also be required
to be planted within the landscape buffer parallel to the SF-
residential lot line. (see surface parking setbacks illustration)
 
7.0   Building Design Standards
7.1   Purpose and Intent
The Building Design Standards for the TRC shall establish a coherent character
and encourage enduring and attractive development. Site and/or building plans
shall be reviewed by the JDA for compliance with the standards below (see Table
7-1 for more detail).
The key design principles establish essential goals for the redevelopment
within the Plan Area to be consistent with the vision for a vibrant mixed-use
development with a range of commercial, employment and residential uses serving
the neighborhoods and the region. Buildings shall be located and designed so
that they provide visual interest and create enjoyable, human-scaled spaces.
The key design principles include:
   (a)   New and redeveloped buildings and sites shall utilize building and
site elements and details to achieve a pedestrian-oriented public realm with
glazing, shading and shelter;
   (b)   Design compatibility is not meant to be achieved through uniformity,
but through the use of variations in building elements to achieve individual
building identity;
   (c)   Building facades shall include appropriate architectural details and
ornament to create variety and interest;
   (d)   Open space(s) shall be incorporated to provide usable public areas
integral to the environment; and
   (e)   Increase the quality, adaptability, energy efficiency, sustainability,
and resilience in Arden Hills’ building stock.

IMAGES/0-0-0-1533.png]
 
7.2   Building Orientation and Entrances
   (a)   Buildings shall be oriented towards Pedestrian Priority Frontages,
where the lot has frontage along Pedestrian Priority Frontages. If a building
has no frontage along a Pedestrian Priority Frontage, then it shall front a
Pedestrian-Friendly Frontage. All other buildings may be oriented towards
General Streets or Civic/Open Spaces.
   (b)   Primary entrances to buildings shall be located on the street along
which the building is oriented (See Figure 7-1). At intersections, corner
buildings may have their primary entrances oriented at an angle to the
intersection. Building entrances shall be provided for all separate ground
floor commercial use tenant spaces that are located along a Pedestrian Priority
or Pedestrian-Friendly frontage.
   (c)   All primary entrances shall be oriented to the public sidewalk for
ease of pedestrian access and entrances may be placed on the corner of the
building in order to serve both the sidewalk and the parking lot. Secondary and
service entrances may be oriented to parking areas or alleys.
   (d)   Primary Entrance Design: Primary building entrances along Pedestrian
Priority Frontages and Pedestrian-Friendly Frontages shall consist of at least
two (2) of following design elements so that the main entrance is
architecturally prominent and clearly visible from that street (see Figures 7-
2):
      i.   Architectural details such as arches, friezes, awnings, canopies,
arcades, tile work, murals, or moldings; or
      ii.   Integral planters or wing walls that incorporate landscape or
seating elements; or
      iii.   Prominent three-dimensional, vertical features such as belfries,
chimneys, clock towers, domes, spires, steeples, towers, or turrets.

7.3   Façade Composition
   (a)   Commercial Use, Mixed-Use and Large and Medium Multi-Family Buildings:
      (i)   Facades greater than sixty feet (60’) in length along all
Pedestrian Priority Frontage, Pedestrian-Friendly Frontages and Civic/Open
Spaces shall meet the following façade articulation standards:
         1.   Include facade modulation such that a portion of the facade steps back or
extends forward with a depth of at least twenty-four inches (24”)(see Figure 7-
3).
         2.   The distance from the inside
edge of a building projection to the nearest inside
edge of an adjacent projection shall not be less than twenty feet (20’)
and not greater than sixty feet (60’) (see Figure 7-3).
      (ii)   All other facades shall be articulated by at least one discernable
architectural element every twenty feet (20’). Such architectural elements
include, but are not limited to:
         1.   Changes in material, color, and/or texture either horizontally or
vertically at intervals not less than twenty feet (20’) and not more than sixty
feet (60’) (see Figure 7-3); or

8.0   Street Design Standards
8.1   Purpose and Intent:
The Master Plan Vision for the TRC recognizes the importance of providing
adequate public infrastructure, which includes an ultimate Street Network that
maximizes connectivity, and other needed infrastructure to serve the vision for
redevelopment within the Plan Area.
Street design and connectivity is envisioned to support and balance automobile,
bicycle, and walking trips in addition to becoming the “living” space for
development. The “living” nature of streets will not only serve private
redevelopment, but the community at large and the people who live in and use
it. This section establishes context sensitive standards for Street Design and
Connectivity.
8.2   Street Designation Categories:
In order to service multiple modes of transportation within an appropriate
redevelopment context, streets within the TRC are designated under two (2)
major categories:
   (a)   Street Classification: The Street Classification designation
establishes standards for the actual cross-section of the street itself. The
Street Classification includes information on automobile, bicycle, pedestrian,
and parking accommodation. It typically addresses the space allocation within
the public right-of-way and its emphasis towards different modes of
transportation. The TCAAP Street Type Plan (Attachment 5) identifies the Street
Classification designations within the Plan Area and Attachment 4 provides
cross sections for the different Street Classifications.
   (b)   Street Network: In addition to Street Classification designations,
streets in plan are identified as Required streets to implement the ultimate
street network in the Master Plan Vision. The TCAAP Street Type Plan
(Attachment 5) illustrates the Street Network within the TRC.
      1.   Required Streets – these are mainly existing, improved or new
streets that are needed to implement the ultimate street network envisioned in
the Vision for the TRC. They shall be mandatory at the time of redevelopment
including the requirement to dedicate right-of-way as identified in the
Regulating Plan. The alignment of new Required Streets may be modified per
Permitted Adjustments in Section 3.3 of this Code.
8.3   Project Circulation Plan:
A Project Circulation Plan must be submitted with a site plan or subdivision
application (whichever comes first) for an area of four (4) acres or larger
that is subject to the requirements of this section. The Project Circulation
Plan shall be developed and reviewed for its consistency with this section and
the Regulating Plan, which illustrates proposed locations for new and improved
streets within the Plan Area. Required streets on the Regulating Plan shall be
mandatory and their alignments may be adjusted per Section 3.3 Permitted
Adjustments.
   (a)   A Project Circulation Plan must demonstrate:
      1.   How the proposed circulation meets the intent of the Master Plan
Vision for redevelopment of TCAAP;
      2.   How the on-site circulation system integrates with existing and
planned streets, bicycle and pedestrian facilities, and trails in the
surrounding area;
      3.   How new street alignments conform with the Regulating Plan or how
modifications from the Regulating Plan, in terms of street placement,
alignment, and design are consistent with the intent of this Code;
      4.   How new street design conforms with the street cross section
standards in Attachment 4;
      5.   How the plan considers all modes of transportation including
walking, biking, and automobiles; and
      6.   How the plan provides adequate linkages between different
destinations within the Plan Area.
   (b)   For a subdivision, a private restrictive covenant depicting the
Project Circulation Plan shall be recorded and referenced on the plat. The
covenant may be amended if the JDA approves a revision to the Project
Circulation Plan as authorized under this section.
   (c)   Approvals: A Project Circulation Plan may only be approved by the JDA.
      1.   The Project Circulation Plan shall create interconnected blocks
bounded by streets to the extent feasible. The JDA may approve a Project
Circulation Plan containing blocks bounded by Highway right-of-way, subdivision
boundary lines, or natural and infrastructure features if no reasonable
alternatives are available.
      2.   When required, revisions to the Project Circulation Plan may be
approved by the JDA after considering the circulation characteristics of a
proposed development plan, the need for access to adjoining properties, phasing
of a larger-scaled project, and the context of surrounding development.
      3.   The JDA, with the recommendation of the Arden Hills Public Works and
Community Development Departments, may waive the requirement for a Project
Circulation Plan through the Permitted Adjustment process. This is permitted if
the JDA finds that a plan is not necessary due to the nature of the proposed
development on the site, the existence of surrounding incompatible development,
or other factors unique to the property which make strict compliance
unfeasible.
      4.   A subdivision or site plan may not be approved if the Project
Circulation Plan is not approved.
      5.   Joint Access and Public Cross-Access Easements: If necessary to
ensure access management goals along the Spine Road and to meet the intent of
the recommended alley/public cross-access easements as indicated on the
Regulating Plan, the JDA may require joint use driveways or public cross-access
easements within the site to adjacent properties and/or easements.
8.4   Street Standards:
Attachment 4 shall establish standards for all elements within the public
right-of-way including travel lane(s), on-street parking, bicycle
accommodation, streetscape/parkway standards, and sidewalk standards. The
process and standards in the Arden Hills Public Works Design Manual shall apply
to the extent that they do not conflict with the design and context standards
in Attachment 4 and the Master Plan Vision for streets in TCAAP. Landscaping
within the public right-of-way shall be per standards in Section 10 in the TRC.
Attachment 4 provides recommended cross sections for public streets within the
TRC based on available right-of-way and intended development context per the
Master Plan Vision.
9.0   Open Space Standards
9.1   Open Space Approach:
The Master Plan Vision for TCAAP recognizes the importance of providing a
network of open spaces with a multitude of passive and active recreational
opportunities. These opportunities are to be accommodated in a variety of
spaces ranging from large scale open spaces to small scale pocket parks located
within the Plan Area. The open space network will be serviced by an
interconnected network of trails and paths for pedestrians and bicyclists
alike, providing desired amenities for future residents and visitors alike.
The approach to Open Space facilitates the implementation of the Master Plan
Vision for the TRC. This vision for redevelopment is based on the City of Arden
Hills’ goal to create a comprehensive, maintained and interconnected system of
parks, pathways and open spaces, as well as a balanced program of recreational
activities for residents of all ages, incomes and abilities. The Open Space
approach recognizes that the development context, with varying density and
building types, is required to ensure quality open spaces that serve both
recreational and placemaking goals of the Master Plan.
9.2   Required Open Space Designations:
This section establishes standards for Open Space within the TRC. The TRC
Regulating Plan (Attachment 1) designates areas for required Open Spaces within
the TRC. The detailed Open Space Standards for each type are included in
Attachment 2. These standards include general character, design, typical size,
frontage requirements, and typical uses.
   (a)   Required Open Spaces are the areas shown on the Regulating Plan with
specific locations of future Open Spaces (including parks, plazas, greens, and
squares). These spaces have been identified on the Regulating Plan due to the
certainty of their location within the context of the overall Plan Area. Such
required spaces shall be publicly accessible open spaces. The specific location
of parks, particularly in the Hill and Creek neighborhoods, are likely to
change based on developer input, but will need to include the amenities
identified in the TCAAP Master Parks Plan.
9.3   Water Infrastructure Designation:
The Natural Resources Corridor within the TCAAP Site Redevelopment will be
designed with the goal of maximizing compatibility and functionality of
regional storm water, wetland mitigation, the Rice Creek re-meander, floodplain
restoration, and groundwater requirements. An additional goal is to provide
visual and active and passive recreational features to support adjacent land
uses. The Natural Resources Corridor is intended to be an amenity to the site’s
uses and users.
9.4   Permeable Area Requirement:
   (a)   All development is required to maintain a permeable ground area per
Table 9-1. In limited areas, the JDA may grant flexibility on these
requirements in accordance with MPCA guidelines.
Table 9-1 Permeable Area Requirements
 
District                  Min Pervious Lot Area
Neighborhood              40%
TC, Retail, Office, Civic 10%
Flex Office, CC           25%
 
   (b)   Permeable ground area shall be on-site within the parcel limits of the
development.
   (c)   Up to 100% of Private Common Open Space may count towards the
permeable ground area requirements if the materials and ground cover for the
Private Common Open Space meets the standards of permeability.
   (d)   Street screening for parking lots that utilize vegetative screening
may count towards the permeable ground area requirements.
   (e)   Permeable materials include:
      i.   Any natural vegetation or landscaping that allows direct water
infiltration
      ii.   Permeable paving materials designed and engineered to allow direct
water infiltration. Any new material not listed in any best practice guides for
permeable paving will be evaluated and considered by Community Development
Staff and may be approved by the JDA. Permeable paving materials shall not
count towards more than twenty percent (20%) of the total permeable area
requirements.
      iii.   Any material that requires a sheet flow and collection system for
water infiltration shall not be considered permeable cover.
   (f)   Design and placement:
      i.   In Town Center, Civic, Retail Mixed-Use and Office Mixed-Use Zones,
permeable area that is adjacent to or visible from the public right-of-way
shall be designed in context with the public realm and not interrupt the
walkable form of the public realm. An interruption may be considered any design
that blocks pedestrian walkability and clear zones, blocks views of entryways
and windows, or blocks access to any ingress/egress of a building.
      ii.   In the Neighborhood, Flex Office or Campus Commercial Zones, any
yard or buffer space on site shall be designed in context with the primary
building(s) and shall not block views or ingress/egress access to the
buildings.
9.5   Open Space Classification:
For the purposes of this Code, all open space shall fall into one of the
following three major classes:
   (a)   Public Open Space: Open air or unenclosed to semi-unenclosed areas
intended for public access and use and located per the Regulating Plan
(Attachment 1). These areas range in size and development and serve to
compliment and connect surrounding land uses and Code requirements.
   (b)   Private Common Open Space: A privately owned outdoor or unenclosed
area, located on the ground or on a terrace, deck, porch, or roof, designed and
accessible for outdoor gathering, recreation, and/or landscaping and intended
for use by the residents, employees, and/or visitors to the development. This
may or may not be accessible to the public, but shall be maintained privately.
   (c)   Private Personal Open Space: A privately owned outdoor or unenclosed
area, located on the ground or on a balcony, deck, porch, or terrace and
intended solely for use by the individual residents of a condominium or multi-
family dwelling unit.
9.6   Open Space Requirements
   (a)   All non-residential development shall provide four (4.0) sq.ft. of
Private Common Open Space for every 100 sq. ft. of non-residential building
space or fraction thereof. This standard shall only apply to site plans two (2)
acres in size or larger.
   (b)   All residential development of five (5) attached dwelling units or
more, on a single parcel, shall meet the Private Common Open Space standards
established in this Section. Table 9-2 establishes the Private Common Open
Space requirement based on the proposed intensity of residential development.
Table 9-2 Private Common Open Space Requirements

10.0   Streetscape and Landscape Standards
10.1   Sidewalks:
Publicly accessible sidewalks are required for all development under this Code
and shall meet the standards of Table 10-1 and shall be based on the Street
Classification per Attachment 4. The minimum sidewalk width requirement shall
apply regardless of the available right-of-way. If necessary to meet the
required sidewalk width, the sidewalk shall extend onto private property to
fulfill the minimum requirement, with a permanent public access easement
provided. Sidewalks shall consist of two zones: a planting zone located
adjacent to the curb, and a clear zone (see Figures 10-1).
   (a)   Planting Zone: The planting zone is intended for the placement of
street trees, if required, and street furniture including seating, street
lights, waste receptacles, fire hydrants, traffic signs, newspaper vending
boxes, bus shelters, bicycle racks, public utility equipment such as electric
transformers and water meters, and similar elements in a manner that does not
obstruct pedestrian access or motorist visibility (see Figure 10-1). This zone
may be planted with vegetation along the street or paved to match the grade of
the clear zone. Landscaping and streetscaping shall follow the City of Arden
Hills Street Design Manual for details and process.
   (b)   Clear Zone: The clear zone shall be hardscaped, shall be located
adjacent to the planting zone, shall comply with ADA and Minnesota
Accessibility Code and shall be unobstructed by any permanent or nonpermanent
element for the required minimum width and a minimum height of ten (10) feet
(see Figure 10-1). Accessibility is required to connect sidewalk clear zones on
adjacent sites.
   (c)   Fee In-Lieu Option: An applicant may opt to pay a proportional fee in-
lieu for the required sidewalk if the development project is phased or the
sidewalk improvements need to match the timing of a programmed City capital
project affecting that street frontage.

Pedestrian passages or paseos are linear public open spaces that connect one
street to another at through-block locations. Pedestrian passages create
intimate linkages through buildings at designated locations. These wide
pathways provide direct pedestrian access to residential or other commercial
addresses and create unique spaces for frontages to engage and enter off of.
Pedestrian passages allow for social and commercial activity to spill into the
public realm.
Pedestrian passages should consist of a hardscape pathway with pervious pavers
activated by frequent entries and exterior stairways. The edges may simply be
landscaped with minimal planting and potted plants. Shade is required for the
success of the paseo.    Typical Characteristics

the recreational needs of families with children. Family-friendly play areas
range in style from pocket parks within mixed use developments to playscapes
within neighborhood parks.
These play areas should serve as quiet, safe places -- protected from the
street and typically located where children do not have to cross major streets
to access. An open shelter, play structures or interactive art and fountains
may be included with landscaping between. Shaded areas and seating shall be
provided for ease of supervision.
Playscape equipment and design must be reviewed and approved by the City prior
to installation. The need for fencing depends on the surrounding environment.
A larger playground may be incorporated into a neighborhood park, whereas a
more intimate family oriented design may be incorporated into a pocket park.

Forecourt is a small scale private common open space surrounded on at least two
sides by buildings. A forecourt is typically a building entry providing a
transition space from the sidewalk to the building. The character serves as a
visual announcement of the building to visitors with additional amenities such
as signage, water features, seating, planting, etc.
Forecourts should be laid out proportionate to building height with a 1:4
(min.) ratio. In order to offset the impact of taller buildings, the detail of
the forecourt level should seek to bring down the relative scale of the space
with shade elements, trees, etc.
The hardscape should primarily accommodate circulation. Seating and shade are
important for visitors. Trees and plantings are critical to create a minimum of
30% pervious cover and offset the effect of the urban heat island.
Typical Characteristics
General Character
Small scale private common open space
Defined by buildings on at least 2 sides with connection to public sidewalk
Size of court should be proportionate to building height
Hardscape should accommodate entry circulation
Trees and plants are critical

Courtyards are small scale private common open spaces surrounded on at least
three sides by buildings with a pedestrian connection to a public sidewalk.
Courtyards maintain the character and style of the surrounding buildings.
Courtyards should be laid out proportionate to building height between 1:1 and
2:1 ratio (width to height of building). In order to offset the impact of
taller buildings, the detail of the courtyard level should seek to bring down
the relative scale of the space with shade elements, trees, etc. Transition
areas should be set up between the building face and the center of the court.
The hardscape should accommodate circulation, gathering, seating, and shade.
Trees and plantings are critical to create a minimum of 30% pervious cover and
offset the effect of the urban heat island.
Typical Characteristics

Site and Landscape Design
Objective: Minimize the potential for bird collisions when siting buildings
near existing landscape features and when planning new landscapes in close
proximity to buildings.
A WELL-INTEGRATED SUSTAINABLE DESIGN enhances open space and protects and
restores habitat while enhancing the overall architectural and operational
quality of a built facility. Efforts to integrate nature and attract wildlife
should be balanced with specific considerations of a site's impact on birds.
Birds attracted to on-site habitat are vulnerable to collisions with glass.
These guidelines encourage bird-safe design strategies early in the
collaborative design process through consideration of site, existing habitat,
and bird-safe landscaping.

WHILE BIRDS COLLIDE WITH BUILDINGS AT ALL LEVELS, ground-level stories are
considered the most dangerous because this is where habitat reflections,
glazing and internal planting are often all quite prominent . Analysis of bird
collision data over 10 years in New York City showed that "most collisions were
documented to occur during the day at the lower levels of buildings where large
glass exteriors reflected abundant vegetation, or where transparent windows
exposed indoor vegetation ."16

Building Layout and Massing
Objective: Include bird-safe strategies as part of an integrated design
approach before construction rather than retrofitting a building that proves
problematic.
BIRD-SAFE STRATEGIES do not restrict the ability to design creatively. These
guidelines encourage an integrated design approach, challenging building
designers to include bird-safe strategies to enhance aesthetic, functional, and
building performance goals. The layout of individual buildings and their
relationship to other structures on the site can affect the number of bird
collisions that occur. Building layout and massing can be planned along with
landscaping to minimize the likelihood of bird collisions.

Exterior Glass
Objective: Prevent bird collisions with glazed surfaces, while maintaining
transparency for views, daylighting and passive environmental control.
MOST BIRD COLLISIONS OCCUR at the glazed surfaces of buildings. While
circumstances such as lighting and other obstacles do contribute, glass areas
are the primary focus of bird-safe design and retrofit strategies regardless of
the overall site, landscape, layout and massing features. Bird-friendly glass
products can contribute to aesthetics, energy efficiency, and effective
daylighting. For bird safety, efforts focus on creating visual markers to make
glass visible to birds and minimize reflection of habitat and sky.

Lighting Design
Objective: Undertake strategies to reduce light trespass from buildings,
particularly during migration seasons.
REDUCING EXTERIOR BUILDING AND SITE LIGHTING has been proven effective at
reducing nighttime migratory bird collisions and mortality. At the same time,
such measures reduce building energy costs and decrease air and light
pollution. These guidelines encourage efficient design of lighting systems as
well as operational strategies to reduce light trespass from buildings,
particularly during migration seasons.

Brief: TCAAP Energy Integration Resiliency Framework
The redevelopment of the Twin Cities Army Ammunition Plant (TCAAP) site in
Arden Hills, Minnesota, offers unique and exciting opportunities to build a
vibrant community that attracts residents and businesses, and serves as a
national model for sustainable redevelopment. Ramsey County (County), Arden
Hills (City), and neighboring property owners are working together to build a
forward-looking community that optimizes innovative energy supply systems that
can be developed for reliability and resiliency, increases the use of local
renewable energy systems that can reduce the environmental impact of the
community, and develops energy efficient buildings that can provide low-cost
energy for residents and tenants.
TCAAP is a 427-acre site that has recently gone through an extensive demolition
and environmental remediation program. The site is centrally located at the
intersection of I-35 E and Highway 10, just ten miles from downtown Minneapolis
and downtown Saint Paul. TCAAP is unique for its size, prime location,
greenfield condition, and potential partnerships. The partnerships between the
Minnesota Army National Guard (MNARNG), the U.S. Army, Xcel Energy, the City,
and the County create dynamic and beneficial opportunities for all entities.
To facilitate TCAAP redevelopment, the County and the City have engaged in a
partnership through the formation of a Joint Development Authority (JDA). For
the purposes of energy planning, they have also established the Energy
Resiliency Advisory Board (ERAB) and appointed community stakeholders to help
define an energy vision for TCAAP. The Project Team includes Ever-Green Energy,
Center for Energy and Environment, Fresh Energy, and Burns & McDonnell.
Findings
• Given current market drivers and the timing of TCAAP development,
implementation of the opportunities identified in this Framework should begin
immediately.
• Partnership with Xcel Energy and the Minnesota Army National Guard will be
essential to achieving the vision for TCAAP.
• Implementing the opportunities recommended in this Framework can reduce
greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 70%.
• A solar photovoltaic (PV) installation at the Primer Tracer site has the
potential to provide sufficient power to TCAAP and AHATS when operating at peak
conditions.
• Combined heat and power (CHP) is an efficient and effective step toward
developing a microgrid at TCAAP and AHATS.
• The locally treated groundwater possesses enough energy to meet all of the
thermal needs of the planned TCAAP residential neighborhoods.
• Enhanced building design standards applied in the request for proposal (RFP)
process can attract and streamline energy efficient development.
• Building orientation, co-location of complementary use buildings, and use of
sub-meters can reduce energy consumption and improve energy efficiency.
• Integrating several of these energy opportunities would allow residents of
TCAAP to achieve netzero energy status.
• The County and JDA should allow corridors for future energy infrastructure
along the Spine Road
• The JDA should begin pursuing funding opportunities that support the
strategies in this Framework.
• The strategies identified in this Framework should be incorporated into the
developer selection process.
The City, County, and ERAB have worked with the Project Team to develop a two-
part TCAAP Energy Integration Resiliency Framework that outlines the
appropriate planning guidelines and policies with careful consideration of
local resources, stakeholder interests, project goals, and the best available
technologies for implementation over the next 50 years. Phase one of the study
was the development of the Policy White Paper which was accepted by the JDA and
the Arden Hills City Council in November 2014. The White Paper helps guide
policy and provides a unifying vision for the site's energy future and
identifies a number of opportunities for energy efficiency and efficient energy
supply options.
Phase two of the study focused on the development of this document, the Energy
Integration Resiliency Framework (Framework) which provides more details about
how the County, the City, and the JDA can technically achieve the vision and
recommendations put forth in the White Paper. The Framework considers the TCAAP
Redevelopment Plan, which outlines land use, infrastructure planning, and the
site development timeline. The expectation is for TCAAP to be redeveloped as a
mixed-use community with residential, commercial, and retail space. The
Framework evaluates the energy supply alternatives and demand-side management
strategies that were the most immediately implementable concepts from the White
Paper. The Framework outlines the energy supply technologies that can be built
during the early phases of site development and would be financially
beneficial, financeable, practical, and achievable. The Framework also provides
a detailed analysis of the optimal initial energy efficiency strategies,
including site and building planning, demand-side management, advanced
technology, and building design. Energy supply and energy efficiency solutions
at TCAAP will also be influenced by collaboration between partners, including
the MNARNG and Xcel Energy. These partnership opportunities are immediate and
implementable to meet the loads of the buildings that are currently in the
area, as well as the future buildings expected to be built within TCAAP and
nearby.
During development of the White Paper, the ERAB outlined their vision and
guiding principles for TCAAP energy development.
Vision Statement
TCAAP will be a vibrant development that leverages long-term energy
conservation and resilience to attract investment and partnership, and achieves
sustainable benefits for Arden Hills and the surrounding community.
Guiding Principles
• Establish TCAAP as a national model for development of integrated energy
systems.
• Develop a resilient community for energy and other utilities.
• Implement infrastructure solutions that are flexible and scalable over the
next 50 years.
• Deliver a model of efficient energy and water usage that minimizes TCAAP’s
impact on the environment.
• Create an economically competitive and attractive environment for developers
and businesses.
Partnership Opportunities (Outlined in Section 2)
The Project Team has begun to assess several potential partnerships, including
infrastructure and operations opportunities with the local utility provider,
Xcel Energy, and MNARNG. The MNARNG owns and operates the Arden Hills Army
Training Site (AHATS) adjacent to the TCAAP site. The MNARNG has developed a
master plan for the buildings on its site that includes the goals of net-zero
energy, water, and waste, and is currently working on implementation plans to
achieve these goals. The MNARNG has expressed a strong interest in
collaborating with the County and JDA on the development of energy solutions
for the area.
Xcel Energy is committed to reaching energy efficiency and renewable energy
goals, as well as the potential for innovative demonstration projects that
showcase energy efficiency and resilient energy. Xcel Energy leadership has
expressed a commitment to partnership with the County in the implementation of
the energy plan for TCAAP, and the County should continue to pursue
opportunities that can benefit both parties and achieve the energy vision for
TCAAP.
 
Partnerships with Xcel Energy and MNARNG could create unique and exciting
opportunities to optimize energy supply and energy efficiency at TCAAP.
 
Additionally, there are two areas for additional partnership. The Ramsey County
Public Works (RCPW) facility on County Highway 96 is an existing facility
adjacent to AHATS and TCAAP. In the Primer Tracer area on the north edge of
TCAAP and AHATS, the Department of Public Safety is contemplating the
installation of an emergency operations facility. Both of these facilities
should be considered when planning energy solutions for the area. Through
partnership discussions, a number of immediate and implementable partnership
opportunities were identified to meet the loads of the buildings that are
currently in the area, as well as the initial buildings expected to be built at
TCAAP.
Energy Source Recommendations (Outlined in Section 3)
After evaluating a range of possible energy sources and considering the TCAAP
goals, timeline, and resources, the Project Team recommends the development of
solar PV, CHP, low-temperature district energy system, and the foundational
components of a future microgrid. Beyond meeting the energy needs of customers
and the goals of stakeholders, these recommendations are customized to the
distinctive features of TCAAP.
When considering the recommended technologies, it is important to consider the
potential CO2 reductions that accompany these strategies. In total, over 8510
tons of CO2/year can be avoided, which is the equivalent of removing 1625 cars
from the road each year. The environmental benefits of reduced greenhouse gas
emissions will be further increased through integration with the other energy
supply alternatives recommended and implementation of demand-side management
strategies, ultimately leading to more sustainable redevelopment of TCAAP and
the long-term potential of reaching carbon-neutrality for the site in the
future.
Solar PV
The utilization of solar technology can enable the generation and utilization
of renewable energy at TCAAP.
Solar PV at Prime Tracer
Based on generally accepted solar generation estimates, a large-scale solar
installation on 40-acre of the Prime Tracer site could generate approximately 8
megawatts of electricity (MWe) in peak conditions. Conservatively, this could
account for approximately 70% of the peak electric load in the area.
Implementing a solar PV array in the Primer Tracer area will result in a
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 7,524 tons of CO2 per
year.
 
A solar PV array at the Primer Tracer site could meet the electricity needs of
TCAAP and AHATS when operating at peak conditions.
 
Solar PV at AHATS
A 2 MWe solar PV installation at the capped soil area west of the existing
AHATS Field Maintenance Shop would primarily meet a portion of the electric
needs of the AHATS site, but could provide additional renewable electric energy
to TCAAP during the non-peak energy usage times at AHATS.
Combined Heat and Power
The vision for the TCAAP site is for the Thumb, Town Center, and Flex areas to
be served electrically and thermally by a CHP energy system located at or near
TCAAP. This localized energy source would enable achievement of many of the
guiding principles established by the ERAB, potentially reducing greenhouse gas
emission reductions by 20%.
Depending upon the type of business that develops in the Thumb, a CHP plant
located on that property could efficiently serve the electric and thermal
energy needs of that business, as well as the thermal needs of buildings in the
Town. A CHP plant located close to AHATS and the existing facility at Ramsey
County Public Works could be used to meet the electric needs of MNARNG, while
simultaneously meeting the thermal needs of MNARNG and RCPW buildings. As TCAAP
development progresses, these two CHP systems could be integrated to serve the
majority of the thermal energy needs of the commercial portion of TCAAP.
 
Implementing a CHP system at the Thumb could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by
as much as 20%, reduce energy costs, increase energy efficiency, and establish
the foundation of a future microgrid.
 
Microgrid - There is an opportunity to implement and demonstrate "next
generation" electricity grid technologies that will help achieve the TCAAP
energy vision, including development of a microgrid connected to a CHP plant.
It will be important for Xcel Energy, the MNARNG, and the JDA to develop a plan
to expand the scope of the CHP plant and develop a microgrid for the broader
area as TCAAP development proceeds.
Low-Temperature District Energy System
The residential neighborhoods planned for the TCAAP site present a unique and
highly visible opportunity to leverage low-grade energy from the treated
groundwater as an energy supply for the neighborhoods, distributed via a low-
temperature district energy system. This energy would be sufficient to meet the
heating and cooling needs of the Hill and Creek residential neighborhoods of
TCAAP, with approximately 3 MMBtu/hour of excess capacity available for
additional TCAAP buildings.
For the proposed system to be successfully implemented, it would need to be
constructed as the first homes are being built, so that service can be provided
from the outset of development. To optimize the economic benefits of the
system, every home in the selected neighborhoods should be constructed with a
heat pump HVAC system and be connected to the proposed system. This would
provide the most financeable, cost-effective implementation plan, and also
maximize energy efficiency for TCAAP.
 
The available energy from the treated groundwater can serve all of the TCAAP
homes with a lower-cost energy source that reduces GHG emissions by ~30%.
 
One important advantage of a low-temperature district energy system is the
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Comparing emission rates between
traditional heating ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems and the
proposed low-temperature district energy system in the Hill and Creek
neighborhoods shows carbon dioxide emissions are could be reduced by almost 30%
or 310 tons CO2/year.
Implementing a low-temperature district energy system in the residential
neighborhoods of TCAAP can deliver several benefits to the site and
stakeholders, including the following:
   •   An energy system that is more energy efficient than traditional heating
and cooling systems.
   •   Reduced fossil fuel usage and greenhouse gas emissions.
   •   Competitive, stable costs of energy for homeowners.
   •   Xcel Energy could avoid installing gas pipe in the neighborhoods
   •   Installation of an infrastructure network in the neighborhoods will
allow for easier integration of future energy sources or technology
advancements as they become available.
   •   Implementation of this system would establish the TCAAP approach to
sustainable neighborhoods as a national model for energy efficiency and
innovative site development.
Additional Energy Technology Opportunities
While not recommended for any of the initial options in this Framework, there
are two additional technologies that should be considered for future TCAAP
energy system integration:
Thermal Energy Storage - On the AHATS site, there is an existing one million
gallon water storage tank and related water distribution piping. This tank
could be used as a thermal energy storage tank to store water for the heating
and cooling needs of the area. This would work like a battery, which would fill
up during non-peak energy hours and be discharged during peak energy usage
times to balance out the energy usage profile for the area.
Solar Thermal - The MNARNG utilizes solar-thermal technology on its buildings
and is investigating further integration of it as their site is built out. This
technology should be considered for individual sites or as part of a larger
energy plan for TCAAP development.
Energy Efficiency Strategies through Demand-Side Management (Outlined in
Section 4)
To promote energy efficiency at TCAAP, the Project Team recommends a combined
approach through flexible building design assistance, readily available
technical resources, planning best practices, and development RFP criteria that
will attract and streamline energy efficient development. High- performance
buildings with a lower energy profile will provide an economically attractive
environment where building owners save money through increased efficiency and
lower energy bills. The implementation of improved building energy efficiency
will be as important as the energy sources to achieving the community's low-
carbon, resiliency goals. Considering demand-side management alongside
development increases the opportunities for demonstration projects and
resident, tenant, and commercial participation. For these efforts, Xcel Energy
and the Center for Sustainable Building Research at the University of Minnesota
will be valuable partners.
Throughout the development of TCAAP, the recommended demand-side initiatives
will depend strongly on engaging developers, who can help implement the TCAAP
energy vision. These energy efficiency recommendations make use of the truly
unique opportunities at TCAAP, which include:
   •   A greenfield development to minimize the cost of initial installation of
energy efficient systems.
   •   The advantage of large scale deployment to optimize economies of scale.
   •   Focus on replicable designs and proven technologies to simplify
developer implementation.
   •   Emphasis on building performance based standards, instead of only design
conditions.
   •   Important strategic partnerships with Xcel Energy and the Center for
Sustainable Building Research at the University of Minnesota.
High-Efficiency Commercial Buildings
As development moves forward it is recommended that the County, the JDA, and
development consultants utilize building standards, technical resources,
planning tactics, and proposal criteria to attract and streamline energy
efficient development.
Utilize SB 2030
Minnesota's Sustainable Buildings 2030 (SB 2030) is a performance based
building energy standard developed to incrementally move new commercial
building construction to net-zero energy by 2030. On average, SB 2030 will
require commercial buildings to be 35% to 45% more efficient than the new
building code (IECC 2012). As nearly 75% of the energy loads for TCAAP are
estimated to be in the retail, commercial, and flex areas of the development,
energy conservation measures for these areas will be paramount for successful
achievement of the Energy Vision. The key way to incentivize use of SB 2030 is
to give preference during the RFP review process to proposals that plan to
implement these standards.
 
On average, SB 2030 will require commercial buildings to be 35% to 45% more
efficient than the new building code (IECC 2012).
 
Sub-metering
Commercial and multi-family building sub-metering is an important consideration
because the additional design cost is relatively low when considered up front,
but has the potential to maintain lower energy use since tenants directly see
and pay for their energy use.
Sub-metering has been shown to save up to 21% in leased building spaces.1 The
material, software, and labor cost for each sub-meter ranges from $5,000 to
$7,500. Several metering companies provide sub-metering services by owning,
operating, and maintaining the meters. Monthly fees are based on the type of
service needed and the quantity of sub-meters served, but costs per sub-meter
range from $150 to $400.

Existing Building Stock" McGraw-Hill Construction and CBRE. September, 2011.

Strategic Building Siting and Co-Location
The County and JDA could facilitate building co-location through the platting
and RFP process. Building energy use types can be identified as potential
candidates, and referred to energy design experts to define the specific energy
benefits that could be achieved through co-location. Buildings with processes
that produce hot water or heat could sell their excess to adjacent buildings
that have use for it at different times of day. District energy infrastructure
could enhance this load diversity and energy sharing. Businesses would be
interested in this opportunity because it would improve the efficiency of their
consumption, reduce upfront capital equipment and maintenance costs, and
increase comfort.2

and Gas-fired heating (0.8/1.3=0.61) http://www.euroheat.org/Files/Filer/
documents/Publications/District%20Heating%20in%20buildings_final.pdf
Low-Load Residential Development
Residential developments at TCAAP could feature homes that do not require
natural gas, by utilizing electric appliances and serving minimal heating and
cooling demands through ground-source heat pump technology. A low-load home
would not require the larger heating and cooling capacity of traditional
systems, but instead could meet residents' comfort needs with smaller capacity
systems. The key technologies and strategies include high levels of building
insulation and passive solar design, a tight building shell, and high
efficiency lighting and appliances. These homes do not require significant
insulation like a passive house, but are 40% to 50% more efficient than what is
required by the new energy code (IECC 2012).
 
Homes built at TCAAP could be 40% to 50% more efficient than what is required
by the new energy code.
 
Incorporation of high-performance technologies that have little to no impact on
the up-front costs, such as efficient appliances and low-flow plumbing, will
help minimize hot water use and help maximize home efficiency.
Building Orientation and Passive Solar
The process for solar-oriented development should be described in residential
and commercial building RFPs and should be integrated as evaluation criteria
for development proposals. It should be evaluated based on lowest total energy
load of the homes or buildings to be sited under one proposal and should
consider street orientation, building orientation, and passive solar building
envelope design elements.
The thermal loads of homes and commercial buildings will be impacted by the
building envelope, street orientation, lot and building orientation, and
building massing. The likely locations where street orientation could vary
significantly to accommodate energy implications would be the Creek, the Hill,
and the Transition neighborhood on the periphery of the Town Center.
 
By pairing solar heat gains and window design strategies, heating energy
savings can be up to 30%
 
By considering these variables prior to the subdivision process, planners and
developers have the opportunity to produce efficient results with little or no-
cost impacts.
High-Efficiency Streetlights
The City of Arden Hills has included a site-wide requirement for all
streetlights to be "high-efficiency lighting, such as LED lamps." This
requirement will trigger the inclusion of high efficiency lights in the
development process. Current LED technology saves approximately 50% to 70% of
lighting energy use. Another significant cost savings occurs by additionally
reducing maintenance costs, given the longer life of the bulbs.
Community Participation and Education
Community participation and education have been consistently mentioned as
important factors for TCAAP, both to engage the wider Arden Hills community and
to leverage the energy savings potential from facilitating ongoing awareness of
energy use by site tenants and residents. Many details of community engagement
will need to be planned once the site sees its first residents and tenants.
However, certain engagement elements can be planned for or implemented during
the early development stage, including:
   •   A TCAAP or Arden Hills-wide website that tracks energy goals and
performance of buildings at the site, including energy and carbon savings. The
website could promote major metrics and milestones, and issue periodic
challenges (e.g. the "lowest user" challenge).
   •   Community-wide open house or showcase events of leading edge
technologies on the site, especially for housing, that will attract and excite
potential residents.
   •   Commissioning of design or signage elements in public spaces that
connect users to the site's energy resiliency goals and their contribution and
participation in those goals. A targeted marketing campaign around community
solar development, as an early symbol of community- driven, low carbon energy
use at the site.
Demonstration Opportunities
Advanced Distribution Grid
TCAAP's greenfield status, combined with the site's forward looking energy
vision, make it an ideal opportunity to pilot and demonstrate advanced
technologies in the electric distribution grid. Many of the opportunities
outlined in this report, such as high solar PV penetration, advanced commercial
building metering, or responsive electric loads, are all facilitated by a
distribution system with increased communications and control functions.
Implementing an advanced distribution grid can save customers money and reduce
the environmental impact of their energy use.
 
By laying the groundwork for an advanced distribution system at TCAAP during
the planning phase, residents and businesses would have access to cutting edge
opportunities such as advanced rate design or real-time load response.
 
Innovative Energy Technologies
In addition to pilot opportunities at the grid level, TCAAP is ideal for
demonstrating innovative energy technologies at scale. The Project Team
recommends that the JDA and County seek and attract partnerships to demonstrate
proven technologies and strategies.
While the technologies may be proven, TCAAP offers scalable and living
demonstration opportunities, where an apartment, house, or street of homes
could serve as a living lab. Additionally, as a cold climate site that can
attract multiple partners, there is great opportunity to demonstrate the
synergies that can exist between multiple innovative technologies and design
strategies. This might include piloting new in-road luminescent street or
pedestrian path lighting products in conjunction with high efficiency overhead
LED street lighting, electric vehicle storage and integration, or homes that
have on-site electric storage and remote controlled appliances/electronics that
communicate with each other.
Conclusion
The ERAB has adopted a very forward-thinking vision for the TCAAP site. This
will be achievable through strategic partnerships with Xcel Energy, the MNARNG,
the University of Minnesota Center for Sustainable Building Research,
environmentally conscious citizens, and developers who see the economic and
environmental value of the TCAAP energy vision. Through these partnerships,
TCAAP will be uniquely poised to be the national model for the development of
integrated energy systems.
The first steps toward achieving the energy vision include implementing energy
supply options that focus on efficiency, reliability, scalability, and
sustainability, such as the low-temperature district energy system in the
residential neighborhoods and the community solar garden at the Primer Tracer
site. These specific opportunities have been shown to be financially beneficial
and financeable.
Developing a CHP that meets the needs of current buildings in the area and is
expandable in the future provides a platform for establishing a resilient TCAAP
microgrid as TCAAP development progresses.
Implementing a demand-side management strategy that focuses on building
performance through the development RFP process will build a resilient
community for energy use. Focusing on improving performance in the buildings to
reduce the energy needs of the buildings will provide an economically
attractive environment as building owners are able to take advantage of the
financial savings realized by the increased efficiency, compared to traditional
energy expenditures.
Schedule and Next Steps (Outlined in Section 6)
The development schedule that is currently proposed is scheduled to begin in
2016 with the construction of the interchanges of County Hwy 96 and County Road
H with the Spine Road. The Spine Road construction is also expected to begin in
2016. Currently, site development is projected to begin with the residential
and retail areas in the northern region of TCAAP in late 2016 or early 2017.
Development is expected to progress southward from the Town and Creek
neighborhoods as the market allows. The Thumb area is being actively marketed
by the JDA at this time, and could be developed as soon as the right proposal
is received from the development community. The current development plan is
included in the appendix as Exhibit III.
Given this development timeline, the JDA will need to begin implementation on
each of the individual opportunities presented in this Framework, including
immediate focus on the following:
   •   partnerships
   •   solar PV
   •   combined heat and power
   •   low-temperature district energy system
   •   demand-side management
   •   infrastructure planning
   •   funding pursuits
   •   RFP development
   •   education workshops
The TCAAP site is positioned to be a national model for site redevelopment.
With planning and leadership, this area can be developed to meet the bold
energy vision of the ERAB to become a vibrant development that leverages long-
term energy conservation and resilience to attract investment and partnership,
and achieves sustainable benefits for Arden Hills and the surrounding
community.
Energy Integration Resiliency Framework
1.   Introduction
The Twin Cities Army Ammunitions Plant (TCAAP) site offers an incredible
opportunity for Ramsey County, Arden Hills, and the surrounding community to
build a forward-looking community that optimizes the energy and environmental
opportunities of the next generation. Innovative energy supply systems can be
developed for reliability and resiliency, increased use of local renewable
energy systems can reduce the environmental impact of redevelopment, and energy
efficient buildings can provide low-cost energy for residents and tenants. The
TCAAP site is positioned to be a national model for site redevelopment. With
planning and leadership, this area can be developed to utilize economically
competitive, low-carbon energy sources, follow exceptional energy and
environmental standards, and engage future residents as stewards of the energy
vision.
Beyond being a greenfield, TCAAP has a number of characteristics that make it
distinctive. One of the unique opportunities TCAAP redevelopment offers is the
potential to partner with the local utility provider, Xcel Energy, and the
MNARNG on energy supply infrastructure and operations. The MNARNG owns and
operates the AHATS adjacent to the TCAAP site. The MNARNG has developed a
master plan for the buildings on its site that includes the goal of net-zero
energy, water, and waste, and are currently working on implementation plans to
achieve this goal. The partnership between the MNARNG, the City, and County
creates dynamic and beneficial opportunities for all entities.
Xcel Energy provides electricity and natural gas to the area in and around
Arden Hills. Xcel Energy views the TCAAP redevelopment as an opportunity to
partner with local government and the community to develop demonstration
projects that showcase energy efficiency and resilient energy projects.
To facilitate TCAAP redevelopment, the County and the City have engaged in a
partnership through the formation of a Joint Development Authority (JDA). For
the purposes of energy planning, they have also established the Energy
Resiliency Advisory Board (ERAB) and appointed community stakeholders to help
define the TCAAP energy vision. The ERAB has worked with energy experts on the
Project Team to develop a two part TCAAP Energy Integration Resiliency
Framework that outlines the appropriate planning guidelines and policies with
careful consideration of local resources, stakeholder interests, project goals,
and the best available technologies for implementation over the next 50 years.
Phase one of the study was the development of the Policy White Paper which was
accepted by the JDA and the Arden Hills City Council in November, 2014. The
White Paper provides a unifying vision for the site's energy future and
identifies the most beneficial opportunities for energy efficiency and
efficient energy supply options. Phase two of the study is to develop this
document, the Energy Integration Resiliency Framework (Framework,) which
provides more details about how the County, the City, and
the JDA can technically achieve the vision and recommendations put forth in the
White Paper. The Framework focuses on determining which energy supply
technologies can be built during the early phases of site development and would
be financially beneficial, financeable, practical, and achievable. The
Framework also provides more detailed analysis of the optimal initial energy
efficiency strategies, including demand-side management, advanced technology,
and building design. Each of these opportunities is considered with the goals,
benefits, and risks for the County, City, JDA, ERAB, the MNARNG, and Xcel
Energy in mind.
Through the development of the White Paper, the ERAB outlined their vision and
guiding principles for TCAAP energy development.
 
Vision Statement
TCAAP will be a vibrant development that leverages long-term energy conservation
and resilience to attract investment and partnership, and achieves sustainable
benefits for Arden Hills and the surrounding community.
Guiding Principles
• Establish TCAAP as a national model for development of integrated energy
systems
• Develop a resilient community for energy and other utilities
• Implement infrastructure solutions that are flexible and scalable over the
next 50 years
• Deliver a model of efficient energy and water usage that minimizes TCAAP’s
impact on the environment
• Create an economically competitive and attractive environment for developers
and businesses
 
2.   Partnership Opportunities
2.1.   Background
The TCAAP EIRF Project Team met with members of the Minnesota Army National
Guard staff to discuss the potential for working together to meet the energy
needs and goals of both sites. In those meetings, it was found that the goals
of the MNARNG are very similar to the energy vision established by the ERAB.
Together, the MNARNG and the Project Team identified several energy-supply
opportunities that should be pursued, including solar photovoltaic (PV),
combined heat and power (CHP) generation, energy capture from treated
groundwater, and thermal energy storage. In addition, the parties identified
several opportunities for collaboration on energy efficiency improvements and
demand-side management.
The Project Team has also engaged in discussions between the County, the
MNARNG, and Xcel Energy to gage the utility's interest in each of these
opportunities. Xcel Energy has expressed interest or support of each option,
with further details provided in the following sections.
The remainder of Section 2 provides further details on each of the partnership
opportunities identified in the conceptual map provided in Exhibit I.
2.2.   Energy Loads
Following the development of the White Paper, the Project Team refined the
estimated loads for the TCAAP site to reflect the changes to the TCAAP
Redevelopment Plan. The Project Team also collaborated with the MNARNG to
understand the energy needs of current and future buildings on the AHATS site.
In addition to the AHATS and TCAAP sites, the Project Team identified one
existing campus and one possible future campus that could be connected to the
proposed system. The RCPW facility on County Highway 96 is an existing facility
adjacent to AHATS and TCAAP that could be integrated with the initial system.
In the Primer Tracer area on the north edge of TCAAP and AHATS, the Department
of Public Safety facility is contemplating the installation of an emergency
operations facility that, if built, could be a strong candidate for connecting
to the proposed system.
The Project Team also worked with Xcel Energy to estimate energy loads that
were in line with energy usage in Minnesota. The estimated loads for all
prospective customer areas are provided in Table 1.
Table 1: Total estimated energy loads
 
Estimated Energy Loads
                Electric Thermal          Cooling
TCAAP           8.01 MW  38.91 MMBtu/hour 6171 tons
AHATS           3.4 MW   7.3 MMBtu/hour   500 tons
DPS EOC         0.07 MW  0.5 MMBtu/hour   30 tons
RCPW            0.40 MW  4.1 MMBtu/hour   240 tons
Estimated Total 11.9 MW  50.8 MMBtu/hour  1,387 tons
 
Note:
1 Loads are estimated based upon the current projection of land use.
2.3.   AHATS Considerations
Through initial discussions with the MNARNG, the following considerations were
identified as being important components of energy plan development for the
MNARNG:
   •   The MNARNG has net-zero goals for energy, water, and waste.
   •   The MNARNG intends to develop an energy resiliency plan for periods of
grid outage in order to meet mission requirements, including the ability to be
disconnected from the larger grid.
   •   The MNARNG will need to receive benefit for any opportunity that is
developed on its property.
   •   The development must not be intrusive or obstruct the training at AHATS.
   •   Funding is limited for the MNARNG. Third-party financing is preferred.
   •   Third-party operations and maintenance of the installed systems is
preferred.
These fundamental goals will continue to drive much of the partnership
discussions with the MNARNG and have been included in the planning for the
options provided in this Framework.
2.4.   Xcel Energy Considerations
TCAAP provides an opportunity for Xcel Energy to pilot advanced energy
solutions that will help them meet and exceed their Minnesota energy efficiency
and renewable energy goals. Through discussions with Xcel Energy, the Project
Team has identified the following considerations that will be important through
the course of development:
   •   Consideration should be given to the potential for an Xcel Energy-owned
community solar garden, which could expedite development, minimize potential
risks, and visibly demonstrate partnership linkages at the TCAAP site.
   •   Xcel Energy would be an important support partner in any innovative
energy demonstration projects at the site, and for investments at TCAAP that
would help the utility further its statewide efficiency or renewable energy
goals.
   •   As a regulated utility, Xcel Energy's investments into the TCAAP site
are more likely to be supported if the ERAB, JDA, and other local partners
would advocate for these investments and partnerships with the Public Utilities
Commission.
Xcel Energy leadership has expressed a commitment to partnering with the County
and the JDA in the implementation of the TCAAP energy plan, and the County
should continue to pursue opportunities that can benefit both parties and
achieve the energy vision for TCAAP.
2.5.   Near-Term Partnership Opportunities
Through partnership discussions, a number of immediate and implementable
partnership opportunities were identified to meet the loads of the buildings
that are currently in the area, as well as the initial buildings expected to be
built at TCAAP. The related technologies are introduced in this section and
further explored later within the Framework.
2.5.1.   Solar PV
2.5.1.1.   Primer Tracer
The Primer Tracer area neighboring the AHATS and TCAAP sites is currently an
area with soil contamination that requires remediation to be suitable for
development. The Army Corps of Engineers has shown interest in having this site
cleaned up and put to productive use, and it does present a good opportunity
for the construction of a solar PV site because of the limited excavation,
maintenance, and human interaction that is necessary. The site is approximately
60 acres in size, with 20 acres being considered for the Department of Public
Safety State Emergency Operations Center. This would leave 40 acres for a
large-scale solar installation. Based on generally accepted solar generation
estimates, this 40-acre site could generate approximately 8 megawatts of
electricity (MWe) in peak conditions, depending on the technology and system
installed. Conservatively, this could account for approximately 70% of the peak
electric load for the area.
2.5.1.2.   AHATS Solar PV
The 2009 Master Plan for AHATS produced by Jacobs Engineering identifies a two
MWe solar PV installation at the capped soil area west of the existing Field
Maintenance Shop. This installation would primarily meet a portion of the
electric needs of the AHATS site, but could provide renewable electric energy
to TCAAP during the non-peak energy usage times at AHATS.
2.5.2.   Combined Heat and Power
Combined heat and power (CHP) could be used to meet the electric needs of TCAAP
and adjacent properties, while simultaneously capturing the thermal energy
created from electric generation to meet the thermal needs of the area. This
would provide a local energy generation source to the area that could be
disconnected from the grid in the event of a grid disruption. As the existing
electric and thermal energy loads are based at the AHATS and RCPW buildings, it
would be optimal to locate the initial CHP plant as close to those buildings as
possible, with the opportunity of expanding it to meet future TCAAP energy
needs. This initial proposed location provides two advantages. First, having
the plant located near the initial load will reduce the up-front capital cost
for the installation of the distribution network providing thermal energy.
Second, this location is near the existing and proposed AHATS buildings,
meaning that training operations (located in the central and northern areas of
AHATS) would not be negatively impacted. Additional CHP facilities could be
located in the Thumb area of TCAAP, or near other concentrated loads at TCAAP
as development proceeds. The CHP system should be designed to allow for
expansion to serve the thermal needs of the TCAAP site as it is developed, to
align with the vision of TCAAP as a comprehensive energy program that optimizes
efficiencies, minimizes costs, and reduces greenhouse gas emissions. The
initial system should also be designed for future fuel flexibility, such as
biogas integration, and the ability to meet growing thermal needs of the area.
2.5.3.   Groundwater Treatment Station
Approximately two million gallons per day (2 MGD) are pumped to AHATS from the
groundwater treatment station located on TCAAP. This pumping is required to
continue until the chemical remediation goals are reached for the water, which
is estimated to be at least another 25-30 years. This groundwater pumping can
be useful to meet the energy goals of both AHATS and TCAAP through the
implementation of a low-temperature district energy system.
In addition, kinetic energy could be captured from the pumped water at the
point of discharge at the gravel pit on the AHATS site. The water is being
pumped uphill to a point that provides energy which potentially could be used
for micro-hydroelectric generation. This would provide a small amount of
electric generation, but could be used to offset the power necessary to pump
the groundwater.
The temperature of the water in this loop is close to 52° F throughout the
year. Assuming a thermal energy transfer of 11° F, the energy in the water per
hour is estimated to be approximately 10 MMBtu/hour. This energy would be
enough to meet the heating and cooling needs of the residential neighborhoods
of TCAAP, with approximately 3 MMBtu/hour of excess capacity available for
AHATS or additional TCAAP buildings. When groundwater remediation is completed,
the district energy infrastructure could be utilized to distribute energy from
other sources such as low-grade waste heat recovery or geothermal wells.
2.6.   Future Potential Opportunities
2.6.1.   Thermal Energy Storage
On the AHATS site, there is an existing one million gallon water storage tank,
and related water distribution piping, that was originally used during
ammunitions manufacturing. The tank was built with adequate ground cover to
prevent water from freezing in the winter. This tank could be used as a thermal
energy storage tank to store water for the heating and cooling needs of the
area. This would work like a battery, which would fill up during non-peak
energy hours and be discharged during peak energy usage times to balance out
the energy usage profile for the area. The size, shape, and structural
condition of the tank need to be studied to judge the feasibility of this
opportunity. It is likely that the tank would require the installation of a
liner or bladder to be able to hold water. While utilization of this tank is
not included in any of the immediate options detailed in this Framework, it is
a valuable asset that should be contemplated as each energy option is further
developed, and as TCAAP redevelopment progresses.
2.6.2.   Solar Thermal
Solar thermal systems are most commonly installed on residential and small
commercial buildings, although larger shared systems are gaining popularity.
Solar thermal systems are comprised of solar collectors and a fluid moving
between the collectors and a hot water reservoir. Typically the heated fluid is
pumped from the tank to a heat exchanger where heat is extracted into the air
to heat space or domestic hot water. Solar thermal systems are highly efficient
in their ability to capture and transfer solar energy.
When included as part of a broader energy plan, benefits of a solar-thermal
system can be enhanced. For example, solar thermal can be paired with thermal
storage to capture excess energy when it is available and dispatch to users
during higher demand periods. The MNARNG utilizes solar thermal technology on
its buildings and is investigating further integration of it as their site is
built out. Solar thermal is not a priority recommendation for initial
implementation, but this technology should be considered for individual sites
or as part of a larger energy plan as TCAAP development progresses.
3.   Energy Source Implementation
As outlined in the partnership section, there are immense opportunities for
technology development at TCAAP. The success of their implementation hinges on
the effectiveness of partnerships and incorporating the right technology
solution for the right project within the development. The technologies
recommended in the following section were selected to fit the partner
interests, development timeline, and both environmental and economic goals.
This includes the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Through the
implementation of the energy supply opportunities presented in this section,
the TCAAP development will be poised to reduce the amount of CO2 emitted into
the atmosphere as the equivalent amount of CO2 produced by 1625 automobiles3.

Table 2: Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction Summary
 
Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Summary
                        Annual CO2 Reductions % Reduction from traditional
                                               scenarios
Solar PV                 7,524 (tons CO2/yr)   100%
CHP                      676 (tons CO2/yr)     19%
Low Temp District Energy 310 (tons CO2/yr)     29%
Totals                   8,510 (tons CO2/yr)   70%
 
The environmental benefits shown in Table 2 will be further increased through
implementation of demand-side management strategies outlined in section 4, and
will lead to more sustainable redevelopment of TCAAP. This combination of
responsible energy supply opportunities, sustainable building practices,
effective demand side management, continuous commissioning of building systems,
and improving occupant awareness set the stage for the possibility of the
entire development being carbon-neutral in the future.
3.1.   Solar PV
As noted in the White Paper, the utilization of solar PV technology can enable
the generation and utilization of renewable energy at TCAAP. While individual
property owners could choose to install roof-mounted or ground-mounted solar PV
systems for some of their site needs, another possibility would be to install a
large-scale community solar array adjacent to the TCAAP site.

3.1.1.   Introduction
The most prime opportunity for solar PV is likely within the Primer Tracer area
north east of the existing TCAAP site. The array, as proposed, would reach a
peak of approximately 8MWe of solar PV generation, which would produce
approximately 14,500,000 AC kWh of energy annually. The project could be
financed by Xcel Energy or a third party developer through a combination of
debt and equity, with the land leased from the County or the MNARNG. The
project owner could utilize available tax incentives such as the 30% investment
tax credit and 5-year accelerated depreciation to help offset the cost of the
project and lower the cost of energy from the array. Electric energy sales and
associated revenues could be generated from subscribers' purchases or lease
interests of the solar garden system through Xcel Energy's existing community
solar garden program. Alternatively, Xcel Energy could own, develop, and sell
the energy from the project.
3.1.2.   Implementation Strategy
3.1.2.1.   Existing Project Site
Between 40 and 60 acres of land are available for the preliminary development
of a solar PV array. This plot of land is relatively flat, with minimal
elevation change from north to south or east to west.
Although a detailed siting study was not conducted, the site characteristics
determined by a Google Earth analysis all point to a feasible site with
significant potential. This solar array would be built atop land with existing
structures currently in place. These structures would be demolished and removed
as part of the solar project construction. Current structures, above and below
grade would need to be removed to a depth of approximately five feet.
3.1.2.2.   Conceptual Solar Plant Site Layout
A conceptual layout of an 8 megawatt alternating current (MWAC) capacity solar
PV array was prepared on the proposed parcel of land to assess feasibility of
this installation on a 40 acre site. If all 60 acres are able to be utilized,
the array could be increased to 12 MWAC. The array would consist of eight, 1
MWAC (1.3 megawatts of direct current - MWDC) blocks. Table 3 outlines the
high-level plant characteristics for this potential array.
Table 3: Solar plant characteristics
Characteristic Value
Characteristic         Value
Plant Capacity (AC)    8MW

A high-level representation of a potential site configuration is shown in
Figure 1. Figure 1 depicts the manner in which an 8 MWAC capacity plant might
be laid out on these 40 acres, but detailed design will need to confirm this
configuration.

Figure 1: Solar PV plant conceptual site layout
3.1.3.   Economic Analysis
3.1.3.1.   PV System Components
Solar PV power plants are simple in their operation. The main components of a
solar PV plant include PV Modules, racking, inverters, transformers, combiner
boxes, DC cabling and AC cabling. The modules convert the solar irradiance to
DC power. A collection of modules are electrically wired together to form what
is referred to as a "string." Multiple strings are combined together into a
single DC output in a combiner box. All outputs from the combiner boxes in a
block are run to a central skid where they are connected to the inverter. The
inverter converts the DC module power into AC power and feeds the AC output
through a medium-voltage (MV) transformer. This transformer steps-up the
inverter voltage to the solar arrays main collection system voltage. The
inverters and medium-voltage transformers are often co-located on a platform
referred to as the power conversation station, sometimes referred to as a skid.
If a site has a local substation, then all the outputs from the skids feed into
the substation where a generator step-up unit outputs the main interconnection
voltage.
Racking is an integral part of any solar plant as it provides the support for
the modules. In addition to proving a fixed point to which the modules are
attached, racking serves as the means to optimize the angle between module
surfaces and the solar irradiance. This angle has significant impacts on a
solar plant's energy production. There are two main classes of racking systems,
tracking and fixed-tilt, the latter of which was used in this layout.
3.1.3.2.   Capital and Operations and Maintenance Costs
The upfront capital construction costs are incurred during the development and
construction of the plant. These costs include material costs, installation
costs, contractor markup, and project indirect costs. The capital costs are
impacted by relative system size (larger systems have the benefit of economies
of scale), project location, and a collection of market factors. Project
capital costs are commonly presented as a cost per installed watt basis ($/W).
This allows for project costs to be expressed independently of system size and
provides for an easy comparison of costs for systems with difference
characteristics. In addition to the cost of the solar PV array, the existing
Primer Tracer site will need to have the existing infrastructure removed and
the site will need to be redeveloped, before the project can be constructed.
The land acquisition is expected to occur through a public benefit sale from
the U.S. Government if the County acquired the property. If the MNARNG took
possession it would be included in their license and remain in the ownership of
the U.S. Government. The cost of the land acquisition is anticipated to be $0
due to the nature of the site and the proposed usage. It is assumed that there
will be no property taxes levied against the properties as the land owner will
be a government entity. The estimated cost to remove the existing
infrastructure and redevelop the 40 acres selected for the solar PV plant
project is $1,250,000. For this analysis, the cost has been assumed to be
incurred by the project; however other sources of funding may be available.
Operation and maintenance (O&M) costs are incurred on an annual basis and are
the costs associated with keeping the plant in proper working order. Common
tasks associated with annual O&M activities include preventative maintenance,
inspection, and corrective maintenance. O&M costs are often presented as a cost
per installed kilo-Watt ($/kW) to be incurred every year. When presented as a
$/kW cost, it is assumed that this cost will be incurred annually.
Table 4 provides an approximation of capital costs and O&M costs for the
proposed 8MWac system.

Solar PV Costs             $/W                    Total

Site Redevelopment Cost    $0.12/ WDC; $0.13/ WAC $1,250,000
Total Project Capital Cost $2.22/WDC; $2.86/WAC   $23,100,000
                                                 
O&M Cost                   $16/kWAC/year          $128,000/year
 
3.1.4.   Solar Resource Assessment and Energy Production
The annual energy production for the proposed array can be estimated with the
use of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) Solar Advisor Model
(SAM). SAM uses a collection of input parameters to construct a model of the PV
plant and analyze the energy production characteristics. These input parameters
include: site location and meteorological data, module characteristics,
inverter performance characteristics, solar array dimensions, system losses,
and a collection of financial parameters. Using this information, SAM
constructs a model of the solar arrays and then predicts plant performance over
a typical meteorological year. The basic technical assumptions that were
utilized to estimate the solar resource assessment and annual energy production
from the solar array are provided in Table 5.

3.1.5.   Financial Assumptions and Economics
SAM was used to estimate the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and estimated
price for the energy from the proposed solar plant project. The project is
assumed to be financed by a developer who would be paid through subscriptions
by consumers where the third party (a tax-paying entity) owns the solar plant
on land leased from the County. Subscriptions with Xcel Energy retail customers
are assumed to be established under the Xcel Energy Solar*Rewards® Community®
solar program. The developer would utilize the federal investment tax credit,
accelerated depreciation, and a combination of debt and equity to fund the
solar project. The key financial assumptions are provided in Table 6. If Xcel
Energy were to own the project, these financial projections would likely need
to be modified.

Based upon an assumed IRR of 10% for the project developer and other noted
assumptions, the Project Team estimated a subscription price for the solar
energy of $0.129 cents/kWh (as shown in Table 7). Xcel Energy retail customers
who subscribe to production from the proposed solar garden under individual
subscriptions would receive a bill credit equal to the energy purchased
multiplied by the retail rates.

3.1.6.   Greenhouse Gas Emission Reductions
Implementing a solar PV array in the Primer Tracer area will result in a
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Electricity offset by the solar output
would be reduced to zero tons of CO2 per year. The estimated greenhouse gas
emission reduction is estimated to be 7,524 tons CO2/year, calculated by
comparing the current Xcel Energy emission rates for the production of
electricity in the Upper Midwest Region (1,041 CO2 lbs/MWh4) as detailed in
Table 8.

3.1.7.   Community Solar Garden Program Approach
The modeled subscription rate for solar PV assumes that solar garden developers
would elect to sell the Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) to Xcel Energy, for
subscribers to receive a $0.02/kWh enhanced bill credit. If the developer were
to retain the RECs for this system, the bill credit would decrease by 2 cents/
kWh. The estimated subscription rate is slightly less than the current Xcel
Energy average Residential and General Service bill credits; however that
difference will increase over time if Xcel Energy applicable retail rates
increase and the subscription rate remains fixed. Table 9 shows how this
estimated first year subscription price for the electricity generated by the
solar garden compares to the Xcel Energy bill credit rates for three types of
Xcel Energy customers. It is assumed that the economic benefits of the solar
garden subscription would improve as the electricity rate increases over the
life of the subscription.

For the solar PV project to be developed under the Xcel Energy Solar*Rewards®
Community® solar program, it will be important for the developer to have
several large credit-worthy subscribers secured to allow the project to be
financed at a low cost of debt. This could include the City of Arden Hills,
Ramsey County, the MNARNG, and other credit-worthy businesses in the area. Once
the project has secured a large portion of the revenue stream from project
subscribers, the project can be financed and developed with the potential for
future residents and businesses to join as subscribers in the future. \ process
for developing and preparing the necessary applications for the project will
need to follow the guidelines outlined in the Xcel Energy Solar*Rewards®
Community® solar program5.

3.1.8.   Next Steps
In order to capture the 30% Investment Tax Credit associated with community
solar gardens, the proposed system must be in service by December 31, 2016. As
such, implementation of this strategy must commence as soon as possible, and
the following steps should be taken to continue development:
Step 1 - Begin the land redevelopment process and secure funding approval. The
County and the MNARNG, as potential property owners, will play key roles in
this process, as a potential property owner.
Step 2 - Secure a development partner to move the project through necessary
stages of development. This could be either Xcel Energy or another solar
developer, who could be selected by issuing an RFP for prospective developers.
Step 3 - The solar garden developer will need to obtain letters of commitment
from large solar garden subscribers to initiate the necessary business and
financing structure. The County, City, JDA, MNARNG, the school district, and
other partners could work with the selected developer to form an initial
coalition of subscribers for the system.
3.2.   Combined Heat and Power
3.2.1.   Introduction
The vision for TCAAP is that the Thumb, Town Center, and Flex areas could be
served by a CHP energy system located at the TCAAP site or nearby. This
localized energy source would enable achievement of many of the guiding
principles established by the ERAB. The MNARNG has a similar energy vision for
the AHATS site, and the partnership potential for a CHP system is very
attractive. The Project Team recommends that the JDA and County collaborate
with the MNARNG and Xcel Energy to define a preferred initial CHP strategy,
considering the following:
   •   Collaboration between the JDA, the County, Xcel Energy, and the MNARNG
could help identify an operational strategy and location for the initial CHP
that is beneficial for all parties.
   •   Incorporation of a CHP system that meets the energy needs of all three
sites would improve the economic competitiveness of CHP, due to the potential
diversity of usage and load profiles.
   •   Due to regulatory statutes, Xcel Energy has the exclusive authority to
distribute and sell electricity across multiple properties in Arden Hills. If
Xcel Energy is the owner, the CHP system could function as a microgrid system
for the area, providing a local energy source for reliable electric and thermal
energy for TCAAP, RCPW, and the MNARNG in the event of a grid disruption,
meeting the goals of each of the sites.
   •   In the event that Xcel Energy is not the owner of the CHP, the proposed
system may only distribute thermal energy across property lines, unless the
electricity is sold to the Midwest Independent System Operators (MISO), in
which case there would be an additional cost for the use of Xcel's
infrastructure, which may prove to be cost prohibitive depending on the
production cost and market dynamics.
While construction of independent CHP systems on both the TCAAP and AHATS sites
could potentially be feasible, the economics of a connected system would be
much more beneficial to both sites.
However, the current uncertainty regarding the timing and type of TCAAP
development restricts the opportunity to perform a complete evaluation of a CHP
and district energy system for TCAAP at this time. With the unknown development
conditions of TCAAP in mind, the Project Team has evaluated a scenario for CHP
implementation in the Thumb and Town areas of TCAAP based on the assumed energy
loads and envisioning how a CHP system could be implemented in the Thumb.
3.2.2.   Initial Proposed CHP
An initial step toward a more comprehensive microgrid could be a small-scale
CHP system that serves the existing loads of the Thumb and Town areas, as shown
in Figure 3. The initial CHP plant could be located within the corporate campus
area of the Thumb, which would provide the advantage of reducing the up-front
capital cost for the installation of the distribution network providing thermal
energy to the corporate campus and the Town. The CHP plant could be designed to
allow for the integration of multiple fuel sources in the future to further
increase renewable generation and system sustainability. Additionally, the CHP
plant and district heating network, as proposed, could be designed to allow for
expansion to serve additional buildings.

Figure 3: Initial potential CHP location and distribution plan north TCAAP
As TCAAP development progresses southward, those additional properties could
also be served from the CHP facility in the Thumb by extending piping to those
buildings in the Spine Road right of way, and expanding the capacity of the
CHP.
In the next stage of CHP development, the design team should carefully analyze
the pros and cons of the CHP application, and work with the JDA, County, and
potential Thumb developers to determine the optimal location and operational
strategy for the initial CHP system. Regardless of the system's initial
configuration and location, the CHP design should allow for expansion to
produce more electricity and thermal energy as energy demand in the area
increases with TCAAP development. Expansion could also enable the development
of a more comprehensive microgrid that would meet the MNARNG's resiliency goals
and the TCAAP energy vision.
3.2.3.   Development Strategy
3.2.3.1.   Load Analysis
Before selecting the appropriate technology and size for a proposed CHP plant,
a careful review of the potential electric and thermal loads must be
considered. The proposed CHP project would be developed to serve the future
electrical load of the Thumb area as well as the combined thermal loads of the
Thumb and the adjacent Town area. A summary of the potential thermal and
electric loads that the initial plant could serve is shown in Table 10.
Table 10: Monthly Projected Energy Usage
 
     Annual Energy Usage Annual Electrical Peak Energy Usage Peak Electrical
                          Usage                               Usage
Town  12,485 MMBtu        2,561,111 kWh     4.06 MMBtu/hr     0.41 MW
Thumb 6,096 MMBtu         4,172,302 kWh     3.33 MMBtu/hr     1.19 MW
 
The monthly aggregated load profiles are presented in Figure 4 and Figure 5.
The Project Team assumed that the load profile for these areas would follow
normal patterns of use for commercial buildings.

Figure 5: Monthly total site electric usage
3.2.3.2.   CHP Technology Selection
Based on a review of the future electric load of the Thumb area and the thermal
loads of the Town and Thumb areas, the CHP plant should have a maximum
generator output no greater than 450 kW. For CHP applications in this size
range, the most efficient and economical technology employed is gas fired
reciprocating engines, with hot water heat recovery. Additionally, due to the
limited heating load available during the summer months, it is generally more
economical to employ a generation technology that has a high simple cycle
efficiency resulting in a production cost lower than the utility's retail
electric rate.
For the proposed initial CHP, the Project Team assumed that a gas- fired
reciprocating engine genset could provide 335 kW of electric power year round
with approximately 1,372 MMBtu/hr of waste heat that would be available
throughout the year. The waste heat would be utilized to offset hot water
production in the existing buildings' boilers during the winter, spring, and
fall. The waste heat from the CHP during the summer months would be exhausted
and the plant would run in simple cycle mode at a production cost lower than
the cost of purchased grid power. In the event that a year-round process
heating load is added in the Thumb, additional thermal energy could be captured
from the CHP and utilized, improving system economics, efficiencies, and
environmental benefits. Figure 6 and Figure 7 provide a representative monthly
dispatch chart showing how the plant would provide power and thermal energy to
the site.

additional thermal energy could be captured from the CHP and utilized,

3.2.3.3.   CHP Plant System Components
One new packaged cogeneration unit could meet the energy needs presented above.
Waste heat from the engine cooling water loop and engine exhaust would be
recovered to produce 1,372 MMBtu/hr of hot water at full-load. The hot water
would be delivered to a hot water distribution system to provide heating energy
to the Thumb and Town. The engine cooling water loop would produce 180-185
degree hot water, which would be used to provide the necessary thermal energy
for heating the buildings and heating domestic hot water. A supplementary
radiator located atop the CHP unit would remove heat from the engine cooling
water loop when there is no need for building heating during the summer months.
In addition to the CHP plant, new hot water distribution piping and pumping
would need to be installed to provide hot water supply and return to the
connected buildings from the CHP plant. This distribution piping is assumed to
be direct buried and would be routed as efficiently as possible to each of the
buildings' central mechanical rooms. The district heating building interface,
based on initial site investigations, could be achieved through a direct
connect interface allowing for a low-cost installation at each building. The
distribution configurations shown in Figure 8 are possible layouts for the
initial system, but the actual location of the plant and routing of the pipe
will need to be determined in the next stage of system development.
The full-load electric output of the genset is proposed to be 335kW at 480V.
The genset power is assumed to be electrically interconnected to provide power
to the future facility located at the Thumb, with standby and supplemental
service provided by the electrical grid. The power from the CHP plant would be
delivered to each of the Thumb buildings behind the meter and would offset
retail electric purchases from Xcel Energy at the existing retail rate. For the
economic evaluation, it was assumed the genset would be operated at full-load
with an availability of 95%. A conceptual process diagram of the proposed CHP
plant is provided in Figure 8.

Figure 8: CHP project conceptual process diagram
The thermal needs of the Town are assumed to be met by the CHP system through
the thermal energy distribution system. For the purposes of the economic model,
the Project Team has assumed that Xcel Energy will not own the CHP facility and
the Town will receive electricity from the electric grid. If Xcel Energy were
the owner of the CHP, the initial plant size could be increased to also meet
the electric needs of the Town, as well as the surrounding TCAAP developments.
3.2.4.   Economic Analysis
3.2.4.1.   CHP Plant System Capital and O&M Costs
Estimated costs for the CHP plant were developed based on major equipment
budgetary pricing and a conceptual distribution system layout. The initial CHP
project primarily consists of the CHP plant, the distribution piping connecting
the buildings, and the electric infrastructure required to connect the output
from the engine generator into the Thumb buildings. For the analysis, the
Project Team has assumed that the CHP plant will be located within the Thumb to
minimize the cost of electrical distribution to the corporate campus. A summary
of the costs are provided in Table 11.

The O&M cost difference associated with the proposed CHP project would consist
of a long-term service agreement for the gas fired engine. Service contracts
for small gas engines can be structured on an hourly basis or annual fixed fee
basis. The annual O&M cost assumed for the project is $0.02/kWh which equals
$56,000 per year.
3.2.4.2.   Financial Assumptions and Economics
CHP facilities provide energy savings greater than the traditional scenario of
purchasing power from the local electric utility and generating thermal energy
on-site with gas-fired or oil-fired boilers. The annual life cycle costs of the
traditional scenario were compared to that of the proposed CHP plant to
determine the overall savings provided by the project. At this stage in the
development process, the ultimate owner of the project is yet to be determined
and the capital financing structure and funding source is unknown. For the
purposes of the assessment, the project was assumed to be structured as a
private, non-profit, funded with a cost of capital of 4.7%, financed over 25
years, with the annual debt service paid through energy sales revenues. The
basic economic assumptions for the project are provided in Table 12.
 
CHP facilities provide energy savings over the traditional scenario of
purchasing power from the local electric utility and generating thermal energy

3.2.4.3.   Interpretation of the economic analysis
The economics of the CHP system are tied to the energy loads connected to the
system. As shown in Table 13, the annual costs of the initial proposed CHP
operations are significantly reduced from the traditional scenario. The primary
factor contributing to the 25-year cost of the CHP is the capital cost for the
initial construction of the system. If additional energy load was connected to
the initial system, the debt service payments could be spread out across more
energy consumers, and energy rates could be decreased. In order to optimize the
economic return of a CHP system, the remaining capacity of its thermal energy
output (approximately 1 MMBtu/hr) could be utilized. If the thermal demand of
TCAAP development included higher continuous loads (light manufacturing
processes, restaurants, domestic hot water, etc.), the 25-year savings could be
increased by an estimated $900,000.
Additionally, the economic analysis did not take into account any rebates,
grants, or savings for which the project could be eligible. These potential
funding sources could be used to offset the cost of the initial construction,
thus making the initial CHP system more economically attractive. The list of
potential funding sources is provided in Exhibit IV.
3.2.5.   Greenhouse Gas Reduction
One of the advantages of a CHP system is the reduction of greenhouse gas
emissions due to the higher efficiency of the CHP system. Implementation of a
CHP system to meet the energy loads in Section 3.2.2.1 could reduce carbon
dioxide emissions by approximately 20%, as shown in Table 14.

The greenhouse gas emission savings presented in Table 14 are based upon a CHP
operational strategy of meeting the Thumb's electrical needs from a gas-fired
generator. In the event that other renewable energy sources are included in the
CHP solution, the greenhouse gas emission reductions would increase.
3.2.6.   Developing a Microgrid for the Area
While an initial CHP approach might be focused on the current campuses of the
Thumb and the Town, the energy vision adopted by the ERAB includes developing a
resilient energy system for the greater community, including the remainder
TCAAP and the adjacent properties. The initial CHP plant is one implementable
opportunity. However, to achieve the TCAAP energy vision, it will be important
for the partner organizations to develop a plan to expand the scope of the CHP
plant and develop a microgrid for the broader area as TCAAP development
proceeds.
3.2.7.   Suggested Next Steps
As part of the Thumb development, the County and JDA could develop a CHP
strategy for the developer selection process, so that the CHP project, electric
distribution, and thermal distribution systems designs can be integrated into
the development plans. Several of the initial activities that will need to
occur prior to the RFP are listed below:
   •   The ownership and initial project funding strategy for CHP will need to
be established to allow initial project development activities to commence. An
agreement will need to be developed to establish the initial energy system
concept and conduct additional due diligence on the technical, business, and
regulatory issues that are associated with the project. The JDA should work
with Xcel Energy to define Xcel Energy's interest in owning the proposed CHP.
Xcel Energy ownership will provide the benefit of increasing the plant size and
system efficiency as electric and thermal demand grows.
   •   If Xcel Energy is interested in owning a CHP system, the JDA should
collaborate with Xcel Energy to develop an initial CHP plant that could serve
as the foundation of a broader microgrid strategy for TCAAP, AHATS, and the
community. If Xcel Energy is not an owner of the CHP, the initial electric
output could be sized to meet the needs of the Thumb, with thermal energy
distributed to the other sites. Additional electric output could be added on
other sites and integrated into a district energy system as the energy needs of
the future buildings are defined, or the CHP electrical output could be
increased if the developer secured a power-purchase agreement with Xcel Energy.
   •   The JDA should integrate and reserve space within easements and right of
way for the future construction of district energy distribution facilities
during the platting of the development and the design of the Spine Road.
   •   During site marketing, the JDA should emphasize the benefits and
opportunities presented by the incorporation of CHP into the Thumb development,
and could pursue businesses that have coincidental thermal and electric energy
needs. Additionally, prioritizing site marketing to companies with additional
process or domestic hot water load would optimize the efficiency of the CHP
system.
3.3.   Low-Temperature District Energy System
3.3.1.   Introduction
The residential neighborhoods of TCAAP present a unique and highly visible
opportunity to leverage low-grade energy from the treated groundwater as an
energy supply for the neighborhoods, distributed via a low-temperature district
energy system. The proposed system would utilize thermal energy from the TCAAP
Groundwater Treatment station described in section 1.5.4 by transferring energy
from the groundwater to the district energy system. The groundwater, which is
consistently ~52°, can be used to transfer energy to and from the closed-loop
distribution system to meet heating and cooling demand in the buildings, while
not affecting the quality of the treated groundwater. The pumped groundwater is
estimated to have 9.8 MMBtu of energy available. The Hill and Creek
neighborhoods are projected to demand 68% of this energy. Thus, an additional
3.1 MMBtu could be available for utilization in other areas of TCAAP or AHATS.
3.3.2.   System Description
The proposed energy system would require an energy transfer station to be
constructed at, or near, the current pumping location for the groundwater
treatment station. This energy transfer station would consist of a heat
exchanger to separate the groundwater from the system water, pumps to circulate
the distribution loop, controls, metering, and piping.
The existing building that houses the groundwater treatment station was
originally the domestic water treatment plant for the TCAAP site during the
ammunitions manufacturing period. This building was decommissioned, as the
groundwater treatment system is housed in a building addition, and is now
largely vacant. The facility is more than adequate to house the proposed energy
transfer station. The building is owned by the Army, and will remain in the
custody of the Army until the groundwater treatment operations cease. Given
these conditions, there would need to be an agreement between the district
energy district energy business and the Army for the use of this building.
As noted in Section 1.5.3, the operations of the groundwater treatment system
are anticipated to continue for a minimum of 30 years. By the end of this
period, an alternative energy source may need to be identified should the
groundwater pumping be discontinued or unavailable for energy transfer. At that
stage, there would be multiple technologies that could be incorporated:
   •   A separate field of geothermal heat exchange wells could be constructed
in the vicinity of the energy transfer station.
   •   Construction of a solar thermal garden in the vicinity of the energy
transfer station.
   •   Installation of a commercial size heat pump at the energy transfer
station.
   •   Future technologies that are currently unavailable in the market.
The proposed distribution system would consist of two pipes, supply and return,
spanning from the energy transfer station to the homes. To prevent the pipes
from freezing, and to efficiently transfer the energy, these pipes can be
insulated and buried at shallow depths, or uninsulated, and buried at greater
depths. To keep the initial construction costs of the distribution system to a
minimum, the proposed district energy business could construct the distribution
system and service extensions to the homes, in coordination with site
development.

Figure 9: Distributed ground source heat pump schematic
A set of two pipes would span between each home and the distribution system,
one delivering water to the home and one returning water to the distribution
system. Each home would be equipped with a water source heat pump unit, powered
by electricity. This would replace the need for traditional forced-air furnaces
and electrically-driven air-conditioners. During the winter months, the heat
pump would take heat from the distribution system water and use it to heat the
air inside the home.
Conversely, during the summer months, the heat pump will take heat from inside
the home and reject it to the distribution system, which is how the home is
cooled. Figure 10 shows how home heat pump systems operate inside the homes.

3.3.3.   Greenhouse Gas Reduction
One important advantage of a low-temperature district energy system is the
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse
gas emission that is monitored and measured for the heating and cooling of
buildings. The carbon dioxide emission rates used to calculate the savings of
the low-temperature district energy system are included in Table 15.
Table 15: Carbon dioxide emission rates
 
Carbon Dioxide Emission Rates
Natural Gas1              117 CO2 lb/MMBtu
EPA MROW Emission Factor2 1,536 CO2 lb/MWh

2.   http://www.epa.gov/climateleadership/documents/emission-factors.pdf
When comparing emission rates between traditional HVAC systems and the proposed
low- temperature district energy system in the Hill and Creek neighborhoods,
carbon dioxide emissions are reduced by almost 30%. The comparison of the
estimated greenhouse gas emissions is shown in Table 16.

This calculation does not take into account the opportunities for carbon-
neutral electricity production that would be available to the TCAAP
development. These calculations use the base emissions rate from the electric
grid, published by Xcel Energy for the Upper Midwest service territory. As the
local electricity sources become less dependent on the primary grid, through
implementation of community solar gardens or other technologies, the carbon
dioxide emissions could be further reduced.
3.3.4.   Financial Analysis
The initial cost of the low-temperature district energy system was estimated
based on the Project Team's historical data for installation of piping and
equipment. The pumping station, heat pumps, furnaces, and air conditioning
units were estimated based on major equipment budgetary pricing that is readily
available from manufacturers. The distribution piping was estimated based on
historical data for similar material installations in Minnesota. The low-
temperature of the water allows for flexibility of the piping system
construction. The Project Team evaluated the material costs for a number of
materials and based the estimate on a high-density polyethylene piping system,
due to the material cost and ease of installation. A summary of the initial
capital costs are provided in Table 17.

Total                  $6,493,250 Total                      $2,733,192
 
For the economic analysis, the Project Team assumed that the district energy
facilities at the energy transfer station and the distribution piping would not
be paid for by the TCAAP developer. Typically, the district energy entity pays
for the production and distribution facilities. The Project Team did assume
that the developer would pay for the procurement and installation of the heat
pumps, and hot water heaters in the homes. The Project Team also assumed that
the developer would pass the minimal additional cost of the heat pump
installation on to the homeowner through an increased mortgage amount, and
would be able to use the eco-friendly aspects of the system as a selling point.
The analysis was completed for straight costs, and did not include any rebates
or tax credits that may be applicable for these energy efficient homes. A
summary of the initial costs to be paid by the developer is shown in Table 18.

Using the energy usage estimates prepared as part of this study, the Project
Team estimated the annual cost of providing heating and cooling to the areas
homes under a traditional scenario (independent high efficiency furnaces and AC
units) and under a low-temperature district energy scenario (energy transfer
station, distribution system, heat pump HVAC units). The life cycle cost
analysis for the low-temperature district energy system, including the costs
covered by the developer, was compared to the traditional scenario. The 30-year
costs include systems operation, maintenance, and equipment replacement, but do
not account for any profit for the district energy business. This analysis is
summarized in Table 21.

As shown, the district system is lower in cost over the-30 year period than a
traditional gas-fired furnace and electric A/C unit; however, it is assumed
that the benefits beyond the 30-year initial agreement would be significantly
greater as the debt payment for the initial system construction is completed.
Lastly, to validate that this system is the optimal means of capturing ground-
source energy, the Project Team compared the life-cycle cost for the low-
temperature district energy system to a scenario where homeowners would install
independent geothermal systems that would serve each home. In this comparison,
both homes would have heat pumps to meet their comfort needs. Because this
would add initial cost to the developer, it was assumed that the developer
would pass this cost along to the home owner in the form of a premium added to
the mortgage amount. This analysis is summarized in Table 22.

2.   Estimate provided by S&B Geothermal, $2,400/well, assumed four wells.
Independent geothermal systems could be built for the residents in TCAAP, and
would be less costly than the district energy system capturing energy from the
treated groundwater. However, the relatively small gains in cost over 30 years
would be offset by the volatility of natural gas markets, inconvenience of
maintaining independent systems in each home, the initial cost of the systems,
and the future flexibility provided by installing district energy
infrastructure.
3.3.5.   Potential Savings Opportunities
Under the assumptions provided in this Framework, the implementation of a low-
temperature district energy system that utilizes energy from the treated
groundwater appears to be technically and financially implementable. The
economic benefits of this system could be improved by realizing one or more of
the following cost reduction opportunities.
   •   The distribution piping is the single largest cost for the
implementation of the low- temperature system. The primary opportunity to
reduce this cost is through coordinating the distribution piping construction
with the construction of the public utilities. This coordinated construction
has been assumed in the financial model.
   Additional savings could be realized if the piping were installed in a joint
trench with the water main, meaning that the distribution piping and water main
would be constructed at the same depth and in the same trench. This would
eliminate the need for a second trench excavation for the distribution piping,
and would only require a marginal increase in the size of the excavation of the
water main trench.
   •   Xcel Energy could partner with the County, JDA, and the City to further
evaluate and promote a neighborhood development that does not utilize natural
gas. This promotion would include providing technical assistance, contributing
electric vehicle charging stations, or promoting the efficiency and low-carbon
possibilities of the neighborhood.
   •   Energy efficiency savings related to micro-hydro, community solar garden
subscription, or other renewable electric generation were not included in the
model for the energy transfer station or customer properties. Utilization of
these technologies could improve the payback time for the system.
Equipment rebates and tax credits were not included into the model, though Xcel
Energy offers rebates on high efficiency equipment and variable frequency
drives, for which the energy transfer station will be eligible. Xcel Energy
also has a number of other energy conservation programs that could be leveraged
to offset initial capital costs of the system. None of these rebates were
assumed in the current model.
•   The Federal Government offers a 30% tax credit to home owners who install a
groundwater heat pump that is applicable from the date of occupancy by the
homeowner for new homes. However, this tax credit is only applicable if the
home is used as a residence by the taxpayer, and is scheduled to end on
December 31, 2016.6 The inherent ambiguity regarding construction date and
owner usage, the Project Team has not included this tax credit in the model.

3.3.6.   Implementation Planning and Suggested Next Steps
Implementing a low-temperature district energy system in the residential
neighborhoods of TCAAP can deliver several benefits to the site and
stakeholders, including the following.
   •   An energy system that is more energy efficient than traditional heating
and cooling systems.
   •   Reduced fossil fuel usage and greenhouse gas emissions.
   •   Competitive, stable costs of energy for homeowners.
   •   Xcel Energy could avoid gas pipe distribution infrastructure costs in
the neighborhoods, saving rate payers money.
   •   Installation of a flexible infrastructure network in the neighborhoods
will allow for easier integration of future energy sources or technology
advancements as they become available.
   •   Implementation of this system would establish the TCAAP approach to
sustainable neighborhoods as a national model for energy efficiency and
innovative site development.
For the proposed system to be successfully implemented, it would need to be
constructed as the first homes are being built, so that service can be provided
from the outset of development. To optimize the economic benefits of the
system, every home in the selected neighborhoods should be constructed with a
heat pump HVAC system and be connected to the proposed system. This would
provide the most financeable, cost-effective implementation plan, and also
maximize energy efficiency for TCAAP.
Implementing the low-temperature district energy system requires several areas
of focus, including the following next steps.
3.3.6.1.   Develop the System Business Plan
Before beginning the implementation of the proposed system, a business will
need to be formed to facilitate the distribution of energy to the customers it
will serve. As part of determining the ownership structure, a business plan
should be developed to resolve a number of organizational preferences for the
business. Resolving these items will be important to help guide development of
the proposed system. Among those preferences, the following should be
determined:
   •   The mission of the organization
   •   The organizational structure
   •   Governance of the business
   •   The energy sales rate structure
   •   The system financing strategy
   •   The expected structure of energy service agreements with customers
   •   The engineering strategy
   •   The construction contracting strategy
   •   The system operational strategy
   •   The system management strategy
   •   The energy transfer station location strategy
   •   Permitting and regulatory strategy
   •   Developer outreach and education strategy
   •   Easement and franchise agreement strategy, needs, or restrictions
The City, County and JDA should resolve these items prior to commencing with
the site development RFP process. While all of the items listed above are
important for development, the following items will likely require the most
attention.
Forming the Business
Unless Ramsey County or Arden Hills is the owner of the low-temperature
district energy system, an ownership entity should be developed, based upon the
system mission. The ownership entity will handle the system operations,
maintenance, and billings. The business could be best served by one of the
following structures: Municipally Owned, Private Non-Profit, Private For-
Profit, or a Hybrid Publically-Owned Infrastructure/Private Non-Profit Company.
Each structure has inherent benefits and detriments, which will need to be
evaluated as the business structure is determined.
The private, non-profit model operational structure is the business structure
that was assumed in the financial analysis. This business structure operates
under the governance of local stakeholders and customers. This type of business
model has several advantages, the most prominent being that the rates would be
cost-based, meaning that the rates would cover the cost of operating the system
and debt service, without mark-ups for profit or return on investment.
Developer Outreach and Education
A critical aspect of this system is that each home in the system service area
should be connected to the system. This will require developers to install heat
pump units in each home, instead of traditional forced air furnaces and air
conditioner units. The developers should be properly educated on this
opportunity and this direction should be clearly stated in the RFP language, so
that the developers can understand and implement the strategy from the onset.
Reach Agreement with U.S. Army for use of Existing Building and Treated
Groundwater
The ownership entity will need to negotiate with the Army for the use of energy
from the treated groundwater and the existing building to which the groundwater
treatment station is attached. This agreement will, at a minimum, need to
provide for access to and operation of the energy transfer station equipment.
Ideally, an agreement would include ownership transfer of the building and
groundwater pumping system at the termination of the groundwater treatment
operations, so that the heat pump loop can continue to meet the heating and
cooling needs of the development.
System Financing
Depending upon the preferred ownership structure, the financing strategy for
the system could be very different. If the system is publicly owned, it could
be financed through the public institution or in private markets. If a private,
non-profit, the system could be 100% debt-financed based upon long-
term agreements with homeowners. Under this scenario, the phasing of housing
development may require City or County backing of the debt as not all homes
will be occupied when the system begins operation.
4.   Energy Efficiency Strategies (Demand Side Management)
Given the pressing timeline of near-term infrastructure investments, much of
the Framework is focused on energy supply options for TCAAP and the Arden Hills
community. However, implementation of improved building energy efficiency will
be necessary to achieve the community's low-carbon, resiliency goals. The
following are the leading opportunities for near-term, low energy use
development at the site. Unlike many next steps for energy supply and
infrastructure, the demand-side initiatives will strongly depend on engaging
developers who can help implement the TCAAP energy vision. These
recommendations make use of the truly unique opportunities at TCAAP, which
include:
   •   Availability of a local, renewable ground heat energy source via the
site remediation process.
   •   Advantages of both greenfield development and large scale deployment to
optimize economies of scale.
   •   Focus on replicable designs and technologies to simplify developer
implementation.
   •   Emphasis on actual building performance, beyond prescriptive design
requirements.
   •   Important strategic partnerships with Xcel Energy and the Center for
Sustainable Building Research at the University of Minnesota.
4.1.   Energy Resilient Design and Construction
To meet the energy resilience goals for TCAAP, building design verification and
benchmarking will be needed on an ongoing basis. As development moves forward
it is recommended that the County, the JDA, City Staff, and development
consultants utilize the following building standards, technical resources,
planning tactics, and proposal criteria to attract and streamline energy
efficient development.
4.1.1.   Meeting SB 2030 Guidelines
All commercial developments on the TCAAP site can be measured against the
requirements of Minnesota's Sustainable Buildings 2030 (SB 2030), a performance
based building energy standard developed to incrementally move new construction
to net zero energy design by 2030. The standing program is not only a standard
for design and construction, but an ongoing energy performance benchmarking
program and guideline. The standard is designed specifically for Minnesota's
climate, is administered by the Center for Sustainable Building Research
(CSBR), and is supported by both the State of Minnesota's Division of Energy
Resources and Xcel Energy.
SB 2030 has several advantages as a consistent site standard, as outlined in
the Policy White Paper. To recap:
   •   SB 2030 is designed and tailored for Minnesota buildings.
   •   SB 2030 is a performance based standard, providing guidance for the
design of energy efficient buildings beyond prescriptive requirements, giving
developers site-specific flexibility, however prescriptive guidelines are
available.
   •   It has building use based standards that cover all development types
applicable to TCAAP: commercial, multi-family, and detached residential.
As a comprehensive, performance-based energy standard, SB 2030 looks at all of
the systems in a building and how they collectively impact its efficiency.
Systems that are modeled or calculated under the standard are:
   •   Building Envelope
   •   Equipment Energy Efficiency
   •   Lighting Power Density & Controls
   •   Domestic Hot Water
   •   Mechanical Systems
   •   Use of Renewables
Resources & Benefits
   •   Xcel Energy's Energy Design Assistance Program is a free resource for
designers and developers to help meet some of the SB 2030 requirements and will
help developers navigate rebate opportunities. (Additional assistance is
available when design teams commit to designing at 30% more efficient than
typical design.)
   •   Xcel Energy's custom efficiency program allows large users to obtain
tailored, performance based efficiency assessments and rebates.
On average, SB 2030 will require commercial buildings to be 35 to 45% more
efficient than the new building code (IECC 2012). Table 23 outlines specific
efficiency improvements for a few building types relevant for TCAAP.7
7 For single-family homes and townhomes, SB 2030 will be more efficient than
the residential IECC 2012 code, but not to the extent of commercial building
requirements.
Table 23: SB 2030 (70% benchmark) Energy Efficiency Improvement over Code8

8 Analyzed by comparing improvements in ASHRAE 90.1 and applying the 70%
reduction compared to the 1989 baseline by building use type (CEE).
The key way to incentivize use of SB 2030 is to give preference to proposals
designing to these standards during the RFP review process (outlined below).
Development teams would have access to SB 2030 tools and case studies that
outline recommended cost-effective design approaches. During schematic design
and design development phases, the design team will set goals and targets for
the project with guidance from the SB 2030 team. When construction documents
are nearly complete, the SB 2030 team provides a full plan review with course
corrections and feedback to achieve the project targets. After construction,
the SB 2030 team will again work with project stakeholders to initiate the
energy benchmarking and tracking process. The cost to the developer/builder for
all of these program services is approximately $8,000 to $10,000 per commercial
site, a greater value than comparable certification programs that do not
provide review services.
Given the scale and visibility of TCAAP, there are potential adjustments that
can be made to streamline this process for developers.
   •   Targeted education and design guidelines that are site specific and
assist developers to quickly identify what major design features to focus on
for a specific site and building type.
   •   Potential cost buy-down for the upfront cost of the study and review
SB 2030 may face a challenge in that while it is relevant for Minnesota
buildings it does not yet have the market visibility of other national
standards such as LEED. Marketing of the TCAAP site could include a marketing
campaign around the benefits of SB 2030, to increase awareness, acceptance, and
a value reflection in the market. The County or City may also consider sharing
review costs with developers to help grow collaboration and buy-in.
4.3.   Leading Near-Term DSM Opportunities
4.3.1.   Low-Load Residential Development
Section 6.4.1.1 (p. 34-35) of the Policy White Paper outlined the concept of a
residential development featuring low-energy, all electric homes, fed by the
ground source heat for heating and cooling needs. A low-load home would not
require the larger heating and cooling capacity of traditional systems, but
instead could meet residents' comfort needs with smaller capacity systems. A
low-load home does not have to cost significantly more than a traditionally
built home, and can be valued more in the marketplace.9
9 Multiple recent housing market studies have shown that homebuyers are willing
to pay a 9-15% premium for homes that perform more efficiently. (CA Housing
Study 2012; NHBA Market Study 2013)
The Project Team estimates that low-load homes in Minnesota could obtain a
maximum combined space heating and cooling load of less than 10 Btu/hour/square
foot (conditioned floor area).10 The key technologies and strategies include
high levels of building insulation and passive solar design, a tight building
shell, and high efficiency appliances. These homes do not require significant
insulation like a passive house, but are 40% to 50% more efficient than what is
required by the new IECC 2012 code.
10 http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy14osti/60712.pdf
The primary opportunity for implementing low-load homes at TCAAP is the
integration of a low- temperature district energy system fed by the treated
groundwater on-site. This energy source could be implemented in homes in the
Creek, Hill and eastern Town residential developments, given their proximity to
the treated ground water. This opportunity deserves significant consideration
since the homes at TCAAP have the unique ability to tap the renewable resource
of the pumped ground water through a district energy system combined with in-
home water-to-air heat pumps.
Incorporation of high-performance technologies that have little to no impact on
the up-front costs, such as efficient appliances and low-flow plumbing, will
help minimize hot water use and help maximize home efficiency. The following is
a summary of the specific technologies and design elements that can be
considered for a low-load, all electric home at TCAAP:
   •   Insulation, air sealing, and passive solar design to reduce space
conditioning load to 10 Btu/hr/square foot
   •   Ground source heat pump technology (electric driven)
   •   High-efficiency appliances such as refrigerators, dishwashers, washer/
dryers (with additional consideration of low water use)
   •   Consideration of heat pump dryers
   •   Propane on localized natural gas stoves and grills
   •   Magnified benefit from rooftop PV electricity or purchase of community
solar shares Some marketing benefits of implementing these solutions include:
   •   Availability of high-tech, low maintenance equipment
   •   Cutting edge all-electric design
   •   True net-zero or net-zero ready potential
   •   Low-cost energy living
Low Load Home Performance Verification
Coordination between ground water system capacity and home design will be
necessary up-front and on an ongoing basis. This will provide developers and
users with the necessary assurance that the designed loads will be compatible
with the capacity of the system. Verification of home energy design and
performance can most easily be achieved by a third-party with design and
construction expertise. The County and JDA could specify building standards to
help homes reach these performance targets, such as SB 2030, which has
standards for single-family homes that could be personalized for TCAAP. This
program could be administered between utility energy-efficiency verification
programs like Energy Star for New Homes and coordination help from the City's
inspection division.
4.3.1.1.   Case Studies
Zero Carbon Residential Development | Bainbridge Island, Washington
Bainbridge Island is a mixed residential development of 24 single-family homes,
rental apartments, senior-living, and condos. Buildings were designed to meet
the criteria of a stringent building certification program, the Living Building
Challenge, and included "ultra-insulated" envelopes, high- efficiency
appliances, and an opt-in opportunity to buy or finance roof-top solar. Mini-
split heat pumps with energy recovery ventilators provide high-efficiency
heating. Additionally, all parking is underground and broader sustainability
innovations are woven in such as walkability, water conservation, and edible
landscapes. All of the single family homes sold out quickly and all home buyers
opted to install solar PV systems.
Low Load Housing Development | Townsend, Massachusetts
A premiere example of low-load homes being built at scale is the 35 single-
family houses on Coppersmith Way in Townsend, MA. These homes, each 1,700
square feet, were built to meet a strict efficiency standard with an additional
cost of approximately $8.40 per square foot (incorporating a $4,550
Massachusetts rebate).11 The resulting thermal load was served by two efficient
"mini-split" systems - one on each floor - and homes continue to be reported by
residents as a comfortable and responsive living environment.
11 Homes achieved a HERS score of 40. The exterior walls were built to R-46,
the basement walls were R-20, the attic was insulated to R- 63 and the under
basement slab was insulated with 2 inches of rigid foam with an R-value of 10.
Carbon Zero Residential Development | Issaquah, Washington
At a built cost of about $375,000 each, the 10 townhome development outside of
Seattle (started in 2008) sold out completely within the first year with
homebuyers showing a willingness to pay $20 to $40 more per square foot than
less efficient homes of similar size and location.12 The neighborhood, similar
to what is being proposed at TCAAP, successfully utilized a community-based
ground source system in combination with in-home heat pumps. The shared walls
between townhomes contributed to reduced heating loads that made it financially
viable. The builder/developer attests that the visible elements of the net zero
energy homes, such as the in-floor radiant heating, heat pump technology, roof-
top solar, and triple pane windows were key to the value that homebuyers saw.
The developer (Ichijo U.S.A.) continuous to build low-load homes and sees ROI
that makes sense in the market.
12 Conversation with Nick Neid, project manager with Ichijo USA, the developer
and builder (February 2015)
Ground Source Heat Pump Housing Development | Kennewick, Washington
SouthCliffe is a 400+ lot residential development in southeastern Washington
that is comprised of low- load homes serviced by a ground source water loop and
heat pumps, very similar to what is being proposed at TCAAP. Heating and hot
water needs of each home are both serviced by this combination of technologies.
The ground source water loop added approximately 5% to the cost of each lot,
but led to immediate monthly energy cost savings. Milo Bauder and Grant Young
were the developers of this project, and have worked with ThermLink in Duluth:
a pioneer in ground source installations and equipment.13
13 http://www.distinctiveprop.com/files/files/soiuthcliffepressrelease.pdf
4.3.2.   Building orientation and passive solar
 
Recommendation:
The process for solar oriented development should be described in residential
and commercial building RFPs and should be integrated as evaluation criteria
for development proposals. It should be evaluated based on lowest total energy
load of the homes or buildings to be sited under one proposal and should
consider street orientation, building orientation, and passive solar building
envelope design elements. As part of the platting process, the County could
plat the land and maximize building orientation prior to sale to developers.
 
The TCAAP Policy White Paper included the recommendations for the TCAAP
subdivision review process to assess the energy implications of street and
building orientation on solar heat gain and loss. Beyond the building envelope,
street orientation, lot and building orientation, and building massing, all
impact the thermal loads of homes and commercial buildings. By jointly
considering these variables prior to the subdivision process, planners and
developers have the opportunity to make tradeoff decisions while still
producing efficient results. Site orientation is potentially a no-cost way to
reduce building energy loads and improve daylighting when considered in site
planning.
In line with solar oriented design, homes should be designed and sited so that
the longest sides of a house face south and southern faces have the greatest
window area.14 This general window orientation is a proven strategy to reduce a
home's heating energy by approximately 4% and cooling costs by 2%, without
affecting any other parts of the design. Figure 11 shows the energy savings
achieved from southern window orientation, assuming that the largest exterior
walls are facing north and south, but without optimizing any other window
characteristics or the window to wall ratio on each side.
14 http://www.energy.ca.gov/title24/2013standards/prerulemaking/documents/
current/Reports/Residential/Water_Heating/
2013_CASE_R_Solar_Ready_Solar_Oriented_Developments_Sept_2011.pdf
Alone, window orientation results in moderate energy savings, but when paired
with improved window insulation, higher solar heat gain coefficients, and
optimum window to wall ratios, the heating energy savings will be 20% to 30%.15
Proper building and window orientation magnify the impact of the remaining
window decision. When aligned, homes with a well-insulated double or triple
pane windows and optimum window to wall ratios, annual energy cost savings for
homes in central Minnesota have been shown to be approximately $300 annually.

Figure 11: Thermal Load with Respect to House Orientation
The likely locations where street orientation could vary significantly to
accommodate energy implications would be the Creek, the Hill, and the
Transition neighborhood on the periphery of the Town. It is important to
remember that in order to utilize building orientation and passive solar at
TCAAP; two mutually dependent factors are required:
   •   Optimizing street orientation during the subdivision process
   •   Designing homes to take advantage of the passive solar resource
Optimizing orientation during the subdivision process would be appropriate to
solicit during the RFP process. These goals can be included as RFP evaluation
criteria.
4.3.3.   High efficiency commercial buildings
4.3.3.1.   Utilizing SB 2030
As shown in the White Paper, the primary energy loads for TCAAP are estimated
to be in the retail, commercial, and flex areas of the development. Thus DSM
energy conservation measures for these areas of the development will be
paramount for successful achievement of the Energy Vision.
However, until specific use types are more clearly defined during the RFP
process, specific commercial building efficiency strategies are challenging to
define. The Project Team recommends that the JDA establish the SB 2030 process
into the commercial development RFPs, as the SB 2030 process provides an
overarching framework for pursuing high commercial efficiency performance. The
process for how to use SB 2030 is described above.
4.3.4.   Sub-metering
Commercial and multi-family building sub-metering (Policy White Paper, p. 31)
is included as an important consideration because it is a relatively low
additional design cost when considered up front, but has the potential to help
maintain low energy use since tenants directly see and pay for their energy
use.
Sub-metering has been shown to save up to 21% in leased building spaces.16 The
material, software, and labor cost for each sub-meter point ranges from $5,000
to $7,500. Several metering companies provide sub-metering services by owning,
operating, and maintaining the meters. Monthly fees are based on the type of
service needed and the quantity of sub-meters served, but costs per sub-meter
range from $150 to $400.

4.3.4.1.   Case Study
Legrand North America | Better Building, Better Plants Challenge19
19 http://www4.eere.energy.gov/challenge/sites/default/files/uploaded-files/
submeter-guide.pdf
Legrand, an international provider of information networks, installed sub-
meters in its 14 largest manufacturing and assembly facilities in North
America.
   •   The Company had to achieve energy savings of 1.5% of total energy
consumption for the dashboard to pay for itself in just 1.5 years. Project ROI
was 83%.
   •   Actions enabled by sub-metering dropped the minimum (baseload) usage by
a factor of two.
   •   The systems empowered Lagrand to engage in conservation competition
across facilities, something that TCAAP businesses could do across the site.
Building sub-metering should be considered by architects and engineers at the
building design stage. While SB 2030 guidelines require minimum sub-metering,
additional sub-metering would offer business opportunities like those
capitalized on at Legrand properties. Once sub-meters are in place, ongoing
energy feedback program opportunities could also be pursued in coordination
with the electric utility.
4.3.6.   Co-location and strategic siting strategies
 
Recommendation:
Attract high energy use businesses and building types through RFP materials and
developer workshops, and help facilitate energy savings opportunities for these
projects through strategic siting.
One opportunity for energy supply alternatives that has been recommended in the
White Paper is the development of a district energy system, possibly fed from a
CHP plant. Planned siting and co-location can bring increased efficiency to a
district system or create opportunities for miniature district systems in areas
that are not connected (e.g. some of the Flex areas).
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/1cab317c3dcfb31fec07e701680c477011d1d9ed/
IMAGES/0-0-0-1918.png]
Figure 12: Building co-location examples
Because of the greenfield advantage, high energy use businesses and building
use types could be motivated to develop at TCAAP because of the future energy
cost savings. For those on the district system, they may be able to benefit
from the efficiency that they bring to the system through lower rates or even
bill credits when they decrease their return temperature.
For businesses that may not be in proximity to a future district energy system,
the County and JDA could facilitate building co-location. Certain project types
can be identified as potential candidates for co-location. Table 26 outlines
business and building types that are high users of hot water or have
concentrated periods of high electricity use. As proposals are reviewed, the
County and JDA should identify projects that are the same use as those listed
in Table 26. Such candidates could be grouped and referred to energy design
experts as to the specific energy benefits that could be achieved through co-
location. For example, a hotel development could be sited adjacent to a
laundromat to make their combined hot water load more even throughout the day
and surface the opportunities to share hot water heating and recovery
equipment.

Co-locating buildings does not require the sharing of exterior walls. The
proximity to one another may even render opportunities to create unique outdoor
employee or community spaces. The hot water or heat producers could sell their
excess to adjacent buildings that have use for it at different times of day.
Shared decentralized hot water storage units could even be used in some cases.
Businesses would be interested in this opportunity because it would improve the
efficiency of their consumption, reduce upfront capital equipment and
maintenance costs, and increase comfort.20

and Gas-fired heating (0.8/1.3=0.61) http://www.euroheat.org/Files/Filer/
documents/Publications/District%20Heating%20in%20buildings_final.pdf
Co-location opportunities will require coordination on the part of the JDA and
County, but communicating the interest to facilitate co-location upfront for
developers and business will make coordination easier. High energy use project
types may be motivated to propose a project at TCAAP if efforts are being make
to facilitate energy savings. Marketing materials and RFP language that
highlights appropriate co-location building use types can help attract these
projects.
4.3.7.   Streetlights
The City of Arden Hills has included a site-wide requirement for all
streetlights to be "high-efficiency lighting, such as LED lamps" in the TCAAP
Redevelopment Code. This requirement will trigger the inclusion of high
efficiency lights in the development process. Current LED technology saves
approximately 50% to 70% of lighting energy use. A significant cost savings
occurs by additionally reducing maintenance costs, given the longer life of the
bulbs. The City can work with Xcel Energy to utilize any future high efficiency
streetlight program offerings that support this effort in a manner that is
timely and commensurate with current development staging.
4.3.8.   Community participation and education
Community participation and education have been consistently mentioned as
important factors at TCAAP, both to engage the wider Arden Hills community and
to leverage the energy savings potential from facilitating ongoing awareness of
energy use by site tenants and residents. Many details of community engagement
will need to be planned once the site sees its first residents and tenants.
However, certain engagement elements can be planned for or implemented during
the early development stage, including:
   •   A TCAAP or Arden Hills-wide website that tracks energy goals and
performance of buildings at the site, including energy and carbon savings. The
website could promote major metrics and milestones, and issue periodic
challenges (e.g. the "lowest user" challenge).
   •   Community-wide open house or showcase events of leading edge
technologies on the site, especially for housing, that will attract and excite
potential residents (e.g. cook a meal in an all-electric kitchen)
   •   Commissioning of design or signage elements in public spaces that
connect users to the site's energy resiliency goals and their contribution and
participation in those goals. A targeted marketing campaign around community
solar development, as an early symbol of community- driven, low carbon energy
use at the site.
4.4.   Demonstration Opportunities
4.4.1.   Advanced Distribution Grid
TCAAP's greenfield status, combined with the site's forward looking energy
vision, make it an ideal opportunity to pilot and demonstrate advanced
technologies in the electric distribution grid. Many of the opportunities
outlined in this report, such as high solar PV penetration, advanced commercial
building metering, or responsive electric loads, are all facilitated by a
distribution system with increased communications and control functions.
Features that could be piloted at the site might include increased reliability
testing, or load management strategies that rely on advanced metering and
communications throughout the distribution network. Load management-the real-
time increase or reduction of electric demand in response to external signals-
can change customer electricity use in response to signals such as physical
constraints or environmental signals, such as an excess renewable energy
capacity. The results can save customers money and reduce the environmental
impact of their energy use.
By laying the groundwork for an advanced distribution system at TCAAP during
the planning phase, residents and businesses would have access to cutting edge
opportunities such as advanced rate design or real-time load response. Moving
forward on these opportunities would likely require the collaboration of Xcel
Energy, the Public Utilities Commission, and the Minnesota Department of
Commerce, Division of Energy Resources.
4.4.2.   Innovative Energy Technologies
In addition to pilot opportunities at the grid level, TCAAP is ideal for
demonstrating innovative energy technologies at scale. The Project Team
recommends that the JDA and County seek and attract partnerships to demonstrate
proven technologies and strategies. While the technologies may be proven, TCAAP
offers scalable and living demonstration opportunities, where an apartment,
house, or street of homes could serve as a living lab. Additionally, as a cold
climate site that can attract multiple partners, there is great opportunity to
demonstrate the synergies that can exist between multiple innovative
technologies and design strategies. This might include piloting new in-road
luminescent street or pedestrian path lighting products in conjunction with
high efficiency overhead LED street lighting or homes that have on-site
electric storage and remote controlled appliances/electronics that communicate
with each other.
The following case studies outline how demonstration opportunities can make
economic sense for developers, the partnerships that brought opportunities to
life, and key technologies that could be demonstrated at scale.
4.4.3.   Technology Demonstration: Case Studies
4.4.3.1.   Builders Leading with Home Connectivity | Standard Pacific Homes, KB
Homes, TruMark Co.
A number of leading home builders in the U.S. are capitalizing on the benefits
of developing homes that are connected - to the internet, to smart phones,
cars, on-site renewables, thermostats, lighting, and other home electronics and
appliances. Basic network capabilities are being installed in homes as a new
standard feature and then buyers can specify additional features they want
making buyer costs incremental and personalized. Control capability for
homeowners may range from remote control of lights and programmable
thermostats, to automatic shutoff of leaky faucets and geofencing capabilities
as users approach home. Networks and devices need to achieve this have dropped
significantly in price and developers are starting to see these home features
as low-cost ways to improve market value. Costs to developers start around $200
and top out around $2,000.

4.4.3.2.   Net Zero Energy Commercial Building Envelopes | Guardian Industries
Detroit, MI
Guardian Industries, a glass and building products manufacturer demonstrated a
PV spandrel panel system on its new Science and Technology Center in suburban
Detroit. The 12,000 square foot building showcases a cutting edge building
panel system that brings solar power generation capability to the vertical
surfaces of one or two story commercial buildings. The panels convert sunlight
in to electricity at an efficiency of 17% allowing each square foot of panel to
produce eight watts of power. Builder
Turner Construction also incorporated Guardian's own transparent PV glass to
demonstrate ease of integration into the panel system. Eligible for federal
modified accelerated cost-recovery System depreciation and a first year federal
tax credit of 30% (available through 2017), the 2014 built project expects to
achieve 100% payback in two years.

Vehicle & Storage Integration Demonstration | SMUD Sacramento, CA
Many major automakers have been working with Sumitomo Electric to demonstrate
the value of a cloud-based communication system between electric vehicles and
utilities.22 The communication software allows the utility to ask charging cars
if they want to temporarily stop charging, based on how much charge a user has
programmed in to the charger. Users can opt into this program to receive
discounted electricity rates or other incentives while the utility would see
less stress on the grid and achieve greater service reliability.23 Most
recently this two-way communication system was demonstrated at the Sacramento
Municipal Utility District's (SMUD) Service Center.

Demonstrate-Technology-Enabling.aspx
23 http://www.af.mil/News/ArticleDisplay/tabid/223/Article/554343/af-tests-
first-all-electric-vehicle-fleet-in-california.aspx
There are opportunities to demonstrate these grid benefits and customer
incentives in Minnesota at TCAAP. The integration of these communication
capabilities into the grid could be demonstrated across multiple individual EV
users or a fleet (from a future TCAAP business or other TCAAP neighbors such as
Ramsey County or AHATS). The synergy of additional technologies, such as on-
site electric storage and renewables and in-home DC power access could be
incorporated as part of such a grid integration project. Such an effort could
be achieved in partnership with Xcel Energy with the opportunity for the
University of Minnesota or other third-parties to play a role in research and
community learning.

4.5.   Recommended Development Request for Proposal Language
In order to embed the energy resilience principals of TCAAP into the fabric of
the site, it is recommended that the JDA incorporate evaluation language as
part of the Request for Proposal (RFP) for all commercial development projects.
The language below presents conservation guidelines as criteria by which each
proposal could be evaluated. In the cases where it is possible to provide
direct incentives or funnel state economic development fund to developers,
these standards could be made requirements for these resources.
4.5.1.   Energy Resilience Proposal Evaluation Criteria
Sustainable Buildings 2030 Design Standards - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
Commercial and residential development proposals will be evaluated based on a
demonstrated commitment to building to meet or exceed the State of Minnesota's
Sustainable Building 2030 (SB 2030) energy standards. Proposals should
highlight design and constructing team experience in developing high-
performance buildings and sites. Proposals should also outline preliminary
strategies and processes that will be used to meet higher energy performance.
This would include:
   •   Early design phase energy modeling to inform building orientation,
daylighting, passive solar heating, and building envelope decisions
   •   Specification of high efficiency lighting, operator controls, and
mechanical systems/district energy connection
   •   Integration of tenant and equipment level sub-meters that will monitor
ongoing building performance and opportunities for demand response
Further Sub-metering - RECOMMENDED
Beyond meeting SB 2030, it is recommended that all commercial buildings on the
TCAAP site be equipped with local sub-metering. Proposals should describe
generally the plans for installing circuit or equipment level sub-meters within
each tenant space (e.g. individual building or tenant building systems such as
lighting or venting) and power monitoring systems to inform behavior and
ongoing commissioning efforts.
Innovative Energy Demonstrations & Partnerships - RECOMMENDED
The RFP should state the interest in TCAAP servings as a national model and
demonstrating proven energy innovations that will help make renewables, energy
efficiency, and energy awareness more visible at TCAAP.
   •   Proposals may describe a unique energy technology to be incorporated at
the building or site level.
   •   Proposals that layout collaboration opportunities with other TCAAP
developers or the community will receive additional consideration (e.g.
building co-location interest)
Advanced Metering - RECOMMENDED
This infrastructure will help track and report detailed building performance
data to building operators and the utility. It would also allow for the
potential of rate programs that give building owners more control of their
energy costs and savings (dynamic pricing). All electric utility meters should
have two- way, real-time communication capabilities. Xcel Energy could work
with developers to help specify and install any advanced meters, and the site
development partners could help Xcel Energy obtain the necessary regulatory
approvals for piloting these installations.
Solar Oriented Development -- RECOMMENDED
While SB 2030 guidelines will encourage building orientation and site planning
that optimizes load minimizing solar heat gains, developers that show intent to
incorporate passive solar design will be given additional consideration or even
site location preference. This may include conceptual drawings, plans, and
other documentation that show how building orientation, building massing,
window placement, and site landscaping will utilize passive solar heating and
achieve solar access for immediate or future on-site renewables.
5.   Schedule
5.1.   Overall TCAAP Development Schedule
The development schedule that is currently proposed is likely to begin in 2016
with the construction of the interchanges of County Hwy 96 and County Road H
with the Spine Road. The Spine Road construction is also expected to begin in
2016. Currently, site development is projected to begin with the residential
and retail areas in the northern region of TCAAP in late 2016 or early 2017.
Development is expected to progress southward from the Town and Creek
neighborhoods as the market allows. The Thumb area is being actively marketed
by the JDA at this time, and could be developed as soon as the right proposal
is received from the development community. The current development plan is
included in the appendix as Exhibit III.
5.2.   Integrating with the TCAAP Development Schedule
Given the development timeline in section 5.1, development of the concepts
presented in this Framework will need to follow varying schedules, as provided
below.
5.2.1.   Future Thermal Energy Grid
While the most cost-effective time to install thermal energy grids is in
coordination with initial site development, this is likely not feasible given
the uncertainty of when and what will be developed at TCAAP. Alternatively, a
corridor for future energy infrastructure (i.e. district energy piping) could
be preserved in the engineering and construction plans for the Spine Road. The
Project Team is in discussions with Ramsey County staff to include that
corridor in the Spine Road design.
5.2.2.   Community Solar
The proposed community solar garden is technically not located on the TCAAP
site, rather it is recommended for the Primer Trace site. As such, TCAAP
development will not necessarily have an impact on the schedule for this
opportunity. Rather, the community solar garden will need to be completed and
in service by December 31, 2016 to be eligible for the 30% income tax credits,
assuming they are not extended. If the tax credit is not needed in the
developer's business model, this schedule is driven more by market conditions
than the TCAAP development schedule.
5.2.3.   Low-Temperature District Energy
Construction of the low-temperature district energy system in the residential
neighborhoods will need to coincide with development in order to be ready to
serve the initial neighborhood development, avoid any unnecessary developer
costs, and minimize the cost of pipe installation. RFPs are likely to be issued
in late 2015, so the business plan for this system will need to be fully
developed in early to mid- 2015.
5.2.4.   Combined Heat and Power
Development of the initial CHP system is more directly related to the needs of
the existing buildings than to the development timeline of TCAAP. Therefore,
construction of the initial CHP system should be coordinated with the MNARNG's
plans for site expansion, so that the proposed future buildings could be served
by the system from the initial construction and unnecessary equipment costs can
be avoided. Connection to the other buildings should be completed at this time
to take advantages of the economies of scale and optimize thermal energy
capture. Expansion of the CHP system to serve development of TCAAP should
coincide with that development, and the JDA should engage early with selected
developers to identify how the CHP system can be expanded to meet their
buildings' needs.
5.2.5.   Demand-Side Management
The JDA should work with partner organizations to develop greater comprehension
of SB 2030 guidelines by hosting informational gatherings for the development
companies that are interested in the TCAAP site. Builders and contractors
familiar with the SB 2030 process could be asked to provide insight and
feedback about the process. Developer education will build developer acceptance
and understanding of process to make the site more attractive.
The JDA should also assess current residential market potential in Twin Cities
region by conducting market research and outreach on all-electric, low load
home concept. This will help to assuage developer and future resident concerns
about unfamiliar technologies and utility structure.
The JDA should lastly work with the site marketing team to market energy
conservation concepts to potential developers, builders, and tenants, focusing
on the business opportunities available through these concepts.
6.   Next Steps and Conclusion
6.1.   Next Steps
To achieve the TCAAP energy vision and achieve sustainable benefits for the
City and the surrounding community, the JDA will need to begin implementation
on each of the individual opportunities presented in this Framework. The
Project Team recommends the following immediate actions related to each
opportunity.
6.1.1.   Partnerships
Continue partnership discussions with the MNARNG, Xcel Energy, the University
of Minnesota Center for Sustainable Building Research, and other stakeholders
as development of the site and the various energy opportunities progress.
6.1.2.   Solar PV
Develop an RFP for the development of a solar array on the Primer Tracer site.
The RFPs could be sent to Xcel Energy and local community solar developers. In
parallel to the site development RFP process, the County and the MNARNG should
begin the process needed to secure the Primer Tracer land for a solar
development.
6.1.3.   Combined Heat and Power
As part of the developer selection process, the JDA should work with
prospective developers to identify opportunities for serving those buildings'
electric and thermal energy needs with a CHP facility. The JDA and County
should also coordinate with the MNARNG and Xcel Energy to define an initial CHP
facility that can serve the current loads in the area, align with the energy
goals of the MNARNG, and be expanded in the future to meet the emerging TCAAP
energy loads as they occur.
6.1.4.   Low-Temperature District Energy System
The JDA should develop the business plan for the proposed low-temperature
district energy system and form the operational organization in preparation for
the site development request for proposals. In addition, the County should work
with the Army and the appropriate regulatory authorities to obtain approval to
extract energy from the treated ground water, and utilize the existing pump
house for the low-temperature district energy distribution loop. Lastly, the
JDA should continue collaboration with Xcel Energy to explore a neighborhood
that is independent of the natural gas system, through district energy and
electric grid services.
6.1.5.   Demand-Side Management
The JDA should adopt the energy savings design standards it would like to
incorporate into the site development RFP process, both for commercial and
residential developments. The JDA should also inform developers on the various
energy efficiency opportunities that are available to them by developing
informational and educational material for prospective developers. Lastly, the
JDA should collaborate with developers and Xcel Energy to identify
opportunities for an advanced distribution grid and meters, building co-
location, and passive-solar design deployment.
6.1.6.   Infrastructure Planning
The County should develop a utility coordination program that enables cost-
effective implementation of initial utilities and infrastructure on the site,
while allowing for future infrastructure to be added as opportunities come
available. The County should also incorporate solar orientation into the
platting process.
6.1.7.   Funding Pursuits
The JDA should identify the funding opportunities that it could be the most
successful in pursuing, and collaborate with the City, County, MNARNG and other
stakeholders, as appropriate, to develop funding requests for each selected
opportunity. In parallel, the stakeholders should develop and implement an
outreach campaign to inform decision makers on the energy opportunities that
are available at TCAAP.
6.1.8.   RFP Development
The JDA and the County should include energy planning in the development of
RFPs for the site, and through negotiations and discussions with individual
developers. Opportunities for co-location, waste energy capture, energy
efficiency improvements, district energy integration, and other options
discussed in the White Paper and the Framework should be discussed with
developers throughout TCAAP development process to achieve the energy vision.
6.2.   Conclusion
The ERAB has adopted a very forward-thinking vision for the TCAAP site. This
will be achievable through strategic partnerships with Xcel Energy, the MNARNG,
the University of Minnesota Center for Sustainable Building Research,
environmentally conscious citizens, and developers who see the economic and
environmental value of the TCAAP energy vision. Through these partnerships,
TCAAP will be uniquely poised to be the national model for the development of
integrated energy systems.
The first steps toward achieving the energy vision include implementing energy
supply options that focus on efficiency, reliability, scalability, and
sustainability, such as the low-temperature district energy system in the
residential neighborhoods and the community solar garden at the Primer Tracer
site. These specific opportunities have been shown to be financially beneficial
and financeable.
Developing a CHP approach that meets the needs of current buildings in the
area, and is expandable in the future as development proceeds, provides a
platform for establishing a resilient TCAAP microgrid in the future.
Implementing a demand-side management strategy that focuses on building
performance through the development RFP process will build a resilient
community for energy use. Focusing on improving performance in the buildings to
reduce, or even eliminate, the energy needs of the buildings will provide an
economically attractive environment as building owners are able to take
advantage of the financial savings realized by the increased efficiency,
compared to traditional energy expenditures.

Exhibit V - Definitions
Air Handling Unit (AHU) - A central unit consisting of a blower, heating and
cooling elements, filter racks or chamber, dampers, humidifier, and other
central equipment in direct contact with the airflow. This does not include the
ductwork through the building.
Active solar - As an energy source, energy from the sun collected and stored
using mechanical pumps or fans to circulate heat-laden fluids or air between
solar collectors and a building.
Alternating Current (AC) - An electric current that reverses its direction at
regularly recurring intervals. AC is the form in which electric power is
delivered to businesses and residences.
Alternative-rate Energy Efficiency program assistance - An Energy Efficiency
(demand-side management) program assistance that offers special rate structures
or discounts on the consumer's monthly electric bill in exchange for
participation in Energy Efficiency programs aimed at cutting peak demands or
changing load shape. These rates are intended to reduce consumer bills and
shift hours of operation of equipment from on-peak to off-peak periods through
the application of time-differentiated rates. For example, utilities often pay
consumers several dollars a month (refund on their monthly electric bill) for
participation in a load control program. Large commercial and industrial
customers sometimes obtain interruptible rates, which provide a discount in
return for the consumer's agreement to cut electric loads upon request from the
utility (usually during critical periods, such as summer afternoons when the
system demand approaches the utility's generating capability).
Arden Hills Army Training Site (AHATS) - A military training area of Minnesota
National Guard and the Minnesota Department of Military Affairs that is
directly adjacent to the Rice Creek Commons Project to the east.
ASHRAE Bin temperature data - Temperature frequency in 5 F intervals available
from American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers.
Boiler - A device for generating steam for power, processing, or heating
purposes; or hot water for heating purposes or hot water supply. Heat from an
external combustion source is transmitted to a fluid contained within the tubes
found in the boiler shell. This fluid is delivered to an end-use at a desired
pressure, temperature, and quality.
British Thermal Unit (Btu) - The amount of heat required to raise the
temperature of one pound of water 1 degree Fahrenheit. The Btu is a small
amount of heat equivalent to the heat released by a burning matchstick. For
district heating systems, heat is often measured in million Btus (MMBtu) which
is equivalent to one million Btu's.
Building Commissioning - a building performance quality assurance process that
begins during design and continues through construction, occupancy, and
operations. Commissioning ensures that the new building operates initially as
intended by design and that building staff are prepared to operate and maintain
its systems and equipment.
Capacity - The maximum output, commonly expressed in megawatts (MW), that
generating equipment can supply to system load, adjusted for ambient
conditions.
Chiller - Any centrally located air conditioning system that produces chilled
water in order to cool air. The chilled water or cold air is then distributed
throughout the building, using pipes or air ducts or both. These systems are
also commonly known as "central chillers," "centrifugal chillers,"
"reciprocating chillers," or "absorption chillers." Chillers are generally
located in or just outside the building they serve. Buildings receiving
district chilled water are served by chillers located at central physical
plants.
Chilled Water - The product of a Chiller that is distributed through a building
or, in the case of a District Cooling system, other adjacent buildings for the
purposes of air conditioning.
Coefficient of Performance (COP) - Ratio of work or useful output to the amount
of work or energy input, both represented in the same unit. Used generally as a
measure of the energy-efficiency of chillers and heat pumps.
Combined Heating and Power (CHP) - A plant designed to produce both heat and
electricity from a single heat source.
Conservation - A reduction in energy consumption that corresponds with a
reduction in service demand. Service demand can include buildings-sector end
uses such as lighting, refrigeration, and heating; industrial processes; or
vehicle transportation. Unlike energy efficiency, which is typically a
technological measure, conservation is better associated with behavior.
Examples of conservation include adjusting the thermostat to reduce the output
of a heating unit, using occupancy sensors that turn off lights or appliances,
and car-pooling.
Constant Air Volume (CAV) - A system designed to provide a constant air flow.
This term is applied to HVAC systems that have variable supply-air temperature
but constant air flow rates. Most residential forced-air systems are small CAV
systems with on/off control.
Consumer (energy) - Any individually metered dwelling, building, establishment,
or location using natural gas, synthetic natural gas, and/or mixtures of
natural and supplemental gas for feedstock or as fuel for any purpose other
than in oil or gas lease operations; natural gas treating or processing plants;
or pipeline, distribution, or storage compressors.
Cooling Degree Days - A degree day is the difference in temperature between the
outdoor mean temperature over a 24-hour day and a given base temperature.
Cooling degree days occur when the outdoor mean temperature is above 65 F.
Cubic Feet per Minute (CFM) - A common means of assigning quantitative values
to volumes of air or fluid in transit.
Customer conversion - The equipment in a customer building mechanical room that
transfers thermal energy from the district heating system to the building
systems to allow the heat to be distributed throughout the building. The
customer conversion usually consists of heat exchangers, pumps, piping, control
sensors, and control valves to enable heat to be efficiently transferred from
the higher temperature district heating system to the lower temperature
building system.
Daylighting - Designing buildings to maximize the use of natural daylight to
reduce the need for electricity.
Demand-Side Management (Energy Efficiency) - A utility action that reduces or
curtails end-use equipment or processes. Energy Efficiency is often used in
order to reduce customer load during peak demand and/or in times of supply
constraint. Energy Efficiency includes programs that are focused, deep, and
immediate such as the brief curtailment of energy-intensive processes used by a
utility's most demanding industrial customers, and programs that are broad,
shallow, and less immediate such as the promotion of energy-efficient equipment
in residential and commercial sectors.
Demand-side management costs - The costs incurred by the utility to achieve the
capacity and energy savings from the Demand-Side Management Program.
Differential temperature (dT, delta T) - The difference between the supply
temperature and return temperature of the district heating water delivered to
users. This is an indication of the amount of energy delivered to the customer.
Direct Current (DC) - The unidirectional flow of electric charge. Direct
current is produced by sources such as batteries, thermocouples, and solar
cells. The electric current flows in a constant direction, distinguishing it
from alternating current (AC).
Distributed Control System (DCS) - A control system of an energy production
plant and process wherein control elements are not only located in central
location but are also distributed throughout the system with each component
sub-system controlled by one or more controllers so the intelligence is
distributed across the sections of the system.
Distribution - The delivery of energy to retail customers.
District energy - A thermal energy delivery system that connects energy users
with a central production facility.
Diversified load - The actual peak load on an energy system. The diversified
load is less than the sum of the peak loads of individual users due to the
difference in time of day that each individual user realizes their peak load.
Distribution system - The underground piping network that delivers hot water
from an energy production facility to the customer buildings. Hot water is
circulated through this distribution system using pumps that are located at the
production facility.
Domestic hot water - Potable water that is heated for use in faucets, showers,
laundry, and similar uses.
Energy Conservation Measure (ECM) - This includes building shell conservation
measures, HVAC conservation measures, lighting conservation measures, any
conservation measures, and other conservation measures incorporated by the
building. However, this category does not include any Energy Efficiency program
participation by the building. Any Energy Efficiency program participation is
included in the Energy Efficiency Programs.
Energy Transfer Station - Equipment installed at the point of customer
connection to the district energy system. The energy transfer station is
utilized to transfer and measure the thermal energy delivered from the district
energy distribution network to the customer's building(s) or other thermal
loads.
Energy Usage Intensity - The quantity of total energy that a building consumes
per square foot per year. Energy is usually expressed in terms of thousand
British thermal units (KBtu/SF/year).
Energy Utilization Index (EUI) - Measure of the total energy consumed in
cooling or heating of a building or facility in a period, expressed as British
thermal unit (Btu) per (cooled or heated) gross square foot.
Equivalent Full Load Hours - Annual energy usage divided by the peak capacity
used.
Fixed Operations and Maintenance (FOM) - Costs other than those associated with
capital investment that do not vary with the operation, such as maintenance and
payroll.
Fuel Cell CHP - Electrochemical power generation process generating both
electricity and thermal energy suitable for making steam or hot water.
Geothermal energy - Hot water or steam extracted from geothermal reservoirs in
the earth's crust. Water or steam extracted from geothermal reservoirs can be
used for geothermal heat pumps, water heating, or electricity generation.
Geothermal plant - A plant in which the prime mover is a steam turbine. The
turbine is driven either by steam produced from hot water or by natural steam
that derives its energy from heat found in rock.
Green Spine - The corridor through the Rice Creek Commons development that will
be designated green space for the use of stormwater management, recreational
trails, and parks.
Greenhouse gases (GHG) - Those gases, such as water vapor, carbon dioxide,
nitrous oxide, methane, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and
sulfur hexafluoride, that are transparent to solar (short- wave) radiation but
opaque to long-wave (infrared) radiation, thus preventing long-wave radiant
energy from leaving Earth's atmosphere. The net effect is a trapping of
absorbed radiation and a tendency to warm the planet's surface.
Ground Source Heat Pump - A heat pump in which the refrigerant exchanges heat
(in a heat exchanger) with a fluid circulating through an earth connection
medium (ground or ground water). The fluid is contained in a variety of loop
(pipe) configurations depending on the temperature of the ground and the ground
area available. Loops may be installed horizontally or vertically in the ground
or submersed in a body of water.
Heat pump - Heating and/or cooling equipment that, during the heating season,
draws heat into a building from outside and, during the cooling season, ejects
heat from the building to the outside. Heat pumps are vapor- compression
refrigeration systems whose indoor/outdoor coils are used reversibly as
condensers or evaporators, depending on the need for heating or cooling.
Heating Degree Days - A degree day is the difference in temperature between the
outdoor mean temperature over a 24-hour day and a given base temperature.
Heating degree days occur when the outdoor mean temperature is below 65 F.
Heat exchanger - A pressure vessel that contains plates or tubes and allows the
transfer of heat through the plates or tubes from the district heating system
water to the building heat distribution system. A heat exchanger is divided
internally into two separate circuits so that the district heating system water
and the building heat distribution system fluids do not mix.
Heating coil - A heating element made of pipe or tube that is designed to
transfer heat energy to a specific area or working fluid.
Hot water supply and return lines - The district heating system piping that
distributes hot water for heating purposes to customers (supply) and returns
the cooler water to the Plant for reheating (return).
Kilowatt (kW) - A unit of power equal to one thousand Watts (W)
Kilowatt-hour (kWh) - A measure of electricity defined as a unit of work or
energy, measured as 1 kilowatt (1,000watts) of power expended for 1 hour. One
kWh is equivalent to 3,412 Btu.
Load - The amount of energy used by a customer. Typically refers to the Peak
Load on the system.
Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) - The present value of the total cost of
building and operating a generating plant over its economic life, converted to
equal annual payments. LCOE is determined by dividing the project's total cost
of operation by the energy generated.
Medium temperature hot water - Thermal heat transferred via hot water at a
temperature between 190 °F and 250 °F.
Megawatt (MW) - One million Watts (W)
Megawatt-hour (MWh) - One thousand kilowatt-hours
Microgrid - A group of interconnected loads and distributed energy resources
within clearly defined electrical boundaries that act as a single controllable
entity with respect to the grid and can connect and disconnect from the grid to
enable it to operate in both grid-connected or island-mode.
Million BTU (MMBTU) -One million British Thermal Units (BTU). One MMBTU is
equivalent to 293.07 kWh.
Net Present Value (NPV) - The difference between the present value of the
future cash flows from an investment and the amount of investment. Present
value of the expected cash flows is computed by discounting them at the
required rate of return. A zero net present value means the project repays
original investment plus the required rate of return. A positive net present
value means a better return, and a negative net present value means a worse
return, than the return from zero net present value.
Non-diversified load - The sum of the peak loads of individual users. This is a
theoretical maximum system peak load.
Normalized - Adjusted annual data of monthly building usage values measured on
different monthly heating degree scales to a common scale prior to averaging.
N+1 Redundancy - A measure of system component redundancy to provide backup in
the event of failure of any one component. N+1 refers to the number of units
installed to carry normal load plus one additional unit as backup. For example,
if a system has three chillers to achieve the total design load, each is rated
at 33% of the total load, or N=3. For this example, an N+1 system will have a
total of four chillers of 33% capacity for a total installed capacity of 133%
with one chiller providing backup in the event of failure of any one chiller.
Operations and Maintenance (O&M) - The activities related to the performance of
routine, preventive, predictive, scheduled, and unscheduled actions aimed at
preventing equipment failure or decline with the goal of increasing efficiency,
reliability, and safety.
Outside Air Temperature (OAT) - A measure of the air temperature outside a
building. The temperature and humidity of air inside and outside the building
are used in enthalpy calculations to determine when outside air can be used for
free heating or cooling.
Passive solar heating - A solar heating system that uses no external mechanical
power, such as pumps or blowers, to move the collected solar heat.
Peak load/ Peak demand- The maximum load during a specified period of time
Photovoltaic and solar thermal energy - Energy radiated by the sun as
electromagnetic waves (electromagnetic radiation) that is converted at electric
utilities into electricity by means of solar (photovoltaic) cells or
concentrating (focusing) collectors.
PSI - An abbreviation for pounds per square inch. PSI is a unit of pressure
measurement.
Rice Creek Commons (RCC) - The name of the land development project that is
being led by Ramsey County, as the land owner, on the site formerly known as
the Twin Cities Army Ammunitions Plant (TCAAP).
Recommissioning - A type of commissioning that occurs within an existing,
operating building to identify ways the building operation is sub-optimal. The
decision to recommission may be triggered by a change in building use or
ownership, the onset of operational problems, or some other need. Renewable
energy resources - Energy resources that are naturally replenishing but flow-
limited. They are virtually inexhaustible in duration but limited in the amount
of energy that is available per unit of time. Renewable energy resources
include biomass, hydro, geothermal, solar, wind, ocean thermal, wave action,
and tidal action
Resiliency - The ability to withstand disruptions to the regional or national
energy grids or significant volatility to the market price for energy sources.
Return on Investment (ROI) - The earning power of assets measured as the ratio
of the net income (profit less depreciation) to the average capital employed
(or equity capital) in a company or project. Expressed usually as a percentage,
return on investment is a measure of profitability that indicates whether or
not a company is using its resources in an efficient manner. For example, if
the long-term return on investment of a company is lower than its cost-of-
capital, then the company will be better off by liquidating its assets and
depositing the proceeds in a bank.
Seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER) - Ratio of the cooling output divided
by the power consumption. It is the Btu of cooling output during its normal
annual usage divided by the total electric energy input in watt hours during
the same period. This is a measure of the cooling performance for rating
central air conditioners and central heat pumps.
Service line/service piping/customer connection - The segment of the district
heating distribution system that extends from the main lines to the inside of
the customer building. The service line is typically sized to meet the peak hot
water flow requirements for the individual building served by the piping.
Square Foot (SQ FT or ft2) - Unit of measure to quantify the footprint area of
a customer building, used to estimate the Load of a building based on the usage
of the building.
Source Energy - The total amount of raw fuel that is required to operate an
energy-using device or facility. Source energy includes all transmission,
delivery, and production losses, thereby enabling a complete assessment of
energy efficiency in a building. On the other hand, "Site Energy" is the amount
of heat and electricity consumed by a building as reflected in utility bills.
Solar cooling - The use of solar thermal energy or solar electricity to power a
cooling appliance.
Solar Photovoltaic Systems (PV) - Systems that directly convert sunlight into
electricity either for use locally or for delivery to the electric grid.
Solar Thermal - Systems that directly convert sunlight into heat, generally for
domestic hot water though they can also be used to produce space heating.
Substation - Facility equipment that switches, changes, or regulates electric
voltage.
Sustainability - Meeting the needs of the present generation without
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.
Therm - One hundred thousand (100,000) Btu
Thermal energy - Energy that is generated and measured in the form of heat.
Thermal Energy Storage - The storage of heat energy during utility off-peak
times at night, for use during the next day without incurring daytime peak
electric rates.
Thumb - That portion of the Rice Creek Commons development that is at the
extreme northwest of the site, and is separated from the remainder of the site
by Rice Creek.
Transit Oriented Development (TOD) - Land development that takes into account
transportation choices as a means of reducing oil and other energy use.
Typically it would combine public transit with walkable, mixed-use communities,
and approaches to minimize the impact of individual vehicles and commuting.
Waste Heat Recovery - An energy conservation system whereby some space heating
or water heating is done by actively capturing byproduct heat that would
otherwise be ejected into the environment. In nonresidential buildings, sources
of waste heat include refrigeration/air-conditioner compressors, manufacturing
or other processes, data processing centers, lighting fixtures, ventilation
exhaust air, and the occupants themselves. Not to be considered is the passive
use of radiant heat from lighting, workers, motors, ovens, etc., when there are
no special systems for collecting and redistributing heat.
Water source heat pump - A type of (geothermal) heat pump that uses well
(ground) or surface water as a heat source. Water has a more stable seasonal
temperature than air thus making for a more efficient heat source.
Variable Air Volume (VAV) - An HVAC system that has a stable supply-air
temperature, and varies the air flow rate to meet the temperature requirements.
Compared to constant air volume (CAV) systems, these systems conserve energy
through lower fan speeds during times of lower temperature control demand.
Variable frequency drive - an electronic controller that controls the speed of
an electric motor by modulating input frequency and voltage to match motor
speed to the specific demands of the work being performed.

      O.   A land disturbance activity equal to or greater than one (1) acre is
required to comply with the conditions of the NPDES/SDS Construction Stormwater
General Permit, Part IV – Construction Activity Requirements.
1520.02   Review of Permit Application
   Subd. 1   General. The PWD shall review the Erosion and Sediment Control
Plan to ensure compliance with the erosion and sediment control practice
specifications and erosion and sediment control practices.
   Subd. 2   Permit Approval. If the PWD determines that the Erosion and
Sediment Control Plan meets the requirements of this ordinance, the PWD shall
issue a permit, valid for a specified period of time that authorizes the land
disturbance activity contingent on the implementation and completion of the
Erosion and Sediment Control Plan.
   Subd. 3   Permit Denial. If the PWD determines that the Erosion and Sediment
Control Plan does not meet the requirements of this article, the PWD shall not
issue a permit for the land disturbance activity. The Erosion and Sediment
Control Plan must be resubmitted for approval before the land disturbance
activity begins. No land use and building permits shall be issued until the
Permittee has an approved Erosion and Sediment Control Plan.
1520.03   Escrow Requirement.
   After approval of an Erosion and Sediment Control Plan, the PWD may require
the Permittee to escrow a sum of money sufficient to ensure the installation,
completion, maintenance, inspection, and enforcement of the Erosion and
Sediment Control Plan and practices. Escrow amounts shall be set by Ordinance
in the City fee schedule. Inspection fees shall be drawn from the escrow. Six
months after final inspection, the remaining escrow shall be returned to the

additional reports and data.
Section 1530 - Implementation and Maintenance
1530.01   Implementation and Maintenance of Plan.
   All storm water pollution controls noted on the approved Erosion and
Sediment Control Plan shall be installed before commencing the land disturbing
activity and shall not be removed without PWD approval or approval of a
Certificate of Completion. Noncompliance with the Erosion and Sediment Control
Plan shall constitute grounds for an order from the PWD to halt all
construction.
1530.02   Implementation.
   The plan implementation shall incorporate the following:
   Subd. 1   Existing vegetation shall be retained whenever feasible.
   Subd. 2   Land shall be disturbed in increments of workable size such that
adequate erosion and sediment control can be provided and maintained as
construction progresses. The area exposed shall be stabilized in conformance
with best management practices and with the maintenance requirements in the
NPDES General Construction Permit. Soil stabilization measures should be
selected to be appropriate for the time of year, site conditions, and estimated
duration of use.
   Subd. 3   The location of areas not to be disturbed shall be identified with
flags, stakes, signs, silt fence, etc. before construction begins.
   Subd. 4   Down-gradient sediment controls shall be in place before up-
gradient land disturbing activity begins.
   Subd. 5   All storm drains, inlets and outfalls shall be protected until all
sources of potential discharge are stabilized.
   Subd. 6   Temporary stockpiles shall have effective sediment control and
cannot be placed in surface waters or storm water conveyance systems.
   Subd. 7   Vehicle tracking from the site shall be minimized with the use of
stone pads, concrete or steel wash racks, or equivalent systems.
   Subd. 8   Street sweeping shall be used if BMPs are not adequate to prevent
sediment from being tracked into the street.
1530.03   Responsibility.
   The Permittee shall be responsible for proper operation and maintenance of
all stormwater pollution controls and soil stabilization measures in
conformance with best management practices and with the maintenance
requirements in the NPDES General Construction Permit. The Permittee is
responsible for the operation and maintenance of temporary erosion at the site.
The Permittee is responsible until another Permittee has assumed control over
all areas of the site that have not been finally stabilized or the site has
undergone final stabilization, and has received an approved Certificate of
Completion. The Permittee is responsible for maintenance, clean-up and all
damages caused by flooding of the site or surrounding area due to in-place
erosion or sediment control.
Section 1540 - Enforcement
1540.01   Erosion and Sediment Control Permit Enforcement.
   If the PWD determines that erosion and sedimentation control is not being
implemented or maintained according to the approved Plan, the Permittee will be
notified and provided with a list of corrective work to be performed.
Notification may be given by personal delivery upon the Permittee, or an
officer, partner, manager or designated representative of the Permittee, or by
e-mail or facsimile by sending such notice to the e-mail address or facsimile
number provided by the Permittee. Upon the receipt of a Non-Compliance Notice
from the PWD, the Permittee shall undertake a corrective action.
   Subd. 1   Types of Corrective Actions.
      A.   Violations Contained on the Construction Site. Permittee shall
complete clean-up and restoration within forty-eight (48) hours of receipt of
the Non-Compliance Notice.

one or more of the remedies specified herein. All costs incurred by the City
shall be paid by Permittee. Escrow funds may be used by the City for this
purpose and, if such funds do not adequately cover the City's cost, the
Permittee shall reimburse the City for any deficiency before continuing work on
the construction site. The City may:
      A.   Withhold the scheduling of inspections and/or the issuance of a
Certificate of Occupancy.
      B.   Issue a stop work order, ceasing all land disturbance activity on
the site until such time as corrective measures are completed to the

percent open and no more than 35 percent solid. The open surfaces are to be
open air or occupied by screens, and/or screen doors. The solid surfaces are to
be exterior materials that are consistent or complementary in color, texture,
and quality to those of the front of the existing home. Solid surfaces may only
include columns, spindles, and railings; solid walls (even partial) are
prohibited.
   Floors
   Open-air porches must have floors of durable exterior grade materials such
as concrete, painted or stained solid wood, high quality composite materials,
or brick.
   Railings
   The height and spacing of railing must meet the requirements of the
International Building Code. Acceptable railing materials are painted or
stained wood, high quality composite materials, and painted metal. The design
of the railing assembly should be compatible with the details of the existing
house.
   Roofs
   The roof or your porch addition should be properly proportioned in shape and
pitch to the rooflines of the existing house. Roofing materials should match as
closely as possible to the materials of the existing home.
   Landscaping
   Integrating your porch addition into your yard is as important as its
integration to the house. Plant materials and landscape features should
transition the porch into your yard, providing a visual base. Landscaping could
also be placed along the entry path.
