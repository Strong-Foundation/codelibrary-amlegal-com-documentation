1-2-3: COURT PROCEEDINGS:
   A.   Prior Acts: No new ordinance shall be construed or held to repeal a
former ordinance, whether such former ordinance is expressly repealed or not,
as to any offense committed against such former ordinance or as to any act
done, any penalty, forfeiture or punishment so incurred, or any right accrued
or claim arising under the former ordinance, or in any way whatever to affect
any such offense or act so committed or so done, or any penalty, forfeiture or

by express words or implication, whether the repeal is in the ordinance making
any new provisions upon the same subject or in any other ordinance.
   C.   Current Pending Actions: Nothing contained in this chapter shall be
construed as abating any action now pending under or by virtue of any general
ordinance of the city herein repealed, and the provisions of all general
ordinances contained in this code shall be deemed to be continuing provisions
and not a new enactment of the same provisions; nor shall this chapter be
deemed as discontinuing, abating, modifying or altering any penalty accrued or

hereby declares that it would have passed each section, subsection,
subdivision, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase thereof irrespective of the

   A.   Regular Meetings: Regular meetings of the city council shall be held on
the third Tuesday of each calendar month at seven thirty o'clock (7:30) P.M.
Any regular meeting falling upon a holiday shall be held on the next following
business day at the same time and place. All meetings, including special and
adjourned meetings, shall be held in the Sabin community center. A schedule of
the regular meetings shall be kept on file at the Sabin community center. If
the council decides to hold a regular meeting at a time or place different from
the time or place stated in its schedule of regular meetings, it shall give the
same notice of the meeting that is provided for a special meeting. (Ord., 11-
18-1997)
   B.   Special Meetings: The mayor or any two (2) members of the council may
call a special meeting of the council. For a special meeting, except an
emergency or a special meeting for which a notice requirement is otherwise
expressly established by statute, the council shall post written notice of the
date, time, place and purpose of the meeting in the window of the council
offices of the Sabin community center or on the door of its usual meeting room.
The notice shall also be mailed or otherwise delivered to each person who has
filed a written request for notice of special meetings with the council. This
notice shall be posted and mailed or delivered at least three (3) days before
the date of the meeting. As an alternative to mailing or otherwise delivering
notice to persons who have filed a written request for notice of special
meetings, the council may publish the notice once, at least three (3) days
before the meeting, in the official newspaper of the city. A person filing a
request for notice of special meetings may limit the request to notification of
meetings concerning particular subjects, in which case, the council shall send
notice to that person only concerning special meetings involving those
subjects. The expiration date for requests for notices of special meetings
pursuant to this subsection shall expire on June 30 of each year, and requests
for notices shall be refiled on or after January 1 of each year for the
following year ending December 31. Not more than sixty (60) days before the
expiration date of a request for notice, the council shall send notice of the
refiling requirement to each person who filed during the preceding year. (Ord.
113, 1987)
   C.   Emergency Meetings: An emergency meeting may be called by any member of
the council or the mayor. For an emergency meeting, the council shall make good
faith efforts to provide notice of the meeting to each news medium that has
filed a written request for notice if the request includes the news medium's
telephone number. Notice of the emergency meeting shall be given by telephone
or by any other method used to notify the members of the council. Notice shall
be provided to each news medium which has filed a written request for notice as
soon as reasonably practicable after notice has been given to the members.
Notice shall include the subject of the meeting. Posted or published notice of
an emergency meeting shall not be required. An "emergency" meeting is a special
meeting called because of circumstances that, in the judgment of the council,
require immediate consideration by the council. If matters not directly related
to the emergency are discussed or acted upon at an emergency meeting, the
minutes of the meeting shall include a specified description of the matters.
The notice requirement of this subsection supersedes any statutory notice
requirement for a special meeting that is an emergency meeting.
   D.   Recessed Or Continued Meetings: If a meeting is a recessed or continued
session of a previous meeting, and the time and place of the meeting was
established during the previous meeting and recorded in the minutes of that
meeting, then no further published or mailed notice is necessary. For purposes
of this subsection, the term "meeting" includes a public hearing conducted
pursuant to Minnesota statutes chapter 429 or any other law requiring a public
hearing by the city. (Ord. 113, 1987; amd. 2005 Code)
   E.   Closed Meetings: The notice requirements of this section apply to
closed meetings.
   F.   Actual Notice: If a person received actual notice of a meeting of the
council at least twenty four (24) hours before the meeting, all notice
requirements of this section are satisfied with respect to that person,
regardless of the method of receipt of notice.

each year, the council shall:

commissions, and committees, as may be necessary. (Ord. 113, 1987)
   H.   Public Meetings: All council meetings, including special and adjourned
meetings and meetings of council committees, except those which may be closed
in accordance with Minnesota statutes chapter 13D, shall be open to the public.

Every application for a license to sell liquor shall state the name of the
applicant, his age, representations as to his character, with such references

sale license and on application for transfer of an existing on sale license,

hundred dollars ($500.00), and the city shall conduct a preliminary background
and financial investigation of the applicant. The application, in such case,
shall be made on a form prescribed by the state bureau of criminal apprehension
and shall contain such additional information as the council may require. If
the council deems it in the public interest to have an investigation made on a
particular application for renewal of an on sale license, it shall so
determine. If the council determines that a comprehensive background and
investigation of the applicant is necessary, it may conduct the investigation
itself or contract with the bureau of criminal apprehension for the
investigation. No license shall be issued, transferred, or renewed if the
results show to the satisfaction of the council that issuance would not be in
the public interest. If an investigation outside the state is required, the
applicant shall be charged the actual cost not to exceed ten thousand dollars
($10,000.00). The fee, after deducting any initial investigation fee already
paid, shall be payable by the applicant whether or not the license is granted.

hearing, the council shall, in its discretion, grant or refuse the application.

commissioner of public safety. (Ord. 108, 6-14-1982)

2-1A-9: TRANSFER OF LICENSE:
Each license shall be issued only to the applicant and for the premises
described in the application. No license may be transferred to another person
or place without city council approval. Any transfer of stock of a corporate
licensee is deemed a transfer of the license, and a transfer of stock without
prior council approval is a ground for revocation of the license. (Ord. 108, 6-
14-1982)

customer by first class United States mail, or it may be personally served, and
shall state that payment is past due, stating the amount due and notifying the
customer that the customer has ten (10) days from the date of the notice in

amount has not been paid within ten (10) days following the date of the past
due notice, a second notice (the "cutoff notice") shall be given the delinquent
account customer. The cutoff notice shall be mailed to the delinquent account
customer by first class United States mail, or it may be personally served, and
shall state that if payment is not made within seven (7) days following the
date of the cutoff notice, the water supply to the customer's premises will be
shut off. If payment of the delinquent account is not made within the time
specified in the cutoff notice, the water supply of the delinquent customer may
