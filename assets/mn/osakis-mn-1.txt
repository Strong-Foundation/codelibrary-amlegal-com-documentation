   (A)   All ordinances of a permanent and general nature of the city, as
revised, codified, rearranged, renumbered and consolidated into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections, shall be known and designated as the
“city code,” for which designation “code of ordinances,” “codified ordinances”
or “code” may be substituted. Code title, chapter and section headings do not
constitute any part of the law as contained in the code.
   (B)   All references to codes, titles, chapters and sections are to the
components of the code unless otherwise specified. Any component code may be
referred to and cited by its name, such as the “Traffic Code.” Sections may be
referred to and cited by the designation “§” followed by the number, such as “§
10.01.” Headings and captions used in this code other than the title, chapter

state law.

of this city shall be by the following rules, unless that construction is

the same ordinance:
      (1)   AND or OR. Either conjunction shall include the other as if written
“and/or,” whenever the context requires.
      (2)   Acts by assistants. When a statute, code provisions or ordinance
requires an act to be done which, by law, an agent or deputy as well may do as
the principal, that requisition shall be satisfied by the performance of the
act by an authorized agent or deputy.
      (3)   Gender; singular and plural; tenses. Words denoting the masculine
gender shall be deemed to include the feminine and neuter genders; words in the

   It is the intention of the City Council that, when adopting this Minnesota
Basic Code, all future amendments to any state or federal rules and statutes
adopted by reference in this code or referenced in this code are hereby adopted
by reference or referenced as if they had been in existence at the time this
code was adopted, unless there is clear intention expressed in the code to the
contrary.
§ 10.20 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Any licensed peace officer of the city’s Police Department, or the
County Sheriff, or any Deputy Sheriff shall have the authority to enforce any
provision of this code.
   (B)   As permitted by M.S. § 626.862, as it may be amended from time to
time, the City Clerk/Treasurer shall have the authority to administer and
enforce this code. In addition, under that statutory authority, certain
individuals designated within the code or by the Clerk/Treasurer or City
Council shall have the authority to administer and enforce the provisions
specified. All and any person or persons designated may issue a citation in
lieu of arrest or continued detention to enforce any provision of the code.
   (C)   The City Clerk/Treasurer and any city official or employee designated
by this code who has the responsibility to perform a duty under this code may
with the permission of a licensee of a business or owner of any property or
resident of a dwelling, or other person in control of any premises, inspect or
otherwise enter any property to enforce compliance with this code.
   (D)   If the licensee, owner, resident or other person in control of a
premises objects to the inspection of or entrance to the property, the City
Clerk/Treasurer, peace officer or any employee or official charged with the
duty of enforcing the provisions of this code may, upon a showing that probable
cause exists for the issuance of a valid search warrant from a court of
competent jurisdiction, petition and obtain a search warrant before conducting
the inspection or otherwise entering the property. This warrant shall be only
to determine whether the provisions of this code enacted to protect the health,
safety and welfare of the people are being complied with and to enforce these
provisions only, and no criminal charges shall be made as a result of the
warrant. No warrant shall be issued unless there be probable cause to issue the
warrant. Probable cause occurs if the search is reasonable. Probable cause does
not depend on specific knowledge of the condition of a particular property.
   (E)   Every licensee, owner, resident or other person in control of property
within the city shall permit at reasonable times inspections of or entrance to
the property by the City Clerk/Treasurer or any other authorized city officer
or employee only to determine whether the provisions of this code enacted to
protect the health, safety and welfare of the people are being complied with
and to enforce these provisions. Unreasonable refusal to permit the inspection
of or entrance to the property shall be grounds for termination of any and all
permits, licenses or city service to the property. Mailed notice shall be given
to the licensee, owner, resident or other person in control of the property,
stating the grounds for the termination, and the licensee, owner, resident or
other person in control of the property shall be given an opportunity to appear
before the City Clerk/Treasurer to object to the termination before it occurs,
subject to appeal of the Clerk/Treasurer’s decision to the City Council at a
regularly scheduled or special meeting.
   (F)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of
the city to enter private property in urgent emergency situations where there
is an imminent danger in order to protect the public health, safety and
welfare.
§ 10.98 SUPPLEMENTAL ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES.
   (A)   In addition to those administrative penalties established in this code
and the enforcement powers granted in §
10.20, the City Council is authorized to create by resolution, adopted by a
majority of the members of the Council, supplemental administrative penalties.
The resolution may be in the form established in
Appendix I of this chapter.
   (B)   These administrative penalty procedures in this section are intended
to provide the public and the city with an informal, cost effective and
expeditious alternative to traditional criminal charges for violations of
certain provisions of this code. While criminal fines and penalties have been
the most frequent enforcement mechanism, there are certain negative
consequences for both the city and the accused. The delay inherent in the
criminal system does not ensure prompt resolution. Citizens resent being
labeled as criminals for violations of administrative regulations. The higher
burden of proof and the potential of incarceration do not appear appropriate
for most administrative violations. The criminal process does not always regard
city code violations as being important. Accordingly, the City Council finds
the use of administrative citations and the imposition of civil penalties is
legitimate and a necessary alternative method of enforcement. This method of
enforcement is in addition to any other legal remedy that may be pursued for
city code violations.
   (C)   Administrative penalties for violations of various provisions of the
code, other than those penalties established in the code or in statutes that
are adopted by reference, may be established from time to time by resolution of
a majority of the members of the City Council. In order to be effective, an
administrative penalty for a particular violation must be established before
the violation occurred.
   (D)   Alternative methods of enforcement. This administrative enforcement
procedure seeks to gain compliance with certain provisions of the city code and
serves as an alternate to any formal criminal or civil court action. The
administrative hearing process provided for in this section shall be in
addition to any other legal or equitable remedy available to the city for city
code violations, except that if a determination is made by the hearing officer
pursuant to the hearing process detailed in this section that a violation did
not occur, the city may not then proceed with criminal prosecution of the same
act or conduct.
   (E)   Authority to issue order to correct/compliance letters and
administrative citations. The following city employees and agents are
authorized to issue compliance letters and administrative citations for
violations of the city code.
      (1)   Licensed peace officers of the city Police Department;
      (2)   City Building Official;
      (3)   City Zoning Administrator;
      (4)   Public Works Director;
      (5)   City Clerk.
   (F)   Administrative offenses; schedule of fines and fees.
      (1)   Except as noted herein or otherwise ordered by the City Council, a
violation of any provision of the city code is an administrative offense which
may be subject to an administrative citation and civil penalties pursuant to
this section. Each day a violation exists constitutes a separate offense.
      (2)   An administrative offense may be subject to a civil penalty not
exceeding $1,000.
      (3)   The City Council shall adopt by resolution a schedule of
recommended civil fines for offenses initiated by administrative citation. The
City Council is not bound by that schedule when a matter is appealed for
administrative review.
      (4)   The City Council may adopt a schedule of fees to be paid to
administrative hearing officers.
   (G)   Order to correct/compliance letters; administrative citations. Upon
the reasonable belief that an administrative offense has occurred, the city
officials listed above may serve the violator an order to correct the violation
(otherwise known as a compliance letter). If compliance is not achieved within
the timeline prescribed in the order to correct letter, the official is
authorized to issue an administrative citation. An administrative citation
shall be presented in person or by first class mail to the person responsible
for the violation. Service shall be deemed complete upon depositing the
citation in the United States Mail, properly addressed to last known address of
the person to be served and postage prepaid. The citation shall state the
following: date, time, and nature of the offense, citing the relevant portion
of the city code that was allegedly violated, the amount of the scheduled civil
fine and the manner for paying the fine, a statement that the city code
violation and the amount of the administrative penalty may be contested to be
heard before an independent hearing officer by notifying the city clerk or
designated representative in writing within ten days of the date of the
citation, and a statement that failure to pay the administrative civil penalty
may result in it being assessed against the property as provided in M.S. Ch.
429. In no circumstances shall the city be required to follow the
administrative citation procedure.
   (H)   Exceptions to issuance of order to correct/compliance letter. For
violations of the following, the city shall not be required to issue a
compliance letter and may proceed directly to the issuance of an administrative
citation as provided in division (G) above.
      (1)   Repeat offender. If the same owner commits a subsequent violation
within 12 months after a compliance letter has been issued for the same or
similar offense.
      (2)   License violations. This constitutes any violation of a city code
license requirement, including not having a license.
   (I)   Reasonable extensions. Following service of the compliance letter, the
city shall attempt to work with the owner to resolve the violation, including
but not limited to responding to reasonable extensions for compliance.
   (J)   Payment of penalty and correction of violation. If the owner pays the
administrative civil penalty and corrects the city code violation, no further
action will be taken against the owner or the owner’s real property for that
same violation. If payment is made but correction is not accomplished, a
subsequent administrative citation may be issued, criminal proceedings may be
initiated, or any other proceedings or remedies available in order to enforce
correction of the violation. If no payment is made, no correction of the
violation is made, and no request for hearing is made in accordance herein, the
city may assess the administrative civil penalty against the property owner
pursuant to M.S. Ch. 429, issue a subsequent administrative citation and
commence a new administrative process, initiate criminal proceedings or
initiate other enforcement action authorized by law or a combination hereof.
   (K)   Request for hearing. An owner or occupant may contest the
administrative citation and the amount of the fine by requesting a hearing, in
writing, within ten days of the date of the citation, to the City Clerk or
designated representative.
   (L)   Administrative hearing procedure.
      (1)   Hearing officers. The City Council will periodically approve a list
of lawyers, from which the City Clerk will select a Hearing Officer to hear and
determine a matter for which the hearing is requested. The person who has
requested the hearing has the right to request, no later than 15 days before
the date of the hearing, that the assigned Hearing Officer be removed from the
case. One such request for each case will be granted by the City Clerk. A
subsequent request must be directed to the assigned Hearing Officer who will
decide whether the Hearing Officer can fairly and objectively review the case.
If such a finding is made, the Hearing Officer shall remove himself or herself
from the case, and the City Clerk shall assign another Hearing Officer. The
Hearing Officer is not a judicial officer, but is a public officer as defined
by M.S. § 609.415. The Hearing Officer shall not be a current employee of the
city, nor shall the Hearing Officer be a representative of the office of the
City Attorney.
      (2)   Notice of hearing. Notice of the hearing must be served in person
or by first class mail to the person responsible for the violation no less than
20 days in advance of the scheduled hearing, unless a shorter time is accepted
by both parties. Service shall be deemed complete upon depositing the notice of
hearing in the United States Mail, properly addressed to last known address of
the person to be served and postage prepaid.
      (3)   Payment for cost of hearing. The cost of the hearing shall be borne
solely by the non-prevailing party. The city shall provide an estimate of the
cost of the hearing at the time of the request for hearing. The City Council
has the authority to reduce the non-prevailing party’s costs where that party
can demonstrate indigence by clear and convincing evidence. Proof of indigence
can be demonstrated by the party’s receipt of means tested governmental
benefits or a demonstrated lack of assets or current income. Such proof shall
be presented to the City Council for determination subsequent to the hearing.
However, the Hearing Officer at the time of the hearing shall make specific
findings as to whether or not the party is indigent with said findings
presented to the City Council. In all cases, where the party requesting the
hearing is unable to attend and fails to request a continuance of the hearing
at least 48 hours in advance of the scheduled hearing, all costs incurred by
the city attributable to the hearing shall be charged to the requesting party.
      (4)   Hearing procedures. At the hearing, the parties shall have the
opportunity to present testimony and question any witnesses, but strict rules
of evidence shall not apply. The Hearing Officer shall record the hearing and
receive testimony and exhibits and the full record of the hearing shall be
kept. The Hearing Officer shall receive and give weight to evidence, including
hearsay evidence of the same probative value commonly accepted by reasonable
and prudent people in the conduct of their affairs.
      (5)   Authority of the hearing officer. The Hearing Officer shall
determine whether a violation did or did not occur. If the Hearing Officer
determines that a violation did not occur then the citation shall be dismissed.
If the Hearing Officer determines that a violation did occur, then the officer
may do any of the following: impose a fine anywhere within or up to, but not
exceeding, the maximum penalty for an administrative offense, stay or waive a
fine either unconditionally or upon compliance with the appropriate conditions.
When imposing a penalty for a violation, the Hearing Officer may consider any
or all of the following.
         (a)   The duration of the violation;
         (b)   The frequency of recurrence of the violation;
         (c)   The seriousness of the violation;
         (d)   The history of the violation;
         (e)   The violator’s conduct after issuance of the notice of hearing;
         (f)   The good faith effort of the violator to comply;
         (g)   The economic impact of the penalty on the violator;
         (h)   The impact of the violation upon the community; and
         (i)   Any other factors appropriate to just result.
      (6)   Fines for continuing violations. The Hearing Officer may exercise
discretion to impose a fine for more than one day of a continuing violation but
only on a finding that the violation caused a serious threat of harm to the
public health, safety or welfare, or the accused intentionally and unreasonably
refused to comply with the code requirement. The Hearing Officer’s decision and
supporting reasons for continuing violations must be in writing.
      (7)   Decision of the Hearing Officer. The Hearing Officer shall issue a
decision in writing to both parties within ten days of the hearing. Any fines
or penalties imposed must be paid no later than 30 days of the date of the
Hearing Officer’s order. If the fine is not paid, the city may assess the civil
penalty against the owner’s property pursuant to M.S. Ch. 429. If the Hearing
Officer determines that no violation occurred, the city may not proceed with
criminal prosecution for the same act or conduct. The decision of the Hearing
Officer is final and may only be appealed to the Minnesota Court of Appeals by
petitioning for a writ of certiorari pursuant to M.S. § 606.01.
   (M)   Payment of fines. Prior to any assessment for unpaid fines, the city
shall seek payment of the fines by notifying the owner of the property in
writing of the fine imposed.
   (N)   Assessment procedure. Unpaid fines, including any administrative
charges for such assessment as indicated in the city’s fee schedule, plus
interest of the total balance will be assessed pursuant to M.S. Ch. 429 against
the property of the owner charged with the violation. For uncorrected or
continued violations, the city may, after notification to the property owner,
correct the violation pursuant to M.S. § 429.101 and assess all charges
incurred for doing so against the property.
(Am. Ord. 135, passed 7-10-2023)
§ 10.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person, firm or corporation who violates any provision of this
code for which another penalty is not specifically provided, shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor. The penalty which may be imposed for
any crime which is a misdemeanor under this code, including Minnesota Statutes
specifically adopted by reference, shall be a sentence of not more than 90 days

   (B)   Any person, firm or corporation who violates any provision of this
code, including Minnesota Statutes specifically adopted by reference, which is

petty misdemeanor. The penalty which may be imposed for any petty offense which
is a petty misdemeanor shall be a sentence of a fine of not more than $300.
   (C)   In either the case of a misdemeanor or a petty misdemeanor, the costs
of prosecution may be added. A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon
each day during which a violation occurs or continues.
   (D)   The failure of any officer or employee of the city to perform any
official duty imposed by this code shall not subject the officer or employee to
the penalty imposed for a violation.
   (E)   In addition to any penalties provided for in this section or in §
10.98, if any person, firm or corporation fails to comply with any provision of
this code, the Council or any city official designated by it, may institute
appropriate proceedings at law or at equity to restrain, correct or abate the
violation.

address and telephone number of the city, and a clearly visible and easily
readable provision to the effect:
         (a)   That all bills are due and payable on or before the date set
forth on the bill; and
         (b)   That if any bill is not paid by or before that date, a $5 charge
will be charged; after the account is 60 days overdue, a disconnect notice will
be mailed containing a cut-off notice that if the bill is not paid within 10
days of the mailing of the disconnect notice, service will be discontinued for
nonpayment; and

service to a customer for nonpayment of bills, service will be reinstated only
after all bills for service then due have been paid, along with a turn-on
charge in the sum of $25 during regular operating hours; on weekends, holidays,
nights and after-hours, the charge will be $150.
      (4)   If the customer requests a hearing before the date specified, a
hearing shall be held on the matter by Council at the next scheduled regular
Council meeting.
      (5) If, as a result of the hearing, the City Council finds that the
amount claimed to be owing is actually due and unpaid and that there is no
legal reason why the water supply of the delinquent customer may not be shut
off in accordance with the ordinance, the city may shut off the supply.
      (6)   Service shut-offs and turn-ons for seasonal residents; after hours
the fee will be $150 per time.

§ 55.01 APPLICABILITY AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   This chapter shall apply to all water entering the sanitary sewer
system unless explicitly exempted by the city. The city and its representatives
are authorized to administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this
chapter.
   (B)   The City Council finds that the discharge of water from roof, surface,
groundwater, sump pump, footing tile, swimming pools, or other natural
precipitation into the municipal sanitary sewer system has the potential to
cause property damage and overload the city’s sanitary sewer system. The City
Council therefore finds it essential for the maintenance of health,
minimization of property damage, and to maintain the life and capacity of the
wastewater treatment system that the provisions of this chapter be strictly
enforced.

Failure to comply with this section shall constitute a violation.
      (2)   Removal by city. The City Clerk/Treasurer or other person
designated by the City Council may cause removal from all public sidewalks all

cost of removal adjacent to each separate lot and parcel.
   (C)   Public health and safety hazards. When the city removes or eliminates
public health or safety hazards from private property under the following
provisions of this chapter, the administrative officer responsible for doing
the work shall keep a record of the cost of the removal or elimination against
each parcel of property affected and annually deliver that information to the
City Clerk/Treasurer.
   (D)   Installation and repair of water service lines. Whenever the city

City Clerk/Treasurer.
      (2)   Inspections; notice. The City Council or its designee shall make
inspections as are necessary to determine that public sidewalks and alleys

and the driver shall be jointly and severally liable for any damage. Any person
who willfully acts or fails to exercise due care and by that act damages any
public property shall be liable for the amount thereof, which amount shall be
collectable by action or as a lien under M.S. § 514.67, as it may be amended
from time to time.

footage of the lot by the general lot depth of the subdivision for pie-shaped
lots and irregular shaped lots where other rules do not apply;
      (3)   Where frontage curves so greatly as to give a general appearance of
a corner, the lot shall be considered a corner lot and equivalent front
footage, as well as side footage where required, determined on the basis of an
irregularly shaped lot; and
      (4)   Where a lot consists of a combination of rectangular and pie-shaped
or irregular portions, the equivalent front footage shall be determined as the

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 118.01 ADOPTION OF STATE LAW BY REFERENCE.
   The provisions of M.S. Ch. 340A, as they may be amended from time to time,
with reference to the definition of terms, conditions of operation,
restrictions on consumption, provisions relating to sales, hours of sale, and
all other matters pertaining to the retail sale, distribution, and consumption
of intoxicating liquor and 3.2% malt liquor are hereby adopted by reference and
are made a part of this Chapter as if set out in full. It is the intention of
the City Council that all future amendments to M.S. Ch. 340A are hereby adopted
by reference or referenced as if they had been in existence at the time this
Chapter is adopted.
§ 118.02 CITY MAY BE MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN STATE LAW.
   The Council is authorized by the provisions of M.S. § 340A.509, as it may be
amended from time to time, to impose, and has imposed in this chapter,
additional restrictions on the sale and possession of alcoholic beverages
within its limits beyond those contained in M.S. Ch. 340A, as it may be amended
from time to time.
§ 118.03 DEFINITIONS.
   In addition to the definitions contained in M.S. § 340A.101, as it may be
amended from time to time, the following terms are defined for purposes of this
chapter:
   LIQUOR. As used in this chapter, without modification by the words
“intoxicating” or “3.2% malt,” includes both INTOXICATING LIQUOR and 3.2% MALT
LIQUOR.
   RESTAURANT. An eating facility, other than a hotel, under the control of a
single proprietor or manager, where meals are regularly prepared on the
premises, where full waitress/waiter table service is provided, where a
customer orders food from printed menus and where the main food course is
served and consumed while seated at a single location. To be a RESTAURANT as
defined by this section, an establishment shall have a license from the state
as required by M.S. § 157.16, as it may be amended from time to time, and meet
the definition of either a “small establishment,” “medium establishment” or
“large establishment” as defined in M.S. § 157.16, Subd. 3d, as it may be
amended from time to time. An establishment which serves prepackaged food that
receives heat treatment and is served in the package or frozen pizza that is
heated and served, shall not be considered to be a restaurant for purposes of
this chapter unless it meets the definitions of “small establishment”, “medium
establishment” or “large establishment.”
§ 118.04 NUDITY ON THE PREMISES OF LICENSED ESTABLISHMENTS PROHIBITED.
   (A)   The City Council finds that it is in the best interests of the public
health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the city that nudity is
prohibited as provided in this section on the premises of any establishment
licensed under this chapter. This is to protect and assist the owners,
operators, and employees of the establishment, as well as patrons and the
public in general, from harm stemming from the physical immediacy and
combination of alcohol, nudity, and sex. The Council especially intends to
prevent any subliminal endorsement of sexual harassment or activities likely to
lead to the possibility of various criminal conduct, including prostitution,
sexual assault, and disorderly conduct. The Council also finds that the
prohibition of nudity on the premises of any establishment licensed under this
chapter, as set forth in this section, reflects the prevailing community
standards of the city.
   (B)   It is unlawful for any licensee to permit or allow any person or
persons on the licensed premises when the person does not have his or her
buttocks, anus, breasts, and genitals covered with a non- transparent material.
It is unlawful for any person to be on the licensed premises when the person
does not have his or her buttocks, anus, breasts, and genitals covered with a
non-transparent material.
   (C) A violation of this section is a misdemeanor punishable as provided by
law, and is justification for revocation or suspension of any liquor, wine, or
3.2% malt liquor license or the imposition of a civil penalty under the
provisions of §
118.99(B).
Penalty, see § 118.99
§ 118.05 CONSUMPTION IN PUBLIC PLACES.
   No person shall consume intoxicating liquor or 3.2% malt liquor in a public
park, on any public street, sidewalk, parking lot or alley, or in any public
place other than on the premises of an establishment licensed under this
chapter, in a municipal liquor dispensary if one exists in the city, or where
the consumption and display of liquor is lawfully permitted.
Penalty, see § 118.99
LICENSING
§ 118.20 NUMBER OF LICENSES WHICH MAY BE ISSUED.
   State law establishes the number of liquor licenses that a city may issue,
as provided under M.S. § 340A.413, as it may be amended from time to time. The
Council in its sound discretion may provide by ordinance that a larger number
of licenses may be issued up to the number of licenses authorized by M.S. Ch.
340A, as it may be amended from time to time. If a larger number of licenses in
a particular category has been authorized by a referendum held under the
provisions of M.S. § 340A.413, Subd. 3, as it may be amended from time to time,
but not all of them have been issued, the larger number of licenses is no
longer in effect until the Council by ordinance determines that any or all of
the licenses may be issued. The Council is not required to issue the full
number of licenses that it has available.
(Am. Ord. 88, passed 2-4-2013)
§ 118.21 TERM AND EXPIRATION OF LICENSES.
   Each license shall be issued for a maximum period of 1 year. All licenses,
except temporary licenses, shall expire on January 14 of each year unless
another date is provided by ordinance. All licenses shall expire on the same
date. Temporary licenses expire according to their terms. Consumption and
display permits issued by the Commissioner of Public Safety, and the
accompanying city consent to the permit, shall expire on March 31 of each year.
§ 118.22 LICENSE FEES; PRO RATA.
   (A)   No license or other fee established by the city shall exceed any limit
established by M.S. Ch. 340A, as it may be amended from time to time, for a
liquor license. Temporary “on-sale” licenses shall be granted only to bona fide
clubs and charitable, religious, and non-profit organizations for the sale of
beer for consumption on the premises only.
   (B)   The Council may establish from time to time in the Ordinance
Establishing Fees and Charges the fee for any of the liquor licenses it is
authorized to issue. The license fee may not exceed the cost of issuing the
license and other costs directly related to the enforcement of the liquor laws
and this chapter. No liquor license fee shall be increased without providing
mailed notice of a hearing on the proposed increase to all affected licensees
at least 30 days before the hearing.
   (C)   The fee for all licenses, except temporary licenses, granted after the
commencement of the license year shall be prorated on a quarterly basis.
   (D)   All license fees shall be paid in full at the time the application is
filed with the city. If the application is denied, the license fee shall be
returned to the applicant.
   (E)   A refund of a pro rata share of an annual license fee may occur only
if authorized by M.S. § 340A.408, Subd. 5, as it may be amended from time to
time.
(Am. Ord. 1-2008, passed 3-3-2008)
§ 118.23 COUNCIL DISCRETION TO GRANT OR DENY A LICENSE.
   The Council in its sound discretion may either grant or deny the application
for any license or for the transfer or renewal of any license. No applicant has
a right to a license under this chapter.
§ 118.24 APPLICATION FOR LICENSE.
   (A)   Form. Every application for a license issued under this chapter shall
be on a form provided by the city. Every application shall state the name of
the applicant, the applicant's age, representations as to the applicant's
character, with references as the Council may require, the type of license
applied for, the business in connection with which the proposed license will
operate and its location, a description of the premises, whether the applicant
is owner and operator of the business, how long the applicant has been in that
business at that place, and other information as the Council may require from
time to time. An application for an on-sale intoxicating liquor license shall
be in the form prescribed by the Commissioner of Public Safety and shall also
contain the information required in this section. The form shall be verified
and filed with the city. No person shall make a false statement in an
application.
   (B)   Financial responsibility. Prior to the issuance of any license under
this chapter, the applicant shall demonstrate proof of financial responsibility
as defined in M.S. § 340A.409, as it may be amended from time to time, with
regard to liability under M.S. § 340A.801, as it may be amended from time to
time. This proof will be filed with the city and the Commissioner of Public
Safety. Any liability insurance policy filed as proof of financial
responsibility under this section shall conform to M.S. § 340A.409, as it may
be amended from time to time. Operation of a business which is required to be
licensed by this chapter without having on file with the city at all times
effective proof of financial responsibility is a cause for revocation of the
license.
Penalty, see § 118.99
§ 118.25 DESCRIPTION OF PREMISES.
   The application shall specifically describe the compact and contiguous
premises within which liquor may be dispensed and consumed. The description may
not include any parking lot or sidewalk.
§ 118.26 APPLICATIONS FOR RENEWAL.
   At least 30 days before a license issued under this chapter is to be
renewed, an application for renewal shall be filed with the city. The decision
whether or not to renew a license rests within the sound discretion of the
Council. No licensee has a right to have the license renewed.
(Am. Ord. 88, passed 2-4-2013)
§ 118.27 TRANSFER OF LICENSE.
   No license issued under this chapter may be transferred without the approval
of the Council. Any transfer of stock of a corporate licensee is deemed to be a
transfer of the license, and a transfer of stock without prior Council approval
is a ground for revocation of the license. An application to transfer a license
shall be treated the same as an application for a new license, and all of the
provisions of this code applying to applications for a license shall apply.
Penalty, see § 118.99
§ 118.28 INVESTIGATION.
   (A)   Preliminary background and financial investigation. On an initial
application for a license, on an application for transfer of a license and, in
the sound discretion of the Council that it is in the public interest to do so,
on an application for renewal of a license, the city shall conduct a
preliminary background and financial investigation of the applicant or it may
contract with the Commissioner of Public Safety for the investigation. The
applicant shall pay with the application an investigation fee of $500 which
shall be in addition to any license fee. If the cost of the preliminary
investigation is less than $500, the unused balance shall be returned to the
applicant. The results of the preliminary investigation shall be sent to the
Commissioner of Public Safety if the application is for an on-sale intoxicating
liquor license or an on-sale wine license.
   (B)   Comprehensive background and financial investigation. If the results
of a preliminary investigation warrant, in the sound discretion of the Council,
a comprehensive background and financial investigation, the Council may either
conduct the investigation itself or contract with the Commissioner of Public
Safety for the investigation. The investigation fee for this comprehensive
background and financial investigation to be paid by the applicant shall be
$500, less any amount paid for the initial investigation if the investigation
is to be conducted within the state, and $10,000, less any amount paid for the
initial investigation, if the investigation is required outside the state. The
unused balance of the fee shall be returned to the applicant whether or not the
application is denied. The fee shall be paid in advance of any investigation
and the amount actually expended on the investigation shall not be refundable
in the event the application is denied. The results of the comprehensive
investigation shall be sent to the Commissioner of Public Safety if the
application is for an on-sale intoxicating liquor license or an on-sale wine
license.
§ 118.29 HEARING AND ISSUANCE.
   The Council shall investigate all facts set out in the application and not
investigated in the preliminary or comprehensive background and financial
investigations. Opportunity shall be given to any person to be heard for or
against the granting of the license. After the investigation and hearing, the
Council shall in its sound discretion grant or deny the application. No license
shall become effective until the proof of financial security has been approved
by the Commissioner of Public Safety.
§ 118.30 RESTRICTIONS ON ISSUANCE.
   (A)   Each license shall be issued only to the applicant for the premises
described in the application.
   (B)   Not more than 1 license shall be directly or indirectly issued within
the city to any 1 person.
   (C)   No license shall be granted or renewed for operation on any premises
on which taxes, assessments, utility charges, service charges, or other
financial claims of the city are delinquent and unpaid.
   (D)   No license shall be issued for any place or any business ineligible
for a license under state law.
   (E)   No license shall be issued to any person who is not a resident of the
state. If the applicant is a corporation, all of the shareholders shall be
residents of the state. The provisions of this division (E) shall not apply to
any license existing on the effective date of this chapter or to the renewal of
an existing license.
(Am. Ord. 88, passed 2-4-2013)
Penalty, see § 118.99
§ 118.31 CONDITIONS OF LICENSE.
   The failure of a licensee to meet any one of the conditions of the license
specified below shall result in a suspension of the license until the condition
is met.
   (A)   Every licensee is responsible for the conduct of the place of business
and the conditions of sobriety and order in it. The act of any employee on the
licensed premises is deemed the act of the licensee as well, and the licensee
shall be liable to all penalties provided by this chapter and the law equally
with the employee.
   (B)   Every licensee shall allow any peace officer, health officer, city
employee, or any other person designated by the Council to conduct compliance
checks and to otherwise enter, inspect, and search the premises of the licensee
during business hours, and after business hours during the time when customers

118.55, no intoxicating liquor may be sold at retail elsewhere in the city.
Penalty, see § 118.99

additional off-sale and on-sale stores at other locations as it may, from time
to time, by motion, determine.
§ 118.53 OPERATION.
   (A)   Manager. The municipal liquor store shall be in the immediate charge
of a Liquor Store Manager selected by the Council and paid compensation as is
fixed by the Council. The Manager shall not be a person who would be prohibited
by law or any provision of this chapter from being eligible for an intoxicating
liquor license. The Manager shall furnish a surety bond to the city,
conditioned upon the faithful discharge of the duties of the office, in a sum
as specified by the Council. The bond premium may be paid by the city or the
Manager, in the discretion of the Council. The Manager shall operate the
municipal liquor store under the Council's direction and shall perform those
duties in connection with the store as may be established by the Council. The
Manager shall be responsible to the Council for the conduct of the store in
full compliance with this chapter and with the laws relating to the sale of
intoxicating liquor and 3.2% malt liquor.
   (B)   Other employees. The Council may also appoint additional employees as

Manager, shall hold their positions at the pleasure of the Council. No person
under the age of 18 shall be employed in the store. The Council may require the
employees to furnish surety bonds conditioned for the faithful discharge of
their duties in a sum as specified by the Council. The premium on the bond may
be paid by the city or the employees, as the Council determines.
   (C)   Municipal liquor store fund. All of the revenues received from the
operation of a municipal liquor store shall be deposited in a municipal liquor
store fund from which all ordinary operating expenses, including compensation

municipal purpose. The handling of municipal liquor store receipts and
disbursements shall comply with the procedure prescribed by law and charter for

   (A)   On-sale licenses for the sale of intoxicating liquor. The Council may
issue in its sound discretion on-sale licenses to a club under M.S. § 340A.404,
Subd. 1(4), as it may be amended from time to time. If the voters have
authorized their issuance at a special election called for that purpose, the
Council may issue in its sound discretion on-sale liquor licenses to hotels and
restaurants. The number of on-sale licenses issued under this section is
governed by M.S. § 340A.413, as it may be amended from time to time, as limited
by the provisions of this chapter. The issuance of these licenses is governed
by the provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   Off-sale licenses for the sale of intoxicating liquor. State law does
not authorize the issuance of off-sale licenses for the sale of intoxicating
liquor by cities which operate a municipal liquor dispensary.
   (C)   On- and off-sale 3.2% malt liquor licenses. The Council may issue 3.2%
malt liquor licenses in its sound discretion as provided in this chapter.
   (D)   Wine licenses. The Council may issue in its sound discretion wine
licenses to a restaurant under M.S. § 340A.404, Subd. 5, as it may be amended
from time to time. Any such wine licenses issued by the Council shall authorize
the sale of wine all days of the week, including Sunday. For purposes of this
section, WINE shall be defined as wine of up to 14% alcohol by volume that is
served with the consumption of food. Any restaurant licensed to sell wine under
this section may permit a person purchasing a full bottle of wine in
conjunction with a purchase of a meal to remove the bottle upon leaving the
licensed premises, provided that the bottle has been opened and its contents
partially consumed.
   (E)   Off-sale license. A microdistillery may be issued a license by the
local licensing authority for off-sale of distilled spirits. The license may
allow the sale of one .375 milliliter bottle per customer per day of product
manufactured on-site, subject to the following requirements:

§ 151.01 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to control, through zoning regulations,
certain land uses that have a direct and detrimental effect on the character of
the city’s residential and commercial neighborhoods.
   (B)   The City Council specifically recognizes the sanctity and fundamental
nature of free speech and does not intend to regulate or ban speech based on
content.
§ 151.02 FINDINGS.
   The City Council makes the following findings regarding the effect sexually-
oriented businesses have on the character of the city’s neighborhoods. In
making these findings, the City Council accepts the recommendations and
conclusions of the Report of the Attorney General’s Working Group on the
Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses, dated June 6, 1989. This Chapter
151 shall have no force and effect until the City Council accepts these
recommendations by resolution of a majority of its members.
   (A)   Sexually oriented businesses have an impact on the neighborhoods
surrounding them which is distinct from the impact caused by other uses.
   (B)   Residential and commercial neighborhoods located within close
proximity to sexually oriented businesses experience the following negative
impacts:
      (1)   Increased crime rates, particularly in sex-related crimes such as
rapes, prostitution, indecent exposure and other lewd and lascivious behavior;
      (2)   Property values which are either diminished or fail to appreciate
at the rate of other comparable properties not located in proximity to sexually
oriented businesses;
      (3)   Increased transiency and decreased stability of ownership;
      (4)   Deteriorated neighborhood appearance from litter and graffiti;
      (5)   Sex-related harassment of residents and customers by motorists and
pedestrians;
      (6)   A perception that the area is unsafe; and
      (7)   Difficulty in attracting and retaining customers, employees and
desirable tenants.
   (C)   The adverse impacts which sexually oriented businesses have on
surrounding areas diminish as the distance from the sexually oriented business
increases.
   (D)   The adverse impacts of sexually oriented businesses are exacerbated
when the uses are located near each other.
   (E)   The presence of liquor establishments in the immediate vicinity of
sexually oriented businesses also compounds the adverse impacts on the
neighborhood.
   (F)   Sexually oriented businesses can exert a dehumanizing influence on
persons attending places of worship, children attending day care centers or
schools, and people using public parks and libraries.
   (G)   Sexually oriented businesses can significantly contribute to the
deterioration of residential neighborhoods and can impair the character and
quality of the residential housing in the area where they are located, thereby
exacerbating the shortage of affordable and habitable housing for city
residents.
   (H)   (1)   The concentration of sexually oriented businesses in 1 area can
have a substantially detrimental effect on that area and on the overall quality
of urban life.
      (2)   A cycle of decay can result from the influx and concentration of
sexually oriented businesses. The presence of like businesses is perceived by
others as an indication that the area is deteriorating and the result can be
devastating: other businesses move out of the vicinity and residents flee from
the area.
      (3)   The resulting decline in real estate values erodes the city’s tax
base and contributes to overall urban blight.
   (I)   Land-use regulations are appropriate to minimize the detrimental
effects that sexually oriented businesses have on adjacent land uses.
