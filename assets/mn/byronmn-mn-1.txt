§ 33.24 EMERGENCY AUTHORITY.
   Any ordinance, resolution, rule or regulation inconsistent with an emergency
regulation promulgated by the Mayor shall be suspended during the period of

emergency the city is, notwithstanding any statutory or charter provision to
the contrary, empowered to enter into contracts and incur obligations necessary
to combat such disaster by protecting the health and safety of persons and
property, and by providing emergency assistance to the victims of such
disaster. The city may exercise such powers in the light of the exigencies of
the disaster without compliance with time-consuming procedures and formalities
prescribed by law pertaining to the performance of public work, entering into
contracts, incurring of obligations, employment of temporary workers, rental of
equipment, purchase of supplies and materials, limitations upon tax levies, and

maintenance of the office of civil defense and other expenditures for civil
defense. Regular accounting, disbursement, purchasing and other financial
procedures of the city shall apply to the civil defense fund insofar as
practicable. Budgeting requirements of the city shall apply except in any case
when their application will prevent compliance with terms and conditions of a
federal or state grant of money or property for civil defense purposes or
prevent the taking of adequate measures to meet a declared civil defense
emergency.
(Ord. passed 3-11-09)
§ 33.26 ANNUAL REPORT.

§ 33.30 JOINING WITH COUNTY CIVIL DEFENSE.
   To the end that the civil defense functions and responsibilities of this
city may be discharged in the most comprehensive, effective and economical
manner possible under law, and recognizing the artificiality of territorial
limits of municipalities and political subdivisions of this state in times of
civil defense emergencies, especially those created by hostile enemy action or
attack, the council acknowledges the desirability of joining with the County of
Olmsted. Minnesota, to form a common civil defense organization under the
provisions of M.S. § 12.25, subd. 5 and M.S. § 471.59. Such a common civil
defense organization may be officially established by the execution of an
agreement between the City of Byron and the County of Olmsted, approved by the
Governor of the State of Minnesota, setting forth in detail the form,
procedures, powers, duties and other matters necessary to the formation,
organization, operation, maintenance, regulation and dissolution of such common
civil defense organization. The extent that the provisions of this chapter are
consistent with the provisions of such agreement, they shall be deemed a part
thereof; but to the extent that the provisions of this chapter are inconsistent
or in conflict with the provisions of such agreement shall be paramount and
shall govern.

actually due and unpaid and that there is no legal reason why the water supply
of the continuously delinquent customer may not be shut off in accordance with
this chapter, the city may shut off the supply.

deem necessary to prevent any substance or matter passing into the public sewer
which may cause a deposit or obstruction therein. In addition to any penalties
that may be imposed for violating this section, if a person refuses or neglects
to install a catch basin or waste trap or to clean out, repair or alter the
same, if one exists, for a period of five days, the Superintendent may cause
such work to be done as deemed necessary at the expense of the owner or person
having charge of the premises.
   (L)   In addition to any penalties that may be imposed for violation of any
provision of this chapter, the city may assess against any person the cost of
repairing or restoring sewers or associated facilities damaged as a result of
the discharge of prohibited wastes by such person and may collect such
assessment as an additional charge for the use of the public sewer system or in
any other manner deemed appropriate by the city.
   (M)   The owner or operator of any motor vehicle washing or servicing
facility shall provide and maintain in serviceable condition at all times a
catch basin or waste trap in the building drain system to prevent grease, oil,
dirt or any mineral deposit from entering the public sewer system.
   (N)   The owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying
industrial wastes may, at the discretion of the city, be required to provide
laboratory measurements, tests and analyses of waters or wastes to illustrate
compliance with this chapter and any special condition for discharge
established by the city or regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over the
discharge. The number, type and frequency of sampling and laboratory analyses
to be performed by the owner shall be as stipulated by the city. The industry
must supply a complete analysis of the constituents of the wastewater discharge
to assure that compliance with the federal, state and local standards are being
met. The owner shall report the results of measurements and laboratory analyses
to the city at such times and in such manner as is prescribed by the city. The
owner shall bear the expense of all measurements, analyses and reporting
required by the city. At such times as deemed necessary, the city reserves the
right to take measurements and samples for analysis by an outside laboratory.

DISCHARGING INTO THE SANITARY SEWER SYSTEM
§ 51.35 PURPOSE.
   In adopting this subchapter, the City Council finds that the discharge of
water from any roof, surface, ground, sump pump, footing tile or swimming pool
or other natural precipitation into the city sanitary sewer collection system
will and has on numerous occasions in the past flooded and over-loaded the
sanitary sewer collection system to such an extent as to cause damage to
residential property and over-loaded the Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP).
Such damage is caused by the backup of sewage of the WWTP. The City Council,
therefore, finds it essential to the maintenance of health, minimization of
damage to property and to maintain the life and capacity of the WWTP that the
provisions of this subchapter be strictly enforced to avoid and minimize these
problems in the future.

   (A)   No water from any roof, surface, ground, sump pump, footing tile,
swimming pool, defective laterals, or other natural precipitation shall be
discharged into the sanitary sewer collection system. Dwellings, including new
housing construction or houses under construction, and other buildings and
structures which require, because of the infiltration of water into basements,
crawl spaces and the like, a sump pump system to discharge water shall have a
permanently installed discharge line which shall not at any time discharge
water into the sanitary sewer collection system. Where a sump pit exists in any
such building, it shall have a pump installed; no empty pits shall be
permitted. A permanent installation shall be one which provides for a year-
round discharge connection to the city subdrain/storm sewer system. If there is
no subdrain available, the surface discharge point shall be located no closer
than four feet from the curb or as approved by the city. No discharge shall be
directed so as to impact neighboring properties or any city street, sidewalk or
right-of-way. The discharge connection shall consist of a rigid discharge line,
without valving or quick connections for altering the path of discharge and, if
connected to the city subdrain/storm sewer line, include a check valve. The
city may allow installation of a locked "winter/summer" valve in individual
circumstances to abate nuisance icing where no subdrain/storm sewer and other
reasonable alternative exists, only with review and express permission of the
city.
   (B)   A sump pump will be allowed to have a surface discharge line when city
subdrain is available if a gravity footing drain connection has been made. This
secondary sump pump connection is only allowed if a gravity footing connection
to the city's subdrain/storm sewer system has been made and approved by the
city. The secondary sump pump connection is only intended to serve as a back-up
to the city's subdrain/storm sewer system.

sanitary sewer system shall disconnect and/or remove the same. Any disconnects
or openings in the sanitary sewer shall be closed or repaired in a manner as
approved by the City Engineer or his or her representative.

section by contracting with a licensed plumber who is authorized to do business
in the city to perform such inspection. Such plumber shall inspect the owner's
property and shall complete, sign and return an inspection form to the city
documenting the results of the inspection. The inspection form shall be
furnished to the property owner or licensed plumber upon request. All costs
associated with an inspection by a licensed plumber retained by the property
owner under this section shall be the responsibility of the property owner.
   (C)   The property owner shall have a period of 30 days from the date the
city sends a written notice to the owner requesting admittance to the owner's
property for an inspection to either allow a city inspection of the property or
to contract with a licensed plumber to perform the inspection and notify the
city of the results thereof. Such inspection, whether performed by the city
inspector, or by the licensed plumber hired by the property owner, shall be
completed within said 30 day period. Upon completion of a city inspection of a
property, or upon the city's receipt of an inspection form from the licensed
plumber hired by the owner of the property, the city shall determine whether
any such property is improperly discharging stormwater into the city sanitary
sewer system; then the owner shall have a period of 90 days from the date the
city send such written notice to the owner to obtain a plumbing permit, to
disconnect the owner's sump pump or other prohibited discharge into the city
sanitary sewer system, and to request re-inspection, certifying that all work
necessary to disconnect the owner's sump pump or other prohibited discharge
from said property into the city sanitary sewer system has been completed. All
work that is necessary to comply with the provisions of this division which
requires the issuance of any plumbing, building, or other permit under this
Code shall be inspected by the city Inspection Services Division for compliance
with all applicable City Code requirements.

52.02   Establishment of a storm water utility fee
   
52.03   Definitions
   
52.04   Rates and charges
§ 52.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the storm water utility is to provide a funding mechanism for
the following services:
   (A)   The administration, planning, implementation, operations and
maintenance of the storm water best management practices (BMPs) to reduce the
maintenance and removal of sediment and other pollutants into local water
resources;
   (B)   The operation, maintenance and replacement of public drainage systems;
   (C)   Activities necessary to maintain compliance with the National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit requirements established
by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, including preparation,
implementation and management of a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan
(SWPPP) to address the following control measures:
      (1)   Public education and outreach on storm water impacts;
      (2)   Public involvement and participation;
      (3)   Illicit discharge detection and elimination;
      (4)   Construction site storm water runoff control;
      (5)   Post-construction runoff control in new development and
redevelopment; and
      (6)   Pollution prevention for municipal operations;
   (D)   Other education, engineering, inspection, monitoring, testing and
enforcement activities as necessary to maintain compliance with local, state
and federal storm water requirements.
(Ord. 52, passed 10-8-08)
§ 52.02 ESTABLISHMENT OF A STORM WATER UTILITY FEE.
   There is established a public utility to be known as the Storm Water Utility
for the City of Byron. The storm water utility will be operated as a public
utility pursuant to the city code and applicable statutes. The revenues are
subject to provisions of this section and M.S. § 444.075. The storm water
utility is part of the Public Works Department and will be administered by the
Public Works Director. This chapter applies to the entire City of Byron.
(Ord. 52, passed 10-8-08)
§ 52.03 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   RESIDENTIAL EQUIVALENCY FACTOR (REF). The ratio of the volume of runoff
generated by a unit area of a particular land use to the volume of runoff
generated by a unit area of single-family residential property based on typical
surface conditions and average annual rainfall.
   UNIT AREA. For purpose of this chapter, the UNIT AREA (“UA”) of a given
parcel will be determined by the following formula:
      First, the maximum residential unit area of a residential lot in the city
is set at 10,890 square feet, then, this area is divided by 43,560 square feet
equaling .25. The maximum residential UNIT AREA value for any residential lot
parcel will be .25.
(Ord. 52, passed 10-8-08)
§ 52.04 RATES AND CHARGES.
   (A)   Calculation of utility charge. The charges to be made against a given
parcel of land will then be determined by multiplying the unit rate (UR) by the
parcel’s REF times the parcel’s unit area (UA) times the impervious rate. And,
the City Council may adopt changes to these rates by resolution during the year
by a majority vote of the City Council.
   (B)   Adjustments to charges. The City Council may adopt by policies
providing for the adjustment of charges for parcels or groups of parcels based
upon hydrologic data supplied by affected property owners, demonstrating an
actual hydrologic response substantially different from the REF being used for
the parcel or parcels. Such adjustment will be made only after receiving the
recommendation of the Public Works Director, and will not be made effective
retroactively. If the adjustment would have the effect of changing the REF for
all or substantially all of the land uses in a particular classification, such
adjustment will be accomplished by amending this chapter.
   (C)   Adjustment to area. The total parcel area as shown in the County
Assessor’s records will be used to calculate the parcel unit area (UA). It is
the responsibility of the owner or manager of any premises to provide the city
with necessary land surveys and other information as the city may reasonably
request to determine if a parcel, or a portion of a parcel, qualifies for an
exception or an area adjustment. Requests for exceptions and/or adjustments
will be reviewed after the receipt of all required information. Exceptions and/
or adjustments must be approved by the Director of Public Works with
discussions with City Engineer and City Administrator, and will become
effective at the beginning of the next billing cycle following approval.
   (D)   Exceptions. Accounts that are billed annually are exempted from any
fixed charge in place at this time (FC). The following land uses are exempt
from the storm water utility fees established herein:
      (1)   Public street right-of-way;
      (2)   Wetlands and public waters as defined by state law;
      (3)   Purposes up to the 100-year flood elevation;
      (4)   Undeveloped parcels;
      (5)   Publicly-owned park lands, natural areas, and recreational fields;
      (6)   Railroad right-of-way;
      (7)   Cemeteries,
      (8)   Unsewered parcels situated within the AG (Agricultural) zoning
districts of the city; and
      (9)   City-owned land. Golf courses are an exempt use except for the club
house/building/paved surface portions thereof. (Somerby)
   (E)   Falsification of information. Willful failure to provide information
that the city reasonably requests related to the use, development and area of a
premises, or falsification of such nformation, will constitute a violation of
this chapter.
   (F)   Estimated charges. If, for any reason, precise information related to
the use, development or area of a premises is not available, then storm water
utility charges for such premise will be estimated, and billed, based upon
information available to the city.
   (G)   Billing method. Storm water utility fees will be computed and
collected by the city together with other city utility fees, in accordance with
the procedures set forth in this code.
   (H)   Delinquent accounts. Storm water utility fees past due on October 1 of
any year may be certified to the County Auditor for collection with real estate
taxes during the following year or any year thereafter in the manner prescribed
in this code.

§ 90.20 VETERAN'S MEMORIAL.
   (A)   Findings and purpose. The City Council finds that there should be an
area within the city's park and open space system set aside exclusively as a
memorial to and to honor our nation's, state's and city's men and women
currently serving in or who have served in the Armed Forces of the United
States. The Veterans Memorial located within Byron Roundabout area and
described below herein is hereby so designated. The Veterans Memorial is hereby
set aside for purposes of the public honoring and remembering the service and
sacrifice of our Nation's veterans and that certain other activities
inconsistent with such purpose, when the same may freely occur in the city's
other extensive public park and open space areas, inherently contravene,
interfere with and are injurious to such purpose. Accordingly, the city has a
compelling interest in imposing time, place and manner restrictions on those
activities inconsistent with the purpose for which the Veteran’s Memorial is
designated on a content neutral basis and in a manner that does not
unreasonably infringe upon the rights of the city's inhabitants and visitors to
engage in free speech or the free exercise of religion. Therefore, the rules of
this section define the standards of conduct required of all the city's
inhabitants and visitors to the Veterans Memorial, which is a shrine to honor
present and past members of the Armed Forces of the United States and contains
monuments for the Civil War, World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Desert
Storm and an All Wars Monument. In addition, POWs, MIAs, Gold Star Spouses and
Parents, and Purple Heart holders are also honored.
   (B)   Definitions. When used in this section:
      (1)   Veterans Memorial or Memorial means the area located between 10th
Avenue and westerly line of the round about/Byron monument sign and between
Canadian Pacific Railroad property and Frontage Road NE.
      (2)   Military memorial service or ceremony means a formal group activity
conducted by an established military service group intended to honor the active
service or memory of members of the Armed Forces.
   (C)   Conduct within Veteran’s Memorial. Because the Veteran’s Memorial is a
shrine, certain acts, appropriate elsewhere in Byron, are not appropriate
within the Veteran’s Memorial. All visitors, including those attending or
taking part in memorial services, shall observe proper standards of conduct,
decorum and decency. Specifically, no person shall:
      (1)   Deface, climb on, sit on, stand on or otherwise damage any
monuments located within the Memorial;
      (2)   Use the memorial grounds for playing sports or participating in
athletics;
      (3)   Use the memorial grounds for grilling or other cooking activities;
      (4)   Erect a tent, hammock or other structure unless the use of the same
is part of a military memorial service or ceremony authorized by this section;
      (5)   Ride a bicycle or skateboard or use rollerblades within the
memorial; unless going through the area on the bike path.
      (6)   Deposit or throw litter on/in memorial grounds;
      (7)   Drive any motor vehicle within the memorial other than in the
parking lot;
      (8)   Engage in any disorderly conduct as defined in statute or city code
within the memorial;
      (9)   Display or distribute commercial advertising for the purpose of
soliciting business or otherwise solicit business while within the memorial; or
      (10)   Be within the boundaries of the memorial between the hours of 10:
00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m. of the following day.

city personnel or emergency or city vehicles, including without limitation
police vehicles, fire vehicles, ambulances and city, county or state
snowplowing vehicles, the use of sirens, warning devices, sound amplification
devices or other equipment by public safety personnel or other city personnel
in emergency situations or otherwise.
      (2)   Emergency or other city work. Activities or work by city personnel
in the performance of emergency work to preserve the public health, safety, or
welfare, or in the performance of emergency work necessary to restore a public
service or eliminate a public hazard or such other work as the City
Administrator or City Council deems necessary or appropriate in the public
interest.
      (3)   Government sponsored or permitted or licensed activities. Those
certain government, and/or government permitted or licensed activities shall be
exempt from the provisions of this section.
   (E)   Any person convicted of violating any provision of this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor.
(Ord. passed 7-25-17)
§ 90.99 PENALTY.
   Any person found guilty of violating this chapter shall be guilty of a petty

free from unnecessary encumbrances.
   (B)   Accordingly, the city hereby enacts this new chapter of this code
relating to right-of-way permits and administration. This chapter imposes
reasonable regulation on the placement and maintenance of facilities and
equipment currently within its rights-of-way or to be placed therein at some
future time. It is intended to complement the regulatory roles of state and
Federal agencies. Under this chapter, persons excavating and obstructing the
rights-of-way will bear financial responsibility for their work. Finally, this
chapter provides for recovery of out-of-pocket and projected costs from persons
using the public rights-of-way.
   (C)   This chapter shall be interpreted consistently with 1997 Session Laws,
Chapter 123, substantially codified in M.S. §§ 237.16, 237.162, 237.163,

amending the Act, and the other laws governing applicable rights of the city
and users of the right-of-way. This chapter shall also be interpreted
consistent with Minn. Rules 7819.0050-7819.9950 and Minn. Rules, Ch. 7560 where
possible. To the extent any provision of this chapter cannot be interpreted
consistently with the Minnesota Rules, that interpretation most consistent with
the Act and other applicable statutory and case law is intended. This chapter
shall not be interpreted to limit the regulatory and police powers of the city
to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to protect the health,
safety, and welfare of the public.

§ 92.13 RIGHT-OF-WAY PATCHING AND RESTORATION.
   (A)   Timing. The work to be done under the excavation permit, and the
patching and restoration of the right-of-way as required herein, must be
completed within the dates specified in the permit, increased by as many days
as work could not be done because of circumstances beyond the control of the
permittee or when work was prohibited as unseasonal or unreasonable under §
92.16.
   (B)   Patch and restoration. Permittee shall patch its own work. The city
may choose either to have the permittee restore the right-of-way or to restore
the right-of-way itself.
      (1)   City restoration. If the city restores the right-of-way, permittee
shall pay the costs thereof within 30 days of billing. If, following such
restoration, the pavement settles due to permittee's improper backfilling, the
permittee shall pay to the city, within 30 days of billing, all costs
associated with correcting the defective work.
      (2)   Permittee restoration. If the permittee restores the right-of-way
itself, it shall at the time of application for an excavation permit post a
construction performance bond in accordance with the provisions of Minn. Rule
7819.3000.
      (3)   Degradation fee in lieu of restoration. In lieu of right-of-way
restoration, a right-of-way user may elect to pay a degradation fee. However,
the right-of-way user shall remain responsible for patching and the degradation
fee shall not include the cost to accomplish these responsibilities.
   (C)   Standards. The permittee shall perform excavation, backfilling,
patching, and restoration according to the standards and with the materials
specified by the city and shall comply with Minn. Rule 7819.1100.
   (D)   Duty to correct defects. The permittee shall correct defects in
patching or restoration performed by permittee or its agents. The permittee
upon notification from the city, shall correct all restoration work to the
extent necessary, using the method required by the city. Said work shall be
completed within five calendar days of the receipt of the notice from the city,
not including days during which work cannot be done because of circumstances
constituting force majeure or days when work is prohibited as unseasonable or
unreasonable under §
92.16.
   (E)   Failure to restore. If the permittee fails to restore the right-of-way
in the manner and to the condition required by the city, or fails to
satisfactorily and timely complete all restoration required by the city, the
city at its option may do such work. In that event the permittee shall pay to
the city, within 30 days of billing, the cost of restoring the right-of-way. If
permittee fails to pay as required, the city may exercise its rights under the
construction performance bond.
(Am. Ord. 2-2017, passed 11-14-17)
§ 92.14 JOINT APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   Joint application. Registrants may jointly apply for permits to
excavate or obstruct the right-of-way at the same place and time.
   (B)   Shared fees. Registrants who apply for permits for the same
obstruction or excavation, which the city does not perform, may share in the
payment of the obstruction or excavation permit fee. In order to obtain a joint
permit, registrants must agree among themselves as to the portion each will pay
and indicate the same on then applications.
   (C)   With city projects. Registrants who join in a scheduled obstruction or
excavation performed by the city, whether or not it is a joint application by
two or more registrants or a single application, are not required to pay the
excavation or obstruction and degradation portions of the permit fee, but a
permit would still be required.
(Am. Ord. 2-2017, passed 11-14-17)
§ 92.15 SUPPLEMENTARY APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   Limitation on area. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the area
of the right-of-way specified in the permit. No permittee may do any work
outside the area specified in the permit, except as provided herein. Any
permittee which determines that an area greater than that specified in the
permit must be obstructed or excavated must before working in that greater
area:
      (1)   Make application for a permit extension and pay any additional fees
required thereby; and
      (2)   Be granted a new permit or permit extension.
   (B)   Limitation on dates. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the dates
specified in the permit. No permittee may begin its work before the permit
start date or, except as provided herein, continue working after the end date.
If a permittee does not finish the work by the permit end date, it must apply
for a new permit for the additional time it needs, and receive the new peimit
or an extension of the old permit before working after the end date of the
previous permit. This supplementary application must be submitted before the
permit end date.
(Am. Ord. 2-2017, passed 11-14-17)
§ 92.16 OTHER OBLIGATIONS.
   (A)   Compliance with other laws. Obtaining a right-of-way permit does not
relieve permittee of its duty to obtain all other necessary permits, licenses,
and authority and to pay all fees required by the city or other applicable
rule, law or regulation. A permittee shall comply with all requirements of
local, state and federal laws, including but not limited to M.S. §§ 216D.01
through 216D.09 (Gopher One Call Excavation Notice System) and Minn. Rules, Ch.
7560. A permittee shall perform all work in conformance with all applicable
codes and established rules and regulations, and is responsible for all work
done in the right-of-way pursuant to its permit, regardless of who does the
work.

city, no right-of-way obstruction or excavation may be done when seasonally
prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable for such work.
   (C)   Interference with right-of-way. A permittee shall not so obstruct a
right-of-way that the natural free and clear passage of water through the
gutters or other waterways shall be interfered with. Private vehicles of those
doing work in the right-of-way may not be parked within or next to a permit
area, unless parked in conformance with city parking regulations. The loading
or unloading of trucks must be done solely within the defined permit area
unless specifically authorized by the permit.
   (D)   Trenchless excavation. As a condition of all applicable permits,
permittees employing trenchless excavation methods, including but not limited
to horizontal directional drilling, shall follow all requirements set forth in
M.S. Ch. 216D and Minn. Rules, Ch. 7560 and shall require potholing or open
cutting over existing underground utilities before excavating, as determined by
the city.
(Ord. 2-2017, passed 11-14-17)
§ 92.17 DENIAL OR REVOCATION OF PERMIT.
   (A)   Reasons for denial. The city may deny a permit for failure to meet the
requirements and conditions of this chapter or if the city determines that the
denial is necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public or
when necessary to protect the right-of-way and its current use.
   (B)   Procedural requirements. The denial or revocation of a permit must be
made in writing and must document the basis for the denial. The city must
notify the applicant or right-of-way user in writing within three business days
of the decision to deny or revoke a permit. If an application is denied, the
right-of-way user may address the reasons for denial identified by the city and
resubmit its application. If the application is resubmitted within 30 days of
receipt of the notice of denial, no additional application fee shall be
imposed. The city must approve or deny the resubmitted application within 30
days after submission.

performed in the right-of-way shall be done in conformance with Minn. Rules
7819.1100 and 7819.5000 and other applicable local requirements, in so far as
they are not inconsistent with the M.S., §§ 237.162 and 237.163. Installation
of service laterals shall be performed in accordance with Minn. Rule, Ch. 7560
and these ordinances. Service lateral installation is further subject to those
requirements and conditions set forth by the city in the applicable permits
and/or agreements referenced in §
92.22(B) of this subchapter.
(Am. Ord. 2-2017, passed 11-14-17)
§ 92.19 INSPECTION.
   (A)   Notice of completion. When the work under any permit hereunder is
completed, the permittee shall furnish a completion certificate in accordance
Minn. Rule 7819.1300.

      (1)   At the time of inspection, the city may order the immediate
cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the life, health, safety,
or well-being of the public.
      (2)   The city may issue an order to the permittee for any work that does
not conform to the terms of the permit or other applicable standards,
conditions, or codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the
violation will be cause for revocation of the permit. Within ten days after
issuance of the order, the permittee shall present proof to the city that the
violation has been corrected. If such proof has not been presented within the
required time, the city may revoke the permit pursuant to §
92.22.
(Am. Ord. 2-2017, passed 11-14-17)
§ 92.20 WORK DONE WITHOUT A PERMIT.
   (A)   Emergency situations. 
      (1)   Each registrant shall immediately notify the city of any event
regarding its facilities that it considers to be an emergency. The registrant
may proceed to take whatever actions are necessary to respond to the emergency.
Excavators' notification to Gopher State One Call regarding an emergency
situation does not fulfill this requirement. Within two business days after the
occurrence of the emergency, the registrant shall apply for the necessary
permits, pay the fees associated therewith, and fulfill the rest of the
requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with this chapter for
the actions it took in response to the emergency.
      (2)   If the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding a registrant's
facilities, the city will attempt to contact the local representative of each
registrant affected, or potentially affected, by the emergency. In any event,
the city may take whatever action it deems necessary to respond to the
emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the registrant whose facilities
occasioned the emergency.
   (B)   Non-emergency situations. Except in an emergency, any person who,
without first having obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or excavates a
right-of-way must subsequently obtain a permit and, as a penalty, pay double
the normal fee for said permit, pay double all the other fees required by the
city code, deposit with the city the fees necessary to correct any damage to
the right-of-way, and comply with all of the requirements of this chapter.
(Am. Ord. 2-2017, passed 11-14-17)
§ 92.21 SUPPLEMENTARY NOTIFICATION.
   If the obstruction or excavation of the right-of-way begins later or ends
sooner than the date given on the permit, permittee shall notify the city of
the accurate information as soon as this information is known.
(Am. Ord. 2-2017, passed 11-14-17)
§ 92.22 REVOCATION OF PERMITS.
   (A)   Substantial breach. The city reserves its right, as provided herein,
to revoke any right-of-way permit without a fee refund, if there is a
substantial breach of the terms and conditions of any statute, ordinance, rule
or regulation, or any material condition of the permit. A substantial breach by
permittee shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following:
      (1)   The violation of any material provision of the right-of-way permit.
      (2)   An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the right-
of-way permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit
upon the city or its citizens.
      (3)   Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a
right-of-way permit.
      (4)   The failure to complete the work in a timely manner, unless a
permit extension is obtained or unless the failure to complete work is due to
reasons beyond the permittee's control.
      (5)   The failure to correct, in a timely manner, work that does not
conform to a condition indicated on an order issued pursuant to §
92.19.
   (B)   Written notice of breach. If the city determines that the permittee
has committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any statute,
ordinance, rule, regulation, or any condition of the permit, the city shall
make a written demand upon the permittee to remedy such violation. The demand
shall state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the
permit. A substantial breach, as stated above, will allow the city, at its
discretion, to place additional or revised conditions on the permit to mitigate
and remedy the breach.
   (C)   Response to notice of breach. Within 24 hours of receiving
notification of the breach, permittee shall provide the city with a plan,
acceptable to the city, that will cure the breach. Permittee's failure to so
contact the city, or permittee's failure to timely submit an acceptable plan,
or permittee's failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be
cause for immediate revocation of the permit. Further, permittee's failure to
so contact the city, or permittee's failure to submit an acceptable plan, or
permittee's failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall
automatically place the permittee on probation for one full year.
   (D)   Cause for probation. From time to time, the city may establish a list
of conditions of the permit, which if breached will automatically place the
permittee on probation for one full year, such as, but not limited to, working
out of the allotted time period or working on right-of-way grossly outside of
the permit authorization.
   (E)   Automatic revocation. If a permittee, while on probation, commits a
breach as outlined above, permittee's permit will automatically be revoked and
permittee will not be allowed further permits for one full year, except for
emergency repairs.
   (F)   Reimbursement of city costs. If a permit is revoked, the permittee
shall also reimburse the city for the city's reasonable costs, including
restoration costs and the costs of collection and reasonable attorneys' fees
incurred in connection with such revocation.
(Am. Ord. 2-2017, passed 11-14-17)
§ 92.23 MAPPING DATA.
   (A)   Information required. Each registrant and permittee shall provide
mapping information required by the city in accordance with Minn. Rules
7819.4000 and 7819.4100. Within 90 days following completion of any work
pursuant to a permit, the permittee shall provide the city accurate maps and
drawings certifying the “as-built” location of all equipment installed, owned,
and maintained by the permittee. Such maps and drawings shall include the
horizontal and vertical location of all facilities and equipment and shall be
provided consistent with the city's electronic mapping system, when practical
or as a condition imposed by the city. Failure to provide maps and drawings
pursuant to this subsection shall be grounds for revoking the permit holder's
registration.
   (B)   Service laterals. All permits issued for the installation or repair of
service laterals, other than minor repairs as defined in Minn. Rule 7560.0150,
subp. 2, shall require the permittee's use of appropriate means of establishing
the horizontal locations of installed service laterals and the service lateral
vertical locations in those cases where the city reasonably requires it.
Permittees or their subcontractors shall submit to the city evidence
satisfactory to the city of the installed service lateral locations. Compliance
with this division (B) and with applicable Gopher State One Call law and
Minnesota Rules governing service laterals installed after Dec. 31, 2005, shall
be a condition of any city approval necessary for:
      (1)   Payments to contractors working on a public improvement project,
including those under M.S. Ch. 429; and
      (2)   City approval under development agreements or other subdivision or
site plan approval under M.S. Ch. 462. The city shall reasonably determine the
appropriate method of providing such information to the city. Failure to
provide prompt and accurate information on the service laterals installed may
result in the revocation of the permit issued for the work or future permits to
the offending permittee or its subcontractors.
(Am. Ord. 2-2017, passed 11-14-17)
§ 92.24 LOCATION AND RELOCATION OF FACILITIES.
   (A)   Placement, location, and relocation of facilities must comply with the
Act, with other applicable law, and with Minn. Rules 7819.3100, 7819.5000, and
7819.5100, to the extent the rules do not limit authority otherwise available
to cities.
   (B)   Corridors. 
      (1)   The city may assign a specific area within the right-of-way, or any
particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of facility that
is or, pursuant to current technology, the city expects will someday be located
within the right-of-way. All excavation, obstruction, or other permits issued
by the city involving the installation or replacement of facilities shall
designate the proper corridor for the facilities at issue.
      (2)   Any registrant who has facilities in the right-of-way in a position
at variance with the corridors established by the city shall, no later than at
the time of the next reconstruction or excavation of the area where the
facilities are located, move the facilities to the assigned position within the
right-of-way, unless this requirement is waived by the city for good cause

its deposit thereon.
   (B)   If the Public Works Director finds that any snow, ice, dirt or rubbish
has remained on a public sidewalk more than 48 hours after its deposit thereon,
he or she shall cause notice to be served upon the recorded owner of the
property by personal service, or upon the occupant if the owner does not reside
within the city or cannot be found therein, ordering the owner or occupant to
have the snow, ice, dirt or rubbish removed and made safe within 24 hours and
stating that if the owner or occupant fails to do so, the Public Works Director
will do so on behalf of the city, that the expense thereof must be paid by the
owner, and that if unpaid it will be a special assessment against the property

animal has then bitten, attacked, or threatened the safety of a person or
domestic animal as stated in division (C)(1).
   (F)   Authority to order destruction. The Animal Control Officer, upon
finding that an animal is dangerous hereunder, is authorized to order, as part
of the disposition of the case, that the animal be destroyed based on a written
order containing one or more of the following findings of fact:
      (1)   The animal is dangerous as demonstrated by a vicious attack, an
unprovoked attack, an attack without warning or multiple attacks; or
      (2)   The owner of the animal has demonstrated an inability or
unwillingness to control the animal in order to prevent injury to persons or
other animals.
   (G)   Procedure. The Animal Control Officer, after having determined that an
animal is dangerous, may proceed in the following manner: The Animal Control
Officer shall cause one owner of the animal to be notified in writing or in
person that the animal is dangerous and may order the animal seized or make
orders as deemed proper. This owner shall be notified as to dates, times,
places and parties bitten, and shall be given 14 days to appeal this order by
requesting a hearing before the City Council for a review of this
determination.
      (1)   If no appeal is filed, the Animal Control Officer shall obtain an
order or warrant authorizing the seizure and the destruction of the animal from
a court of competent jurisdiction, unless the animal is already in custody or
the owner consents to the seizure and destruction of the animal.
      (2)   If an owner requests a hearing for determination as to the
dangerous nature of the animal, the hearing shall be held before the City
Council, which shall set a date for hearing not more than three weeks after
demand for the hearing. The records of the Animal Control or City
Administrator’s office shall be admissible for consideration by the Animal
Control Officer without further foundation. After considering all evidence
pertaining to the temperament of the animal, the City Council shall make an
order as it deems proper. The City Council may order that the Animal Control
Officer take the animal into custody for destruction, if the animal is not
currently in custody. If the animal is ordered into custody for destruction,
the owner shall immediately make the animal available to the Animal Control
Officer. If the owner does not immediately make the animal available, the
Animal Control Officer shall obtain an order or warrant authorizing the seizure
and the destruction of the animal from a court of competent jurisdiction.
      (3)   No person shall harbor an animal after it has been found to be
dangerous and ordered into custody for destruction.
   (H)   Stopping an attack. If any police officer or Animal Control Officer is
witness to an attack by an animal upon a person or another animal, the officer
may take whatever means the officer deems appropriate to bring the attack to an
end and prevent further injury to the victim.
   (I)   Notification of new address. The owner of an animal which has been
identified as dangerous or potentially dangerous shall notify the Animal
Control Officer in writing if the animal is to be relocated from its current
address or given or sold to another person. The notification shall be given in
writing at least 14 days prior to the relocation or transfer of ownership. The
notification shall include the current owner’s name and address, the relocation
address, and the name of the new owner, if any. If the animal is to be
relocated within Byron city limits the same requirements for housing a
dangerous animal must be observed.

94.11(F). If the owner is found to have violated the provisions for which the
animal was seized, the Animal Control Officer shall order the animal destroyed
in a proper and humane manner and the owner shall pay the costs of confining

§ 94.51 GENERAL REGULATIONS PROTECTION OF NATURAL FEATURES.
   (A)   Intent. The intent of this section is to allow prescribed grazing of
goats on certain property in the City of Byron for a specific period and for

control undesirable vegetation on steep slopes or other challenging terrain
where it is difficult for humans to access. Prescribed grazing is not intended
to allow the raising or keeping of goats as livestock or pets on property.
   (B)   Allowable locations for prescribed grazing. Prescribed grazing is
allowed in all zoning districts with the following conditions:
      (1)   Prescribed grazing shall be limited to properties that are
primarily used for public, semi-public, or institutional uses, such as parks,
trails, public or private schools, or similar uses as determined by the city.
      (2)   The city may authorize prescribed grazing on properties other than
those described in division (B)(1) of this section if the property is directly

the approved prescribed grazing permit. Where electric fences are used, the
city may require a double fence system with non-electric outer fence line to
serve as a safety barrier to reduce the possibility of the public coming in
contact with the electric fence.
         (b)   Any electric or electrified fence in association with a
prescribed grazing activity must have a warning sign posted on every boundary
of the enclosure at least every 50 feet along each side of the fence. The
warning sign shall clearly identify the electric fence. No single sign shall
exceed four square feet in area. Each sign shall be clearly visible on the
approach to the fence and be posted on or within one foot of the electric or
electrified fence.

treatment and regular deworming. In the event that a prescribed animal becomes
ill, hurt, or perishes, the owner of the prescribed grazing animal(s) must
provide immediate on-site care or remove the animal(s) from the property
promptly if immediate on-site care cannot be provided.
      (3)   Neutering. Male goats used for prescribed grazing must be neutered.
Male goats less than six months of age that accompany an adult female goat
shall be exempt from the neutering requirement.
   (F)   Storage of supplement feed. Any feed for the prescribed grazing
animals (other than the vegetation on the property that is intended for
grazing) must be securely stored so as not to encourage vermin or other pests.

not adversely affect significant natural resources. Prescribed grazing
activities shall comply with the following.

in area and not to exceed four feet in height if freestanding, shall be erected
and visible from the nearest public right-of-way, but not in the public right-
of-way. The city may approve an alternate location for the sign or may require
more than one identification sign if needed to comply with the intent of this
chapter. The sign shall include the prescribed grazing permit number for the
issued permit and the phone number for a 24-hour contact for the prescribed
grazing animals. The sign shall be present for the duration of the prescribed
grazing activity and shall be promptly removed at the conclusion of the
prescribed grazing activity.

permit, the applicant shall also submit a current, effective insurance policy
or a copy thereof providing liability insurance covering claims arising out of
the prescribed grazing activity.

responsible person can be reasonably identified, notice may be served on the
property by posting a copy of the notice on the premises. The notice shall
require the owner or occupant of such premises, or both, to take reasonable
steps within a reasonable amount of time as designated in said notice, but the
maximum time of the removal of said violation after service of said notice
shall not in any event exceed 30 days. If the owner, occupant or other
responsible party does not comply with the notice within the time specified,
the City Council may, after notice to the owner and occupant or other

will consider the matter. If notice is given by posting, at least 30 days shall
elapse between the day of posting and the hearing date.

         (b)   There is an immediate threat of serious property damage;
         (c)   A public nuisance has been caused by private parties on public
property or if the enforcing officer abated the nuisance pursuant to this

abated by the city or a person who has caused a public nuisance on property not
owned by that person shall be personally liable to the city for the cost of
abatement, including administrative costs. As soon as the work has been
completed and the cost determined, the Clerk-Treasurer or the designee shall
prepare a bill for the cost and mail it to the owner or other responsible
party. Thereupon, the amount shall be immediately due and payable at the office
of the Clerk-Treasurer.

cost may be certified against the property to which the cost is attributable.
Before certification against the property, reasonable notice of the impending
certification and an opportunity to be heard by the City Council must be given
to the taxpayer of record. Failure of the taxpayer to receive the notice shall
not invalidate the certification, however. Thereafter, the unpaid cost may be
certified to the County Auditor for collection along with current taxes on the
following year or in such annual installments, not exceeding ten, as the City
Council may determine in each case.

§ 98.01 PURPOSE.
   (A)   It is declared to be the purpose and intent of this chapter to protect
and preserve this city’s neighborhoods and the public health, safety and
welfare of those who live there. The Byron City Council determines that keeping
the city free of tall grass and noxious weeds improves the quality of life of
city residents by improving the aesthetics of the city, by eliminating harbor
for rodents and insects, and by eliminating fire hazards. At the same time, the
Council recognizes that requiring the mowing of grasses and noxious weeds is
under certain circumstances impractical and unreasonable. The exemptions
contained within this chapter are intended to cover these circumstances.
   (B)   The City Council also determines that a variety of properly maintained
landscapes in the city adds diversity and a richness to the quality of life,
and does not want to discourage the preservation, restoration and maintenance
of diverse biologically stable natural plant communities or environmentally
sound practices. The City Council finds that the establishment of prairie,
naturalistic and meadow plant communities is an acceptable landscape treatment
in the city.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 111.01 PURPOSE.
   Because the city recognizes that many persons under the age of 21 years
purchase or otherwise obtain, possess and use tobacco, tobacco products and
tobacco related devices, and such sale, possession and use are violations of
both state and federal laws; and because studies, which the city accepts and
adopts, have shown that most smokers begin smoking before they have reached the
age of 18 years and that those persons who reach the age of 18 years without
having started smoking are significantly less likely to begin smoking; and
because smoking has been shown to be the cause of several serious health
problems which subsequently place a financial burden on all levels of
government; this chapter shall be intended to regulate the sale, possession and
use of tobacco, tobacco products and tobacco related devices for the purpose of
enforcing and furthering existing laws to protect youth against the serious
effects associated with the illegal use of tobacco, tobacco products and
tobacco related devices and to further the official public policy of the State
of Minnesota in regard to preventing young people from starting to smoke as
stated in M.S. § 144.391, as it may be amended from time to time.
(Ord. 461, passed 7-24-97; Am. Ord. 19-07, passed 6-11-19)

product wrapped individually for sale. Individually wrapped tobacco and tobacco

with reference to the definition of terms, conditions of operation,
restrictions on consumption, provisions relating to sales, hours of sale, and
all other matters pertaining to the retail sale, distribution, and consumption
of intoxicating liquor and 3.2% malt liquor are hereby adopted by reference and
are made a part of this Chapter as if set out in full. It is the intention of
the City Council that all future amendments to M.S. Ch. 340A are hereby adopted
by reference or referenced as if they had been in existence at the time this
chapter is adopted.
(Ord. 112, passed 3-8-22)
§ 112.02 CITY MAY BE MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN STATE LAW.
   The Council is authorized by the provisions of M.S. § 340A.509, as it may be
amended from time to time, to impose, and has imposed in this chapter,
additional restrictions on the sale and possession of alcoholic beverages
within its limits beyond those contained in M.S. Ch. 340A, as it may be amended
from time to time.
(Ord. 112, passed 3-8-22)
§ 112.03 DEFINITIONS.
   In addition to the definitions contained in M.S. § 340A.101 as it may be
amended from time to time, the following terms are defined for purposes of this
chapter:
   LIQUOR. As used in this chapter, without modification by the words
“intoxicating” or a “3.2% malt” includes both intoxicating liquor and 3.2% malt
liquor.
   RESTAURANT. An eating facility, other than a hotel, under the control of a
single proprietor or manager, where meals are regularly prepared on the
premises, where full waitress/waiter table service is provided, where a
customer orders food from printed menus and where the main food course is
served and consumed while seated at a single location. To be a restaurant as
defined by this chapter, an establishment shall have a license from the state
as required by M.S. § 157.16, as it may be amended from time to time, and meet
the definition of either a “small establishment,” “medium establishment” or
“large establishment” as defined in M.S. § 157.16, subd. 3(d), as it may be

(Ord. 112, passed 3-8-22)
§ 112.04 NUDITY ON THE PREMISES OF LICENSED ESTABLISHMENTS PROHIBITED.
   (A)   The City Council finds that it is in the best interests of the public
health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the city that nudity is
prohibited as provided in this section on the premises of any establishment
licensed under this chapter. This is to protect and assist the owners,
operators, and employees of the establishment, as well as patrons and the
public in general, from harm stemming from the physical immediacy and
combination of alcohol, nudity, and sex. The Council especially intends to
prevent any subliminal endorsement of sexual harassment or activities likely to
lead to the possibility of various criminal conduct, including prostitution,
sexual assault, and disorderly conduct. The Council also finds that the
prohibition of nudity on the premises of any establishment licensed under this
chapter, as set forth in this section, reflects the prevailing community
standards of the city.
   (B)   It is unlawful for any licensee to permit or allow any person or
persons on the licensed premises when the person does not have his or her
buttocks, anus, breasts, and genitals covered with a non-transparent material.
It is unlawful for any person to be on the licensed premises when the person
does not have his or her buttocks, anus, breasts, and genitals covered with a
non-transparent material.
   (C)   A violation of this section is a misdemeanor punishable as provided by
law, and is justification for revocation or suspension of any liquor, wine, or
3.2% malt liquor license or any other license issued under this chapter or the
imposition of a civil penalty under the provisions of §
112.99(B).
(Ord. 112, passed 3-8-22) Penalty, see §

   No person shall consume intoxicating liquor or 3.2% malt liquor on any
public street, sidewalk, parking lot or alley, or in any public place other
than on the premises of an establishment licensed under this chapter, or where
the consumption and display of liquor is lawfully permitted. It is unlawful for
any person to bring upon or possess in a park a container of an alcoholic
beverage which contains or has a capacity of more than eight gallons. This
section shall not apply to a person licensed to sell alcoholic beverages in a
park, to an employee or agent acting on behalf of such licensee, not to a
person delivering an alcoholic beverage to such licensee. No beverages of any
kind in glass containers are allowed in the parks.

§ 112.06 NUMBER OF LICENSES WHICH MAY BE ISSUED.
   State law establishes the number of liquor licenses that a city may issue.
However, the number of licenses which may be granted under this section is
limited to four, even if a larger number of licenses are authorized by law or
election. The Council in its sound discretion may amend the chapter as allowed
by M.S. Ch. 340A, as it may be amended from time to time. If a larger number of
licenses in a particular category has been authorized by a referendum held
under the provisions of M.S. § 340A.413, subd. 3 as it may be amended from time
to time, but not all of them have been issued, the larger number of licenses is
no longer in effect until the Council by chapter determines that any or all of
the licenses may be issued. The Council is not required to issue the full
number of licenses that it has available.
(Ord. 112, passed 3-8-22)
§ 112.07 TERM AND EXPIRATION OF LICENSES.

§ 112.10 COUNCIL DISCRETION TO GRANT OR DENY A LICENSE.
   The Council in its sound discretion may either grant or deny the application
for any license or for the transfer or renewal of any license. No applicant has
a right to a license under this chapter.
(Ord. 112, passed 3-8-22)
§ 112.11 APPLICATION FOR LICENSE.
   (A)   Form. Every application for a license issued under this chapter shall
be on a form provided by the city. Every application shall state the name of
the applicant, the applicant’s age, representations as to the applicant’s
character, with references as the Council may require, the type of license

   No license issued under this chapter may be transferred without the approval
of the Council. Any transfer of stock of a corporate licensee is deemed to be a
transfer of the license, and a transfer of stock without prior Council approval
is a ground for revocation of the license. An application to transfer a license
shall be treated the same as an application for a new license, and all of the
provisions of this code applying to applications for a license shall apply.

§ 114.01 PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to protect the public health, safety and
welfare of the community at large and the residents of rental dwellings in the
City of Byron and to ensure that rental housing in the city is decent, safe and
sanitary and is so operated and maintained as not to become a nuisance to the
neighborhood or to become an influence that fosters blight and deterioration or
creates a disincentive to reinvestment in the community. The operation of
rental residential properties is a business enterprise that entails certain
responsibilities. Owners and operators are responsible to take such reasonable
steps as are necessary to ensure that the citizens of the city who occupy such
units may pursue the quiet enjoyment of the normal activities of life in
surroundings that are: safe, secure and sanitary; free of noise, nuisances and
annoyances; and free from unreasonable fears about safety of persons and
security of property.
(Ord. 114, passed 6-25-08)
§ 114.02 SCOPE.
   (A)   The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all buildings or
portions thereof used, or designed or intended to be let for human habitation.
This chapter does not apply to Minnesota Department of Health licensed rest
homes; convalescent care facilities; licensed group homes; nursing homes;
hotels; motels; as defined and governed by M.S. Chs. 515, 515A and 515B.
   (B)   With respect to rental disputes, and except as otherwise specifically
provided by the terms of this chapter, it is not the intention of the City
Council to intrude upon the fair and accepted contractual relationship between
tenant and landlord. The City Council does not intend to intervene as an
advocate of either party, nor to act an arbiter, nor to be receptive to
complaints from tenant or landlord which are not specifically and clearly
relevant to the provisions of this chapter. In the absence of such relevancy
with regard to rental disputes, it is intended that the contracting parties
exercise such legal sanctions as are available to them without the intervention
of city government. In enacting this chapter neither is it the intention of the
City Council to interfere or permit interference with legal rights to personal
privacy.
(Ord. 114, passed 6-25-08)
§ 114.03 REGISTRATION CERTIFICATE REQUIRED.

this chapter or at such time that the registration certificate, or the right to
receive such a registration certificate, is suspended or revoked. Any
registration certificate obtained pursuant to this section shall be issued in
the name of the owner. In the case of a multiple unit dwelling, a registration
certificate issued pursuant to this section includes and applies to both the
entire dwelling as well as each individual rental unit within the dwelling. Any
suspension or revocation of the registration certificate or the right to
receive a registration certificate may involve the entire dwelling or any
individual unit or units within the dwelling.
   (B)   The occupancy or rental of any dwelling, or any apartment, or rooming
unit in any dwelling for which a registration certificate is required, need not
be interrupted or suspended for lack of a registration certificate if the same

herein required would serve no useful purpose.

a waiver by the Building Supervisor shall not in any way affect the authority

DESIGN STANDARDS
§ 151.020 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Conformance to applicable rules and regulations.
      (1)   The subdivision standards contained in this chapter exist to ensure
that the improvements, reservations and design of developments will conform to
minimum requirements while promoting the health, safety and general welfare of
the public.
      (2)   In addition to these regulations and to ensure that future
developments are consistent with land use goals, objectives, and policies of
the city, subdivisions shall conform to the Byron Comprehensive Plan, Zoning
Code, Building Code, and Engineering Specifications.
      (3)   All subdivision plats also shall comply with all applicable
statutory provisions, rules and regulations of the State of Minnesota.
   (B)   Land suitability.
      (1)   Land which the City Council finds to be unsuitable for subdivision
or development due to flooding, severe soil erosion potential, improper
drainage, or other soil related problems or other features which will
reasonably be harmful to the safety, health or general welfare of the present
or future inhabitants of the subdivision and/or its surrounding areas shall not
be subdivided or developed unless adequate methods are formulated by the
applicant and approved by the City Council upon recommendation of the City
Engineer to solve the problems created by the unsuitable land conditions. Such
land shall be set aside for land uses that shall not involve such a danger.
      (2)   Flood prone areas.
         (a)   The City Council may, when it deems it necessary for the health,
safety or welfare of the present and future population of the area and
necessary to the conservation of water, drainage, and sanitary facilities,
prohibit the subdivision of any portion of land which lies within a flood prone
area as identified by an applicable engineering study or by Flood Insurance
Rate Maps (FIRM) for the City of Byron prepared by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) if available. These flood prone areas shall be
preserved from any and all destruction, damage, or alteration which restricts
flow or changes the direction of flow and substantially changes the location of
flooding, as required by the Zoning Code.
         (b)   All subdivisions shall have vehicular access both to the
subdivision and to the individual building sites no lower than two feet below
an elevation established by an engineering study of the area or the regulatory
flood protection elevation if available.
         (c)   All buildable lots created within the flood prone area shall
contain a building site located above an elevation established by an
engineering study of the area or at or above the regulatory flood protection
elevation if available.
   (C)   Exceptions to design standards. The City Council may authorize a
modification or exception to the design standards listed in this section in
order to permit reasonable subdivision of property as recommended by city staff
based on characteristics unique to the property. These conditions may include,
but are not limited to, natural features (topography, wetlands, floodplain,
etc.), presence of major utilities (high pressure gas main), and size of
subdivision.
   (D)   Self-imposed restrictions. If the applicant places restrictions on any
of the land contained in the subdivision greater than those required by the
Zoning Code or these regulations, such restrictions or reference thereto shall
be required to be submitted with the preliminary plat and in a document
attached to the final plat. The City Council shall require that restrictive
covenants be recorded with the County Recorder.
   (E)   Design statement. The city shall encourage site planning for
subdivisions and other development covered by this chapter that is well
organized and will be a livable and/or productive space that supports the needs
and activities of the people of each subdivision and the people of Byron.
      (1)   In order to accomplish such an objective, applicants will need to
follow a reasonable site planning process that includes, but is not limited to:
         (a)   Recognition of the need for responsible and sensitive site
planning;
         (b)   Collection of information regarding manmade and natural features
and analysis of the locality;
         (c)   Organization of the site and surrounding area, including land
use and density of development;
         (d)   Movement to, from and within the site;
         (e)   Appearance or attractiveness of the site plan-design;
         (f)   Analysis of the development when completed and occupied,
including streets, housing types and environmental conditions to see if it
works as envisioned; and
         (g)   Consideration of future site management.
      (2)   Finally, the subdivision design should reflect certain basic
elements of sound development, including:
         (a)   Preservation of the character of the land;
         (b)   Economy of construction;
         (c)   Inclusion of special facilities;
         (d)   Variation in design;
         (e)   Privacy and sociability; and
         (f)   Individual lot sizes that are practicable and desirable.
   (F)   Standards. In addition to the principles and standards listed in this
division, which are appropriate to the planning of all subdivisions, the
applicant for a nonresidential subdivision shall demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the City Council that the street, lot, and block pattern
proposed is specifically adapted to the uses anticipated and takes into account
other uses in the vicinity. The following principles and standards shall be
observed:
      (1)   Proposed industrial parcels shall be suitable in area and
dimensions to the types of industrial development anticipated;
      (2)   Special requirements may be imposed by the city for street, gutter
and sidewalk design and construction and for the installation of public
utilities, including water, sewer, and storm water drainage.
(Ord. 2023-02, passed 5-9-23)
§ 151.021 BLOCKS.
   (A)   Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots of
appropriate depths. Exceptions to this prescribed block width shall be
permitted in blocks adjacent to arterial streets or frontage roads, railroads,
waterways, natural hazards, or sensitive areas.
   (B)   The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be such as are
appropriate for the locality and the type of development contemplated, but
block lengths in residential areas shall be a walkable block size generally
less than 600 feet in length. Walkable blocks are encouraged. If applicant
wishes to deviate from the walkable block size they must be able to justify
their rationale.
   (C)   On blocks exceeding 600 feet in length, the City Council may require
the reservation of an easement or dedication of a right-of-way through the
block to accommodate utilities, drainage facilities, and/or pedestrian traffic.
Walkways not less than ten feet wide may be required by the City Council
through the center of blocks more than 600 feet long where deemed essential to
provide circulation or access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers,
transportation or other community facilities.
   (D)   Blocks designed for industrial uses shall be of such length and width
as may be determined suitable by the City Council for prospective use.
(Ord. 2023-02, passed 5-9-23)
§ 151.022 LOTS.
   (A)   Lot improvement. The lot arrangements shall be such that there will be
no foreseeable difficulties for reasons of topography, grading, or other
conditions in securing site plan approval and building permits to build on all
lots in a manner which is compliant with these regulations and the zoning code,
and which provides reasonable driveway access to buildings from an approved
right-of-way. Where topographic and soils constraints are present on a lot or
area, subdivision design shall be suitable for development and will not create
unstable slopes and/or the potential for chronic soil erosion problems.
   (B)   Lot dimensions.
      (1)   Lots shall comply with the minimum dimensional standards of the
Zoning Code.
         (a)   Dimensions of corner lots shall be large enough to allow for
erection of buildings observing the minimum yard requirements from both streets
as specified in the Zoning Code. Lots shall be large enough to minimize
grading, stormwater runoff, and soil erosion problems.
         (b)   Lots in residential districts that are adjacent to railroad
right-of-way shall include an additional 25 foot easement on that portion of
the lot adjacent to the right-of-way which shall be used as a buffer strip.
This buffer area shall be shown on the preliminary plat and attached as a
separate document and diagram with the final plat: "This easement is reserved
for buffering and screening. The placement of buildings hereon is prohibited."
      (2)   Where lots are more than double the minimum required area specified
for the applicable zoning district, the City Council may require that such lots
be arranged and sized so as to allow further subdivision and the opening of
future streets where they would be necessary to serve such potential lots.
      (3)   All remnants of lots below minimum size left over after subdividing
a larger tract must be added to adjacent lots, dedicated to the public, owned
with specified restrictions by a homeowner association or comparable
association, or dedicated as an outlot with specific restrictions.
      (4)   Irregular shaped lots are discouraged. Where such lots are
proposed, the development shall demonstrate to the city an ability to properly
place principal buildings and accessory structures on the site in a manner
which is compatible in size and character to the surrounding area.
      (5)   In general, side lot lines shall be at right angles to street lines
or radial to curving street lines unless a variation from the rule will give a
better street or lot plan, or unless topographic conditions necessitate a
different arrangement.
   (C)   Frontage.
      (1)   No subdivision shall be approved unless the area to be subdivided
shall have frontage on and access from an existing street right-of-way, a
street that is an existing state, county, or township highway, or a street not
yet constructed but shown upon a plat approved by the City Council and recorded
in the County Recorder Office. Such street shall be suitably improved to allow
year-round safe access by residents of the area and all safety vehicles.
      (2)   Every lot shall abut on a public street to provide access for fire
protection, utilities and other services unless a subdivision has received
approval from the City Council for a private street or access easement.
      (3)   Double frontage and reversed frontage lots shall be avoided except
where necessary to provide separation of residential development from arterials
or higher level streets or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and
orientation.
   (D)   Access to arterial streets.
      (1)   Arterial streets are considered to be controlled access streets.
Therefore, where possible, lots shall not derive access exclusively from an
arterial street.
      (2)   Where a subdivision borders on or contains an existing or proposed
arterial street, the City Council may limit access to such streets by one of
the following means:
         (a)   The subdivision of lots shall be designed so that all lots to
back onto the arterial and front onto a parallel local street. No access shall
be provided from the arterial, and screening shall be provided in a strip of
land along the rear property line of such lots.
         (b)   A series of cul-de-sacs, U-shaped streets or short loop streets
entered from and designed generally at right angles to a street parallel to the
arterial street, with the rear lines of their terminal lots backing onto the
arterial when there are preexisting obstacles/conditions beyond the
applicant's/city's control, i.e., gas lines, railroad tracks, water/sewer
mains, etc.
         (c)   Where driveway access to and from an arterial street may be
necessary for several adjoining lots, such lots may be required to be served by
a combined access drive in order to limit possible traffic hazards.
         (d)   Where possible, driveways should be designed and arranged so as
to avoid requiring vehicles to back onto arterial streets.
(Ord. 2023-02, passed 5-9-23)

plans indicate a need for realignment or widening of a street that would be
used by the land within the subdivision, the applicant shall be required to
dedicate at their expense such areas for widening or realignment of such roads
to the full width as required by this chapter.
      (6)   Street names shall be sufficiently different in sound and spelling
from other city/county street names so as not to cause confusion. A street
which is or is planned as a continuation of an existing street shall bear the
same name. Where possible, all streets shall be numbered progressively.

possible to the original topography. A combination of steep grades and curves
shall be avoided.
      (3)   All collector streets shall be properly related to special traffic
generators such as industries, business districts, schools, places of worship,
and shopping centers; to population densities; and to the pattern of existing
and proposed land uses.
      (4)   Local streets shall be arranged to discourage use by through
traffic, to permit efficient drainage and utility systems, and to require the
minimum number of streets necessary to provide convenient and safe access to
property.
      (5)   The arrangement of streets shall provide for the continuation of
streets between adjacent properties when such continuation is necessary for
convenient movement of traffic, effective fire protection, and for efficient
provision of utilities. The use of dead end streets shall be minimized.
      (6)   The arrangement of streets in a new subdivision shall make
provisions for the proper projection of streets into adjoining areas by
carrying the new streets (both the right-of-way and pavement) to the boundary
lines of the new subdivision at appropriate locations unless prevented by
topography or other physical conditions, or unless the City Council determines
that such extension is not necessary or desirable for future development on
adjacent tracts.
      (7)   In nonresidential and multi-unit residential developments, streets
and other accessways shall be planned to minimize conflict of movement between
the various types of traffic, including pedestrian.
   (C)   Treatment of dead-end streets.
      (1)   Dead end streets may be considered in those areas where such street
design serves as a way to preserve open space or protect the integrity of the
greenway system or where topography or other physical features do not permit
connecting streets.
      (2)   Dead end streets (temporary).
         (a)   If the property adjacent to a subdivision is undeveloped and the
street must be a dead-end street temporarily, the right-of-way shall be
extended to the property line.
         (b)   A turnaround shall be provided on all temporary dead-end
streets, with the notation on the preliminary plat and on a separate document
with the final plat that land outside the normal street right-of-way shall
revert to abutting property owners whenever the street is continued.
         (c)   The City Council may limit the length of temporary dead-end
streets in accordance with the standards in the Engineering Specifications.

temporary dead-end street, the length of the barricade shall be the minimum
required surface width as specified in the Engineering Specifications.
      (3)   Dead end streets (permanent).
         (a)   Where a street does not extend beyond the boundary of the
subdivision, and its continuation is not required by the City Council for
access to adjoining property, a permanent dead end street may be permitted.
         (b)   A cul-de-sac turnaround shall be provided at the end of a
permanent dead-end street meeting the standards in the Engineering
Specifications.
         (c)   For greater convenience to traffic and more effective police and
fire protection, permanent dead-end streets shall be limited in length to 500
feet.
         (d)   The City Council may require the reservation of an appropriate
easement or right-of-way to accommodate drainage facilities, utilities or
pedestrian traffic.
   (D)   Private streets.
      (1)   Private streets shall only be allowed in compliance with the Byron
Comprehensive Plan and only for such roads which have no public interest for
traffic circulation. Private streets shall not create a conflict with adopted
road circulation plans or studies.
      (2)   The number, location, and width of private streets may be
controlled and limited by the City Council in the interests of public safety

            1.   Where publicly-owned utilities are located under a private
street, the city shall be responsible for any street repairs necessitated by
repairs or maintenance of the public utility. Conversely, if full replacement
of the public utility is required, the entity responsible for maintenance and
ownership of the private street shall be solely responsible for the related
street replacement.
            2.   Privately-owned utilities under private streets shall be owned
and maintained by the entity responsible for ownership of the street. Any
street repairs necessitated by the maintenance of the privately owned utility
shall not be the responsibility of the city.
   (B)   Water facilities.
      (1)   The applicant shall install adequate water facilities, including
fire hydrants, subject to the city’s Engineering Specifications and the State
of Minnesota. If oversized water facilities are required, the city shall
reimburse the applicant for the difference in cost of these facilities as
specified in the development agreement.
      (2)   All water mains shall be publicly owned.
      (3)   Water main extensions shall be approved by the City Council.

the initial phases of construction.
         (g)   Drainageways shall be constructed in such a way as to not cause
additional soil erosion or sedimentation during and after all phases of
construction.
      (2)   Natural drainage system.
         (a)   All lots shall be developed to maximize the use of the natural
drainage system of an area in order to minimize direct overland runoff from lot
to lot and into adjoining streets and water courses. Where necessary, the
natural surface drainage system shall be augmented by constructed surface
drainageways.
         (b)   Storm water runoff from roofs and other impervious surfaces
should be directed to pervious soil and into drainageways or onto terraces on
the lot when possible. This may be an additional element or an alternative to
the underground storm sewer system as required in this section and recommended
by the City Engineer.
         (c)   Wherever possible, it is desirable that the drainage be
maintained in an open channel with landscaped banks and adequate dimension for
maximum potential volume of flow without causing soil erosion.
         (d)   Low-lying lands along waterways subject to flooding during storm
periods, whether or not included in areas for dedication, shall be preserved
and retained in their natural state as drainageways.
      (3)   Subdrain.

requirements for any new or reconstructed drainageways:
         (a)   System sizing.
            1.   Drainage system elements, including culverts or natural
drainageways, shall be large enough to accommodate potential runoff from the
entire upstream drainage area, whether inside or outside the subdivision. The
City Engineer shall determine the necessary size of the facility, based on the
standards listed within the Engineering Specifications assuming conditions of
maximum potential watershed development permitted by the Zoning Code.
            2.   If the City Engineer determines that the drainage system must
be oversized to manage current or future storm water runoff, the applicant
shall be responsible for the costs of this oversizing.

rap shall consist of quarried limestone, field-stone (if random rip rap is
used), or construction materials of concrete. Construction materials shall be
used only in those areas where the waterway is not used as part of a city park.
         (e)   If the flow velocity in the waterway is such that erosion of the
turf sidewall will occur and said velocity cannot be decreased via velocity
control structures, then other materials may replace turf on the side walls.
         (f)   Development of housing and other structures shall be restricted
from the area on either side of the waterway required to channel a 100-year
storm.
   (E)   Easements.
      (1)   The applicant shall provide drainage and utility easements in
accordance with the city’s Engineering Specifications.

easement if approved by the city at the time of review.
      (4)   Utility easements.
         (a)   Perpetual unobstructed easements shall be provided for public
utilities. Such easements shall be at least ten feet wide and centered on rear
lot lines and provided along all street rights-of-way. Proper coordination
shall be established between the applicant and the applicable utility companies
for the establishment of utility easements.
         (b)   Where topographic or other conditions are such as to make
impractical the inclusion of utilities along the rear lot lines, perpetual
unobstructed easements at least ten feet in width shall be provided along side
lot lines with satisfactory access to the road or rear lot lines. Easements
shall be indicated on the plat.
         (c)   Any site element, including but not limited to buildings,
fences, and shrubs and trees, which is placed within a utility easement is done
so at the property owner’s risk and must meet required setbacks to the utility
improvement.
      (5)   Drainage easements.
         (a)   Where a subdivision is traversed by a waterway, drainageway,
channel, or stream, there shall be provided a drainage easement conforming
substantially to the lines of such waterway and of such width and construction
or both as will be adequate for the purpose.
         (b)   Where conditions are such as to make impractical the inclusion
of drainage facilities within street rights-of-way, perpetual unobstructed
easements at least 15 feet in width for such drainage facilities shall be
provided across property outside the street lines and with satisfactory access
to the street. Drainage easements shall connect the street right-of-way to a
natural waterway or to other approved drainage facilities and shall be
designated on the plat.
         (c)   No site elements are permitted within a drainage easement.
         (d)   When a proposed drainage system will carry water across private
land outside the subdivision, appropriate drainage rights must be secured and
indicated on the preliminary plat and in a separate document attached to the
final plat.

shall not be altered, extended, enlarged or moved in such a way as to increase
its nonconformity under this chapter. Alterations or modifications to
nonconforming structures which have the effect of not increasing their
nonconformity are permitted subject to zoning certificate approval and
compliance with all other applicable ordinance provisions. Additional
encroachment of existing structures or buildings into a required yard when a

proposed addition or alteration will not exceed the existing encroachment may
be permitted subject to zoning certificate approval where all other provisions
of this chapter are met or exceeded.
      (2)   Grain elevators, and other buildings in which operations are
conducted that are directly related to grain elevators, located in the downtown

already part of the industrial use. However, in no case, and at no time, shall
a building or structure exceed 90 feet in height in the downtown industrial
area.

structure on a nonconforming lot of record may be enlarged, extended,
constructed, or moved so long as all other requirements of this chapter are
met.
   (E)   Discontinuance of nonconforming use. If a nonconforming use is
discontinued for a period of 12 consecutive months, further use of the property
shall conform to this chapter. If a nonconforming use is replaced by another
use, the new use shall conform to this chapter.
   (F)   Destruction of nonconforming structure or use. If a nonconforming
structure or a conforming structure with a nonconforming use located therein is
destroyed by any means to an extent of more than 50% of its market value at the
time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed or used except in conformity
with the provisions of this chapter. If the structure is destroyed to less than
50% of its market value, it must be restored to its original condition if said

§ 152.035 DISTRICT USES ESTABLISHED.
   (A)   In any district, whenever a use is neither specifically permitted nor
denied, the use shall be considered prohibited. The Zoning Administrator may
determine if a proposed use is consistent by type, intensity, physical
characteristics, style, size, and purpose with any use listed in Tables 152.1
and 152.2.
      (1)   If found to be consistent with a listed use, the proposed use shall

Use Definitions. The following definitions shall be referenced when using
Tables 152.1 and 152.2:
         (a)   Permitted uses – a “P” in a cell of the use table indicates that
the land use is allowed by right in the base zoning district.
         (b)   Permitted with standards uses – a “PS” in a cell of the use

152.065 et seq., Use Standards are met. Uses permitted with standards are also
subject to all other applicable requirements of this chapter. Any request to
vary from the standards set forth for a permitted with standards use shall be
processed as a variance.
         (c)   Conditional uses – a “C” in a cell of the use table indicates
that the land use is allowed in the base zoning district only upon approval of
a conditional use permit as described in §

1 This is the minimum front required for a lot abutting a local street. Where a
front or side yard of a lot abuts a major thoroughfare or frontage road to a
major thoroughfare, based on the Thoroughfare Plan, an additional 10 feet shall
be required for the adjacent front and side yard. This requirement does not
apply to nonresidential land uses. In the R-1 and R-2 districts, where existing
dwellings have a front yard of more than 20 feet, all new development shall be
required to have a minimum front yard that is equal to or greater than the
front yards of abutting lots that have front yards abutting the same street.
2 In the R-2 and R-3 districts, where all dwellings located along the side
street have a front yard less than the required 20 feet, the side street side
yard shall be permitted to be reduced to the front yard but in no case shall
the side street side yard be less than 10 feet.
3 Any building in the R-1 district greater than 30 feet in height shall be set
back from all lot lines 1 foot for each foot the building is greater than 30
feet. Any building in the R-2 or R-3 districts greater than 35 feet in height
shall be set back from all lot lines 1 foot for each foot the building is
greater than 35 feet.

152.085 Buffering and Screening shall be complied with under these provisions
of this chapter.
5 The historic downtown area shall be determined as identified on the Byron

6 The minimum rear yard may be reduced to zero where a commercial establishment
has a part of its business located on an abutting lot which is located only
within the commercial or industrial districts.
7 Where the use abuts a residential zoning district or a federal, state or
county highway, a 45 foot setback shall be required.
8 Where an industrial establishment abuts a railroad right-of-way, the abutting
side or rear yard may be reduced to zero. The minimum side or rear yard may be
reduced to zero where an industrial establishment has a part of its business
located on an abutting lot which is located only within the Commercial or
Industrial District.
9 This percentage refers to 100% of the area available for building. This area
is the area remaining after providing the minimum area or more for yard
requirements, buffer and screen requirements, parking area and loading/
unloading requirements where required.

OVERLAY/SPECIAL DISTRICTS
§ 152.050 GREENWAY OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   (A)   Purpose. The Greenway Overlay District is intended to protect natural
resources and allow for the development of a connected, city-wide greenway
recreational trail network.
   (B)   Application.
      (1)   The Greenway Overlay District shall apply to any parcel that
contains areas identified on the Greenway Overlay District Zoning Map.
         (a)   The Greenway Overlay District is generally intended to include
any wetland, stream, or Decorah formation and a 50 foot buffer around said
natural feature or as otherwise identified by the City Council.
         (b)   The Greenway Overlay District also includes 50 foot wide
greenways which connect natural features on a site or to the parcel boundary
when natural features are located beyond the parcel under development.
      (2)   Interpretation of the exact boundary shall be made by the Zoning
Administrator based on publicly available data, such as the national wetland
inventory and public waters inventory, as well as information from the property
owner which is prepared and signed by a licensed professional (engineer,
surveyor, etc.).
      (3)   The Greenway Overlay District shall be used with any underlying
base zoning district as shown on the Zoning Map.
      (4)   Unless otherwise exempted, the regulations of this chapter shall be
required when any land is subdivided or significant grading of a site is
proposed.
   (C)   Uses allowed. Uses are allowed based on the underlying base zoning
district.
   (D)   Required preservation.
      (1)   Natural areas, natural area buffers, and greenway connections
identified on the Greenway Overlay District Zoning Map shall be, at the
discretion of the City Council, either:
         (a)   Dedicated to the city; or
         (b)   Preserved within an outlot owned by the homeowners association
established as part of the development. The outlot must include an easement
that preserves the greenway area and allows for the development of a public
recreational trail.
      (2)   No construction activity shall be allowed within the designated
preservation areas, including grading, excavation, or stockpiling of fill
materials whether to provide for a building site, on site utilities or
services, or for any roads or driveways. In addition to any construction
activities specifically allowed by the City Council, the following activities
are permitted:
         (a)   Construction of multi-use trails;
         (b)   Restoration of previously disturbed or degraded areas to their
natural state;
         (c)   Enhancement of the habitat or natural resource value of the
natural area;
         (d)   Construction needed for emergency public safety; or
         (e)   Installation of utilities when such installation cannot
reasonably occur in other areas and when conducted with sensitivity to natural
features.
   (E)   Required development.
      (1)   Each development within the Greenway Overlay District shall include

§ 152.051 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD) DISTRICT.
   (A)   Intent. The intent of the PUD district is to:
      (1)   Encourage developments offering greater creativity, alternative
development styles, and flexibility in site plan design than is provided under
the strict application of zoning regulations, while at the same time preserving
the health, safety, order, convenience, prosperity, and general welfare of the
City of Byron. The PUD district may allow deviations, under appropriate
circumstances, to underlying ordinance provisions if it is proven that public
benefits are provided to mitigate any deviations.
      (2)   Allow for and facilitate the potential mixture of uses in an
integrated and well-planned area when such mixing of land uses could not
otherwise be accomplished under this Code.
      (3)   Ensure concentration of open space into more usable areas, and to
protect and preserve the natural features and resources of a site.
      (4)   Facilitate the efficient provision of streets and public utilities.
   (B)   Overall density.
      (1)   Within a PUD, overall density for residential developments shall be
consistent with the Comprehensive Plan.
      (2)   Individual buildings or lots within a PUD may exceed those
standards, provided that density for the entire PUD does not exceed the
permitted standards.
   (C)   Permitted uses.
      (1)   Uses permitted in a PUD shall include those uses considered to be
in conformance with the general land use shown for the area on the Byron
Comprehensive Plan. The city may permit up to 25% of the gross floor area of
all buildings in a PUD to be used for land uses for which the site is not
designated in the Comprehensive Plan if the City Council finds that such use is
in the best interests of the city and is consistent with the requirements of
this section.
      (2)   A PUD may not contain uses which, according to the city’s
underlying districts, are not allowed anywhere in the city.
      (3)   Uses permitted in a PUD may consist of one or a mixture of land
uses clearly designated by type on the approved final development plan. Mixed
uses may occur among or within buildings as long as the uses are compatible
with each other and with planned and existing uses surrounding the planned unit
development. Any change in the list of uses presented in the development stage
PUD plan will be considered an amendment to the PUD and shall follow the
procedures specified in §
152.106.
   (D)   District standards. The district standards shall be as follows:
      (1)   Minimum PUD area. Ten acres of contiguous land in single ownership
or control. A land use of less than ten acres may qualify if one or more of the
following conditions exist:
         (a)   The PUD is to include two or more principal land uses;
         (b)   Natural features of the land are such that development under
standard zoning regulations would not be appropriate in order to conserve such
features;
         (c)   The land is adjacent to or across the street from property which
has been developed as a PUD and is to be developed in relationship to such
prior development;
         (d)   The land is located in the city’s historic downtown;
         (e)   The land is an existing developed site which is proposed for
redevelopment; or
         (f)   The PUD process is desirable to ensure compatibility and careful
consideration of the effect of a development on surrounding land uses.
      (2)   Determining standards. Standards such as lot size, coverage,
setbacks, building height, parking, and screening shall be governed by the
standards of the zoning district most similar in function to the proposed PUD
use(s), as determined by the Planning Commission and City Council. Deviation
from those standards may be permitted only if such deviation is consistent with
the total design of the development, encourages a desirable living environment,
and is not detrimental to the welfare of the city.
         (a)   More than one principal building may be constructed on each
platted lot within a PUD as long as the buildings are separated by at least 15
feet.
      (3)   Access.
         (a)   All land uses shall abut on a public street or have adequate
access to a public street by means of a private street or drive. All streets
and drives must tie in effectively with the city's existing street system and
with those arterial and collector streets proposed in the Byron Comprehensive
Plan.
         (b)   All sidewalks and trails within the PUD shall be public.
      (4)   Architectural style. The architectural style of individual
structures shall be compatible with other structures in the PUD, with the
overall site design, and with surrounding land uses.
      (5)   Open space.
         (a)   Open space shall include all areas of the development with
physical characteristics unsuitable for development in their natural state, and
areas containing significant historic sites.
         (b)   Usable open space shall be required for each PUD.
            (i)   Usable open space shall be of a size, shape, and location
suitable for its intended purpose.
            (ii)   PUDs with residential uses shall provide at least 10% of the
development as usable open space.
            (iii)   PUDs with non-residential uses shall provide central area
(s) or feature(s) such as a patio with seating, pedestrian plaza with benches,
water feature(s), and/or other designated areas or focal points as approved
through the PUD approval process that are openly accessible to the public. The
size of this area shall be no smaller than 5% of the total PUD area. The
central area(s) or feature(s) shall be designed with materials compatible with
the building and remainder of the site and shall be maintained over the life of
the development.
            (iv)   For PUDs with a mix of residential and non-residential uses,
subsection (ii) shall apply to the residential portion of the PUD while
subsection (iii) shall be used to calculate the appropriate amount of open
space for the non-residential portion.
         (c)   Whenever possible, open space shall be linked to the open space
areas of surrounding developments.
         (d)   Deed restrictions, covenants, permanent easements, public
dedication and acceptance, or other equally effective and permanent means shall
be provided to ensure long term preservation and maintenance of open space for
its intended use as specified in the Final Development Plan.
      (6)   Homeowners association. Membership in a homeowner’s association or
similar organization approved by the city shall be mandatory for all residents
of the planned unit development. The homeowner’s association shall own and
maintain all common open space and private interior roadways.

§ 152.052 FLOOD PRONE AREA REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Intent. The intent of these requirements is to guide development in
the flood prone area consistent with the flood threat in order to minimize
adverse effects on the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      DRAINAGEWAY, NATURAL. Any naturally occurring watercourse, trench, ditch,
swale or similar depression in which surface water or groundwater is collected
and flows during any part of a year.
      FLOOD LEVEL, MAXIMUM. The elevations at which flooding is recorded by the
flood prone soils in a natural drainageway, for example, or the elevation of
flood prone soil boundaries in undeveloped watersheds.
      FLOOD PRONE SOILS. Based on the U.S.D.A. Soil Conservation Service Soil
Survey of Olmsted County, Minnesota, alluvial soils or soils deposited by
surface water runoff that indicate areas of land that are flooded temporarily.
Any land area on which the following soils are located are subject to flooding
and are flood prone soils:
 
Map Symbol Soil Name
19         Chaseburg
467        Sawmill
468        Otter
1846       Kato
 
   (C)   Uses in the flood prone area. All uses located within the flood prone
area shall be permitted only after a conditional use permit has been issued by
the city.
   (D)   Development standards. The deposition of any fill or spoil from
dredging or sand and gravel operations, the construction of any structure or
the grading or paving of any area shall require certification by a registered
professional engineer or hydrologist that the following conditions have been
met. The City Engineer also shall review all permit applications to determine
that the following conditions have been met:
      (1)   Fill deposited in the flood prone area shall be no more than the
minimum amount necessary to conduct the use. Where any permanent building or
structure is planned to be located fill shall be at a minimum of one foot above
the maximum flood level;
      (2)   No net loss of capacity for surface storage of flood waters shall
result from the activity. The cumulative effect of fill within the flood prone
area shall cause no increase in upstream flood levels. Compensatory storage
shall be provided to offset the storage lost through filling;
      (3)   The cumulative effect of fill shall not cause an increase in the
velocity of flood waters;
      (4)   The effect of such activities in the flood prone area shall not
result in an increase in erosion potential on the site or in the flood prone
area downstream of the fill site;
      (5)   In no event shall an increase in the maximum flood level be
permitted if it would affect any existing building;
      (6)   Fill shall consist of soil or rock materials only;
      (7)   All fill areas shall be stabilized with material which will ensure
and protect against erosion, undercutting and undermining.
   (E)   Engineering studies. In developing proper hydrologic and hydraulic
studies, the following conditions shall be addressed:
      (1)   Consideration of the effects of a proposed use shall be based on a
reasonable assumption that there will be an equal degree of encroachment
extending for a significant reach on both sides of the natural drainageway;
      (2)   The maximum flood level is calculated based on the location of
alluvial soils and is therefore an historic record, not a reflection of the
potential flooding once urban development occurs in the watershed or a portion
thereof. Engineering studies shall address this difference, and, where the
studies indicate that the maximum flood level, as defined, is at a lower
elevation than the flooding elevation based on hydraulic studies of a
developing watershed, then the flooding elevation of the hydraulic studies
shall be used to determine all further development standards under this section
of this chapter.
   (F)   Flood prone soils location. The location of flood prone soils shall be
determined by the Zoning Administrator by scaling the location from the soils
map covering the Byron area in the Soil Survey of Olmsted County, Minnesota.
Otherwise, the applicant shall be given the opportunity to determine flood
prone soils locations as part of the required engineering study carried out by
a registered professional engineer or hydrologist.

         (b)   Permitted locations.
            (i)   No wireless communication tower shall be erected in the city
unless the applicant demonstrates that the equipment planned for the purpose of
the proposed wireless communication cannot be accommodated on an existing or
approved tower, building, or structure within one mile search radius of the
proposed tower due to one or more of the following reasons:
               a.   The planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity
of the existing or approved structure, as documented by a qualified and
licensed professional engineer; and the existing or approved structure cannot
be reinforced, modified, or replaced to accommodate planned or equivalent
equipment at a reasonable cost.
               b.   The planned equipment would cause interference materially
impacting the usability of other existing or planned equipment at the tower or
building as documented by a qualified and licensed professional engineer, and
the interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost.
               c.   Existing or approved wireless communication towers and
buildings within the search radius cannot accommodate the planned equipment at
a height necessary to function reasonably as documented by a qualified and
licensed professional engineer.
               d.   Other unforeseen reasons that make it unfeasible to locate
the planned equipment upon an existing or approved structure.
            (ii)   Wireless communications towers are permitted with a
conditional use in areas with the following uses:

requirements.
         (a)   All towers and antennas shall comply with all FCC and FAA rules
and regulations. Wireless communication towers attached to a building or
existing structure shall comply with the setbacks of the zoning district and
shall not exceed 20 feet in height beyond the top of the primary structure.
Freestanding towers shall be set back one foot from any property line or
building for each one foot of structural height. Freestanding towers shall not
be located in a front yard, nor shall any part of the antenna or tower extend
across or over any part of the public right-of-way, street, highway or walkway.
         (b)   Towers should be located in areas that provide the maximum
possible amount of natural or existing structural screening for off-site view.
         (c)   Towers shall be self-supporting without the use of wires,
cables, beams or other means, the design should utilize an open framework or
monopole configuration that is designed to collapse in on itself in the event
of structural damage. Design and installation of towers and antennas shall
comply with all applicable federal and state standards, including FCC and FAA
standards and the current Uniform Building Code, and shall be approved and
stamped by a licensed professional structural engineer.
         (d)   Towers shall be designed to allow the future co-location of
equipment at varying heights. Tower operators are required to accept co-
location of communication equipment and shall not make co-location economically
unfeasible. Towers over 150 feet in height shall be designed for co-location of
at least three additional antennas. Towers of 125 feet to less than 150 feet
shall be designed for co-location of at least two additional antennas. Towers
of 100 feet to less than 125 feet shall be designed for co-location of at least
one additional antenna. Subsequent co-locators are subject to the same
provisions and procedures as the primary conditional use applicant.
         (e)   Towers shall only be illuminated by artificial means if such
light is required by federal (FAA) or state regulations; or if the lighting is
used to illuminate ball fields, parking lots or similar areas; or if said
artificial illumination is used for crime prevention purposes.
         (f)   The use of any portion of a tower for signs other than required
warning or equipment information is prohibited. All buildings and structures
accessory to a tower shall:
            (i)   Be constructed of a material on the exterior of the building
similar to the surrounding residential area when located in or adjacent to a
residential zoning district.
            (ii)   Be buffered and screened from adjoining uses as established
in the requirements of the underlying zoning district.
            (iii)   Meet the height and setback limitations as established for
each zoning district.
         (g)   A tower shall have only one accessory building, which shall be
immediately adjacent to the tower. The accessory building shall contain only
electronic equipment that is necessary for the functioning of the
telecommunications system.
         (h)   The ground level perimeter may be required to be screened with
pre-approved landscaping and/or fencing at the owner’s expense. The tower shall
be reasonably protected against unauthorized access and vandalism.
         (i)   All construction, installation, wiring and maintenance of towers
shall not create a safety hazard or damage to the property of others, nor
interfere with public safety communications.
         (j)   Owners or operators shall remove abandoned or unused towers and
similar facilities within 12 months of the cessation of operations and shall
restore the site to its original condition. Should the owners or operators of
abandoned or unused towers and similar facilities fail to abide by this
provision, the city shall remove the structure and shall assess the costs to
the property, owner, or operator.
         (k)   All wireless communication facilities that are in existence to
date may continue to operate, but may not be replaced or structurally altered
without complying in all respects to this section. Routine adjustment or
replacement of the primary or co-location antennae shall not constitute a
replacement or structural alteration of a wireless communication facility.
         (l)   When the owner of property upon which a wireless communication
facility is located requests preliminary plat approval or requests the issuance
of a building permit, any and all wireless communication facilities which fail
to conform to this section shall be removed prior to preliminary plat approval
or building permit issuance, whichever occurs first.

      (3)   Additional standards.
         (a)   For all existing and new permitted commercial uses located in
the downtown commercial area, as identified by the Byron Comprehensive Plan, no
off-street parking shall be required.
         (b)   Residential uses located on the same lot as the principal
commercial use in a commercial district shall be required to have one off-
street parking space for each dwelling unit.
         (c)   A proportion of the total spaces in a parking lot may be
designed and marked for small car use according to the following:
 
Total Spaces Required Maximum percentage of spaces for small cars

100 or more           40%
 
      (4)   Buffers or screening shall be required for all parking areas used
by commercial or industrial uses that are adjacent to or abutting a residential
district as specified in §
152.085 Buffering and Screening.
   (B)   Joint parking requirements. Two or more uses may provide required off-
street parking spaces in a common parking facility where the total number of
spaces provided is less than the sum of the total required for each use if the
following conditions are satisfactorily met:
      (1)   The proposed joint parking space is within 500 feet of the use it
will serve.
      (2)   The applicant shall demonstrate that there is not substantial
conflict in the principal operating hours of the two or more buildings or uses
for which joint use of off-street parking facilities is proposed.
      (3)   A properly drawn legal instrument approved by the City Council and
executed by the parties concerned for shared use of off-street parking
facilities shall be filed with the City Clerk. Said instrument may be a three
party agreement, including the city and all private parties involved. Such
instrument shall first be approved by the City Attorney.
   (C)   Proof of parking requirements. The city may allow reductions in the
number of required parking spaces to be installed via an interim use permit if
the following conditions are met:
      (1)   Applicant has demonstrated that the unique characteristics of the
proposed use are such that it will generate a need for less parking than the
ordinance standard.
      (2)   All requests for reductions in the amount of required parking to be
installed shall be accompanied by a plan showing where the total amount of
parking spaces required by this chapter can be added on the lot, if necessary,
without requiring a variance.
   (D)   Off-street loading. Off-street loading requirements as specified below
shall be provided.
      (1)   Dimensions and locations. Each loading space shall not be less than
10 feet in width and 25 feet in length and shall be on the same lot as the
principal use it serves. Such space may occupy all or any part of any required
side or rear yard, except the space shall not be located in the side yard along
the side street in the case of a corner lot. In no event shall any part of a
required front yard be occupied by such loading space. Each loading space shall
have adequate space for standing, loading, and unloading services in order to
avoid any interference with public use of the roads or alleys or sidewalks.

§ 152.083 COMMON ELEMENTS.
   (A)   Common open space ownership. At the time of development review, the
city shall require dedication of common open space and may obtain such open
space, if the city determines that a public purpose will be served by providing
open space within the area of the city. Common open space shall remain in
private ownership unless the City Council determines that it is in the best
interest of the city to obtain the open space and make it available to the
public.
   (B)   Ownership and maintenance of common improvements.
      (1)   All developments involving common open space area and other common
improvements shall meet the requirements herein set forth, and no development
application shall be approved until compliance with this section is
established.
      (2)   The applicant or developer shall provide for and establish a non-
profit organization or other legal entity under the laws of Minnesota for the
ownership, care, and maintenance of common landscaped areas, recreational
areas, private streets, parking lots, or other commonly owned facilities.
      (3)   Such organization shall be created by covenants and restrictions
running with the land and shall be composed of all persons having ownership
within the development. Such organization shall be responsible for the
perpetuation, maintenance, and function of all common lands, uses, and
facilities.
      (4)   If the common areas are deeded to a homeowner's association, the
proposed documents governing the association shall be filed with the Zoning
Administrator. Such documents shall meet the following requirements:
         (a)   The homeowner's association must be established before any
residences are sold;
         (b)   Membership in the association must be mandatory for each
residence owner;
         (c)   Common area restrictions must be permanent and not for a period
of years;
         (d)   The homeowner's association must be made responsible for
liability insurance, taxes, and maintenance of recreational and other
facilities;
         (e)   The association must have the power to levy assessments which
can become a lien on individual premises for the purpose of paying the cost of
operating and maintaining common facilities;
         (f)   The governing board of any such association shall consist of at
least three members who shall be owners of property in the development.
      (5)   All lands and improvements shall be described and identified as to
location, size, use, and control in a restrictive covenant, and such covenant
shall set forth the method of assessment for the maintenance of such land.
      (6)   Such restrictive covenant and organization shall continue in effect
so as to control the availability of the facilities and land thereby provided
to maintain the land and facilities for their intended function on and to
protect the development from additional and unplanned densities of use. Such
organization shall not be dissolved nor shall such organization dispose of any
common open space, unless that land is dedicated to the city.
      (7)   In the event the organization established to own and maintain
common open spaces, recreational areas, communally owned facilities, and
private streets, or any successor organization shall at any time fail to
maintain the common facilities in responsible order and condition in accordance
with the approved plan, the City Council may cause written notice to be served
upon such organization or upon the owners of property in the development
setting forth the manner in which the common facilities have failed to be
maintained in reasonable condition. Such notice shall include the demand that
the deficiencies noted be cured within 30 days thereafter and shall state the
date and place of a hearing to be held within 14 days of the notice. At the
time of hearing, the City Council may modify the terms of the original notice
as to deficiencies and may extend the time within which the same may be cured.
If the deficiencies set forth in the original notice or modifications are not
cured within the time set, the City Council, in order to preserve the taxable
values of properties within the development and to prevent the common
facilities from becoming a public nuisance, may enter upon such common
facilities and maintain the same for a period of six months. Such entry and
maintenance shall not vest in the public any right to use the common facilities
not dedicated to public use. Before expiration of such six months, the City
Council shall, upon its own initiative, or upon the written request of the
organization theretofore responsible for maintenance, call a public hearing and
give notice of such hearing to the organization responsible for maintenance or
the property owners of the development. At such hearing, the organization
responsible for maintenance and/or the residents of the development may show
cause why maintenance by the city should not be continued for a succeeding six
months. If the City Council determines that it is not necessary for the city to
continue such maintenance, the city shall cease such maintenance at the time
established by the City Council. Otherwise, the city shall continue maintenance
for the next succeeding six months subject to a similar hearing and
determination at the end of each six months thereafter. The cost of maintenance
by the city shall be a lien against the common facilities of the development
and the private properties within the development. The City Council shall have
the right to make assessments against properties in the development on the same
basis that the organization responsible for maintenance of the facilities could
make such assessments. Any unpaid assessment shall be a lien against the
property responsible for the same, enforceable the same as a mortgage against
the property. The city may further foreclose its lien on the common facility by
certifying the same to the County Treasurer for collection of general property
taxes.
(Ord. 2023-02, passed 5-9-23)
§ 152.084 FENCES, WALLS, AND HEDGES.
   A fence, wall, column, peer, post, or any similar type structure, or any
combination of such structures, may be permitted in the required yards of the
various districts, subject to the following requirements:
   (A)   It shall be the responsibility of the property owner to locate all
property lines;
   (B)   No fence, hedge, or wall may extend beyond or across a property line
unless in joint agreement with the abutting property owner;
   (C)   No fence, hedge, or wall shall be closer than 18 inches to any public
sidewalk;
   (D)   Fences and walls shall not exceed seven feet in height above the
elevation of the surface of the ground at any point, except:
      (1)   That in instances where public safety or security necessitate, the
Zoning Administrator may authorize fences and walls to have a maximum height of
not to exceed 10 feet above the elevation of the surface of the ground at any
point. Fences of this height are required to obtain a building permit and
certification from the City Engineer;
      (2)   Where the grade of buildings on adjacent lots is greater than that
of buildings on the applicant's lot, the fence may exceed the height
limitations, but in no case shall it exceed the grade of the adjacent building
by more than five feet;
      (3)   Where used for private open space requirements in cluster or
planned residential development; or
   (E)   Fences, walls, and hedges shall not interfere with solar energy access
to existing solar energy systems located on adjacent lots.
(Ord. 2023-02, passed 5-9-23)
§ 152.085 BUFFERING AND SCREENING.
   (A)   Purpose. Buffering and screening serves to soften the outline of
buildings, to screen glare and noise, and to create a visual and/or physical
barrier between conflicting land uses. Buffering and screening are required
between specified lots in different zoning districts and between land
developments and along existing streets. The extent of buffering and screening
required shall be determined by the type of use proposed and the adjacent uses
and/or zoning surrounding the proposed development. The impact of the proposed
use on adjoining properties is the basis for establishing buffering and
screening standards.
   (B)   Required buffering and screening. All buffering and screening required
by this chapter shall conform to the regulations set forth in this section of
this chapter. Buffering and screening that conforms to the requirements of this
section shall be required as specified in the table set forth below or
provisions (D)(1) through (4). The applicant proposing the new land use,
rezoning, or major structural change or expansion shall be responsible for
meeting the requirements of this section of this chapter.
   (C)   Determination of buffering and screening class.
      (1)   The table set forth in this section specifies the buffering and
screening that shall be required. For each property boundary, the applicant
shall determine the adjacent zoning district(s). Then, the applicant shall
match the proposed land use, whether the land is vacant or there is an existing
use that is proposing a major structural change or expansion or rezoning with
the identified adjacent zoning district(s) in the table below. The letter
indicates the buffer class. After determining the buffer class from the table,
the applicant shall select a planting option from the table set forth in
provision (E) of this section.
      (2)   A major structural change or expansion, for the purposes of this
section, shall be considered to be an expansion of the existing building floor
area or land area used by 40% or more.

      (3)   Where a street or alley is located between the proposed and
adjacent land uses, the required Class (A-D) shall be reduced to the next less
restrictive class, such as from Class C to Class B, except industrial uses
which shall be required to use the same classes as indicated on the table
above.
   (D)   Special planning option requirements.
      (1)   Buffering and screening shall be required to be located along the
perimeter of all parking areas of nonresidential uses located in residential
districts. The buffering and screening planting option required shall be Class
B.
      (2)   Buffering and screening shall be required around the perimeter of
parking areas serving dwelling uses with three or more units located in the
Mixed Low Density Residential (R-2) District. The buffering and screening
planting required shall be one deciduous canopy tree per 40 feet and one
understory tree per 40 feet or a hedge planted on three-foot centers and
meeting all other requirements of this section.
      (3)   Low- or High-Density Residential uses proposed for development
adjacent to arterial streets, as designated in the Byron Comprehensive Plan or
railroad right-of-way shall be required to provide buffering and screening to
the level specified in planting options, Class B.
      (4)   Where a railroad right-of-way is located between the proposed
industrial/commercial and adjacent residential uses/zoning, no buffer or
screening shall be required adjacent to the railroad right-of- way.
   (E)   Planting options.
      (1)   The options below indicate the amount of plant material and fencing
that is required. Unless specified, plantings are not required to be aligned on
property or right-of-way boundaries, but may be sited in any required yard on
the property for buffering and screening purposes. The Planning Commission and
City Council may permit staggering or grouping of plant materials if a
satisfactory buffer is achieved. Determination of the total number of plants
shall be made by dividing the dimensions of the area where buffering and
screening is required by the specification of the tables set forth in this
section.

   (F)   General requirements.
      (1)   All existing deciduous and coniferous trees larger than two inches
in diameter, six inches above ground level, and/or six feet in height may be
considered to contribute to the required buffering and screening. Where the
amount of existing plant material of that size or greater equals or contributes
to the required number of plants under the appropriate class, an equivalent
reduction may be taken in the number and type of required plants. In all cases,
existing plant material of the above diameter and height shall be preserved in
any buffer yard, except where clearance is required to ensure adequate sight
distance. Any removal shall, where feasible, involve relocation rather than
clearing.
      (2)   The buffer yard may be coterminous with required front, side, or
rear yards, and in case of conflict, the larger yard requirements shall apply.
      (3)   All buffering and screening areas shall be maintained and kept
clean of all debris, rubbish, weeds, and tall grass in conformance with
existing regulations.
      (4)   No structure, manufacturing, or processing activity or storage of
materials shall be permitted in the buffering and screening areas; however,
parking of passenger automobiles shall be permitted in the portion of the
buffering and screening area exclusive of the exterior 15 feet adjacent to the
lot line.
      (5)   The buffering and screening areas shall be located on the outer
perimeter of the lot, extending to the property line, except when there exists
a utility easement, in which case the buffering and screening area shall be
measured from the inner boundary of the utility easement. No buffer yard shall
be located on any portion of an existing or dedicated public or private street
right-of-way.
      (6)   Plant materials:
         (a)   By this chapter, canopy trees (deciduous or coniferous) shall be
considered to be trees that when full-grown will attain a height of over 30
feet in height; understory trees shall be considered to be trees that when
full-grown attain a height of between ten and 30 feet; shrubs shall be
considered to be woody perennial plants that when full-grown attain a height of
between three and 15 feet.
         (b)   Minimum size:
 
Canopy tree     Deciduous                1½  11 – 1¾ 11 in diameter
                Coniferous               6 – 8 feet in height
Understory tree                         1½ 11 – 1¾ 11 in diameter
Shrub           Deciduous and coniferous 2 – 4 feet in height
 
         (c)   Plant materials shall be permanently maintained and any plant
material which does not live shall be replaced within one year. All plant
material shall be native to Minnesota or have been known to be able to survive
and grow in the southeast Minnesota climate. All planting material shall meet
the standards of the American Association of Nurserymen.
         (d)   It is encouraged that plant materials in buffering and screening
areas be planted in natural clusters that will give privacy but will not block
views or vistas. The exception shall be commercial or industrial uses bordering
residential uses. Here a dense, visual screen is encouraged.
         (e)   Prior to the issuance of any zoning permit, complete plans
showing the arrangement of all buffering and screening areas; the placement,
species and size of all plant materials; and the placement, size, materials and
type of all fences to be placed in such buffering and screening areas shall be
reviewed by the Zoning Administrator to ascertain that the plans are in
conformance with the terms of this chapter.

§ 152.086 SOIL EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL.
   (A)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      ERODIBLE SLOPE. All slopes with inclines in excess of 4%.
      EROSION includes both the detachment and transport of soil particles.
      LARGE FLAT SURFACE AREA (UNPAVED). An area which is flat or whose slope
is less than 4% and which consists of more than 1,000 square feet of exposed
soil.
      SEDIMENTATION. The sending out of the soil particles which are
transported by water and wind. Sedimentation occurs when the velocity of water
or wind in which soil particles are suspended is slowed to a sufficient degree
and for a sufficient period of time to allow the particles to settle out of
suspension or when the degree of slope is lessened to achieve the same result.
      SOIL EROSION. Any removal and/or loss of soil by the action of water,
ice, gravity or wind.
   (B)   Erosion control policies. Any conditional use permit or other
application requiring site plan approval and subdivision plats shall prepare a
soil erosion plan addressing the following policies. Such plan shall be
approved by the City Engineer as a condition to site plan approval.
      (1)   The smallest practical area of land shall be exposed at any given
time during development.
      (2)   Such minimum area exposure shall be kept to as short a duration of
time as is practicable.
      (3)   If at all practicable, temporary vegetation, mulching, or other
cover shall be used to protect
areas exposed during development.
      (4)   Provision shall be made to effectively accommodate the increased
surface water runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and
after development on upstream and downstream flooding, surface water runoff
volumes, and soil erosion and sedimentation, such that there is no significant
increase thereof.
      (5)   Permanent, final plant covering or structures shall be installed as
soon as possible.
      (6)   The plan of development shall relate to the topography and soils of
the site so that the lowest potential for erosion is created.
      (7)   Natural plant covering shall be retained and protected and shall be
deemed a dominating factor in developing the site.

§ 152.103 INTERIM USE PERMIT (IUP).
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of an Interim Use Permit (IUP) is to permit a use
which would not be appropriate generally, but which may be allowed within a
certain zoning district with appropriate restrictions. An IUP is not intended
to last indefinitely, but is meant to have a specific end date for when the use

§ 152.105 VARIANCE.
   (A)   Purpose. A variance is a modification or variation of the provisions
of this zoning code as applied to a specific piece of property. A variance may
be granted when strict enforcement of the provisions of the zoning code would
cause practical difficulties to the property owner, and when it can be
demonstrated that such action will be in keeping with the spirit and intent of
the code.
   (B)   General provisions.
      (1)   The City Council shall act as the Board of Adjustment.
      (2)   A variance may not be approved to allow a use that is not allowed
under the Zoning Code for property in the zone where the affected person's land
is located.
      (3)   Under no circumstances shall the City Council grant a variance to
an existing nonconforming use of land or building as specified under §
152.009 Nonconforming Uses, Lot, and Structure.

and
         (c)   The applicant has established that there are “practical
difficulties” in complying with this chapter.
      (2)   Practical difficulties, as used in connection with the granting of
a variance, means that:
         (a)   The property owner proposes to use the property in a reasonable
manner not permitted by the zoning ordinance;
         (b)   The plight of the landowner is due to circumstances unique to
the property not created by the landowner; and
         (c)   The variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character
of the locality.
         (d)   Economic considerations alone do not constitute practical
difficulties.
         (e)   Practical difficulties include, but are not limited to,
inadequate access to direct sunlight for solar energy systems.
   (E)   Conditions. The City Council may impose conditions in the granting of
variances. Any condition must be directly related to and must bear a rough
proportionality to the impact created by the variance. Violation of such
conditions, when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted,
shall be deemed a violation of this chapter.
(Ord. 2023-02, passed 5-9-23)
§ 152.106 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD).
   (A)   Applicability. PUDs are processed using a development stage PUD plan

allowed as appropriate. The development stage and final stage PUD plan
processes may also occur simultaneously when the complexity of the project will
allow.
   (B)   Pre-application meeting.
      (1)   Before submitting the development stage PUD plan application to the
city, the developer shall meet with the City Administrator, Planning
Coordinator, City Engineer, Public Works Director, and any other such personnel
as may be deemed necessary to determine the feasibility and suitability of the
application.
      (2)   This step is required so that the developer may obtain information
and guidance from city officials before entering into any binding commitments
or incurring substantial expenses of the site and plan preparation.
      (3)   During this meeting, staff will determine if the project must go
through the concept planning process specified in §
151.078 Concept Plan.

PUD plans, the PUD shall be designated on the city's Official Zoning Map.
   (D)   Final stage PUD procedure.
      (1)   Within 12 months after the development stage PUD plan has been
approved, the applicant shall submit an application for final development plan
approval. Failure to do so shall result in the development stage PUD plan
becoming null and void.
      (2)   The final stage PUD plan may, if permitted by the City Council as
part of a phasing plan approved during the development stage PUD review,
constitute only that portion of the approved development stage PUD plan which
the applicant proposes to record at that time.
      (3)   The City Council, upon written request by the developer, may extend
the period permitted for the final stage PUD plan application for periods of
not more than 12 months each upon a finding that:
         (a)   The proposed use(s) is consistent with the Byron Comprehensive
Plan at the time the request for an extension is considered; and
         (b)   The project design meets the applicable City Code standards in
effect at the time the request for an extension is considered, or the design is
modified to satisfy those standards.

processed using the same procedure as outlined in §
152.100 Common Procedures and Requirements with the exception of a public
hearing.
      (5)   Criteria for review. The City Council shall base its actions
regarding a final stage PUD plan upon the final plan’s substantial compliance
with the approved development stage PUD plan. Substantial compliance shall

requirements.
         (d)   An applicant may request an extension of the expiration date
from the City Council. The Council may extend the approval for an additional

hearing by the Planning Commission and upon approval by the Council.
   (G)   Amendment of a PUD.

modifications to an existing project which does not conform to the approved
final stage PUD plan shall be processed as either a minor amendment or a major
amendment.
      (3)   Minor amendments meeting the requirements of provision (D)(5) above
may be reviewed and approved administratively by the Zoning Administrator.
      (4)   Any major amendment to the final PUD plan shall require review and
approval of the development stage and final stage PUD plans using the procedure
identified in §

stage PUD plans may be reviewed concurrently. An amendment shall be considered
major if it involves any change greater than specified in provision (D)(5)
above.

proposed change shall be based on all requirements of Chapters
151 Subdivision Regulations and
152 Zoning Regulations and the approved PUD plans.
