§ 10.20 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Any licensed peace official of the city’s Police Department, or the
County Sheriff, or any Deputy Sheriff shall have the authority to enforce any
provision of this code.
   (B)   As permitted by M.S. § 626.862, as it may be amended from time to
time, the City Administrator/Clerk/Treasurer shall have the authority to
administer and enforce this code. In addition, under that statutory authority,
certain individuals designated within the code or by the City Administrator/
Clerk/Treasurer or City Council shall have the authority to administer and
enforce the provisions specified. All and any person or persons designated may
issue a citation in lieu of arrest or continued detention to enforce any
provision of the code.
   (C)   The City Administrator/Clerk/Treasurer and any city official or
employee designated by this code who has the responsibility to perform a duty
under this code may, with the permission of a licensee of a business or owner
of any property or resident of a dwelling, or other person in control of any
premises, inspect or otherwise enter any property to enforce compliance with
this code.
   (D)   If the licensee, owner, resident or other person in control of a
premises objects to the inspection of or entrance to the property, the City
Administrator/Clerk/Treasurer, peace official or any employee or official
charged with the duty of enforcing the provisions of this code may, upon a
showing that probable cause exists for the issuance of a valid search warrant
from a court of competent jurisdiction, petition and obtain a search warrant
before conducting the inspection or otherwise entering the property. This
warrant shall be only to determine whether the provisions of this code enacted
to protect the health, safety and welfare of the people are being complied with
and to enforce these provisions only, and no criminal charges shall be made as
a result of the warrant. No warrant shall be issued unless there be probable
cause to issue the warrant. Probable cause occurs if the search is reasonable.
Probable cause does not depend on specific knowledge of the condition of a
particular property.
   (E)   Every licensee, owner, resident or other person in control of property
within the city shall permit at reasonable times inspections of or entrance to
the property by the City Administrator/Clerk/Treasurer or any other authorized
city official or employee only to determine whether the provisions of this code
enacted to protect the health, safety and welfare of the people are being
complied with and to enforce these provisions. Unreasonable refusal to permit
the inspection of or entrance to the property shall be grounds for termination
of any and all permits, licenses or city service to the property. Mailed notice
shall be given to the licensee, owner, resident or other person in control of
the property, stating the grounds for the termination, and the licensee, owner,
resident or other person in control of the property shall be given an
opportunity to appear before the City Administrator/Clerk/Treasurer to object
to the termination before it occurs, subject to appeal of the City
Administrator/Clerk/Treasurer’s decision to the City Council at a regularly
scheduled or special meeting.
   (F)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of
the city to enter private property in urgent emergency situations where there
is an imminent danger in order to protect the public health, safety and
welfare.
§ 10.98 SUPPLEMENTAL ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES.
   (A)   In addition to those administrative penalties established in this code
and the enforcement powers granted in §
10.20 of this chapter, the City Council is authorized to create by resolution,
adopted by a majority of the members of the Council, supplemental
administrative penalties. Such resolution may not proscribe administrative
penalties for traffic offenses designated by M.S. § 169.999, as it may be
amended from time to time.
   (B)   These administrative penalty procedures in this section are intended
to provide the public and the city with an informal, cost effective and
expeditious alternative to traditional criminal charges for violations of
certain provisions of this code. The procedures are intended to be voluntary on
the part of those who have been charged with those offenses.
   (C)   Administrative penalties for violations of various provisions of the
code, other than those penalties established in the code or in statutes that
are adopted by reference, may be established from time to time by resolution of
a majority of the members of the City Council. In order to be effective, an
administrative penalty for a particular violation must be established before
the violation occurred.
   (D)   In the discretion of the peace official, City Administrator/Clerk/
Treasurer or other person giving notice of an alleged violation of a provision
of this code, in a written notice of an alleged violation, sent by first class
mail to the person who is alleged to have violated the code, the person giving
notice may request the payment of a voluntary administrative penalty for the
violation directly to the City Administrator/Clerk/Treasurer within 14 days of
the notice of the violation. In the sole discretion of the person giving the
notice of the alleged violation, the time for payment may be extended an
additional 14 days, whether or not requested by the person to whom the notice
has been given. In addition to the administrative penalty, the person giving
notice may request in the notice to the alleged violator to adopt a compliance
plan to correct the situation resulting in the alleged violation and may
provide that if the alleged violator corrects the situation resulting in the
alleged violation within the time specified in the notice, that the payment of
the administrative penalty will be waived.
   (E)   At any time before the payment of the administrative penalty is due,
the person who has been given notice of an alleged violation may request to
appear before the City Council to contest the request for payment of the
penalty. After a hearing before the Council, the Council may determine to
withdraw the request for payment or to renew the request for payment. Because
the payment of the administrative penalty is voluntary, there shall be no
appeal from the decision of the Council.
   (F)   At any time after the date the payment of the administrative penalty
is due, if the administrative penalty remains unpaid or the situation creating
the alleged violation remains uncorrected, the city, through its Attorney, may
bring criminal charges in accordance with state law and this code. Likewise,
the city, in its discretion, may bring criminal charges in the first instance,
rather than requesting the payment of an administrative penalty, even if a
penalty for the particular violation has been established by Council
resolution. If the administrative penalty is paid, or if any requested
correction of the situation resulting in the violation is completed, no
criminal charges shall be initiated by the city for the alleged violation.
§ 10.99 GENERAL PENALTY AND ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Any person, firm or corporation who violates any provision of this
code for which another penalty is not specifically provided shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor. The penalty which may be imposed for
any crime which is a misdemeanor under this code, including Minnesota Statutes
specifically adopted by reference, shall be a sentence of not more than 90 days
or a fine of not more than $1,000, or both.
   (B)   Any person, firm or corporation who violates any provision of this
code, including Minnesota Statutes specifically adopted by reference, which is
designated to be a petty misdemeanor shall, upon conviction be guilty of a
petty misdemeanor. The penalty which may be imposed for any petty offense which
is a petty misdemeanor shall be a sentence of a fine of not more than $300.
   (C)   Pursuant to M.S. § 631.48, as it may be amended from time to time, in
either the case of a misdemeanor or a petty misdemeanor, the costs of
prosecution may be added. A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon
each day during which a violation occurs or continues.
   (D)   The failure of any official or employee of the city to perform any
official duty imposed by this code shall not subject the official or employee
to the penalty imposed for a violation.
   (E)   In addition to any penalties provided for in this section or in §
10.98 of this chapter, if any person, firm or corporation fails to comply with
any provision of this code, the Council or any city official designated by it,
may institute appropriate proceedings at law or at equity to restrain, correct
or abate the violation.

      (8)   Public sale. If the volume and value of unclaimed property is
insufficient in the opinion of both the Chief of Police and any appointed
responsible authority to justify a public auction, the unclaimed property may
be sold by public sale. The responsible authority shall follow the procedure in
division (B)(7) above; except that, the sale will be at a public sale to the
person with the first reasonable offer.
      (9)   Disposition of proceeds and unsold property. The responsible
authority shall remit the proceeds of the auction/sale to the City
Administrator/Clerk/Treasurer for deposit in the General Fund. Any property
offered for sale, but not sold and not suitable for appropriation to the use of
the city shall be deemed worthless and shall be disposed of in such manner as
the responsible authority directs.
      (10)   Claim by owner after auction. The lawful owner of property sold at
public auction or sale shall, upon application to the City Administrator/Clerk/

dispose of any property, determined as being dangerous or perishable, coming
into the possession of this person. The responsible authority shall make a

describe the premises to be served, the materials to be used, the general and
specific uses of the water and the estimated quantity of water to be used per
month.
   (B)   Connection fee. The number of unit determination of property is based
on the future use of the building. In the case of a shell building that will be
occupied by multiple tenants, with the use of each space not known, the number
of initial units is determined and collected based on the speculative use of
the shell building. The number of units shall be an estimate determined by
using the Metropolitan Council’s SAC unit determination. As uses for the

of any repairs made beyond the curb box, but shall make such necessary repairs
to the curb stop and box itself.
   (F)   Persons making installations. The installations of service connections
to the water system shall only be made by plumbers duly licensed under the laws
of the state and in accordance with any of the provisions of this chapter. The

period. Upon the filing of a claim, the city shall investigate the incident and
determine the amount, if any, which the claimant should be refunded. The amount
shall be reported to the City Council and, if approved, the amount shall be
allowed as a credit on succeeding water bills or as a regular claim for
damages. No claim against the city shall be allowed for any loss by fire or
injury to persons or property.

certified to the county’s Auditor as taxes against such property to be
collected and paid over to the city along with other taxes. Either or both of
such methods of collection thereof may be pursued by the city until payment in
full has been made, and the initiation of one such method of collection shall
not be deemed to be an election preventing the city from thereafter using the
other method of collection until paid in full.

§ 51.07 WATER REVENUE FUND.
   A special Water Revenue Fund is established and shall be kept and maintained

the driveway, if necessary. The expense will be the city's, however, the
property owner will be responsible for expenses of repairs to the driveway and
landscaping.
   (B)   It shall not be the responsibility of the city to determine whether
repair or adjustment is needed.
   (C)   The costs of all such maintenance and repair of curb boxes or stops
shall be the expense of the city. If it is determined that the repair or
maintenance was required due to faulty materials or faulty installation, the
city may require the property owner to pay for all or a portion of the expense.
   (D)   Replacement of landscaping, paved or concrete driveways, walkways,
steps or other permanent structure shall be the responsibility and expense of
the property owner.
   (E)   From this date of adoption forward, no service or water shutoff shall
be installed under concrete walks, steps, driveways or other permanent
structures, either existing or contemplated, between the property line and the
building to be supplied. Exceptions may be granted by written approval of the
City Engineer.
   (F)   It shall be the responsibility and expense of the property owner to
maintain the service line from the curb box into the house or building. The
expense shall not include the curb box. In case of failure upon the part of any
property owner to repair any leak or malfunction occurring in the service line
within 24 hours after written notice has been given to the owner or occupant of
the premises, the water will be shut off and will not be turned on until

§ 51.14 WATER TRUNK AVAILABILITY.
   (A)   The City Council has determined that the city has expended substantial
city resources developing a water distribution system including, but not
limited to, the construction of wells, pumps, a municipal water tower and trunk
lines to deliver water. The City Council has further determined that the water
distribution system provides a definite benefit to undeveloped property within
the corporate limits of the city, which undeveloped property has not paid its
fair share of the cost of creating the water distribution system.
   (B)   At the time of the application for a building permit for any
construction which requires a connection to the city’s water distribution
system a water trunk availability charge of an amount as set forth in the
annual fee schedule shall be paid for each equivalent residential unit (“ERU”).
Equivalent residential units shall be assigned by the city consistent with the
assignment table set forth in division (C) below. If a particular use is not
categorized in the table, the city, in its reasonable discretion will make the
ERU assignment. A request for determination should be made by the landowner
prior to the application for the building permit.

§ 51.15 RECYCLED WATER FOR CAR WASHES; ALTERNATIVES.
   (A)   Any structure within the city which was put into service on or after
8-1-2007, for the purpose of washing the exterior of motor vehicles (both hand
wash and mechanical systems) for a fee, or as a service provided to the
operator of the motor vehicle purchasing a good or service, must have in place
a water recycling system that reclaims at least 60% of the water taken from the
city’s water system on a daily basis. In order to facilitate compliance, a
separate meter or submeter acceptable to the city must be installed.
   (B)   Any structure within the city which was put into service on or after
8-1-2007, for the purpose of washing the exterior of motor vehicles (both hand
wash and mechanical systems) for a fee, or as a service provided to the
operator of the motor vehicle purchasing a good or service, may, as an
alternative to the recycling requirements of division (A) above, operate on a
system that uses less than 45 gallons of water per vehicle washed. In order to
proceed under this section, the time of the installation of the car washing
equipment, the owner of the proposed car wash must provide detailed technical
information to the City Administrator/Clerk/Treasurer and the Building Official
demonstrating that less than 45 gallons of water are used per vehicle washed.

consumed therein and the owner of the car wash must, on an annual basis, on or
before February 15 of each year, provide documentation to the city, for the
prior calendar year, of the number of vehicles washed so the city can verify
compliance with the 45 gallons or less per wash standard. The exception within
this section is not available for any mechanical car wash which is hand-
operated by any individual, including, but not limited to, the driver and or
occupants of the vehicle being washed.

(1994 Code, § 7-2.6)
§ 52.04 RATES AND CHARGES.
   (A)   The rates and charges for sewer service are as set out in the annual
fee schedule.
   (B)   (1)   The number of unit determination of property is based on the
future use of the building. In the case of a shell building that will be
occupied by multiple tenants, with the use of each space not known, the number
of initial units is determined and collected based on the speculative use of
the shell building. The number of units shall be an estimate determined by
using the Metropolitan Council’s SAC unit determination. As uses for the
building are defined and/or additional building permits are applied for in
relation to the building, the city shall, based upon the use, determine the
appropriate number of city ERUs to apply and the appropriate charges shall be
paid accordingly.
      (2)   The same one-half unit charges computed on said amounts shall also
apply. Furthermore, any such unit charges shall be in addition to and exclusive
of any other applicable assessments or charges which may be imposed.
   (C)   The City Council reserves the right to impose a supplemental sewage
charge, in addition to any and all other rates and charges stated herein, on

interest, not to exceed 8% per annum on the unpaid balance. All such charges
and interest collected by the county’s Auditor shall be paid over to the City
Treasurer in the same manner as other municipal taxes.
   (E)   Any application for connection permit shall state whether the subject
premises has paid an assessment. If so, the amount so assessed and the legal

lessee or occupant of the benefitted property or against all of them in a civil
action without waiver of other remedies.

certified to the county’s Auditor as taxes against such property to be
collected and paid over to the city along with other taxes. Either or both of
such methods of collection thereof may be pursued by the city until payment in
full has been made, and the initiation of one such method of collection shall
not be deemed to be an election preventing the city from thereafter using the
other method of collection until paid in full.

pertinent requirements of this chapter. Upon completion of the work, a copy of
the permit shall be signed and dated by the licensed individual or firm making
the connection and said copy shall be delivered up to the City Inspector at the
time of the final inspection of the work. The City Inspector shall also sign
said permit to indicate that he or she has performed an inspection and the work

with the approval of the City Council.
      (3)   A certificate of insurance, acceptable to the City Council and
showing coverage of not less than $50,000 per person for injuries, shall be
filed. The insurance certificate shall also include provisions for accidental

the City Engineer, but shall, in general, comply with the following minimum
requirements in addition to conforming with all of the requirements of the
state’s Plumbing Code.
      (1)   All pipe shall be four-inch extra heavy cast iron soil pipe or
four-inch polyvinyl chloride pipe, thick walled sewer pipe, Type W-1. If the
sewer service pipe is less than ten feet from the water service pipe or if the
sewer service pipe is closer than 20 feet from any well, plastic pipe shall not
be allowed. In addition, no plastic pipe shall be used on unstable ground or in
fill materials unless tests provided by the plumber indicate to the
satisfaction of the City Council that the fill is of a density of equal or
greater value than that density required to support the pipe and that the fill
will be displaced at any time in the future.
      (2)   Joints shall be made air-tight using O-ring rubber gaskets or, in
the case of plastic pipe, a solvent-cemented joint.
      (3)   Sewer service shall not contain more than four bends of any size
angle, nor shall it contain any bend or combination of bends totaling more than
45 degrees.
      (4)   Sewer service shall not be installed parallel to any bearing wall
or footing closer than three feet therefrom, nor shall it be installed with any
bend closer than three feet from such wall or footing.
      (5)   Clean-outs shall be provided in any sewer service on instructions
from the City Inspector, but in any case, clean-outs shall be installed at
intervals of 75 feet on long services.
      (6)   Sewer service connections shall not, in any manner, be connected
to, or be a part of, any septic tank or cesspool, and if any service pipe is
installed across any existing septic tank or cesspool, plastic pipe shall not
be allowed for that portion of the service.
      (7)   All existing septic tanks and cesspools shall be obliterated by
first pumping out all organic matter and then filling with granular material to
the level of the surrounding ground.
      (8)   Sewer service connections shall be made only at the location of the
existing stub from the sewer main unless expressly approved by the Council to
make such connection in a different location. In this case, the applicant shall

available. If none is available, the City Council shall determine the solution
to the problem.
   (B)   Where the building to be so serviced stands to the rear of another
building on an interior lot and no sewer service can be provided to the rear
building, the Council may approve the connection of the rear building to the
service of the front building if clean-outs are provided immediately outside of
both of the buildings in the sewer service.
(1994 Code, § 7-2.9)

premises, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be
required to implement, at said person’s expense, additional structural and non-
structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the municipal
separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a
valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of storm water associated with
industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliant with

facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of
materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants
discharging into storm water, the storm drain system or waters of the state,
said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment
and cleanup of such a release. In the event of such a release of hazardous
materials, said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of
the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of
non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the city in person or by
phone or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in person
or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the
city within three business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of
prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment,
the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site

employees and contractors and they may enforce the provisions relating to
nuisances. Any city officer shall have the power to inspect private premises
and take all reasonable precautions to prevent the commission and maintenance
of public nuisances. Except in emergency situations of imminent danger to human
life and safety, no city officer shall enter enclosed buildings for the purpose
of inspecting or preventing public nuisances without the permission of the
owner, resident or other person in control of the property, unless the city
officer has obtained a warrant or order from a court of competent jurisdiction
authorizing the entry. Officers and designated persons will have the authority
to enter curtailage and areas in open sight, in accordance with §
10.20 to inspect and take enforcement action.
(Ord. 107, passed 6-4-2008)
§ 92.19 ABATEMENT.
   (A)   Notice. Written notice of violation; notice of the time, date, place
and subject of any hearing before the City Council; notice of City Council
order; and notice of motion for summary enforcement hearing shall be given as
set forth in this section.
      (1)   Notice of violation. Written notice of violation shall be served by
a peace officer or designated person on the owner of record or occupant of the
premises either in person or by certified or registered mail. If the premises
are not occupied, the owner of record is unknown or the owner of record or
occupant refuses to accept notice of violation, notice of violation shall be
served by posting it on the premises.
      (2)   Notice of City Council hearing. Written notice of any City Council
hearing to determine or abate a nuisance shall be served on the owner of record
and occupant of the premises either in person or by certified or registered
mail. If the premises are not occupied, the owner of record is unknown, or the
owner of record or occupant refuses to accept notice of the City Council
hearing, notice of City Council hearing shall be served by posting it on the
premises.
      (3)   Notice of City Council order. Except for those cases determined by
the city to require summary enforcement, written notice of any City Council
order shall be made as provided in M.S. § 463.17 (Hazardous and Substandard
Building Act), as it may be amended from time to time.
      (4)   Notice of motion for summary enforcement. Written notice of any
motion for summary enforcement shall be made as provided for in M.S. § 463.17
(Hazardous and Substandard Building Act), as it may be amended from time to
time.
   (B)   Procedure.
      (1)   Whenever a city officer determines that a public nuisance is being
maintained or exists on a premises in the city, the officer or person
designated shall notify in writing the owner of record or occupant of the
premises of such fact and order that the nuisance be terminated or abated. The
notice of violation shall specify the steps to be taken to abate the nuisance
and a reasonable time within which the nuisance is to be abated. If the notice
of violation is not complied with within the time specified, the city officer
shall report that fact forthwith to the City Council, or cite the violator, or
take any other appropriate enforcement action. If the city officer issues a
citation or takes other appropriate enforcement action, they shall again
specify the steps to be taken to abate the nuisance and another reasonable time
within which the nuisance is to be abated. If the notice of violation is not
complied with within the time specified, the city officer shall report the fact
forthwith to the City Council.
      (2)   Thereafter, the City Council may, after notice to the owner or
occupant and an opportunity to be heard, determine that the condition
identified in the notice of violation is a nuisance and further order that if
the nuisance is not abated within the time prescribed by the City Council, the
city may seek injunctive relief by serving a copy of the City Council order and
notice of motion for summary enforcement or obtain an administrative search and
seizure warrant and abate the nuisance.
   (C)   Emergency procedure; summary enforcement. In cases of emergency, where
delay in abatement required to complete the notice and procedure requirements
set forth in divisions (A) and (B) above will permit a continuing nuisance to
unreasonably endanger public health safety or welfare, the City Council may
order summary enforcement and abate the nuisance. To proceed with summary
enforcement, the city officer shall determine that a public nuisance exists or
is being maintained on premises in the city and that delay in abatement of the
nuisance will unreasonably endanger public health, safety or welfare. The
officer or designated person shall notify in writing the occupant or owner of
the premises of the nature of the nuisance and of the city’s intention to seek
summary enforcement and the time and place of the City Council meeting to
consider the question of summary enforcement. The City Council shall determine
whether or not the condition identified in the notice to the owner or occupant
is a nuisance, whether public health, safety or welfare will be unreasonably
endangered by delay in abatement required to complete the procedure set forth
in division (A) above and may order that the nuisance be immediately terminated
or abated. If the nuisance is not immediately terminated or abated, the City
Council may order summary enforcement and abate the nuisance.
   (D)   Immediate abatement. Nothing in this section shall prevent the city,
without notice or other process, from immediately abating any condition which
poses an imminent and serious hazard to human life or safety.
(Ord. 107, passed 6-4-2008)
§ 92.20 RECOVERY OF COST.
   (A)   Personal liability. The owner of premises on which a nuisance has been
abated by the city shall be personally liable for the cost to the city of the
abatement, including administrative costs. As soon as the work has been
completed and the cost determined, the City Administrator/Clerk/Treasurer or
other official shall prepare a bill for the cost and mail it to the owner.
Thereupon, the amount shall be immediately due and payable at the office of the
City Administrator/Clerk/Treasurer.
   (B)   Assessment. After notice and hearing as provided in M.S. § 429.061, as
it may be amended from time to time, if the nuisance is a public health or
safety hazard on private property, the accumulation of snow and ice on public
sidewalks, the growth of weeds on private property or outside the traveled
portion of streets, or unsound or insect-infected trees, the City
Administrator/Clerk/Treasurer shall, on or before September 1 next following
abatement of the nuisance, list the total unpaid charges along with all other
charges as well as other charges for current services to be assessed under M.S.
§ 429.101, as it may be amended from time to time, against each separate lot or
parcel to which the charges are attributable. The City Council may then spread
the charges against the property under that statute and other pertinent
statutes for certification to the county’s Auditor and collection along with
current taxes the following year or in annual installments, not exceeding ten,
as the City Council may determine in each case.
(Ord. 107, passed 6-4-2008)
WEEDS AND GRASS
§ 92.35 PROHIBITION.
   Weeds and grass in excess of 12 inches in length on any occupied or
unoccupied lot or parcel of land less than five acres in size in the city is a
public nuisance and is prohibited. On vacant property where it would be
physically difficult to mow because of topography or other physical
constraints, the height limitation on weeds and grass shall only apply to a
ten-foot-wide strip abutting the lot line of the property. Noxious weeds or
plants as identified and defined by the state’s Department of Agriculture in
their current publication are also a public nuisance and are prohibited. Native
grasses and wild flower indigenous to Minnesota, planted and maintained on any
occupied lot or parcel of land as part of a garden or landscape treatment are
exempt from this subchapter.
(Ord. 80, passed 5-4-2005) Penalty, see §
92.99
§ 92.36 CUTTING, REMOVAL OR CHEMICAL TREATMENT.
   The owner, lessee or occupant of any lot or parcel of land shall cut and
remove or chemically treat all such weeds, grass or other rank, poisonous or
harmful vegetation as often as necessary to comply with the provisions of this
section. Cutting, removing or chemically treating (posted by date) such weeds,
grass or other rank, poisonous or harmful vegetation at least once in every
three weeks, between May 15 and October 15 in a given year, is deemed to be in
compliance with this subchapter.
(Ord. 80, passed 5-4-2005; Ord. 80A, passed 7-6-2011) Penalty, see §
92.99
§ 92.37 VIOLATION.
   After giving the owner or occupant of a lot not in compliance with the
previous sections seven days’ advance written notice of the non-compliance, the
city may cut, or cause to be cut, the grass, weeds or plants and may assess the
cost against the property in accordance with M.S. § 429.101, as it may be
amended from time to time.
(Ord. 80, passed 5-4-2005)
§ 92.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person violating any provision of this chapter for which no
specific penalty is prescribed shall be subject to §
10.99 of this code of ordinances.
   (B)   Any person who shall violate any of the provisions of §§
92.15 through
92.20 of this chapter, or shall fail to comply with an order made thereunder,
shall separately for each and every violation and non-compliance respectively
be guilty of a misdemeanor. The imposition of one penalty for any violation
shall not excuse the violation or permit it to continue; and, all such persons
shall be required to correct or remedy such violation or defects within
reasonable time. When not otherwise specified, each day the prohibited
conditions are maintained shall constitute a separate offense.
   (C)   The violation of any provision of §§
92.35 through
92.37 of this chapter is a misdemeanor and the violator shall be fined or
penalized not more than the maximum levels established by the state for
misdemeanor offenses.

   (A)   Timing. The work to be done under the excavation permit, and the
patching and restoration of the right-of-way as required herein, must be
completed within the dates specified in the permit, increased by as many days
as work could not be done because of circumstances beyond the control of the
permittee or when work was prohibited as unseasonal or unreasonable.
   (B)   Patch and restoration. Permittee shall patch its own work. The city
may choose either to have the permittee restore the right-of-way or to restore
the right-of-way itself.
      (1)   City restoration. If the city restores the right-of-way, permittee
shall pay the costs thereof within 30 days of billing. If, following such
restoration, the pavement settles due to permittee’s improper backfilling, the
permittee shall pay to the city, within 30 days of billing, all costs
associated with correcting the defective work.

restoration, a right-of-way user may elect to pay a degradation fee. However,
the right-of-way user shall remain responsible for patching and the degradation
fee shall not include the cost to accomplish these responsibilities.
   (C)   Standards. The permittee shall perform excavation, backfilling,
patching and restoration according to the standards and with the materials
specified by the city and shall comply with Minn. Rules 7819.1100, as it may be

patching or restoration performed by permittee or its agents. The permittee
upon notification from the city, shall correct all restoration work to the
extent necessary, using the method required by the city. Said work shall be
completed within five calendar days of the receipt of the notice from the city,
not including days during which work cannot be done because of circumstances
constituting force majeure or days when work is prohibited as unseasonable or
unreasonable.
   (E)   Failure to restore. If the permittee fails to restore the right-of-way
in the manner and to the condition required by the city, or fails to
satisfactorily and timely complete all restoration required by the city, the
city at its option may do such work. In that event the permittee shall pay to
the city, within 30 days of billing, the cost of restoring the right-of-way. If
permittee fails to pay as required, the city may exercise its rights under the
construction performance bond.
§ 93.08 SUPPLEMENTARY APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   Limitation on area. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the area
of the right-of-way specified in the permit. No permittee may do any work
outside the area specified in the permit, except as provided in this chapter.

area:
      (1)   Make application for a permit extension and pay any additional fees
required thereby; and
      (2)   Be granted a new permit or permit extension.
   (B)   Limitation on dates. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the dates
specified in the permit. No permittee may begin its work before the permit
start date or, except as provided in this chapter, continue working after the
end date. If a permittee does not finish the work by the permit end date, it
must apply for a new permit for the additional time it needs, and receive the
new permit or an extension of the old permit before working after the end date
of the previous permit. This supplementary application must be submitted before
the permit end date.
§ 93.09 DENIAL OF PERMIT.
   The city may deny a permit for failure to meet the requirements and
conditions of this chapter or if the city determines that the denial is
necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare or when necessary to
protect the right-of-way and its current use.

or well-being of the public.
      (2)   The Director may issue an order to the permittee for any work that
does not conform to the terms of the permit or other applicable standards,
conditions or codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the
violation will be cause for revocation of the permit. Within ten days after

within the required time, the Director may revoke the permit pursuant to §
93.22.
§ 93.12 WORK DONE WITHOUT A PERMIT.
   (A)   Emergency situations.
      (1)   Each registrant shall immediately notify the Director of any event
regarding its facilities that it considers to be an emergency. The owner of the
facilities may proceed to take whatever actions are necessary to respond to the
emergency. Excavators’ notification to Gopher State One Call regarding an
emergency situation does not fulfill this requirement. Within two business days
after the occurrence of the emergency, the owner shall apply for the necessary
permits, pay the fees associated therewith, and fulfill the rest of the
requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with this chapter for
the actions it took in response to the emergency.
      (2)   If the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding facilities, the
city will attempt to contact the local representative of each facility owner
affected, or potentially affected, by the emergency. In any event, the city may
take whatever action it deems necessary to respond to the emergency, the cost
of which shall be borne by the person whose facilities occasioned the
emergency.
   (B)   Non-emergency situations. Except in an emergency, any person who,
without first having obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or excavates a
right-of-way must subsequently obtain a permit and, as a penalty, pay double
the normal fee for said permit, pay double all the other fees required by the
city code, deposit with the city the fees necessary to correct any damage to
the right-of-way, and comply with all of the requirements of this chapter.
§ 93.13 SUPPLEMENTARY NOTIFICATION.
   If the obstruction or excavation of the right-of-way begins later or ends
sooner than the date given on the permit, permittee shall notify the city of
the accurate information as soon as this information is known.
§ 93.14 REVOCATION OF PERMITS.
   (A)   Substantial breach. The city reserves its right, as provided in this
chapter, to revoke any right-of-way permit without a fee refund, if there is a
substantial breach of the terms and conditions of any statute, ordinance, rule
or regulation, or any material condition of the permit. A substantial breach by
permittee shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following:
      (1)   The violation of any material provision of the right-of-way permit;
      (2)   An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the right-
of-way permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit
upon the city or its citizens;
      (3)   Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a
right-of-way permit;
      (4)   The failure to complete the work in a timely manner, unless a
permit extension is obtained or unless the failure to complete work is due to
reasons beyond the permittee’s control; or
      (5)   The failure to correct, in a timely manner, work that does not
conform to a condition indicated on an order issued pursuant to §
93.11.
   (B)   Written notice of breach. If the city determines that the permittee
has committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any statute,
ordinance, rule, regulation or any condition of the permit, the city shall make
a written demand upon the permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall
state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. A
substantial breach, as stated above, will allow the city, at its discretion, to
place additional or revised conditions on the permit to mitigate and remedy the
breach.
   (C)   Response to notice of breach. Within 24 hours of receiving
notification of the breach, permittee shall provide the city with a plan,
acceptable to the city, which will cure the breach. Permittee’s failure to so
contact the city, or permittee’s failure to timely submit an acceptable plan,
or permittee’s failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be
cause for immediate revocation of the permit. Further, permittee’s failure to
so contact the city, or permittee’s failure to submit an acceptable plan, or
permittee’s failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall
automatically place the permittee on probation for one full year.
   (D)   Cause for probation. From time to time, the city may establish a list
of conditions of the permit, which if breached will automatically place the
permittee on probation for one full year, such as, but not limited to, working
out of the allotted time period or working on right-of-way grossly outside of
the permit authorization.
   (E)   Automatic revocation. If a permittee, while on probation, commits a
breach as outlined in this chapter, permittee’s permit will automatically be
revoked and permittee will not be allowed further permits for one full year,
except for emergency repairs.
   (F)   Reimbursement of city costs. If a permit is revoked, the permittee
shall also reimburse the city for the city’s reasonable costs, including
restoration costs and the costs of collection and reasonable attorneys’ fees
incurred in connection with such revocation.
§ 93.15 MAPPING DATA.
   (A)   Information required. Each registrant and permittee shall provide
mapping information required by the city in accordance with Minn. Rules
7819.4000 and 7819.4100, as they may be amended from time to time. Within 90
days following completion of any work pursuant to a permit, the permittee shall
provide the Director accurate maps and drawings certifying the “as-built”
location of all equipment installed, owed and maintained by the permittee. Such
maps and drawings shall include the horizontal and vertical location of all
facilities and equipment and shall be provided consistent with the city’s
electronic mapping system, when practical or as a condition imposed by the
director Failure to provide maps and drawings pursuant to this subsection shall
be grounds for revoking the permit holder’s registration.
   (B)   Service laterals. All permits issued for the installation or repair of
service laterals, other than minor repairs as defined in Minn. Rules 7560.0150,
Subpart 2, as it may be amended from time to time, shall require the
permittee’s use of appropriate means of establishing the horizontal locations
of installed service laterals and the service lateral vertical locations in
those cases where the Director reasonably requires it. Permittees or their
subcontractors shall submit to the Director evidence satisfactory to the
Director of the installed service lateral locations. Compliance with this
division (B) and with applicable Gopher State One Call law and Minnesota Rules
governing service laterals installed after December 31, 2005 shall be a
condition of any city approval necessary for:
      (1)   Payments to contractors working on a public improvement project
including those under M.S. Ch. 429, as it may be amended from time to time; and
      (2)   City approval under development agreements or other subdivision or
site plan approval under M.S. Ch. 462, as it may be amended from time to time.
The city shall reasonably determine the appropriate method of providing such
information. Failure to provide prompt and accurate information on the service
laterals installed may result in the revocation of the permit issued for the
work or future permits to the offending permittee or its subcontractors.
§ 93.16 LOCATION FACILITIES.
   (A)   Placement, location and relocation of facilities must comply with the
Act, with other applicable law, and with Minn. Rules 7819.3100, 7819.5000 and
7819.5100, as they may be amended from time to time, to the extent the rules do
not limit authority otherwise available to cities.
   (B)   Corridors.
      (1)   The city may assign a specific area within the right-of-way, or any
particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of facilities
that is or, pursuant to current technology, the city expects will someday be
located within the right-of-way. All excavation, obstruction, or other permits
issued by the city involving the installation or replacement of facilities
shall designate the proper corridor for the facilities at issue.
      (2)   Any registrant who has facilities in the right-of-way in a position
at variance with the corridors established by the city shall, no later than at
the time of the next reconstruction or excavation of the area where the
facilities are located, move the facilities to the assigned position within the
right-of-way, unless this requirement is waived by the city for good cause
shown, upon consideration of such factors as the remaining economic life of the
facilities, public safety, customer service needs and hardship to the
registrant.
   (C)   Nuisance. One year after the passage of this chapter, any facilities
found in a right-of-way that have not been registered shall be deemed to be a
nuisance. The city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in
equity, including, but not limited to, abating the nuisance or taking
possession of the facilities and restoring the right-of-way to a useable
condition.
   (D)   Limitation of space. To protect health, safety and welfare, or when
necessary to protect the right-of-way and its current use, the city shall have
the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional facilities
within the right-of-way. In making such decisions, the city shall strive to the
extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the right-
of-way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the public interest,
the public’s needs for the particular utility service, the condition of the
right-of-way, the time of year with respect to essential utilities, the
protection of existing facilities in the right-of-way, and future city plans
for public improvements and development projects which have been determined to
be in the public interest.

may be amended from time to time, (“One Call Excavation Notice System”) before
the start date of any right-of-way excavation, each registrant who has
facilities or equipment in the area to be excavated shall mark the horizontal
and vertical placement of all said facilities. Any registrant whose facilities
are less than 20 inches below a concrete or asphalt surface shall notify and
work closely with the excavation contractor to establish the exact location of
its facilities and the best procedure for excavation.
§ 93.18 DAMAGE TO OTHER FACILITIES.
   When the city does work in the right-of-way and finds it necessary to
maintain, support or move a registrant’s facilities to protect it, the city
shall notify the local representative as early as is reasonably possible. The
costs associated therewith will be billed to the facility owner and must be
paid within 30 days from the date of billing. Each facility owner shall be
responsible for the cost of repairing any facilities in the right-of-way which
it or its facilities damage. Each facility owner shall be responsible for the
cost of repairing any damage to the facilities of another registrant caused
during the city’s response to an emergency occasioned by that registrant’s
facilities.
§ 93.19 RIGHT-OF-WAY VACATION.
   If the city vacates a right-of-way that contains facilities, the facility
owner’s rights in the vacated right-of-way are governed by Minn. Rules
7819.3200, as it may be amended from time to time.
§ 93.20 INDEMNIFICATION AND LIABILITY.
   By applying for and accepting a permit under this chapter, a permittee
agrees to defend and indemnify the city in accordance with the provisions of
Minn. Rules 7819.1250, as it may be amended from time to time.
§ 93.21 ABANDONED AND UNUSABLE FACILITIES.
   (A)   Discontinued operations. A registrant who has determined to
discontinue all or a portion of its operations in the city must provide
information satisfactory to the city that the registrant’s obligations for its
facilities in the right-of-way under this chapter have been lawfully assumed by
another registrant.
   (B)   Removal. Any person who has abandoned facilities in any right-of-way
shall remove them from that right-of-way if required in conjunction with other
right-of-way repair, excavation, or construction, unless this requirement is
waived by the city.
§ 93.22 APPEAL.
   A right-of-way user that has been denied registration; has been denied a
permit; has had a permit revoked; believes that the fees imposed are not in
conformity with M.S. § 237.163, Subd. 6, as it may be amended from time to
time; or disputes a determination of the city regarding §
93.11 may have the denial, revocation, fee imposition, or decision reviewed,
upon written request, by the City Council. The City Council shall act on a
timely written request at its next regularly scheduled meeting. A decision by
the City Council affirming the denial, revocation, or fee imposition will be in
writing and supported by written findings establishing the reasonableness of
the decision.

REGISTRATION AND LICENSING
§ 151.01 PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this subchapter to assure that rental housing in the
city is decent, safe and sanitary and is so operated and maintained as not to
become a nuisance to the neighborhood or to become an influence that fosters
blight and deterioration or creates a disincentive to reinvestment in the
community. The operation of rental dwelling units is a business enterprise that
entails certain responsibilities. Operators are responsible to take such
reasonable steps as are necessary to assure that the citizens of the city who
occupy such units may pursue the quiet enjoyment of the normal activities of
life in surroundings that are safe, secure and sanitary and free from crimes
and criminal activity, nuisances or annoyances.

   (A)   General.
      (1)   License action. The City Council may revoke, suspend, deny or
decline to renew any license issued under this subchapter. In buildings
containing more than one rental dwelling unit, the revocation, suspension,
denial or declination may apply to one or more rental dwelling units at the
discretion of the City Council. The basis for such revocation, suspension,
denial or non-renewal includes any of the following circumstances:
         (a)   The license was procured by misrepresentation of material facts
with regard to the rental dwelling unit or the ownership of the rental dwelling
unit;
         (b)   The owner, applicant or one acting in his or her behalf made
oral or written misstatements accompanying the license application;
         (c)   The owner, applicant or one acting in his, her or its behalf has
failed to comply with any condition set forth in any other permits granted by
the city for the premises or a rental dwelling unit on the premises;
         (d)   The activities of the owner/applicant create or have created a
danger to the public health, safety or welfare for the premises or a rental
dwelling unit on the premises;
         (e)   The rental dwelling unit contains conditions that might injure
or endanger the safety, health or welfare of any member of the public;
         (f)   Failure to pay any application, penalty or reinstatement fee
required by this section and City Council resolution;

the applicant for the approval or maintenance of the license; and/or
         (j)   Any violation of this section.
      (2)   Notification. The Code Official shall notify the owner or the
owner’s agent in writing of the basis for the revocation, suspension, denial or
non-renewal and the date upon which the City Council shall review the request
to revoke, suspend or deny the license or if the basis for a non-renewal of the
license is for a reason other than the physical condition of the rental
dwelling unit or the premises. The notice required by this section shall be
served upon the owner or the owner’s agent at least 20 days before the City
Council hearing. Service shall be deemed sufficient if the notice is sent to
the owner or the owner’s agent by first class mail at the address provided in
the license application. It shall be the responsibility of the owner or the
owner’s agent to notify the tenant in writing of the hearing date, time and
place.
      (3)   Hearing. The owner or the owner’s agent and the Code Official shall
be given an opportunity to be heard. The owner may be represented by counsel.
Both sides may be permitted to examine the other side’s witness(es). The City
Council shall hear all relevant evidence and arguments and shall review all
testimony, documents and other evidence submitted. The City Council shall
record the hearing and keep a record of documentary evidence submitted. No
notice or hearing is required for non-renewal of a license where the rental
dwelling unit(s) or the premises have not passed the inspection by the Code
Official.
      (4)   Decision. The City Council shall make findings based on the
evidence and shall make a decision on the recommendation to revoke, suspend,
deny or non-renew (solely for issues not related to physical condition of the
rental dwelling unit or the premises) a license based on the findings. The City
Council shall issue a written decision regarding the recommendation of the Code
Official within 30 days following the date of the hearing and shall notify the
appellant of the decision by first class mail with a duplicate copy to the Code
Official. The decision shall specify the rental dwelling unit or the premises
to which it applies. Thereafter, and until a license is reissued or reinstated,
no rental dwelling unit that has had its rental license revoked, suspended,
denied or non-renewed may be re-let or occupied. Revocation, suspension, denial
or non-renewal of a license shall not excuse the owner from compliance with all
terms of this section for as long as any rental dwelling units in the building
are occupied.
      (5)   License process after revocation, suspension, denial or renewal
declination. After the City Council revokes, suspends, denies or declines to
renew a license, no license will be issued for the affected rental dwelling
unit(s) until the Code Official determines that the applicant/licensee has
remedied the conditions identified by the City Council as the basis for its
action. A license application to obtain a license for a rental dwelling unit
after the City Council has revoked, suspended, denied or declined to renew a
license for the same rental dwelling unit(s) must be accompanied by all fees
required by this subchapter.
   (B)   Effect of revocation, suspension, denial or non-renewal. If a license
is revoked, suspended, denied or not renewed by the City Council, it shall be
unlawful for the owner or the owner’s agent to thereafter permit the occupancy
of the then vacant, or thereafter vacated, rental dwelling unit(s) until such
time as a valid rental license is obtained for the rental dwelling unit(s).
Issuance of a new license after revocation, suspension, denial or non-renewal
shall be made in the manner provided for in §
151.05(A) of this chapter.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 154.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The legislature of the state has, in M.S. Chs. 103F and 462, as they may be
amended from time to time, delegated the responsibility to local government
units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses.
(Ord. 77A, passed 10-5-2016)
§ 154.02 PURPOSE.
   (A)   This chapter regulates development in the flood hazard areas of the
city. These flood hazard areas are subject to periodic inundation, which may
result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of
commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood
protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base. It is the purpose of
this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare by
minimizing these losses and disruptions.
   (B)   This chapter is adopted to comply with the rules and regulations of
the National Flood Insurance Program codified as 44 C.F.R. parts 59 - 78, as
amended, so as to maintain the community’s eligibility in the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (C)   This chapter is also intended to preserve the natural characteristics
and functions of watercourses and floodplains in order to moderate flood and
stormwater impacts, improve water quality, reduce soil erosion, protect aquatic
and riparian habitat, provide recreational opportunities, provide aesthetic
benefits and enhance community and economic development.
(Ord. 77A, passed 10-5-2016)
§ 154.03 LANDS TO WHICH CHAPTER APPLIES.
   This chapter applies to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city shown
on the flood insurance rate maps adopted in §
154.04 as being located within the boundaries of the Floodplain District. The
Floodplain District is an overlay district that is superimposed on all existing
zoning districts. The standards imposed in the overlay districts are in
addition to any other requirements in this chapter. In case of a conflict, the
more restrictive standards will apply.
(Ord. 77A, passed 10-5-2016)
§ 154.04 ADOPTION OF FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY AND MAPS.
   The flood insurance study for the county and incorporated areas, and flood
insurance rate maps for the county and incorporated areas, with map numbers
27053C0270F and 27053C0290F; all of these documents being dated November 4,2016
and prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, are hereby adopted by
reference and declared to be a part of this chapter and the official zoning
map. These materials are on file in the city office.
(Ord. 77A, passed 10-5-2016)
§ 154.05 INTERPRETATION.
   The boundaries of the Floodplain District are determined by scaling
distances on the flood insurance rate map.
   (A)   Where a conflict exists between the floodplain limits illustrated on
the official zoning map and actual field conditions, the flood elevations must
be the governing factor. The Zoning Administrator must interpret the boundary
location based on the ground elevations that existed on the site on the date of
the first national flood insurance program map showing the area within the
regulatory floodplain and other available technical data.
   (B)   Persons contesting the location of the district boundaries will be
given a reasonable opportunity to present their case to the City Council and to
submit technical evidence.
(Ord. 77A, passed 10-5-2016)
§ 154.06 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   It is not intended by this chapter to repeal, abrogate or impair any
existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter
imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter prevail. All other
ordinances inconsistent with this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of
the inconsistency only.
(Ord. 77A, passed 10-5-2016)
§ 154.07 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   This chapter does not imply that areas outside the floodplain districts or
land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or flood
damages. This chapter does not create liability on the part of the city or any
officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on
this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.
(Ord. 77A, passed 10-5-2016)
§ 154.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any section, clause, provision or portion of this chapter is adjudged
unconstitutional or invalid by a court of law, the remainder of this chapter
shall not be affected and shall remain in full force.
(Ord. 77A, passed 10-5-2016)
§ 154.09 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION. The elevation of the REGIONAL FLOOD. The term BASE
FLOOD ELEVATION is used in the flood insurance survey.
   DEVELOPMENT. Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate
including, but not limited to, buildings, manufactured homes and other
structures, recreational vehicles, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving,
excavation, drilling operations, or storage of materials or equipment.
   FARM FENCE. A fence as defined by M.S. § 344.02, Subd. 1(a)-(d), as they may
be amended from time to time. An open type fence of posts and wire is not
considered to be a structure under this chapter. Fences that have the potential
to obstruct flood flows, such as chain link fences and rigid walls, are not
permitted in the Floodplain District.
   FLOOD FRINGE. The portion of the floodplain located outside of the floodway.
FLOOD FRINGE is synonymous with the term “floodway fringe” used in the flood
insurance study for the county and incorporated areas.
   FLOODPLAIN. The areas adjoining a watercourse which have been or hereafter
may be covered by the regional flood.
   FLOODWAY. The bed of a wetland or lake and the channel of a watercourse and
those portions of the adjoining floodplain which are reasonably required to
carry or store the regional flood discharge.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include the term RECREATIONAL VEHICLE.
   OBSTRUCTION. Any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment,
projection, excavation, channel modification, culvert, building, wire, fence
(with the exception of farm fences), stockpile, refuse, fill, structure, or
matter in, along, across, or projecting into any channel, watercourse, or
regulatory floodplain which may impede, retard, or change the direction of the
flow of water, either in itself or by catching or collecting debris carried by
such water.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle that is built on a single chassis, is 400
square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, is
designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and
is designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary
living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use. For the
purposes of this chapter, the term RECREATIONAL VEHICLE is synonymous with the
term “travel trailer/travel vehicle.”
   REGIONAL FLOOD. A flood which is representative of large floods known to
have occurred generally in the state and reasonably characteristic of what can
be expected to occur on an average frequency in the magnitude of the 1% chance/
100-year recurrence interval. REGIONAL FLOOD is synonymous with the term “base
flood” used in the flood insurance study.
   REGULATORY FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION. An elevation no lower than one foot
above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation
caused by encroachments on the floodplain that result from designation of a
floodway.
   STRUCTURE. Anything constructed or erected on the ground or attached to the
ground, including, but not limited to, buildings, factories, sheds, detached
garages, cabins, manufactured homes and other similar items.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure where the
cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or
exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Within any consecutive 365-day period, any
reconstruction, rehabilitation (including normal maintenance and repair),
repair after damage, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of
which equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the
“start of construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures that
have incurred SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE, regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include either:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a “historic structure” provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
“historic structure.” For the purpose of this chapter, “historic structure” is
as defined in 44 C.F.R. part 59.1.
(Ord. 77A, passed 10-5-2016)
§ 154.10 ANNEXATIONS.
   The flood insurance rate map panels adopted by reference into §
154.04 may include floodplain areas that lie outside of the corporate
boundaries of the city at the time of adoption of this chapter. If any of these
floodplain areas are annexed into the city after the date of adoption of this
chapter, the newly annexed floodplain lands will be subject to the provisions
of this chapter immediately upon the date of annexation.
(Ord. 77A, passed 10-5-2016)
§ 154.11 NONCONFORMITIES.
   (A)   Continuance of nonconformities. A use, structure or occupancy of land
which was lawful before the passage or amendment of this chapter but which is
not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter may be continued subject
to the following conditions. Historic structures, as defined in §
154.09, are subject to the provisions of (A)(1) through (4) of this section.
      (1)   A nonconforming use, structure, or occupancy must not be expanded,
changed, enlarged, or altered in a way that increases its nonconformity. There
shall be no expansion to the outside dimensions of any portion of a
nonconforming structure located within the Floodplain District.
      (2)   The cost of all structural alterations or additions to any
nonconforming structure over the life of the structure may not exceed 50% of
the market value of the structure unless the conditions of this section are
satisfied. The cost of all structural alterations and additions must include
all costs such as construction materials and a reasonable cost placed on all
manpower or labor. If the cost of all previous and proposed alterations and
additions exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure, then the structure
must meet the standards of division (B) of this section.
      (3)   If any nonconforming use, or any use of a nonconforming structure,
is discontinued for more than one year, any future use of the premises must
conform to this chapter. The assessor must notify the Zoning Administrator in
writing of instances of nonconformities that have been discontinued for a
period of more than one year.
      (4)   If any nonconformity is substantially damaged, as defined in §
154.09, it may not be reconstructed unless it is located in the flood fringe
portion of the floodplain and it is reconstructed in accordance with the
standards of division (B) of this section.
      (5)   Any substantial improvement, as defined in §
154.09, to a nonconforming structure, then the existing nonconforming structure
must be located in the flood fringe portion of the floodplain and meet the
requirements of division (B) of this section.
   (B)   Standards for reconstruction of nonconforming structures. The
following standards and procedures apply to nonconforming structures in the
flood fringe portion of the floodplain, as allowed under division (A) of this
section.
      (1)   All structures, including manufactured homes, must be elevated on
fill so that the lowest floor including basement floor is at or above the
regulatory flood protection elevation. The finished fill elevation for
structures shall be no lower than one foot below the regulatory flood
protection elevation and the fill shall extend at such elevation at least 15
feet beyond the outside limits of the structure.
      (2)   Fill must be properly compacted and the slopes must be properly
protected by the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable method.
      (3)   Floodplain developments must not adversely affect the hydraulic
capacity of the channel and adjoining floodplain of any tributary watercourse
or drainage system.
      (4)   All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system that resists flotation, collapse and lateral
movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of
over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition
to applicable state or local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
      (5)   On-site sewage treatment and water supply systems: Where public
utilities are not provided: on-site water supply systems must be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems; and new or
replacement on-site sewage treatment systems must be designed to minimize or
eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the
systems into flood waters and they shall not be subject to impairment or
contamination during times of flooding. Any sewage treatment system designed in
accordance with the state’s current statewide standards for on-site sewage
treatment systems shall be determined to be in compliance with this section.
      (6)   The applicant is required to submit certification by a registered
professional engineer, registered architect or registered land surveyor that
the finished fill and building elevations were accomplished in compliance with
the provisions of this chapter. Floodproofing measures must be certified by a
registered professional engineer or registered architect.
      (7)   The Zoning Administrator must maintain a record of the elevation of
the lowest floor (including basement) of all new structures and alterations to
existing structures in the floodplain. The Zoning Administrator must also
maintain a record of the elevation to which structures and alterations or
additions to structures are floodproofed.
(Ord. 77A, passed 10-5-2016) Penalty, see §
154.99
§ 154.12 AMENDMENTS.
   (A)   Floodplain designation; restrictions on removal. The floodplain
designation on the official zoning map shall not be removed from floodplain
areas unless it can be shown that the designation is in error or that the area
has been filled to or above the elevation of the regulatory flood protection
elevation and is contiguous to lands outside the floodplain. Special exceptions
to this rule may be permitted by the Commissioner of the Department of Natural
Resources if the Commissioner determines that, through other measures, lands
are adequately protected for the intended use.
   (B)   Amendments require DNR and FEMA approval. All amendments to this
chapter must be submitted to and approved by the Commissioner of the Department
of Natural Resources (DNR) prior to adoption. The Commissioner of the DNR must
approve the amendment prior to community approval.
   (C)   Map amendments require ordinance amendments. The floodplain district
regulations must be amended to incorporate any revisions by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency to the floodplain maps adopted in §
154.04.
(Ord. 77A, passed 10-5-2016)
FLOODPLAIN DISTRICT
§ 154.25 ESTABLISHMENT.
   (A)   Areas included. The Floodplain District for the city includes those

permit a lower degree of flood protection than the regulatory flood protection
elevation for the particular area or permit standards lower than those required
by state law.
   (C)   The following additional variance criteria of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency must be met:
      (1)   Variances must not be issued by a community within any designated
regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood
discharge would result;
      (2)   Variances may only be issued by a community upon a showing of good
and sufficient cause; a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and a determination that the
granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional
threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws
or ordinances; and
      (3)   Variances may only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   (D)   The City Council must submit hearing notices for proposed variances to
the Department of Natural Resources sufficiently in advance to provide at least
ten days’ notice of the hearing. The notice may be sent by electronic mail or
U.S. mail to the respective DNR area hydrologist.
   (E)   A copy of all decisions granting variances must be forwarded to the
Commissioner of the Department of Natural Resources within ten days of such
action. The notice may be sent by electronic mail or U.S. mail to the
respective DNR area hydrologist.
   (F)   The Zoning Administrator must notify the applicant for a variance that
the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level
will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as
high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and such construction below the
base or regional flood level increases risks to fife and property.
   (G)   The Zoning Administrator must maintain a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance, and must report such
variances in an annual or biennial report to the Administrator of the National
Flood Insurance Program, when requested by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency.
(Ord. 77A, passed 10-5-2016)
§ 154.44 NOTIFICATIONS FOR WATERCOURSE ALTERATIONS.
   Before authorizing any alteration or relocation of a river or stream, the
Zoning Administrator must notify adjacent communities. If the applicant has
applied for a permit to work in public waters pursuant to M.S. § 103G.245, as
it may be amended from time to time, this will suffice as adequate notice. A
copy of the notification must also be submitted to the Chicago Regional Office
of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
(Ord. 77A, passed 10-5-2016)
§ 154.45 NOTIFICATION TO FEMA WHEN PHYSICAL CHANGES INCREASE OR DECREASE BASE
FLOOD ELEVATIONS.
   As soon as is practicable, but not later than six months after the date such
supporting information becomes available, the Zoning Administrator must notify
the Chicago Regional Office of FEMA of the changes by submitting a copy of the
relevant technical or scientific data.
(Ord. 77A, passed 10-5-2016)
§ 154.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Violation constitutes a misdemeanor. Violation of the provisions of
this chapter or failure to comply with any of its requirements (including
violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants
of variances) constitutes a misdemeanor and is punishable as defined by law.
   (B)   Other lawful action. Nothing in this chapter restricts the city from
taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any
violation. If the responsible party does not appropriately respond to the
Zoning Administrator within the specified period of time, each additional day
that lapses will constitute an additional violation of this chapter and will be
prosecuted accordingly.
   (C)   Enforcement. In responding to a suspected ordinance violation, the
Zoning Administrator and City Council may utilize the full array of enforcement
actions available to it including but not limited to prosecution and fines,
injunctions, after-the-fact permits, orders for corrective measures or a
request to the National Flood Insurance Program for denial of flood insurance
availability to the guilty party. The city must act in good faith to enforce
these official controls and to correct ordinance violations to the extent
possible so as not to jeopardize its eligibility in the National Flood
Insurance Program.

§ 155.06 ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Permit required. Except as herein exempted, no person, firm or
corporation shall maintain, install, erect, relocate or modify any sign in the
city without first obtaining a permit from the city. If a permit is not
obtained prior to installation of a permanent sign, the resulting permit fee
shall be two times the cost of a sign permit as stated in the fee schedule.
   (B)   Application and fee. Applications for sign permits shall be made in
writing to the City Administrator/Clerk/Treasurer upon printed forms furnished
by the city. Each application for a permit shall set forth the correct legal
description of the tract of land upon which the sign presently exists or is
proposed to be located, the location of the sign on said tract of land, the
manner of construction and materials to be used in the sign, a complete
description and sketch of the sign, and such information as the city deems
necessary. At the time of application, the applicant shall pay a fee as set
forth in the schedule of fees. Upon receipt of the application and the fee
payment, the permit application shall be placed on the Park/Planning Commission
agenda for its review. Following review and recommendation by the Park/Planning
Commission, the application shall be forwarded to the City Council for final
action and issuance of the permit if approved, if a sign authorized by permit
has not been installed within 90 days from date of issuance, said permit shall
become void. No fee shall be refunded.
   (C)   Maintenance. All signs shall be constructed in such a manner and of
such materials as to be safe and substantial. The exposed backs of all signs
and sign structures shall be painted in a neutral color. Signs determined by
the city to be in a state of disrepair shall be restored to a good repair by
the sign owner, or property owner on which the sign is situated, within 30 days
after the mailing of written notice of repair from the City Administrator/
Clerk/Treasurer. In the event of non-compliance with said notice, the city
shall be authorized to remove said sign at the expense of the sign or property
owner. The City Administrator/Clerk/Treasurer or other designated city
representative may enter at reasonable times, in accordance with §
10.20 any land in the city to inspect or re-inspect any sign.
   (D)   Removal of outdated sign. Any sign now or hereafter existing which no
longer advertises or identifies a bona fide open and operating business
conducted, service rendered or product sold shall be taken down and removed by
the owner, agent or person having beneficial use and/or control of the
buildings, structure or land upon which the sign may be found. Such sign shall
be taken down and removed within 30 days of the discontinuance of the
applicable business, service or product, or within ten days of written notice
at the city, whichever is less. Upon receipt of a notice from the city, the
owner, agent or person having the beneficial use and/or control of the sign may
take appropriate actions to paint over or otherwise render the sign blank and,
concurrently, apply to the city for authorization to leave the blank sign
erected for a defined period of time to be approved by the city so such sign
may be used or otherwise completed for the next bona fide business conducted,
service rendered or product sold in conjunction with the location of the sign.
Such approval shall rest in the sound discretion of the City Council. In the
event of non-compliance, the city shall be authorized to remove such sign at
the expense of the sign or property owner.
   (E)   Removal of sign that endangers public safety. The city shall cause to
be removed any sign that endangers the public safety, such as abandoned,
dangerous or materially, electrically or structurally defective signs, or a
sign for which no permit has been issued. The City Administrator/Clerk/
Treasurer shall prepare a notice that shall describe the sign and specify the
violation involved and shall state that if the sign is not removed or the
violation corrected within seven days, the sign shall be removed at the expense
of the sign or property owner. If the invoice is not timely paid, the city may
certify the amount so billed to the property taxes for the property from which
the sign was removed in the manner of an assessment in accordance with
applicable city codes and state statutes.
   (F)   Exemption. No permit shall be required for the following signs;
provided that, all signs herein exempted from the permit requirements shall

      (7)   Directional signs.
   (G)   Non-conforming signs. Any sign legally existing on the effective date
of this chapter that does not conform to the requirements set forth in this
chapter shall become a non-conforming use. Non- conforming, permanent signs
shall be allowed to continue, but shall not be rebuilt, replaced, materially
altered or relocated without being brought into compliance with the
requirements of this chapter.

DESIGN STANDARDS AND IMPROVEMENTS
§ 156.35 GENERAL.
   The following design standards shall apply to all subdivisions submitted
under this chapter.
(1994 Code, § 13-1.7) (Ord. passed 12-17-2014)
§ 156.36 STREETS.
   (A)   The arrangement, character, width and location of all streets shall
conform to the existing comprehensive/master plan or street layout plan and
shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets,
topographic conditions, public convenience and safety, and to their appropriate
relationship to the proposed use of the land to be served by such streets.
   (B)   Where streets are not shown on a master plan, the arrangement in the
subdivision shall either:
      (1)   Provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of existing
principal streets and surrounding areas; or
      (2)   Conform to a plan for the neighborhood approved or adopted by the
Council to meet a particular situation where topographic or other conditions
make continuance of or conformance to existing streets impractical.
   (C)   Minor streets shall be so arranged that their use by through traffic
will be discouraged.
   (D)   Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial
street, the Council may require marginal access streets, reverse frontage with
screen planting contained in a non-access reservation along the rear property
line, or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of
residential property and to afford separation of through and local traffic. The
subdivider shall only be required to pay for his or her appropriate share of
the cost of an arterial street as determined by the assessment policies of the
city.
   (E)   Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way or
limited access highway right-of-way, the Council may require a street
approximately parallel to and on each side of such right- of-way at a distance
suitable for the appropriate use of intervening land, as for park purposes and
residential districts. Such distances shall also be determined with due regard
for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separations.
   (F)   Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be prohibited,
except where the control is placed under city jurisdiction under conditions
approved by the Council.
   (G)   Jogs in streets with centerline offsets of less than 150 feet shall be
avoided.
   (H)   A tangent of at least 100 feet shall be introduced between reverse
horizontal curves on arterial and collector streets.
   (I)   Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at
right angles, and no streets shall intersect any other street at less than 60
degrees. Intersections of more than four corners are prohibited.
   (J)   The Council may require that sight easements be provided at street
intersections to ensure a sight distance of not less than 150 feet for minor
and collector streets and a greater radii as the Engineer shall determine for
heavier traveled streets. The Council may permit property lines at street
intersections to be rounded with a radius sufficient to ensure the above stated
distance in lieu of the sight easement.
   (K)   All cul-de-sacs and minor streets built by the developer shall be
designed for a minimum seven- ton axle load or such load as set forth in the
current Minnesota Department of Transportation’s (MnDOT) Road Design Manual (§
291.5 at the date of this chapter). Thoroughfare streets, which are expected to
carry heavier traffic, shall be designed for a nine-ton load, or current MnDOT
manual specifications. Minimum requirements of the city are shown in division
(M) of this section. This drawing shall be considered a part of these
standards. Cul-de-sacs shall not exceed 600 feet in length as measured along
the centerline from the intersection of origin to the end of the right-of-way.
   (L)   When submitting street plans to the city for approval, the developer
shall submit typical design sections showing the depth and type of the base to
be constructed, the thickness and type of wearing surface to be used, the width
of pavement planned and the general dimensions of the roadway showing crown and
related information as determined by the City Engineer to ensure adequate
review of said street plans.
   (M)   Minimum pavement width for streets built by the developer shall be as
shown in the following table.
 
Classification  Right-of-Way Width  Paved Roadway Width  Ton Loading (tons)
                (ft.)               (ft.)
Arterial        100                 44                   9
Collector/major 80                  36                   9
Cul-de-sac      50                  30                   7
Minor           60                  30                   7
 
   (N)   The street plan proposed by the developer shall meet all of the
requirements of the city’s comprehensive plan for thoroughfares. Requirements
to be met include those for alignment, right-of-way width, layout of
intersections and related requirements. In submitting his or her proposed
street plan, the developer shall provide drawings and engineering details
showing the horizontal alignment and vertical grades planned for each
individual street. Plans and profile elevations datum for the street grades
shall be given in reference to the U.S. Geodetic Survey 1929 or the 5th General
Adjustment.
   (O)   All underground utilities, street grading and compacted road base
shall be in place before building permits will be issued to the abutting
property.
   (P)   Street rights-of-way shall not be planned so as to cause hardship to
owners of adjoining property.

easement conforming substantially with the lines of such watercourse.
      (2)   Additional easement width may be required for maintenance or
construction of the watercourse.
   (C)   Where a pond or lake exists or is created in a subdivision, there
shall be provided a drainage easement conforming substantially with the
expected high water line of the waterbody. Lots shall be platted to include the
waterbody on one or more lots, but in no case shall a separate lot be created
for the waterbody alone in such a manner as to preclude the construction of a
structure thereon equal in size or value to the structures in the remainder of
the plat.
   (D)   (1)   The city shall apply National Urban Run-Off Program (NURP)
standards for the design of required storm water ponds. A copy of said
standards is on file in the office of the City Engineer.

where essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic
arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. A
planting screen easement of at least ten feet in width shall be provided along
any line of lots abutting such a traffic artery or other disadvantaged use
where required by the city.
   (F)   Side lot lines shall wherever possible be substantially at right
angles to street lines or radial from the radius point in the case of a cul-de-
sac or curved street.
   (G)   In the subdividing of land, regard shall be shown for all natural
features, including tree growth, watercourses, historic places and similar
amenities of the area, which if preserved will add attractiveness and stability
to the area. Such irreplaceable asset shall be preserved in the design of the
subdivision to the extent possible.
   (H)   Lot remnants which are below minimum lot area or dimension must be
added to adjacent or surrounding lots rather than to be allowed to remain as an
unusable outlot or parcel unless the subdivider can show acceptable plans for
the future use of such remnants.

PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS
§ 157.035 INTENT AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   It is the intent of this section to accommodate creative and
imaginative planned unit development (PUD) for the purpose of accommodating
greater flexibility in site plan design than is provided under the strict
application of zoning regulations, while at the same time preserving the
health, safety and general welfare of the city and its citizens.
   (B)   In summary, a PUD is intended to be used to achieve the following
objectives:
      (1)   Take advantage of natural features;
      (2)   Provide flexibility in design to enhance the city’s visual
character;
      (3)   A more efficient use of land and public facilities and services;
and
      (4)   Accumulation of large areas of usable open space and preservation
of areas with significant natural features worth preserving.
(Ord. passed 12-17-2014)
§ 157.036 STANDARDS.
   (A)   A PUD shall have a minimum of five acres; except that, a smaller
parcel may qualify for the use of a PUD where total ownership is less than five
acres and, in the judgment of the city, there is a benefit to the city to
consider a smaller PUD for such reason as the conservation of natural features.
   (B)   All property within a PUD shall be under the control of one owner or
group of owners capable of planning and developing the PUD site as a unit.
   (C)   The maximum density of development shall not exceed densities
consistent with the city’s long range comprehensive land use plan.
   (D)   Standards throughout the zoning and subdivision ordinances will be
used to review and guide the development of a proposed PUD. Deviation from
those standards may be permitted only if deviation is consistent with the total
design of the development, encourages a desirable living environment and is not
detrimental to the health, safety and general welfare of the city or its
residents.
   (E)   Design standards of roads, lots utility easements, storm drainage,
utilities or other facilities shall be accomplished in accord with those design
standards specified in Ch. 156 of this code of ordinances.
   (F)   Whenever possible, common open space shall be linked into the open
space areas of surrounding developments.
   (G)   All land uses shall abut on a public street or have adequate access to
a public street by means of an interior access drive. All streets and drives
must tie in effectively with the city’s existing street system and other
streets as may be proposed in the comprehensive plan.
   (H)   The architectural style of individual structures should be related and
compatible with other structures in the PUD, with the overall site design and
with surrounding land uses.
   (I)   Whenever a question arises concerning the interpretation of any
portion of this chapter, the Park/Planning Commission shall ascertain all facts
concerning the question and forward all data and a recommendation to the City
Council for determination.
   (J)   In considering an application for a PUD, the City Council shall
consider:
      (1)   The advice and recommendation of the city staff and Park/Planning
Commission;
      (2)   The effect of the proposed plan upon the health, safety and general
welfare of the occupants of surrounding land;
      (3)   The existing and anticipated traffic conditions, including parking
facilities on adjacent streets and land;
      (4)   The consistency of the proposed plan with the city’s comprehensive
plan;
      (5)   The provision within the plan for preservation of natural amenities
such as streams, wooded areas and rough terrain and its offset upon the
environment; and
      (6)   The availability of financing to the applicant and the applicant’s
financial ability to assure completion of the development by requiring a
performance bond as specified in Ch. 156 of this code of ordinances.
   (K)   Lands within a planned unit development district shall only be used
for uses designated on the comprehensive plan. Upon approval of a development
plan, the PUD shall become the zoning district for the PUD site and any change
in use will require a zoning amendment. Amendments shall follow the procedures
established by §
157.168 of this chapter.
   (L)   Subdivision review shall be carried out simultaneously with the review
of the PUD. The plans required by this section shall be submitted in a form
which will satisfy the requirements of Ch. 156 of this code of ordinances for
the preliminary and final plat.
(Ord. passed 12-17-2014)
§ 157.037 PROCEDURES FOR PROCESSING A PUD.
   (A)   Pre-application conference. Upon filing an application for PUD, the
applicant shall arrange for a meeting with appropriate city staff. The purpose
of this meeting is to provide the applicant with as much background information
as may be available which could have a bearing in the PUD and to obtain
guidance as to the general suitability of the proposed PUD.
   (B)   Concept plan.
      (1)   The applicant shall submit a concept plan for review by the Park/
Planning Commission as a means to further establish the general suitability of
the PUD.

      (3)   A preliminary plat in accordance with Ch. 156 of this code of
ordinances. Public hearing requirements shall be the same as for preliminary
plat hearings as outlined in §
156.17 of this code of ordinances. For purposes of administrative
simplification, public hearings required for the rezoning and preliminary plat

comprehensive plan;
      (2)   The development satisfies most, if not all, of the objectives of
the district; and
      (3)   The PUD will not be detrimental to surrounding neighborhoods and
provides some benefit not gained through adherence to the underlying zoning
district requirements.
   (G)   Development agreement. Upon approval of a development plan, the City

      (4)   The City Council shall review the final development plan and act on
the final plat within 30 days of receiving the recommendation from the Park/

requirements shall be in accordance with §
156.18 of this code of ordinances.
      (6)   If development has not occurred within one year, the City Council
may rezone the property to the original district and shall not have to find
that the PUD zoning was in error.
   (I)   Major amendments.

(Ord. passed 12-17-2014)
§ 157.039 SEPARABILITY.
   If any court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge any provision of this
chapter to be invalid, such judgment shall not affect any other provisions of
this chapter not specifically included in said judgment.
(Ord. passed 12-17-2014)
§ 157.040 AMENDMENTS.
   For the purpose of providing for the public health, safety and general
welfare of the city, the City Council, with the consultation of the Park/
Planning Commission, may from time to time amend the provisions imposed by

(Ord. passed 12-17-2014)
§ 157.041 CONDITIONS.
   Regulation of the subdivision of land and the attachment of reasonable
conditions to land subdivision is an exercise of valid police power delegated
by the state to the city. The developer has the duty of compliance with
reasonable conditions laid down by the City Council and Park/Planning
Commission for design, dedication, improvement and restrictive use of the land
so as to conform to the physical and economic development of the city and to
allow for the health, safety and general welfare of future landowners in the
subdivision and of the community at large.
(Ord. passed 12-17-2014)
§ 157.042 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   BLOCK. An area of land within a subdivision that is entirely bounded by
streets, exterior boundary lines of the subdivision and/or bodies of water.
   FINAL PLAT. The final map and/or plan and/or record of a subdivision and any
accompanying material presented material to the City Council for approval and
which, if approved, will be duly filed with the county’s Register of Deeds.
Said plat must conform to all state laws.
   IMPROVEMENTS. The construction or installation of public or private
utilities including, but not limited to, potable water, sanitary sewer systems,
storm sewers, roads and other barricades, trees and other plantings, lighting,
fuel or energy and the transmission thereof, transportation systems or
facilities connected therewith and communication systems which are necessary,
desirable or convenient in the maintenance of the health, safety and the
general welfare.
   LOT. A lot whose existence, location and dimensions have been legally
recorded or registered in a deed or on a plat.
   PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD). A self-contained development, sometimes with
a mixture of housing types and densities, in which the subdivision and zoning
controls are applied to the project as a whole rather than to individual lots,
as in most subdivisions. Therefore, densities are calculated for the entire
development, usually permitting a trade-off between clustering of houses and
provision of common open space.
   RIGHT-OF-WAY. An area or strip of land, either public or private, on which
an irrevocable right of passage has been recorded for the use of vehicles or
pedestrians or both.
(Ord. passed 12-17-2014)

LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING
§ 157.085 GENERAL.
   (A)   The primary purpose of this policy is to establish minimum
requirements and standards relative to landscaping, buffering and screening to
be implemented concurrently with site plans approved by the city.
   (B)   The objectives of these requirements are to establish and maintain
forestation of the city; to provide appropriate ground cover vegetation to
control soil erosion; to enhance, when necessary, the natural environment,
particularly in instances where the natural environment is disturbed during the
course of development; and to establish standards for utilization of natural
materials to achieve desired screening and buffering.
   (C)   This policy sets forth minimum requirements of landscaping and
limitations to assure that the result is consistent with reasonable maintenance
requirements on a long-term basis and to assure that the results provide an
aesthetically pleasing environment.
(Ord. passed 12-17-2014)
§ 157.086 MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICTS.
   (A)   An earth berm, not exceeding a slope of three to one, but at least
three feet high, shall be placed in all newly-platted residential developments
that abut a state highway or county road. The berm shall be placed on the side
(s) abutting the state highway or county road, and shall be in addition to
other minimum planting requirements. Evergreen trees and shrubs shall be
planted on or at the base of the berm to at least 75% opaqueness at maturity
and a total height (combined with the berm height) of at least six feet in
order to screen the development from the highway or county road.
   (B)   In the R-1 and R-2 Zoning Districts, each newly-platted single- or
two-family lot shall have two shade trees planted in the front building
setback. Each new multi-family lot shall have one tree per unit planted in the
front building setback.
   (C)   In the R-6 Zoning District, there shall be one shade tree or two
ornamental trees for every two dwelling units on any given property.
   (D)   In the R-6 Zoning District, landscaped areas averaging three feet in
width with at least one shrub every five feet shall be installed along
sidewalks. If there is an off-street parking area with a required screen hedge
along one side of a sidewalk, the landscape area requirement will be considered
met along that stretch of sidewalk.
   (E)   Vacant lots shall be kept mowed to a height of not more than six
inches by the developer or owner.
   (F)   Multiple-family dwellings shall have trash and trash handling
equipment stored within the principal structure or within an attached structure
accessible from within the principal structure that is screened, through the
use of vegetation, from public streets and adjacent residential properties.
   (G)   Where any multiple-family use with more than four parking spaces abuts
another residential use, the off-street parking for such use shall be screened
from adjoining properties by a hedge or other various plantings as approved by
the City Council.
   (H)   Light from automobile headlights and other sources shall be screened
whenever it may be directed onto residential windows, including those within
the same development.
(Ord. passed 12-17-2014)

   (A)   One tree for every 50 feet of site perimeter shall be planted. The
City Council may determine that trees should be grouped in certain instances.
   (B)   If landscaping cannot be accommodated on a MU-BR District site, the
City Council shall require the plantings to be placed in a city park or city
right-of-way. Placement of such landscaping shall be approved by the City
Council.
   (C)   Any off-street parking or stacking areas or drive aisles that face or
abut a residentially-zoned area shall be screened so as to minimize the visual
impact of the large expanses of asphalt and automobiles. This screening shall
be accomplished by an earth berm, not exceeding a slope of three to one, but at
least three feet high with shrubs at least two feet in height planted on top of
the berm and spaced to create 75% opaqueness at the time of planting and
growing to a 100% opaque hedge within two years. The berm shall be placed on
the side(s) abutting the residential zone(s), and shall be in addition to other
minimum planting requirements. An evergreen hedge installed at a minimum of 42
inches in height and 100% opaqueness at the time of planting or other
combinations (including fences) may be approved by the City Council during site
plan review.
   (D)   Loading docks, loading berths or other delivery areas that are on the
side of the lot nearest a residentially-zoned area shall be screened so as not
to be seen from the residential area. Various schemes of berms, plantings and/
or fencing or walls approved by the City Council may be used.
   (E)   All trash and trash handling equipment shall be stored within the
principal structure, within an attached structure accessible from within the
principal structure that is screened, through the use of vegetation, from
public streets and adjacent residential properties.

plans or subdivisions shall be sodded or seeded and maintained.
   (C)   All off-street parking areas shall include unpaved, landscaped islands
at a rate of one island for each 12 parking stalls (the islands do not need to
be installed at exact 12-stall intervals, but the total number of required
islands must be met by spreading the islands at intervals designed to achieve
the desired aesthetic effect of breaking up large expanses of pavement). Each
landscaped island shall be 180 square feet in size (eight feet by 18 feet
measured from back of curb; eight feet by 37 feet if combined in head-to-head
parking row) and shall be contained by a raised concrete curb that meets city
standards. Plantings shall include one shade tree and two shrubs per 18-foot

welfare and health is a public nuisance and the city may commence proceedings
for the abatement thereof. Electric fences may not be used as boundary fences
and such material as hog wire, barbed wire, safety, construction, silt or snow
fencing will not be allowed as permanent fencing.
      (6)   Snow fencing may be used from November 1 to April 1 with the
approval of a fence permit from the City Council.
      (7)   All construction or silt fencing may be used for any work requiring
a building permit and for the duration of said permit; no fence permit shall be

expressly authorized herein. RVs shall not be parked within any setback
required on any parcel of land within the city under this chapter, except on a
driveway (bituminous, concrete or pavers or two inches of Class 5 material). An
RV may encroach upon the front yard setback, but not block any sidewalk. Once
each calendar year, a RV may be used for camping purposes on an individual tax
parcel (multiple adjacent tax parcels under common ownership are considered to
be one tax parcel for the purpose of this division (A)) for up to 14 continuous
days. The use must be continuous. By way of example, it is not permissible to
use a RV on a tax parcel for overnight camping for two non-consecutive seven-
day periods. Any use of a RV for camping purposes beyond 14 consecutive days
requires a permit issued by the city and will only be issued based on a
reasonable hardship such as a fire or other damage to the residential property
on the tax parcel which precludes occupancy at the dwelling house.
      (2)   Additionally, a RV may be stored (but not used or occupied) on a
bituminous, concrete, pavers or two inches of Class 5 material driveway;
provided, it does not encroach upon any setback, except upon the front yard
setback, and does not block any sidewalk.

household use shall be drilled, installed or constructed, and no existing well
shall be further developed to provide potable water.
      (3)   New wells may be drilled for agricultural and horticultural use,
but there shall be no cross-connections between these wells and the city water
system. A cross-connection shall be any means by which a private system could
contaminate the city water system and need not be a direct pipe connection.
      (4)   Any private well now providing water shall be completely
disconnected from the plumbing system at such time as the consumer installs a
service connection to the city system.
   (B)   On-site sewage disposal systems.

§ 157.111 ANTENNAS AND TOWERS.
   (A)   Introduction.
      (1)   The city has studied the impact of amateur communication antennas
and the towers which support them within the city limits.
      (2)   The city has considered and referred to FCC Rule PRMU-BR concerning
amateur radio communications.
      (3)   The city acknowledges that it is obligated to accommodate
reasonable amateur radio communications and that the regulations imposed by the
city in relation to antennas and the towers which support such antennas shall
create the minimal practical regulations which are necessary to ensure the
public health, safety and welfare. The city has determined that the regulations
enacted herein are reasonable and necessary in order to maximize both the use
of existing structures and in order to reduce the number of antennas needed to
serve the community and to minimize the adverse visual effects of antennas
through careful siting standards.
   (B)   Towers supporting amateur radio antennas. In the R-1, R-2 and R-
6 Zoning Districts, towers more than 35 feet in height supporting amateur radio
antennas and antennas on such towers may be a conditional use subject to the
following.
      (1)   No more than one tower may be constructed on any lot.
      (2)   The tower (including the antenna) shall not exceed 60 feet in
height as measured from ground level. The tower must be constructed within the
rear yard setback of the lot in question. The tower may not be constructed in
the front or side yard setbacks. The tower may not be constructed on any
drainage or utility easement.
      (3)   Roof mounted antennas may not exceed a height of 15 feet from the
point at which the lower of the tower or antenna joins the roof.
      (4)   No tower or any antenna array on such tower shall have affixed or
attached to it in any way any lights, signs, flashers or reflectors, unless
required by the Federal Aviation Agency or the Federal Communications
Commission.
      (5)   Every tower affixed to the ground shall be enclosed from ground
level to a height of at least six feet above the ground with some type of a
mechanism designed to preclude children from climbing on the tower.
      (6)   Each tower shall be screened to the greatest extent practicable to
minimize visual impacts on surrounding properties. The tower shall comply with
all applicable building, electrical, fire code and manufacturing standards.
      (7)   As a condition precedent to erecting the tower, the person desiring
to erect such tower shall provide the city with proof of liability insurance
covering personal injury or property damage in the event that such injury or
damage is caused by the tower.
      (8)   By applying for a conditional use permit to construct such a tower,
the applicant agrees to indemnify the city and its officers and personnel,
against any claim, demand, damages, actions or causes of action and from any
fees, costs, disbursements or expenses of defending the same in relation to the
tower and any antenna raised thereon.
      (9)   No tower or antenna in an R-1, R-2 or R-6 Zoning District may be
used for commercial wireless communication purposes including cellular
telephones, personal communication services, specialized mobilized radios,
enhanced specialized mobilized radios, paging and similar services that are
sold to businesses and the general public.
      (10)   As a condition precedent to the issuance of a conditional use
permit, the applicant must agree that in the event any resident within 150 feet
of the tower and antenna claims that the antenna interferes with the affected
resident’s radio or television reception, the applicant, at the applicant’s
expense, must retain an engineer licensed in the state experienced in
telecommunications interference to conduct an interference study. The
interference study must be provided to the city within 60 days of the complaint
of interference. If the interference study determines that the applicant’s
operations are the source of the interference, the applicant shall take
appropriate corrective actions to eliminate the interference. If the
interference study determines that the applicant’s operations are not the
source of the interference, for purposes of the conditional use permit, the
study shall be presumed conclusive, and any further claims of interference by
the complaining resident shall be resolved by the Federal Communications
Commission.

§ 157.112 NON-CONFORMING BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES AND USES.
   It is the purpose of this section to provide for the regulation of non-
conforming buildings, structures and uses and to specify those requirements,
circumstances and conditions under which non-conforming structures and uses
will be operated and maintained.
   (A)   Any structure or use lawfully existing upon the effective date of this
chapter may be continued as a legal non-conforming use, except as hereinafter
stated. Whenever a legal non-conforming use has been changed to a conforming
use, it shall not thereafter be changed to a non-conforming use. No expansion,
enlargement or intensification of a non-conforming use or structure is
permitted.
   (B)   Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the repair, replacement,
restoration, maintenance or improvement, but not including the expansion, of a
legally non-conforming building or use to prevent deterioration, obsolescence,
depreciation and wear. Any non-conformity, including lawful use or occupation
of land or premises existing at the time of the adoption of this chapter, may
be continued unless the non-conforming use is destroyed by fire or other peril
to the extent of greater than 50% of its market value and no building permit
has been applied for within 180 days of when the property was damaged. Market
value shall be determined based upon the building’s assessed value on record
with the City Administrator/Clerk/Treasurer at the time immediately prior to
the loss or damage to the use in question.
   (C)   Whenever a legal non-conforming structure has been damaged in any
manner, it may be constructed and continued as a legal non-conforming use
within 12 months unless the damages to such structure total more than 50% of
its fair market value as determined by the Building Inspector and approved by
the City Council. If the damage exceeds 50% of fair market value, the owner
may, within six months, apply to the City Council for a special permit to
reconstruct and continue its non-conforming use or operation. Approval to
rebuild shall be granted only upon finding:
      (1)   Such rebuilding or restoration will not substantially extend the
probable duration of such non-conforming use;
      (2)   Restoration will not increase the size, intensity or character of
the use that was destroyed;
      (3)   Restoration constitutes no more than the replacement of the damaged
non-conforming use; and
      (4)   Restoration will be in compliance with all Building Code
requirements.
   (D)   Whenever a legal non-conforming use of land shall have been
discontinued for a continuous period of one year, any future use shall be in
conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
   (E)   (1)   Any legal non-conforming use of land not involving a structure,
or any structure with a market value of $1,000 or less, may be continued for a
period of 36 months from the effective date of this chapter. Any sign subject
to control by this code, regardless of its value, may be continued as a legal
non-conforming use for a period of 24 months. At the end of the aforementioned
time periods, the use shall be illegal non-conforming and the offenders shall
be in violation of this chapter.
      (2)   Whenever the boundaries of a district shall be changed so as to
transfer an area from one district to another district of another
classification, the provisions in this chapter shall also apply to any existing
uses that become non-conforming as a result of the boundary changes.

§ 157.113 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS; NUISANCES, HAZARDS AND DRAINAGE.
   (A)   The guiding of urban development so as to develop a compatible
relationship of uses depends upon certain standards being maintained.
   (B)   Uses permitted in the various district, conditional uses, uses
permitted with restrictions and accessory uses shall conform to the following
standards.
      (1)   Nuisance standards.
         (a)   Noise. Any use established shall be so operated that no undue
noise resulting from said use is perceptible beyond the boundaries of the
property on which such use is located. This standard shall not apply to
incidental traffic, parking, loading, construction, farming or maintenance
operations. Noise standards shall be in compliance with the state’s Pollution
Control Agency standards.
         (b)   Vibration. Any use creating periodic earth shaking vibrations
shall be prohibited if such vibrations are perceptible beyond boundaries of the
property on which the use is located. The standards shall not apply to
vibrations created during the process of construction of the building or
parking areas.
         (c)   Glare and heat. Any use requiring an operation producing an
intense heat or light transmission shall be performed with the necessary
shielding to prevent such heat or light from being detectable at the lot line
of the site in which the use is located. Lighting in all instances shall be
diffused or directed away from the residential districts and public streets.
         (d)   Smoke and particulate matter. Any use established, enlarged or
remodeled after the effective date of this chapter shall be so operated as to
control the emission of smoke or particulate matter to the degree that it is
not detrimental to or shall endanger the public health, safety or general
welfare of the public. Any use shall be so operated as to meet the minimum
requirements of the state’s Pollution Control Agency standards.
         (e)   Odors. Any use established, enlarged or remodeled shall be so
operated as to prevent the emission of odorous matter of such quality as to be
readily detectable at any point beyond the lot line of the site on which such
use is located. The emission of odor by any use shall be in compliance with and
regulated by the state’s Pollution Control Agency standards.
         (f)   Toxic or noxious matter. Any use established shall be so
operated as not to discharge across the boundaries of the lot or through
percolation into the subsoil beyond the boundaries of the lot wherein such use
is located toxic or noxious matter in such concentrations as to be detrimental
to or endanger the public health, safety or welfare, or cause injury or damage
to property or business.
      (2)   Hazard standards.
         (a)   Explosives. Any use requiring the storage, utilization or
manufacturing of products which could decompose by detonation shall be located
not less than 400 feet from any residential district and shall require a
conditional use permit. All uses must have a certificate of compliance from the
state’s Fire Marshal office as well as the Pollution Control Agency. This
section shall not apply to the storage or usage of liquid petroleum or natural
gas for normal residential or business purposes.
         (b)   Radiation emissions. All activities that emit radioactivity
shall comply with the minimum requirements in the state’s pollution standards.
         (c)   Electrical emissions. There shall be no electrical disturbance
adversely affecting the operation of any equipment, including, but not limited
to, radio and television reception, other than that of the creator of the
disturbance.
         (d)   Toxic material. Any use shall not discharge toxic matter into
the atmosphere, water or subsoil.
      (3)   Drainage standards. No land shall be developed and no use shall be
permitted that result in water run-off causing flooding or erosion on adjacent
properties. Such run-off shall be properly channeled into a storm drain,
watercourse, ponding area or other suitable facility.

SEXUALLY-ORIENTED BUSINESSES
§ 157.135 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (A)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this subchapter to regulate sexually-
oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals and general
welfare of the citizens of the city, and to establish reasonable and uniform
regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually-
oriented businesses within the city. The provisions of this chapter have
neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the
content of any communicative materials, including sexually- oriented materials.
Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny
access by adults to sexually-oriented materials protected by the First
Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually-
oriented entertainment to its intended market. Neither is it the intent nor
effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene
material.
   (B)   Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects
of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made
available to the City Council, and on findings incorporated in the cases of
City of Renton v. Playtime Theaters, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v.
American Mini Theaters, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), and Northend Cinema. Inc. Seattle,
585 P. 2d 1153 (Wash. 1978), and on studies in other communities including, but
not limited to: Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Houston, Texas;
Indianapolis, Indiana, Amarillo, Texas; Los Angeles, California; Austin, Texas;
Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and Beaumont, Texas; and also on
findings found in the Report of Attorney General’s Working Group on the
Regulation of Sexually-Oriented Businesses, (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota),
the Council finds the following.
      (1)   Sexually-oriented businesses in the city lend themselves to
ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by
the operators of the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism
to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that
occur on their premises.
      (2)   Certain employees of sexually-oriented businesses defined in this
chapter as adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain
types of sexually-oriented behavior at these businesses than employees of other
establishments.
      (3)   Sexual acts, including masturbation, oral and anal sex, occur at
sexually-oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-
private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos or live sex shows, as
defined under this chapter as adult bookstores, adult novelty shops, adult
video stores, adult motion picture theaters or adult arcades.
      (4)   Offering and providing such space encourages such activities, which
create unhealthy conditions.
      (5)   Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades and other
sexually-oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the
premises of such sexually-oriented businesses.
      (6)   At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities
occurring in sexually- oriented businesses, including, but not limited to,
syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodefiency virus infection (AIDS), genital
herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections and shigella
infections.
      (7)   Since 1981 and to the present there has been an increasing
cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS caused by the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States: 600 in 1982, 2,200 in 1983,
4,600 in 1984, 8,555 in 1985 and 253,448 through 12-31-1992.
      (8)   The number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the
United States reported annually has risen, with 33,613 cases reported in 1982
and 45,200 through November of 1990.
      (9)   The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported
annually remains at a high level, with over one-half million cases being
reported in 1990.
      (10)   The Surgeon General of the United States, in his or her report of
10-22-1986, has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be
transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to
infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her
newborn.
      (11)   According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection,
as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts.
      (12)   Sanitary conditions in some sexually-oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and,
in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of
the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those
activities and maintain those facilities.
      (13)   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found
in the areas of sexually- oriented businesses where persons view “adult”
oriented films.
      (14)   The findings noted in divisions (B)(1) through (B)(13) above raise
substantial governmental concerns.
      (15)   Sexually-oriented businesses have operational characteristics
which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns.
      (16)   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators
of the sexually-oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will
place a heretofore non-existent incentive on the operators to see that the
sexually-oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health,
safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the
city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is
the actual operator of the sexually-oriented business, fully in possession and
control of the premises and activities occurring therein.
      (17)   Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting
on premises with adult booths advances a substantial government interest in
curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters.
      (18)   Requiring licensees of sexually-oriented businesses to keep
information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help
reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the
identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from
working in such establishments.
      (19)   The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually-
oriented businesses, where such information is substantially related to the
significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in
preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.
      (20)   It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable
diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees
who may engage in the conduct which this subchapter is designed to prevent or
who are likely to be witnesses to such activity.
      (21)   The fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been
convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the
applicant is likely to engage in that conduct in contravention of this
subchapter.
      (22)   The barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses
for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads
to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.
      (23)   The general welfare, health and safety of the citizens of the city
will be promoted by the enactment of this subchapter.

so granted in cases where there are practical difficulties or particular
hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the regulations of
