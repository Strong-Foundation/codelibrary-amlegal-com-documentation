   (A)   By contract or by city personnel, supplements to this code shall be
prepared and printed whenever authorized or directed by the City Council. A
supplement to the code shall include all substantive permanent and general
parts of ordinances passed by the City Council or adopted by initiative and
referendum during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made by
the supplement in the code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that
they will fit properly into the code and will, where necessary, replace pages
which have become obsolete or partially obsolete; and the new pages shall be so
prepared that, when they have been inserted, the code will be current through
the date of adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement.
   (B)   In preparing a supplement to this code, all portions of the code which
have been repealed shall be excluded from the code by their omission from

   (C)   When preparing a supplement to this code, the codifier, meaning the
person authorized to prepare the supplement, may make formal, non-substantive
changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement,
insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified code. For
example, the codifier may:
      (1)   Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions;
      (2)   Provide appropriate catch-lines, headings, and titles for sections
and other subdivisions of the code printed in the supplement and make changes
in catch-lines, headings, and titles;
      (3)   Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be
inserted in the code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change
existing section or other subdivision numbers;
      (4)   Change the term “this ordinance” or words of the same meaning to
“this chapter”, “this subchapter”, “this section”, or “       through        ,”
indicating the sections of the code which embody the substantive sections of
the ordinance incorporated into the code; and
      (5)   Make other non-substantive changes necessary to preserve the
original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the code, but in no case
shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance
material included in the supplement or already embodied in the code.
(Prior Code, § 1.5.5)
§ 10.010 SEVERABILITY.
   It is declared to be the intention of the City Council that the chapters,
sections, divisions, and sentences of this code are severable; and if any
chapters, sections, divisions, and sentences of this code shall be declared
unconstitutional, invalid, or unenforceable, such unconstitutionality,
invalidity, or unenforceability shall not affect any of the remaining chapters,
sections, divisions, and sentences of this code.
(Prior Code, § 1.5.6)
ADMINISTRATIVE OFFENSES
§ 10.025 PURPOSE.
   The City Council finds that there is a need for alternative methods of
enforcing this code. While criminal fines and penalties have been the most
frequent enforcement mechanism, there are certain negative consequences for
both the city and the accused. The delay inherent in that system does not
ensure prompt resolution. Citizens resent being labeled as criminals for
violations of administrative regulations. The higher burden of proof and the
potential of incarceration do not appear appropriate for most administrative
violations. The criminal process does not always regard city code violations as
being important. Accordingly, the City Council finds that the use of
administrative citations and the imposition of civil penalties is a legitimate
and necessary alternative method of enforcement. This method of enforcement is
in addition to any other legal remedy that may be pursued for this code’s
violations.
(Prior Code, § 5.6.1.1)
§ 10.026 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Administrative offense. A violation of any provision of this code is
an administrative offense that may be subject to an administrative citation and
civil penalties. Each day a violation exists constitutes a separate offense.
   (B)   Exemption. Alcohol and tobacco license violations are not subject to
administrative citation under this section.
   (C)   Civil penalty. An administrative offense may be subject to a civil
penalty not to exceed the maximum penalty for a misdemeanor violation under
state law.
   (D)   Schedule of fines and fees. The City Council must adopt by resolution
a schedule of fines for offenses initiated by administrative citation. The City
Council is not bound by that schedule when a matter is appealed to it for
administrative review under §§
10.060 to
10.063. The City Council may adopt a schedule of fees to be paid to
administrative hearing officers.
(Prior Code, § 5.6.1.2)
§ 10.027 ADMINISTRATIVE CITATION PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Administrative notice.
      (1)   Upon the first violation, the city may issue an administrative
notice to the violator. The city will deliver the administrative notice to the
violator in person or by regular mail. The violator will have ten calendar days
to correct the violation after issuance of the administrative notice.
      (2)   If the violator is making a good faith attempt to remedy the
violation, the city may grant an extension, the length of which must be agreed
upon in writing between the city and the violator. The city is not required to
give such notice and the city, in its sole discretion, may determine that the
violation needs no notice since it is presumed that the public is clearly on
notice that the conduct is in violation of this code. In such cases, the city
shall immediately issue the administrative citation as set forth in division
(B) below.
   (B)   Administrative citation. If the violator fails to correct the
violation within the time period provided in the administrative notice, the
city may issue an administrative citation. The city must issue the citation to
the violator in person or by certified and regular mail. In the case of a
vehicular offense, the citation may be attached to the motor vehicle. The
citation must state the date, time, and nature of the offense, the name of the
issuing officer, the amount of the scheduled fine, and the manner for paying
the fine or appealing the citation.
   (C)   Payment. The violator must either pay the scheduled fine or request a
hearing within seven days after issuance of the citation. Penalties for failure
to correct the violation or late payment of the fine may be imposed as set
forth in §§
10.075 to
10.079. The city may issue a second citation or take other legal action to
achieve compliance with the ordinances.
(Prior Code, § 5.6.1.3)
§ 10.028 ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING.
   (A)   Hearing officers. The City Council will periodically approve a list of
qualified individuals, from which the City Clerk-Treasurer will randomly select
a hearing officer to hear and determine a matter for which a hearing is
requested. The hearing officer will be a public officer, as defined by M.S. §
609.415, as it may be amended from time to time. The hearing officer must not
be a city employee. The City Clerk-Treasurer must establish a procedure for
evaluating the competency of the hearing officer, including comments from
accused violators and city staff. These reports must be provided to the City
Council.
   (B)   Removal of hearing officer. No later than five days before the date of
the hearing, the violator may make a written request that the assigned hearing
officer be removed from the case. The City Clerk- Treasurer will automatically
grant one request for removal. A subsequent request must be directed to the
assigned hearing officer who will decide whether he or she can fairly and
objectively review the case. If the hearing officer determines he or she cannot
fairly and objectively review the case, the hearing officer shall notify the
City Clerk-Treasurer in writing at least one day before the scheduled hearing
date. The City Clerk-Treasurer will then assign another hearing officer.
   (C)   Notice of hearing. Within 30 days of the request for a hearing, the
City Clerk-Treasurer will schedule the hearing and will notify the violator and
involved city staff of the date, time, and place for the hearing. Parties are
expected to be available for two hours. Notice of the hearing must be mailed to
the violator and the hearing officer at least ten days in advance of the
scheduled hearing, unless a shorter time is accepted by all parties. The notice
must contain the names of the parties, the identity of the hearing officer, the
location of the alleged violation and the type of violation alleged.
   (D)   Continuance. A request for a continuance must be made to the City
Clerk-Treasurer at least five days prior to the scheduled hearing date. The
City Clerk-Treasurer may grant a continuance at the request of the violator or
the city staff member only for good cause shown and for no more than ten days
from the originally assigned date.
(Prior Code, § 5.6.1.4)
§ 10.029 FILE TRANSMITTAL.
   (A)   Upon receipt of any request for a hearing, the City Clerk-Treasurer’s
office will compile a summary report detailing the facts in support of any
determination that the offense constitutes a violation.
   (B)   The summary report will include:
      (1)   Copy of the citation issued;
      (2)   Copy of the administrative notice, which preceded the citation;
      (3)   Copy of any case history in the issuing employee’s department;
      (4)   Photographs and/or videotape of property where available; and
      (5)   Proof of mailing and/or posting of notice on the property if the
citation was not personally served on the violator.
   (C)   The file must be ready for the hearing officer to pick up on the
business day preceding the scheduled hearing.
(Prior Code, § 5.6.1.5)
§ 10.030 PRESENTATION OF CASE.
   At the hearing, the parties will have the opportunity to present testimony
and question any witnesses, but strict rules of evidence will not apply. The
hearing officer must tape record the hearing and receive testimony and
exhibits. The hearing officer must receive and give weight to evidence,
including hearsay evidence, that possesses probative value commonly accepted by
reasonable and prudent people in the conduct of their affairs.
(Prior Code, § 5.6.1.6)
§ 10.031 WRITTEN DECISION.
   (A)   The hearing officer must issue a written decision containing findings
of fact, conclusions of law, and an order. The decision will be mailed to the
parties within ten days after the hearing. The hearing officer has the
authority to determine that a violation occurred, to dismiss a citation, to
impose the scheduled fine, and to reduce, stay, or waive a scheduled fine
either unconditionally or upon compliance with appropriate conditions.
   (B)   When imposing a penalty for a violation, the hearing officer may
consider any or all of the following factors:
      (1)   Duration of the violation;
      (2)   Frequency of reoccurrence of the violation;
      (3)   Seriousness of the violation;
      (4)   History of the violation;
      (5)   Violator’s conduct after issuance of the administrative notice and
citation;
      (6)   Violator’s conduct after issuance of the notice of hearing;
      (7)   Good faith effort by the violator to comply;
      (8)   Impact of the violation upon the community;
      (9)   Prior record of city code violations; and
      (10)   Any other factors appropriate to a just result.
   (C)   The hearing officer may not impose a fine greater than the established
fine, except that the hearing officer may impose a fine for each week that the
violation continues if:
      (1)   The violation caused or is causing a serious threat of harm to the
public health, safety, or welfare; or
      (2)   The violator intentionally and unreasonably refused or refuses to
comply with the code requirement.
(Prior Code, § 5.6.1.7)
§ 10.032 NO APPEAL AVAILABLE.
   Except as provided in §§
10.060 to
10.063,
10.045, and
10.046, the decision of the hearing officer is final without any further right
of appeal.
(Prior Code, § 5.6.1.8)
§ 10.033 FAILURE TO APPEAR.
   The failure to attend the hearing constitutes a waiver of the violator’s
rights to an administrative hearing and an admission of the violation. A
hearing officer may waive this result upon good cause shown. Examples of good
cause are death in the immediate family or documented incapacitating illness of
the violator; a court order requiring the violator to appear for another
hearing at the same time; and lack of proper service of the citation or notice
of the hearing. Good cause does not include forgetfulness, lack of
transportation or childcare, and intentional delay.
(Prior Code, § 5.6.1.9)
JUDICIAL REVIEW
§ 10.045 DECISION REVIEW.
   An aggrieved party may obtain judicial review of the decision of the hearing
officer as provided in state law.
(Prior Code, § 5.6.2.1)
§ 10.046 OPTION TO WITHDRAW.
   These procedures are intended to be voluntary on the part of those who have
been charged with administrative offenses. The individual may withdraw from
participation in this administrative process by submitting a written request
for withdrawal to the City Clerk-Treasurer within seven days of the issuance of
the administrative citation. Upon receiving this written request, the city may
bring criminal or other civil charges according to this code and state law.
Likewise, nothing in this section shall prohibit the city, in its discretion,
to initiate criminal charges or any other remedy in lieu of the administrative
procedures herein set forth.
(Prior Code, § 5.6.2.2)
ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW
§ 10.060 APPEAL.
   A violator may appeal the hearing officer’s decision in any of the following
matters to the City Council for administrative review:
   (A)   An alleged failure to obtain a permit, license, or other approval from
the City Council as required by an ordinance;
   (B)   An alleged violation of a permit, license, other approval, or the
conditions attached to the permit, license, or approval, that was granted by
the City Council; or
   (C)   An alleged violation of regulations governing a person or entity who
has received a license granted by the City Council.
(Prior Code, § 5.6.3.1)
§ 10.061 NOTICE.
   The appeal under this subchapter will be heard by the City Council. Notice
of the hearing must be delivered to the alleged violator or property owner and
involved city staff, in person or by mail, at least ten days in advance of the
hearing. The parties to the hearing will have an opportunity to present oral or
written arguments regarding the hearing officer’s decision.
(Prior Code, § 5.6.3.2)
§ 10.062 DECISIONS.
   The City Council must consider the record, the hearing officer’s decision,
and any additional arguments before making a determination. The Council is not
bound by the hearing officer’s decision, but may adopt all or part of the
officer’s decision. The Council’s decision must be in writing.
(Prior Code, § 5.6.3.3)
§ 10.063 SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION.
   In addition to imposing a civil penalty, the Council may suspend or revoke a
city-issued license, permit, or other approvals associated with the violation.
(Prior Code, § 5.6.3.4)

unpaid shall be a lien upon the property. The term CUSTOMER shall include the
owner, occupant, or both.
   (C)   Rates. The rates for refuse disposal shall be a charge against the
premises from which refuse or rubbish is collected and the owner, lessee, or
occupant of the premises, or against any or all of them, and any claim for

the occupant of the premises may be collected in a civil action in any court of
competent jurisdiction, or in the discretion of the City Council, may be
certified to the County Auditor with the taxes against such property served,
and shall be collected as other taxes are collected.
   (D)   Payment and late charge.  Bills for refuse service charges shall be

action, or remedy available to the city.

   (G)   Delinquency between April 15 and October 15. If a customer’s account
becomes delinquent during the period between April 15 and October 15 and
satisfactory arrangements for payment have not been made, the Water Department
may, after the procedural requirements set out herein have been complied with,
discontinue service to a delinquent customer by shutting off the water. When
water service to any premises has been discontinued, service shall not be
restored except upon the payment of all delinquent amounts due, plus a fee set
from time to time by the Council for disconnection and reconnection.
   (H)   Procedure. Water service shall not be shut off or disconnected under
this section until notice and an opportunity for hearing have first been given
to the occupant and owner of the premises involved. The city may rely on its
records to determine the owner and shall mail notice to the owner, or to the
last known address of the owner. Notice shall be personally served on the
occupant by mail or other sufficient method to provide adequate notice to the
occupant and shall state that if payment is not made before a date stated in
the notice, no less than 20 days after the date of which the notice is given,
the water supply to the premises will be shut off. The notice shall clearly
inform the occupant and the owner of the opportunity to present to the City
Council objections to the bill, or proposed disconnection, and shall identify
the telephone number, address, and officer or employee who will handle the
customer’s complaint, and who has the authority to review the facts and files,
to correct any errors in the billing and to arrange for credit terms. The
notice shall also state that the occupant may, before such date, demand a
hearing on the matter, in which case the water supply will not be shut off
until the hearing has been concluded or dismissed. If the customer requests a
hearing before the date specified, a hearing shall be held on the matter by the
City Council at the next regularly scheduled Council meeting after the request
is made. If as a result of the hearing the city finds that the amount claimed
to be owing is actually due and unpaid, and that there is no legal reason why
the water supply of the delinquent customer may not be shut off in accordance
with this section, the city may shut off the supply.
   (I)   Reconnection. The city shall reinstate and reconnect service which in
any way affects the primary heat source of a residential unit if such service
remains disconnected as of October 15, if the residential customer makes
application for reinstatement and enters into either a reconnection plan or
payment schedule. The residential customer may enter into a connection plan
only if the customer’s monthly household income is less than 185% of the
federal poverty level.
(Prior Code, § 3.4)
§ 51.05 COLLECTION OF TAXES.
   Delinquent accounts shall be certified with the City Clerk-Treasurer, who
shall prepare an assessment roll each year providing for assessment of the
delinquent amounts against the respective properties served. The assessment
roll shall be delivered to the Council for adoption on or before October 1 of
each year. Upon such adoption, the Clerk-Treasurer shall certify the assessment
roll to the County Auditor for collection along with taxes.
(Prior Code, § 3.5)
§ 51.06 TAPPING.
   Before any tapping to any water main shall be performed, a permit must first
be obtained from the city and upon the payment to the city of a tapping fee
plus a further sum set from time to time by the Council to cover the cost of
street repair, a three-fourths-inch meter will be installed for residential
units. Should a larger meter of up to one inch be required, an additional
tapping charge set from time to time by the Council shall be paid by the
consumer in addition to the actual expense incurred by the city in completing
the tapping. If a customer desires a larger meter, the customer must purchase
the meter, and the meter must measure in gallons. All such tappings shall be
performed by the City Foreman of the waterworks or his or her agents; and no
taps shall be made between the water main and the inside of the water meter;
and no ties, branches, or other taps shall be made between the water main and
the inside of the water meter. It shall be unlawful for any person except the
City Foreman of the waterworks, or his or her agents, or the Fire Department in
case of fire, to turn on or off the water at the curb or at any other place on
city property.
(Prior Code, § 3.6) Penalty, see §
51.99
§ 51.07 RATES.
   All taps used by any person for the supply of water from the city shall be
provided with a three-fourths-inch water meter by the city, and each consumer
requiring a larger meter of up to one inch shall purchase the meter, and it
shall remain his or her property. In addition, each water user furnished with a
water meter shall pay to the city a minimum monthly rate, and for all
additional gallons, set from time to time by the Council. In addition to these
fees, and for the purpose of providing funds for the operation and maintenance
of the sewer system of the city, there shall be charged, added, and collected
monthly with each water consumer bill a fee per gallon for monthly sewer
charges and a fee for service charges set from time to time by the Council.
(Prior Code, § 3.7)
§ 51.08 SPRINKLING LAWNS AND GARDENS.
   (A)   Any person desiring to install a separate water meter for the purpose
of sprinkling lawns and gardens may purchase a water meter approved by the city
to measure water for sprinkling. This meter shall measure by gallons. This
meter shall be so connected that no water flowing through it shall be wasted
into the city sewer. Water charges shall be made for the water used by the
meter, but no sewer charge shall be made for the use of the water for
sprinkling.
   (B)   All meters and hookups shall be approved by the city.
   (C)   All meters and water usage for sprinkling shall not be used before May
1 of each year. Meter use and water use for sprinkling shall not occur after
October 20 of each year, and the meter shall be read by the Water Department.
   (D)   Any water used by the meter between October 20 and May 1 will be
considered to be part of the sewer bill.

industrial wastes may, at the discretion of the city, be required to provide
laboratory measurements, tests, or analyses of waters or wastes to illustrate
compliance with this chapter and any special condition for discharge
established by the city or regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over the
discharge. The number, type, and frequency of sampling and laboratory analyses
to be performed by the owner shall be as stipulated by the city. The industry
must supply a complete analysis of the constituents of the wastewater discharge
to assure that compliance with federal, state, and local standards are being
met. The owner shall report the results of measurements and laboratory analyses
to the city at such times and in such manner as prescribed by the city. The
owner shall bear the expense of all measurements, analyses, and reporting
required by the city. At such times as deemed necessary, the city reserves the
right to take measurements and samples for analysis by an independent
laboratory.
   (K)   All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of

Superintendent.
   (L)   Where required by the city or the district, the owner of any property
serviced by a sanitary sewer shall provide protection from an accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this
chapter. Where necessary, facilities to prevent accidental discharges of
prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner’s expense.
Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this
protection shall be submitted to the Superintendent for review and approval
prior to construction of the facility. Review and approval of such plans and
operating procedures shall not relieve any user from the responsibility to
modify the user’s facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this
chapter. Users shall notify the Superintendent immediately upon having a slug
or accidental discharge of substances or wastewater in violation of this
chapter to enable countermeasures to be taken by the Superintendent to minimize
damage to the wastewater treatment works. Such notification will not relieve
any user of any liability for any expense, loss, or damage to the wastewater
treatment works or treatment process, or for any fines imposed on the city or
the district on account thereof under any state and federal law. Employers
shall ensure that all employees who may cause or discover such a discharge are
advised of the emergency notification procedure.
   (M)   No person having charge of any building or other premises which drains
into the public sewer shall permit any substance or matter which may form a
deposit or obstruction to flow or pass into the public sewer. Within ten days
after receipt of written notice from the city, the owner shall install a
suitable and sufficient catch basin or waste trap, or if one already exists,
shall clean out, repair, or alter the catch basin or trap, and perform such
other work as the Superintendent may deem necessary. Upon the owner’s refusal
or neglect to install a catch basin or waste trap or to clean out, repair, or
alter the catch basin or trap after the period of ten days, the Superintendent
may cause such work to be completed at the expense of the owner or his or her
representative.
   (N)   Whenever any service connection becomes clogged, obstructed, broken or
out of order, or detrimental to the use of the public sewer, or unfit for the
purpose of drainage, the owner shall repair or cause such work to be done as
the Superintendent may direct. Each day after ten days that a person neglects
or fails to so act shall constitute a separate violation of this division (N),
and the Superintendent may then cause the work to be done and recover from such
owner or agent the expense by an action in the name of the city.
   (O)   The owner or operator of any motor vehicle washing or servicing
facility shall provide and maintain in serviceable condition at all times, a
catch basin or waste trap in the building drain system to prevent grease, oil,
dirt, or any mineral deposit from entering the public sewer system.
   (P)   In addition to any penalties that may be imposed for violation of any
provision of this chapter, the city or the district may assess against any
person the cost of repairing or restoring sewers or associated facilities
damaged as a result of the discharge of prohibited wastes by such person and
may collect such assessment as an additional charge for the use of the public
sewer system or in any other manner deemed appropriate by the city or the
district.
   (Q)   No statement contained in this section shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and/or the
district and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual
strength or character may be accepted by the city and/or the district for
treatment, subject to payment by the industrial concern.

      (2)   The allocation of users to these classes for the purpose of
assessing sewer service charges shall be the responsibility of the City Clerk-
Treasurer. Allocation of all users to user classes shall be based on the
substantive intent of the definitions contained in this chapter. Industrial
users discharging segregated domestic-strength waste only can be classified as
commercial users for the purpose of rate determination.
   (B)   User charges.
      (1)   Each user shall be assessed and pay user charges in proportion to
the user’s proportionate contribution of wastewater flows and loadings to the
treatment works, with a minimum rate for pollutant loadings being the rate
established for domestic-strength waste.
      (2)   The charges assessed users discharging domestic-strength waste
shall be established proportionately on the basis of billable wastewater
volume. Billable wastewater volume shall generally be calculated as metered
water usage.
   (C)   Capital recovery charges.
      (1)   Each user shall be assessed and pay capital recovery charges in
proportion to the user’s proportionate contribution of wastewater flows and
loadings to the treatment works, with a minimum rate for pollutant loadings
being the rate established for domestic-strength waste.

of metered water usage. For all users discharging domestic-strength waste,
billable wastewater volume shall be equal to the metered water usage, as
measured throughout the year. The billable amounts of wastewater loadings shall
be calculated from the volume of metered usage, where the billable quantities
will be those attributable to domestic-strength waste.
      (2)   For users with unmetered water services or not connected to the
city’s water system, the billable wastewater volume shall be calculated from
the volume of metered water usage or, at the discretion of the city, from the
measurement or estimate of effluent flow at the user’s point of discharge.
Measurements shall be according to a regular program prescribed by the city.
      (3)   For all users discharging extra-strength waste, billable wastewater
volume shall be calculated from the volume of metered water usage or, at the
discretion of the city, from the measurement of effluent flow at the user’s
point of discharge. Measurements shall be according to a regular program
prescribed by the city. For all users discharging extra-strength waste,
billable amounts of wastewater loadings shall be calculated by the measurement
of these wastes according to a program prescribed by the city, in keeping with
the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and
Wastewater and in accordance with other provisions of this chapter.
      (4)   The city may, at its discretion, require any user to install a
water meter, wastewater meter, or such additional water meters as may be
necessary to determine wastewater volume. When so required, such meter shall be
of a type approved by the city, equipped with a remote registering recorder,
and located at an accessible site on the owner’s property.

         POMR   =   Unit surcharge per pound of phosphorus.
         SUC      =   Surcharge for extra-strength waste.
   (F)   Determination of capital recovery charges.
      (1)   Capital recovery charges shall consist of a volume charge for
domestic-strength waste and, if necessary, a surcharge for extra-strength
waste. Such charges shall be developed in accordance with the approved sewer
service charge system and computed in accordance with the formula presented
below.
      CRC = MCR + (Vcr x F) + Scr
      Where:
         CRC   =   Capital recovery charge.
         MCR   =   Minimum charge ($/billing period) for capital-related costs
assigned to customer service and one unit of domestic-strength wastewater
volume.
         Vcr   =   Volume charge per 1,000 gallons for capital-related costs.
         F   =   Billable wastewater volume in 1,000 gallons.
         Scr   =   Surcharge for extra-strength waste.
      (2)   Surcharges for extra-strength waste, if applicable, shall be
computed in accordance with the formula presented below.
         Scr = 0.00624 x F x [(B x BCR) + (T x TCR) + (P x PCR)].
         Where:
            0.00624   =   Conversion factor.
            B      =   Concentration of BOD5 in excess of domestic-strength
waste.
            T      =   Concentration of TSS in excess of domestic-strength    .
            P      =   Concentration of phosphorus in excess of domestic-

computed for each user in accordance with the formula presented below.
      SSC = Uc + CRc
      Where:
         SSC   =   Sewer service charge.
         Uc   =   User charge.
         CRc   =   Capital recovery charge.
   (H)   Additional charges. The sewer service charges established in this
chapter shall not prevent the assessment of additional charges to users who
discharge extra-strength waste or wastes of unusual character, or contractual
agreements with such users, as long as the following conditions are met:
      (1)   The user pays OM&R costs in proportion to the user’s proportionate
contribution of wastewater flows and loadings to the treatment works and no
user is charged at a rate less than that of domestic-strength waste; and
      (2)   The measurement of such wastes are conducted according to the
latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater
in a manner acceptable to the city, as provided for in this chapter.
      (3)   A study of unit costs of collection and treatment processes
attributable to fixed service, flow, BOD5, TSS, and other significant loadings
shall be developed for determining the proportionate allocation of costs to
fixed service, flows, and loadings for users discharging extra-strength wastes
or wastes of unusual character.
(Prior Code, § 3.19)
§ 52.11 ESTABLISHMENT OF A SEWER SERVICE FUND.
   (A)   The city establishes a Sewer Service Fund as an income fund to receive
all revenues generated by the sewer service charge system, and all other income
dedicated to the operation, maintenance, replacement, and capital recovery

STORM SEWER DRAINAGE UTILITY
§ 52.25 STORM SEWER DISTRICT.
   (A)   A Storm Sewer District is established within the city pursuant to M.S.
§ 444.17, as it may be amended from time to time, which shall be entitled the
Crosby Storm Sewer District.
   (B)   The purpose of the District is to enable the city to plan, prepare
for, and establish storm sewers throughout the city and to provide a method of
financing construction of the storm sewers installed pursuant to M.S. § 444.20,
as it may be amended from time to time.
   (C)   The entire incorporated boundaries of the city shall be the boundaries
of the District.
   (D)   The governing body of the District shall consist of the Mayor and
Council members of the city.
   (E)   The District shall be empowered to levy taxes pursuant to M.S. §
444.20, as it may be amended from time to time, and/or to make assessments
pursuant to M.S. Ch. 429, as it may be amended from time to time.
   (F)   The City Council shall be required to approve all expenditures and
construction by at least a four-fifths vote of the Council.
(Prior Code, § 3.23)
§ 52.26 ESTABLISHMENT.
   A storm sewer drainage utility for the city is established. The municipal
storm sewer system shall be operated as a public utility pursuant to M.S. §
444.075, as it may be amended from time to time, from which revenues will be
derived subject to the provisions of this chapter and state law. The storm
water drainage utility shall be part of the Public Works Department and subject
to the administration of the City Council, under the management and direction
of the working foreman. Just and reasonable charges for use and availability of
storm sewer drainage facilities shall be calculated and determined pursuant to
the terms contained in this chapter based on expected and typical storm water
runoff as may be calculated within reasonable and practical limits with due
regard to just and equitable charges as provided for in this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 3.24)
§ 52.27 DETERMINATION OF RATES AND CHARGES.
   Rates and charges for the use and availability of the utility system shall
be determined through the use of a residential equivalent factor (REF), defined
as the ratio of the average volume of runoff generated by one acre of a given
land use to the average volume of runoff generated by one acre of typical
single-family residential land, during a two-inch rainfall event.
(Prior Code, § 3.25)
§ 52.28 STORM WATER DRAINAGE FEES.
   (A)   Calculation.
      (1)   For the purpose of calculating storm water drainage fees for
parcels of land, the REF for the parcel’s storm water land use classification
shall be multiplied by that parcel’s acreage, and then the resulting product
shall be multiplied by the storm water drainage rate, or, in formula format:
Fee = REF x acreage x rate.
      (2)   The REF values for the various storm water land use classifications
are as follows.
 
Class Storm Water Land Use Classifications                     REF
1     Undeveloped                                              0.0
2     Open areas                                               0.2
3     Residential                                              1.0
4     Medium-density commercial, industrial, and institutional 2.0
5     Heavy-density commercial, industrial, and institutional  2.5
 
      (3)   For the purpose of calculating storm water drainage fees, actual
acreages shall be used except for those parcels having a storm water land use
classification of “Residential”. As residential parcels are the most numerous,
and to simplify the process, the storm water drainage fee for all parcels
classified as “Residential” shall be calculated using an acreage of 0.25 acre,
regardless of their actual acreage.
   (B)   Other land usage. Other land uses not listed in the table in this
section shall be classified by the working foreman by assigning them to classes
most nearly like the uses, from the standpoint of runoff volume for the
standard rainfall event. An appeal of such classification from the
determination of the working foreman may be made to the City Council.
   (C)   Adjustments. The City Council may by resolution adopt policies
providing for the adjustment of charges for parcels based upon land use data
supplied by affected property owners which demonstrate a runoff volume for a
standard rainfall event substantially different from the REF being used for
such parcels. Such adjustments for storm water drainage fees shall not be made
retroactively. A credit of up to 50% of the storm water drainage fee may be
given if the property owner has or develops on-site retention of the storm
water.
   (D)   Exemption. Public street right-of-way and vacant unimproved land with
ground cover are exempt from storm water drainage charges.
(Prior Code, § 3.26)
§ 52.29 PAYMENT OF FEES.
   (A)   Statements. Statements for storm water drainage fees shall be made a
part of the utility billing system invoiced through the City Clerk-Treasurer’s
office on a monthly basis. In cases where the property or property owner is not
receiving a monthly utility statement, the statement shall be billed on an
annual basis invoiced through the City Clerk-Treasurer’s office.
   (B)   Recalculation of fee. If a property owner or person responsible for
paying the storm water drainage fee questions the accuracy of an invoice, such
person may have the determination of the charge recalculated by written request
to the working foreman within 60 days following the mailing of the invoice by
the city.
   (C)   Late payment penalty. Bills for storm water drainage charges shall be
rendered on a monthly basis succeeding the period for which the service was
rendered and shall be due 30 days from the date of rendering. Any payment not
received by the due date shall result in a penalty of a late payment charge.
The penalty shall be computed as 10% of the original bill and shall be
increased the same 10% for every month the bill is outstanding.
   (D)   Collection with real estate taxes. Any past-due storm water drainage
fees may be certified to the County Auditor for collection with real estate
taxes, pursuant to M.S. § 444.075, Subd. 3, as it may be amended from time to
time. In addition, the city may exercise any and all legal remedies available
to it for the collection of unpaid charges.
   (E)   Establishment of tax lien. As authorized by state law, the city may
certify to the County Auditor between October 1 and 15 of each year any charges
that are delinquent, which includes all such charges that are more than 30 days
past due on or before September 30 of that year, which certification shall
include the amount of such charges, the description of the premises serviced,
and the name and address of the owner. The amount so certified shall be
extended by the Auditor on the tax rolls against the premises in the same
matter as other taxes, and collected by the County Treasurer and paid to the
city along with other taxes. lf the property is occupied by any person who is
not the owner, the owner is nonetheless obligated for all service collection
charges incurred.
   (F)   The owner of the premises shall be liable to pay for the service to
such premises, and the service is furnished to the premises by the city only
upon the condition that the owner of the premises is liable to the city.

of facts on which the SSTS permit was issued, or unauthorized changes to the
system design that alter the original function of the system, change the
treatment capacity of the system, change the location of the system, or
otherwise change the original system design, layout, or function. A notice of
suspension or revocation and the reasons for the suspension or revocation shall
be conveyed in writing to the permit holder. If suspended or revoked,
installation or modification of a treatment system may not commence or continue
until a valid SSTS permit is obtained.
   (I)   (I)   SSTS assessment requirements. For those SSTS without a
management plan or operating permit according to the provisions of this
subchapter, the following provisions apply:
      (1)   The owner of an ISTS or the owner's agent shall regularly, but in
no case less frequently than every three years, assess whether sewage tanks
leak below the designed operating depth and whether sewage tank tops, riser
joints, and riser connections leak through visual evidence of major defects and
measure or remove the accumulations of scum, grease, and other floating
materials at the top of each septic tank and compartment, along with the
sludge, which consists of the solids denser than water.
      (2)   All solids and liquids must be removed by pumping from all tanks or
compartments in which the top of the sludge layer is less than 12 inches from
the bottom of the outlet baffle or transfer hole or whenever the bottom of the
scum layer is less than three inches above the bottom of the outlet baffle or
transfer hole. Total sludge and scum volume must not be greater than 25%of the
tank's liquid capacity. Removal of accumulated sludge, scum, and liquids from
septic tanks and pump tanks must be through the maintenance hole. The removal
of solids from any location other than the maintenance hole is not a compliant
method of solids removal from a sewage tank, and this method does not fulfill
the solids removal requirement of this division or a management plan. Liquid
and solids removal from clean-out pipes is allowed for holding tanks.

(Ord. 2016-06, passed 5-23-2016)
§ 53.02 FINDINGS.
   (A)   The city finds that uncontrolled storm water runoff and construction
site erosion from land development and land disturbing activity can have
significant adverse impacts upon local and regional water resources diminishing
the quality of public health, safety, public and private property, and natural
resources of the city.
   (B)   Uncontrolled soil erosion and storm water runoff can:
      (1)   Threaten public health, safety, property, and general welfare by
increasing runoff volumes and peak flood flows and overburdening storm sewers,
drainage ways, and other storm drainage systems;
      (2)   Diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish, aquatic
life, and recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant loadings
of sediment, suspended solids, nutrients, heavy metals, toxins, debris,
bacteria, pathogens, biological impairments, thermal stress, and other
pollutants;
      (3)   Degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion,
increasing stream bed scour, diminishing ground water recharge, diminishing
stream base flows, and increasing stream temperatures;
      (4)   Undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence
and levels of flooding;
      (5)   Alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and
increasing pollutant loads; and
      (6)   Impact ground water by reducing recharge and increasing potential
pollutant loading.
(Ord. 2016-06, passed 5-23-2016)
§ 53.03 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to establish regulatory requirements
for land development and land disturbing activities aimed at minimizing the
threats to public health, safety, public and private property, and natural
resources within the city from construction site erosion and post-construction
storm water runoff.
   (B)   Specifically, this chapter establishes regulatory requirements that:
      (1)   Meet MIDS performance goals;
      (2)   Assist in meeting NPDES/SDS construction storm water general permit
requirements;
      (3)   Assist in meeting total maximum daily load (TMDL) plan waste load
allocations for impaired waters through quantification of load reductions;
      (4)   Protect life and property from dangers associated with flooding;
      (5)   Protect public and private property and natural resources from
damage resulting from storm water runoff and erosion;
      (6)   Ensure the annual storm water runoff rates and volumes from post
development site conditions mimic and/or reduce the annual runoff rates and
volumes from predevelopment site conditions;
      (7)   Ensure site design minimizes the generation of storm water and
maximizes pervious areas for storm water treatment;
      (8)   Provide a single, consistent set of performance goals that apply to
all developments;
      (9)   Protect water quality from pollutant loadings of sediment,
suspended solids, nutrients, heavy metals, toxics, debris, bacteria, pathogens,
biological impairments, thermal stress, and other pollutants;
      (10)   Promote infiltration and ground water recharge;
      (11)   Provide vegetated corridors (buffers) to protect water resources
from development;
      (12)   Protect functional values of all types of natural water bodies
(e.g., rivers, streams, wetlands, lakes, and seasonal ponds); and
      (13)   Sustain or enhance biodiversity (native plant and animal habitat)
and support riparian ecosystems.

Appendix B of the state’s construction storm water permit no. MN R100001
(construction permit) available at http://www.pca.state.mn.us/wfhva5b:. If not
defined in the construction permit, then words or phrases shall be interpreted
to have the meaning they have in common usage. Words or phrases shall be
interpreted so as to give this chapter its most reasonable application. For the
purpose of this chapter, the words MUST, SHALL, and WILL are mandatory and not
permissive.
   APPLICANT. The owner of land submitting an application under the provisions
of this chapter for a storm water and/or erosion control permit to be issued by
the city.
   BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES (BMPs). The most effective and practicable means
of erosion prevention and sediment control, and water quality management
practices that are the most effective and practicable means to control,
prevent, and minimize degradation of surface water, including avoidance of
impacts, construction-phasing, minimizing the length of time soil areas are
exposed, pollution prevention through good housekeeping, and other management
practices published by state or designated area-wide planning agencies.
   BETTER SITE DESIGN. The control and management of storm water quantity and
quality through the application of BETTER SITE DESIGN techniques as outlined in
the current version of the state’s storm water manual: http://
stormwater.pca.state.mn.us/index.php/Main Page. BETTER SITE DESIGN includes
preservation of natural areas, site reforestation, stream and shoreland
buffers, open space design, disconnection of impervious cover, rooftop
disconnection, grass channels, storm water landscaping, compost and amended
soils, impervious surface reduction, and trout stream protection.
   COMMON PLAN OF DEVELOPMENT OR SALE. A contiguous area where multiple
separate and distinct land disturbing activities may be taking place at
different times, on different schedules, but under one proposed plan. ONE PLAN
is broadly defined to include design, permit application, advertisement or
physical demarcation indicating that land disturbing activities may occur.
   CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY. Includes construction activity as defined in 40
C.F.R. §122.26(b)(14)(x), small construction activity as defined in 40 C.F.R. §
122.26(b)(15), and construction activity as defined by Minn. Rules Part
709.0080, Subp. 4. This includes a disturbance to the land that results in a
change in the topography, existing soil cover (both vegetative and non-
vegetative), or the existing soil topography that may result in accelerated
storm water runoff, leading to soil erosion and movement of sediment into
surface waters or drainage systems. Examples of CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY include
clearing, grading, filling, and excavating. CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY includes the
disturbance of less than one acre of total land area that is a part of a larger
common plan of development or sale if the larger common plan will ultimately
disturb one acre or more. CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY does not include a disturbance
to the land of less than five acres for the purpose of routine maintenance that
is performed to maintain the original line and grade, hydraulic capacity, or
original purpose of the facility.
   DEVELOPMENT, NEW. Any development that results in the conversion of land
that is currently prairie, agriculture, forest, or meadow and has less than 15%
impervious surface. Land that was previously developed, but now razed and
vacant, will not be considered NEW DEVELOPMENT.
   DEWATERING. The removal of surface or ground water to dry and/or solidify a
construction site to enable construction activity. DEWATERING may require a
State Department of Natural Resources (DNR) water appropriation permit, and if
DEWATERING water is contaminated, discharge of such water may require an
individual MPCA NPDES/SDS permit.
   ENERGY DISSIPATION. Methods employed at pipe outlets to prevent erosion
caused by the rapid discharge of water. Examples include, but are not limited
to, concrete aprons, riprap, splash pads, and gabions that are designed to
prevent erosion.
   EROSION PREVENTION. Measures employed to prevent erosion. Examples include,
but not limited to, soil stabilization practices, limited grading, mulch,

owner or operator to construct the project described in the final plans and
specifications. Where the construction project involves more than one
contractor, the GENERAL CONTRACTOR could be the party responsible for managing
the project on behalf of the owner or operator. In some cases, the owner or
operator may be the GENERAL CONTRACTOR. In these cases, the owner may contract
with an individual as the operator who would become the co-permittee.
   GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE. A wide array of practices at multiple scales that
manage wet weather and that maintains or restores natural hydrology by
infiltrating, evapotranspiring, or harvesting and using storm water. On a
regional scale, GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE is the preservation or restoration of
natural landscape features, such as forests, floodplains, and wetlands, coupled
with policies that reduce overall imperviousness in a watershed. On a local
scale, GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE consists of site and neighborhood-specific
practices, such as bioretention, trees, green roofs, permeable pavements, and
cisterns.
   IMPERVIOUS SURFACE. A constructed hard surface that either prevents or
retards the entry of water into the soil and causes water to run off the
surface in greater quantities and at an increased rate of flow than prior to
development. Examples include rooftops, sidewalks, patios, driveways, parking
lots, storage areas, and concrete, asphalt, or gravel roads.
   LAND DISTURBANCE. Any activity that result in a change or alteration in the
existing ground cover (both vegetative and non- vegetative) and/or the existing
soil topography. LAND DISTURBING ACTIVITIES include, but are not limited to,
development, redevelopment, demolition, construction, reconstruction, clearing,

§ 53.10 SITE DESIGN AND MIDS CALCULATOR.
   (A)   Site design process.
      (1)   Better site design. Whenever possible, new development projects
shall be designed using the better site design techniques of the current
version of the state’s storm water manual (available at http://
stormwater.pca.state.mn.us/index.php/Better_site_design). Better site design
involves techniques applied early in the design process to preserve natural
areas, reduce impervious cover, distribute runoff, and use pervious areas to
effectively treat storm water runoff. Site design should address open space
protection, impervious cover minimization, and runoff distribution,
minimization, and utilization through considerations as follows.
         (a)   Open space protection and restoration.
            1.   Conservation of existing natural areas (upland and wetland);
            2.   Reforestation;
            3.   Re-establishment of prairies;
            4.   Restoration of wetlands;
            5.   Establishment or protection of stream, shoreline, and wetland
buffers; and
            6.   Re-establishment of native vegetation into the landscape.
         (b)   Reduction of impervious cover.
            1.   Reduce new impervious surfaces by redeveloping existing sites
and reuse of existing roadways, trails, and the like;
            2.   Minimize street width, parking space size, driveway length,
and sidewalk width; and
            3.   Reduce impervious surface footprint (e.g., two story
buildings, parking ramp).
         (c)   Distribution and minimization of runoff.
            1.   Utilize vegetated areas for storm water treatment (e.g.,
parking lot islands, vegetated areas along property boundaries, front and rear
yards, building landscaping);
            2.   Direct impervious surface runoff to vegetated areas or to
designed treatment areas (roofs, parking, and driveways drain to pervious
areas, not directly to storm sewer or other conveyances);
            3.   Encourage infiltration and soil storage of runoff through
grass channels, soil compost amendment, vegetated swales, rain gardens, and the
like; and
            4.   Plant vegetation that does not require irrigation beyond
natural rainfall and runoff from the site.
         (d)   Runoff utilization. Capture and store runoff for irrigation use
in areas where irrigation is necessary.
      (2)   Storm water criteria. The following general criteria shall be
incorporated in site design for storm water runoff to protect surface and
ground water and other natural resources by maintaining pre-development
hydrological conditions:
         (a)   Reduce impacts on water;
         (b)   Protect soils;
         (c)   Preserve vegetation;
         (d)   Decrease runoff volume;
         (e)   Decrease erosion and sedimentation and channel erosion;
         (f)   Decrease flow frequency, duration, and peak runoff rates;
         (g)   Increase infiltration (ground water recharge);
         (h)   Maintain existing flow patterns;
         (i)   Reduce peak flows; and
         (j)   Store storm water runoff on-site.
      (3)   Erosion and sediment control criteria. The following general
criteria shall be incorporated in site design for erosion and sediment control:
         (a)   Minimize disturbance of natural soil cover and vegetation;
         (b)   Minimize, in area and duration, exposed soil and unstable soil
conditions;
         (c)   Protect receiving water bodies, wetlands, and storm sewer
inlets;
         (d)   Protect adjacent properties from sediment deposition;
         (e)   Minimize off-site sediment transport on trucks and equipment;
         (f)   Minimize work in and adjacent to water bodies and wetlands;
         (g)   Maintain stable slopes;
         (h)   Avoid steep slopes and the need for high cuts and fills;
         (i)   Minimize disturbance to the surrounding soils, root systems, and
trunks of trees adjacent to site activity that are intended to be left
standing; and
         (j)   Minimize the compaction of site soils.
   (B)   MIDS calculator. Final site design and choice of permanent storm water
volume reduction practices shall be based on outcomes of the MIDS calculator
(or other model that shows the performance goal can be met) and shall meet the
performance goals in §
53.11. The MIDS calculator is available at http://stormwater.pca.state.mn.us/
index.php/Calculator.
(Ord. 2016-06, passed 5-23-2016)
§ 53.11 STORM WATER VOLUME REDUCTION PERFORMANCE GOALS.
   (A)   Any applicant for a permit resulting in site disturbance that creates
6,000 square feet of new impervious surface or fully reconstructs one or more
acre of impervious surface must meet all of the following storm water
performance goals.
      (1)   New development volume control. For new, nonlinear developments on
sites without restrictions, storm water runoff volumes will be controlled and
the post-construction runoff volume shall be retained on site for one and one-
tenth inches of runoff from all impervious surfaces on the site.
      (2)   Redevelopment volume control. Nonlinear redevelopment projects on
sites without restrictions that create or fully reconstruct impervious surfaces
shall capture and retain on site one and one-tenth inches of runoff from the
new and/or fully reconstructed impervious surfaces.
      (3)   Linear development volume control.
         (a)   Linear projects on sites without restrictions that create new
and/or fully reconstructed impervious surfaces, shall capture and retain the
larger of the following:
            1.   Fifty-five hundredths of an inch of runoff from the new and
fully reconstructed impervious surfaces on the site; or
            2.   One and one-tenth inches of runoff from the net increase in
impervious area on the site.
         (b)   Mill and overlay and other resurfacing activities are not
considered fully reconstructed.
   (B)   Sites with restrictions (as found in the MIDS design sequence
flowchart).
      (1)   If a site has restrictions where infiltration is not feasible or
advised as determined by the applicant and agreed to by the city or as
determined by the city, the applicant shall follow one of the flexible
treatment options (summarized in the design sequence flow chart in Appendix H).

IMAGES/0-0-0-1544.png]
 
      (2)   Applicant shall attempt to fully comply with the appropriate
performance goals described above. Options considered and presented shall
examine the merits of relocating project elements to address varying soil
conditions and other constraints across the site. If full compliance is not
possible due to any of the factors listed below, the applicant shall document
the reason. If site constraints or restrictions limit the full treatment goal,
the following flexible treatment options shall be used: applicant shall
document the flexible treatment options sequence starting with Alternative #1.
If Alternative #1 cannot be met, then Alternative #2 shall be analyzed.
Applicants must document the specific reasons why Alternative # 1 cannot be met
based on the factors listed below. If Alternative #2 cannot be met, then
Alternative #3 shall be met. Applicants must document the specific reasons why
Alternative #2 cannot be met based on the factors listed below. When all of the
conditions are fulfilled within an alternative, this sequence is completed.
      (3)   Volume reduction techniques considered shall include infiltration,
reuse, and rainwater harvesting, and canopy interception and evapotranspiration
and/or additional techniques included in the MIDS calculator and the state’s
Storm Water Manual. Higher priority shall be given to BMPs that include volume
reduction. Secondary preference is to employ filtration techniques, followed by
rate control BMPs.
      (4)   Factors to be considered for each alternative will include:
         (a)   Shallow bedrock;
         (b)   High ground water;
         (c)   Hotspots or contaminated soils;
         (d)   Drinking water source management areas or within 200 feet of
drinking water well;
         (e)   Zoning, setbacks, or other land use requirements; and
         (f)   Poor soils (infiltration rates that are too low or too high,
problematic urban soils).
   (C)   Alternative #1: Applicant shall attempt to comply with and document
the following conditions.
      (1)   Achieve at least fifty-five hundredths volume reduction from all
impervious surfaces if the site is new development, or from the new and/or
fully reconstructed impervious surfaces for a redevelopment site.
      (2)   Remove 75% of the annual TP load from all impervious surfaces if
the site is new development or from the new and/or fully reconstructed
impervious surfaces for a redevelopment site.
      (3)   Options considered and presented shall examine the merits of
relocating project elements to address varying soil conditions and other
constraints across the site.
   (D)   Alternative #2: Applicant shall attempt to comply with and document
the following conditions.
      (1)   Achieve volume reduction to the maximum extent practicable.
      (2)   Remove 60% of the annual TP load from all impervious surfaces if
the site is new development or from the new and/or fully reconstructed
impervious surfaces for a redevelopment site.
      (3)   Options considered and presented shall examine the merits of
relocating project elements to address varying soil conditions and other
constraints across the site.
   (E)   Alternative #3: Off-site treatment. Mitigation equivalent to the
performance of one and one-tenth inches of volume reduction for new development
or redevelopment as described above in this section, including banking or cash,
can be performed off-site to protect the receiving water body. Off-site
treatment shall be achieved in areas selected in the following order of
preference:
      (1)   Locations that yield benefits to the same receiving water that
receives runoff from the original construction activity;
      (2)   Locations within the same Department of Natural Resource (DNR)
catchment area as the original construction activity;
      (3)   Locations within the next adjacent DNR catchment area upstream; and
      (4)   Locations anywhere within the city’s jurisdiction.
   (F)   The MIDS design sequence flowchart can be found in the state’s Storm

§ 53.14 INSPECTIONS AND MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   Inspections and record keeping.
      (1)   Applicant responsibilities. The applicant is responsible for
inspections and record keeping during and after construction for all privately-
owned storm water treatment practices on the site.
      (2)   City inspections. The city reserves the right to conduct
inspections on a regular basis to ensure that both temporary and permanent
storm water management and erosion and sediment control measures are properly
installed and maintained prior to construction, during construction, and at the
completion of the project city inspections may occur at any time, including:
         (a)   Before any land disturbing activity begins;
         (b)   Before or during the installation of permanent storm water
treatment systems;
         (c)   At the time of footing inspections;
         (d)   At the completion of the project; and
         (e)   Prior to the release of financial securities.
   (B)   Right of entry and inspection.
      (1)   The issuance of a permit constitutes a right-of-entry for the city
and/or its authorized representatives to enter upon the construction site.
      (2)   The applicant shall allow the city and/or its authorized
representatives, upon presentation of credentials, to:
         (a)   Enter upon the permitted site for the purpose of obtaining
information, examining records, and conducting investigations or surveys;

   (D)   Enforcement tools/stop-work orders. The city reserve the right to
issue construction stop-work orders when cooperation on inspections is withheld
or when a violation has been identified that needs immediate attention to
protect human health and/or the environment. The following example highlights a
scenario on a site where a stop-work order could be utilized. If storm water
and/or erosion and sediment control management measures malfunction and breach
the perimeter of the site, enter streets, other public areas, or water bodies,
the city should assess the need for issuing a stop-work order. The applicant
shall immediately develop a cleanup and restoration plan, obtain the right-of-
way from the adjoining property owner if necessary, and implement the cleanup
and restoration plan within 48 hours. If in the discretion of the city, the
applicant does not repair the damage caused by the storm water runoff, the city
can complete the remedial work required and charge the cost to the applicant.
If payment is not made within 30 days, payment will be made from the
applicant’s financial securities. An inspection by the city must follow before
the construction project work can resume.
      (1)   Construction stop-work order. The city may issue construction stop-
work orders until storm water management measures meet specifications and the
applicant repairs any damage caused by storm water runoff. An inspection by the
city must verify the storm water management measures meet the specifications
before the construction project work can resume.
      (2)   Other actions to ensure compliance. The city may take any
combination of the following actions in the event of a failure by applicant to
meet the terms of this chapter:

         (c)   Conduct remedial or corrective action on the development site or
adjacent site affected by the failure;
         (d)   Charge applicant for all costs associated with correcting the
failure or remediating damage from the failure, if payment is not made within
30 days, payment will be made from the applicant’s financial securities; and
         (e)   Bring other actions against the applicant to recover costs of
remediation or meeting the terms of this chapter.
   (E)   Long term inspection and maintenance of storm water facilities.
      (1)   Private storm water facilities.
         (a)   Maintenance plan required. No private storm water facilities may
be approved unless a maintenance plan is provided that defines who will conduct
the maintenance, the type of maintenance necessary to ensure effective
performance, and the maintenance intervals. At a minimum, all private storm
water facilities shall be inspected annually and maintained in proper condition
consistent with the performance goals for which they were originally designed.
         (b)   Facility access. Access to all storm water facilities must be
inspected annually and maintained as necessary. The applicant shall obtain all
necessary easements or other property interests to allow access to the
facilities for inspection or maintenance for both the responsible party and the
city.

action. The city shall also take every reasonable action possible to contact
and direct the applicant to take any necessary action. Any cost to the city may
be recovered from the applicant’s financial security. In the absence of

§ 53.16 ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS.
   The city shall notify the permit holder of the failure of the permit’s
measures.
   (A)   Initial contact .The initial contact will be to the party or parties
listed on the application and/or the SWPPP as contacts. Except during an
emergency action, 48 hours after notification by the city or 72 hours after the
failure of erosion and sediment control measures, whichever is less, the city,
at its discretion, may begin corrective work. Such notification should be in
writing, but if it is verbal, a written notification should follow as quickly
as practical. If after making a good faith effort to notify the responsible
party or parties, the city has been unable to establish contact, the city may
proceed with corrective work. There are conditions when time is of the essence
in controlling erosion. During such a condition the city may take immediate
action and then notify the applicant as soon as possible.
   (B)   Erosion off-site. If erosion breaches the perimeter of the site, the
applicant shall immediately develop a cleanup and restoration plan, obtain the
right-of-entry from the adjoining property owner, and implement the cleanup and
restoration plan within 48 hours of obtaining the adjoining property owner’s
permission. Unless written approval is received from the city, corrective
action shall be initiated within seven days after failure of erosion control
measures. If in the discretion of the city, the permit holder does not repair
the damage caused by the erosion, the city may undertake the remedial work
required. Applicant shall obtain all required permits and adhere to all
applicable local, state, and federal regulations when restoring the site.
   (C)   Erosion into streets, wetlands, or water bodies. If eroded soils,
including tracked soils from construction activities, enter or appear likely to
enter streets, wetlands, or other water bodies, cleanup and repair shall be
immediate. The applicant shall provide all traffic control and flagging
required to protect the traveling public during the cleanup operations.
   (D)   Failure to do corrective work. When an applicant fails to conform to
any provision of this policy within the time stipulated, the city may take the
following actions:
      (1)   Stop-work order. Issue a stop-work order, withhold the scheduling
of inspections, and/or the issuance of a certificate of occupancy;
      (2)   Permit revocation. Revoke any permit issued by the city to the
applicant for the site in question or any other of the applicant’s sites within
the city’s jurisdiction; and/or
      (3)   Correction by city. Correct the deficiency or hire a contractor to
correct the deficiency.
         (a)   The applicant will be required to reimburse the city for all
costs incurred in correcting storm water pollution control deficiencies. If
payment is not made within 30 days after costs are incurred by the city,
payment will be made from the applicant’s financial securities as described in
§
53.13.
         (b)   If there is an insufficient financial amount in the applicant’s
financial securities as described in §
53.13, the city may assess the remaining amount against the property. As a
condition of the permit, the owner shall waive notice of any assessment hearing
to be conducted by the city, concur that the benefit to the property exceeds
the amount of the proposed assessment, and waive all rights under M.S. Ch. 429,
as it may be amended from time to time, to challenge the amount or validity of
the assessment.

or less in length, provided that this requirement shall not apply to any
portion of a park which has been designated by the Administrator as an area
where dogs are not required to be restrained by a leash.
   (B)   Dogs which damage property. No owner of a dog shall permit the dog to
damage any lawn, garden, or other private or public property, or to defecate on
public property or private property, without the consent of the owner or
possessor of the property. It shall be the duty of each owner of a dog to
remove any feces left by such dog and to dispose of such feces in a sanitary
manner. It shall also be the duty of each owner of a dog when such dog is off
the owner’s premises to have in possession a device or equipment for the
picking up and removal of dog feces; at a minimum, this equipment must include
at least two bags. The provisions of this division (B) shall not apply to a
guide dog accompanying a blind person or to a dog when used in police or rescue
activities by or with the permission of the city. This division (B) shall not
be construed, by implication or otherwise, to allow dogs to be where they are
otherwise prohibited by this code.
   (C)   Picketing. No dog shall be picketed in such a manner as to create a
nuisance by reason of odor or unreasonably disturbing the peace and quiet, as
defined in the city code, or which allows it to occupy any area within 20 feet
of a property line.

pet containment systems installed within any public right-of-way or public
easement shall be owned and maintained by the owner of the system. The Engineer
may direct the removal or relocation of an electronic pet containment system
from any public right-of-way or public easement at the sole cost and expense of
the owner of the electronic pet containment system if the Engineer determines
the system interferes with the public’s use of the right-of-way or easement.
The cost of any repair to electronic pet containment systems which are damaged
due to the public’s use of a public right-of-way or public easement shall be
borne solely by the owner of the system.
   (E)   Clean yard and enclosure. A dog owner shall regularly clean any yard
occupied by the dog, or dog enclosure occupied by the dog, whether now existing
or hereafter constructed, and any area in which the dog has been picketed, and
shall not permit feces or food scraps to remain for more than 24 hours.
   (F)   Dangerous dogs.
      (1)   The provisions of M.S. Ch. 347 and M.S. §§ 343.20 to 343.40, as

adopted as part of this section. The persons authorized to enforce this section
shall also enforce the provisions of M.S. Ch. 347 and M.S. §§ 343.20 to 343.40,
as they may be amended from time to time. A violation of the provisions of M.S.
Ch. 347 and M.S. §§ 343.20 to 343.40, as they may be amended from time to time,
shall also be a violation of this section. Incorporation of said statutes shall
not be a release by the city of any powers or authority which it has without
such incorporation.
      (2)   The Animal Control Officer may declare a dog to be a potentially
dangerous dog as defined by M.S. § 347.50, as it may be amended from time to

Officer may require that a potentially dangerous dog be confined or restrained
when on the owner’s property and restrained and muzzled when off the owner’s
property.
      (3)   The Police Chief may declare a dangerous dog under M.S. Ch. 347, as
it may be amended from time to time. Said declaration may be appealed to the
City Council for a public hearing.

in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative
officer in the interpretation and enforcement of this section, may appeal to
the City Council by filing a written appeal with the City Clerk-Treasurer
within ten days after the date of such order, requirement, decision, or
determination. The appeal shall fully state the order to be appealed and the
relevant facts of the matter.
      (5)   The City Council shall hear such appeal within 30 days of receipt.
Mailed notice of such hearing shall be given at least ten days prior to the

within 250 feet of the property where such dog is usually kept. The Council
shall make its decision at such hearing or any continuation thereof.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 91.01 ASSESSABLE CURRENT SERVICES.
   (A)   Definition. For the purpose of this section, the following definition
shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning.
      CURRENT SERVICE. Shall mean one or more of the following: snow, ice, or
rubbish removal from sidewalks; weed elimination from street grass plots
adjacent to sidewalks or from private property; removal or elimination of
public health or safety hazards from private property, excluding any hazardous
building included in M.S. §§ 463.15 through 463.26, as they may amended from
time to time; installation or repair of water service lines; street sprinkling,
street flushing, light street oiling, or other dust treatment of streets;
repair of sidewalks and alleys; trimming and care of trees and removal of
unsound and insect-infected trees from the public streets or private property;
and the operation of a street lighting system.
   (B)   Snow, ice, dirt and rubbish.
      (1)   Duty of owners and occupants. The owner and the occupant of any
property adjacent to a public sidewalk shall use diligence to keep the walk
safe for pedestrians. No owner or occupant shall allow snow, ice, dirt or
rubbish to remain on the walk longer than 24 hours after its deposit thereon.
Failure to comply with this section shall constitute a violation.
      (2)   Removal by city. The City Clerk or other person designated by the
City Council may cause removal from all public sidewalks all snow, ice, dirt
and rubbish as soon as possible beginning 24 hours after any matter has been
deposited thereon or after the snow has ceased to fall. The City Clerk or other
designated person shall keep a record showing the cost of removal adjacent to
each separate lot and parcel.
   (C)   Public health and safety hazards. When the city removes or eliminates
public health or safety hazards from private property under the following
provisions of this chapter, the administrative officer responsible for doing
the work shall keep a record of the cost of the removal or elimination against
each parcel of property affected and annually deliver that information to the
City Clerk.

and the driver shall be jointly and severally liable for any such damage. Any
person who willfully acts or fails to exercise due care and by that act damages
any public property shall be liable for the amount thereof, which amount shall

Penalty, see §
91.99
§ 91.02 TREE DISEASES AND SHADE TREE PEST CONTROL.
   (A)   Declaration of policy. The health of the trees in the city is
threatened by shade tree pests, and the loss or ill health of trees growing
upon public and private property substantially depreciates the value of
property within the city and impairs the safety, good order, general welfare
and convenience of the public. In addition to and in accordance with M.S. §§
89.001, 89.01 and 89.51 through 89.64, as those sections may be amended from
time to time, the provisions of this section are adopted to attempt to control
and prevent the spread of these shade tree pests.
   (B)   Jurisdiction. The city shall have control of all street trees, shrubs,
and other plantings now or hereafter in any street, park, public right-of-way
or easement, or other public place within the city limits, and shall have the
power to plant, care for, maintain, remove, and replace such trees, shrubs and
other plantings.
   (C)   Declaration of a shade tree pest.   The Council may declare any
vertebrate or invertebrate animal,   plant pathogen, or plant threatening to
cause significant damage to a shade tree or community forest as defined by M.S.
§ 89.001, as it may be amended from time to time, to be a shade tree pest and
prescribe control measures to effectively eradicate, control or manage the
shade tree pest including necessary timelines for action.
   (D)   Public nuisances declared. A shade tree pest declared by Council
occurring within a declared control zone is a public nuisance.
   (E)   Shade tree pest nuisances are unlawful. It is unlawful for any person
to permit any public nuisance as defined in this section to remain on any
premises the person owns or controls within the city. The nuisance may be
abated as provided in this section.
   (F)   Definition of control areas. Upon declaring a shade tree pest, the
Council may define one or more locations within the geographic boundaries of
the city to be within a shade tree pest control area provided such locations
are characterized by biologic, composition, environmental and size factors
favorable to successful application of the control measures prescribed by
Council.
   (G)   Tree Inspector. The Council may appoint a Tree Inspector to coordinate
the activities of the city relating to the control and prevention of damage by
shade tree pests. The Tree Inspector will recommend to the Council the details
of any program for the declaration, control and prevention of shade tree pests.
The Tree Inspector is authorized to enforce or cause to be enforced the tasks
incident to such a program adopted by the Council. The term TREE INSPECTOR
includes any person designated by Council or the Tree Inspector to carry out
activities authorized in this section.
   (H)   Abatement of shade tree pest nuisances.
      (1)   In abating a nuisance declared by ordinance under divisions (B) and
(C), the organism, condition or plant and any tree, wood or material identified
as injurious to the health of shade trees shall be removed or effectively
treated so as to destroy and prevent as fully as possible the spread of the
shade tree pest. Such abatement procedures shall be carried out in accordance
with the control measures and areas prescribed by ordinance according to
divisions (C) and (K) and (O) .
      (2)   In addition, should the appropriate abatement procedure be removal
and the tree(s) and/or hedge(s) be within the limits of a highway in a rural
area within the city’s jurisdiction, M.S. § 160.22, as it may be amended from
time to time, shall be complied with as necessary.
   (I)   Reporting discovery of shade tree pest. Any owner or occupier of land
or any person engaged in tree trimming or removal who becomes aware of the
existence of public nuisance caused by a shade tree pest as defined under
division (C) shall report the same to the city.
   (J)   Registration of tree care firms. Any person, firm or corporation that
provides tree care, tree trimming or removal of trees, limbs, branches, brush,
or shrubs for hire must be registered with the Minnesota Commissioner of
Agriculture under M.S. § 18G.07, as it may be amended from time to time.
   (K)   Inspection and application of control measures.
      (1)   The Tree Inspector is authorized to inspect premises and places
within the city to determine whether shade tree pests exist thereon and to
investigate all reported incidents of shade tree pests. The Tree Inspector is
authorized to take all reasonable measures to prevent the maintenance of public
nuisances and may enforce the provisions relating to abatement in this section.
Diagnosis of shade tree pests may be by the presence of commonly recognized
symptoms or by tests as may be recommended by the Commissioner of the Minnesota
Department of Agriculture or the Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of
Natural Resources or other reliable means.
      (2)   Except in situations of imminent danger to human life and safety,
the Tree Inspector shall not enter private property for the purpose of
inspecting or preventing maintenance of public nuisances without the permission
of the owner, resident or other person in control of the property, unless the
Tree Inspector has obtained a warrant or order from a court of competent
jurisdiction authorizing the entry.
      (3)   No person, firm, or corporation shall interfere with the Tree
Inspector acting under his or her authority while engaged in activities
authorized by this section.
   (L)   Standard abatement procedure. Except as provided in divisions (M) and
(O), whenever a Tree Inspector determines with reasonable certainty that a
public nuisance as described by this section is being maintained or exists on
premises in the city, the Tree Inspector is authorized to abate a public
nuisance according to the following procedure.
      (1)   The Tree Inspector will notify in writing the owner of record or
occupant of the premises of such fact and order that the nuisance be terminated
or abated. The notice may be given in person or by mail. Failure of any party
to receive the mail does not invalidate the service of the notice. A copy of
the notice shall be filed with the City Clerk.
      (2)   The notice of abatement shall state that unless the public nuisance
is abated by the owner or occupant, it will be abated by the city at the
expense of the owner or occupant. The notice shall specify the control measures
to be taken to abate the nuisance, and provide a reasonable amount of time to
abate the nuisance. The notice will also state that the owner or occupant has
the right to appeal the determination that a public nuisance exists by
submitting a request in writing to the City Clerk within seven days after
service of the notice, or before the date by which abatement must be completed,
whichever comes first.
      (3)   If no timely appeal is submitted, and the notice of abatement and
its prescribed control measures are not complied with within the time provided
by the notice or any additional time granted, the Tree Inspector or designated
person shall have the authority to obtain permission or an administrative
search warrant, enter the property and carry out abatement in accordance with
the notice of abatement.
   (M)   High cost abatement. If the Tree Inspector determines that the cost of
abating a nuisance will exceed $5,000 based on a reasonable, good faith
estimate, the written notice referred to in division (L) must provide that if
the nuisance is not abated within the reasonable amount of time provided, the
matter will be referred to the City Council for a hearing. The date, time, and
location of the hearing must be provided in the notice.
   (N)   Appeal procedure. If the City Clerk receives a written request for a
hearing on the question of whether a public nuisance in fact exists, the City
Council shall hold a hearing within seven calendar days following receipt by
the Clerk of the written request. At least three days notice shall be given to
the individual who made the written request for the hearing. The Council may
modify the abatement notice or extend the time by which abatement must be
completed. Each owner, agent of the owner, occupant and lienholder of the
subject property or properties in attendance, if any, shall be given the
opportunity to present evidence at the hearing. After holding the hearing, the
City Council may issue an order requiring abatement of the nuisance.
   (O)   Abatement procedure in event of imminent danger.
      (1) If the Tree Inspector determines that the danger of infestation to
other shade trees is imminent and delay in control measures may put public
health, safety or welfare in immediate danger, the Tree Inspector may provide
for abatement without following (L) or (M). The Tree Inspector must reasonably
attempt to notify the owner or occupant of the affected property of the
intended action and the right to appeal the abatement and any cost recovery at
the next regularly scheduled City Council meeting.
      (2)   Immediate Abatement. Nothing in this section shall prevent the
city, without notice or other process, from immediately abating any condition
which poses an imminent and serious hazard to human life or safety.
   (P)   Recovery of cost of abatement; liability and assessment.
      (1)   The owner of premises on which a nuisance has been abated by the
city shall be personally liable for the cost to the city of the abatement,
including administrative costs. As soon as the work has been completed and the
cost determined, the City Clerk or other official shall prepare a bill for the
cost and mail it to the owner. Thereupon the amount shall be immediately due
and payable at the office of the City Clerk.
      (2)   After notice and hearing as provided in M.S. § 429.061, as it may
be amended from time to time, the City Clerk may list the total unpaid charges
along with all other charges as well as other charges for current services to
be assessed under M.S. § 429.101, as it may be amended from time to time,
against each separate lot or parcel to which the charges are attributable. The
City Council may then certify the charges against the property under that
statute and other pertinent statutes to the County Auditor for collection along
with current taxes the following year or in annual installments as the City
Council may determine in each case.
   (Q)   Penalty.
      (1)   Any person, firm, or corporation who violates any provision of this
section shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor. The penalty which
may be imposed for any crime which is a misdemeanor under this section,
including Minnesota Statutes specifically adopted by reference, shall be a
sentence of not more than 90 days or a fine of not more than $1,000, or both.
      (2)   Upon conviction of a misdemeanor, the costs of prosecution may be
added. A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during which
a violation occurs or continues.
      (3)   The failure of any officer or employee of the city to perform any
official duty imposed by this section shall not subject the officer or employee
to the penalty imposed for a violation.
      (4)   In addition to any penalties provided for in this section, if any
person, firm or corporation fails to comply with any provision of this section,
the City Council or any official designated by it, may institute appropriate
proceedings at law or at equity to restrain, correct or abate the violation.
   (R)   Declared shade tree pests, control measures and control areas.
      (1)   Oak Wilt. Oak Wilt is declared a shade tree pest and is defined as
any living or dead tree, log, firewood, limb, branch, stump or other portion of
a tree from any species of the genus Quercus existing within the control area
defined that has bark attached and that exceeds three inches in diameter or ten
inches in circumference and contains to any degree any spore or reproductive
structures of the fungus Ceratocystis fagacearum. Control measures prescribed
for abating Oak Wilt Disease are:
         (a)   Installation of a root graft barrier. A root graft barrier can
be ordered installed to prevent the underground spread of Oak Wilt Disease. The
city will mark the location of the root graft
barrier. The barrier disrupts transmission of the fungus within the shared
vascular systems of root grafted trees. The barrier is created by excavating or
vibratory plowing a line at least 42 inches deep between any oak tree infected
with Oak Wilt Disease and each nearby and apparently healthy oak tree within 50
feet of the infected tree.
         (b)   Removal and disposal of trees on property zoned for residential
and commercial use. On property that is zoned residential and commercial the
city may mark for removal trees that have the potential to produce spores of
the fungus Ceratocvstis fagacearum. After, and in no case before the
installation of the root graft barrier and no later than May 1 of the year
following infection all marked trees must be felled. The stump from such felled
trees must not extend more than three inches above the ground or, if taller,
must be completely debarked. If, however, after the city prescribes the
location for a root graft barrier, the city determines that installation of the
barrier is impossible because of the presence of pavement or obstructions such
as a septic system or utility line, the city may mark for removal all oak trees
whether living or dead, infected or not and located between an infected tree
and the marked barrier location. These marked trees must be felled and disposed
of no later than May 1 of the year following infection. The stump from such
felled trees must not extend more than three inches above the ground or, if
taller, must be completely debarked.
         (c)   Removal and disposal of trees on all other property. On all
other property the city may mark for removal all oak trees whether living or
dead, infected or not and located between an infected tree and the marked
barrier location. These marked trees must be felled and disposed of no later
than May 1 of the year following infection. The stump from such felled trees
must not extend more than three inches above the ground or, if taller, must be
completely debarked.
         (d)   Wood disposal. All wood more than three inches in diameter or
ten inches in circumference from such felled trees must be disposed of by
burying or debarking or chipping or sawing into wane-free lumber or by
splitting into firewood, stacking the firewood and immediately covering the
woodpile with unbroken 4-mil or thicker plastic sheeting that is sealed into
the ground until October 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in
which the tree was felled or by burning before May 1 of the year following
infection. Wood chips from infected trees may be stockpiled or immediately used
in the landscape.
         (e)   The control area for Oak Wilt Disease is defined as all lands
within the boundaries of the city.
      (2)   Emerald Ash Borer. Emerald Ash Borer is declared a shade tree pest
and is defined as an insect that attacks and kills ash trees. The adults are
small, iridescent green beetles that live outside of trees during the summer
months. The larvae are grub or worm-like and live underneath the bark of ash
trees.
         (a)   Control measures prescribed for abating Emerald Ash Borer are
those provided in the document, Guidelines to Slow the Growth and Spread of
Emerald Ash Borer from the Minnesota Department of Agriculture.
         (b)   Definition of control areas. The control area for Emerald Ash
Borer is defined as all lands within the boundaries of the city.
      (3)   Dutch Elm Disease. Dutch Elm Disease is declared a shade tree pest
and is defined as a disease of elm trees caused by the fungus Ophiostoma ulmi
or Ophiostoma novo-ulmi, and includes any living or dead tree, log, firewood,
limb, branch, stump or other portion of a tree from any species of the genus
Ulmus existing within the control area defined that has bark attached and that
exceeds three inches in diameter or ten inches in circumference and could
contain bark beetles or any spore or reproductive structures of the fungus
Ophiostoma ulmi or Ophiostoma novo-ulmi.
         (a)   Control measures prescribed for abating Dutch Elm Disease are:
            1.   Use of fungicide. Fungicides may be effective in preventing
Dutch elm disease when injected into living trees that do not already show
symptoms of Dutch elm disease. Fungicide injections on private lands are
optional and, if performed, are at the landowner’s expense.
            2.   Removal and disposal of trees. Prompt removal of diseased
trees or branches reduces breeding sites for elm bark beetles and eliminates
the source of Dutch elm disease fungus. Trees that wilt before July 15 must be
removed within 20 days of detection [alternative: 30 days]. Trees that wilt
after July 15 must be removed by April 1 of the following year. Diseased trees
not promptly removed will be removed by the city at the landowner's expense.
Wood may be retained for use as firewood or sawlogs if it is de-barked or
covered from April 15 to October 15 with 4 mil plastic. The edges of the cover
must be buried or sealed to the ground.
         (b)   Definition of control areas. The control area for Dutch Elm
Disease is defined as all lands within the boundaries of the city.

provisions relating to nuisances. Any peace officer or designated person shall
have the power to inspect private premises and take all reasonable precautions
to prevent the commission and maintenance of public nuisances. Except in
emergency situations of imminent danger to human life and safety, no police
officer or designated person shall enter private property for the purpose of
inspecting or preventing public nuisances without the permission of the owner,
resident or other person in control of the property, unless the officer or
person designated has obtained a warrant or order from a court of competent
jurisdiction authorizing the entry.
§ 91.23 ABATEMENT.
   (A)   Notice. Written notice of violation; notice of the time, date, place
and subject of any hearing before the City Council; notice of City Council
order; and notice of motion for summary enforcement hearing shall be given as
set forth in this section.
      (1)   Notice of violation. Written notice of violation shall be served by
a peace officer or designated person on the owner of record or occupant of the
premises either in person or by certified or registered mail. If the premises
is not occupied, the owner of record is unknown, or the owner of record or
occupant refuses to accept notice of violation, notice of violation shall be
served by posting it on the premises.
      (2)   Notice of City Council hearing. Written notice of any City Council
hearing to determine or abate a nuisance shall be served on the owner of record
and occupant of the premises either in person or by certified or registered
mail. If the premises is not occupied, the owner of record is unknown, or the
owner of record or occupant refuses to accept notice of the City Council
hearing, notice of City Council hearing shall be served by posting it on the
premises.
      (3)   Notice of City Council order. Except for those cases determined by
the city to require summary enforcement, written notice of any City Council
order shall be made as provided in M.S. § 463.17 (Hazardous and Substandard
Building Act), as it may be amended from time to time.
      (4)   Notice of motion for summary enforcement. Written notice of any
motion for summary enforcement shall be made as provided for in M.S. § 463.17
(Hazardous and Substandard Building Act), as it may be amended from time to
time.
   (B)   Procedure. Whenever a peace officer or designated person determines
that a public nuisance is being maintained or exists on the premises in the
city, the officer or person designated may notify in writing the owner of
record or occupant of the premises of such fact and order that the nuisance be
terminated or abated. The notice of violation shall specify the steps to be
taken to abate the nuisance and the time within which the nuisance is to be
abated. If the notice of violation is not complied with within the time
specified, the officer or designated person shall report that fact forthwith to
the City Council. Thereafter, the City Council may, after notice to the owner
or occupant and an opportunity to be heard, determine that the condition
identified in the notice of violation is a nuisance and further order that if
the nuisance is not abated within the time prescribed by the City Council, the
city may seek injunctive relief by serving a copy of the City Council order and
notice of motion for summary enforcement or obtain an administrative search and
seizure warrant and abate the nuisance.
   (C)   Emergency procedure; summary enforcement. In cases of emergency, where
delay in abatement required to complete the notice and procedure requirements
set forth in divisions (A) and (B) of this section will permit a continuing
nuisance to unreasonably endanger public health safety or welfare, the City
Council may order summary enforcement and abate the nuisance. To proceed with
summary enforcement, the officer or designated person shall determine that a
public nuisance exists or is being maintained on premises in the city and that
delay in abatement of the nuisance will unreasonably endanger public health,
safety or welfare. The officer or designated person shall notify in writing the
occupant or owner of the premises of the nature of the nuisance and of the
city’s intention to seek summary enforcement and the time and place of the City
Council meeting to consider the question of summary enforcement. The City
Council shall determine whether or not the condition identified in the notice
to the owner or occupant is a nuisance, whether public health, safety or
welfare will be unreasonably endangered by delay in abatement required to
complete the procedure set forth in division (A) of this section, and may order
that the nuisance be immediately terminated or abated. If the nuisance is not
immediately terminated or abated, the City Council may order summary
enforcement and abate the nuisance.
   (D)   Immediate abatement. Nothing in this section shall prevent the city,
without notice or other process, from immediately abating any condition which
poses an imminent and serious hazard to human life or safety.
Penalty, see §
91.99
§ 91.24 RECOVERY OF COST.
   (A)   Personal liability. The owner of premises on which a nuisance has been
abated by the city or a person who has caused a public nuisance on a property
not owned by that person shall be personally liable for the cost to the city of
the abatement, including administrative costs. As soon as the work has been
completed and the cost determined, the City Clerk or other official shall
prepare a bill for the cost and mail it to the owner. Thereupon the amount
shall be immediately due and payable at the office of the City Clerk.
   (B)   Assessment. After notice and hearing as provided in M.S. § 429.061, as
it may be amended from time to time, if the nuisance is a public health or
safety hazard on private property, the accumulation of snow and ice on public
sidewalks, the growth of weeds on private property or outside the traveled
portion of streets, or unsound or insect-infected trees, the City Clerk shall,
on or before September 1 next following abatement of the nuisance, list the
total unpaid charges along with all other charges as well as other charges for
current services to be assessed under M.S. § 429.101, as it may be amended from
time to time against each separate lot or parcel to which the charges are
attributable. The City Council may then spread the charges against the property
under that statute and other pertinent statutes for certification to the County
Auditor and collection along with current taxes the following year or in annual
installments, not exceeding ten, as the City Council may determine in each
case.
Penalty, see §
91.99

unnecessarily disrupt the movement of other traffic within the area of the
event;
   (E)   The event is of the size or nature that requires the diversion of too
many law enforcement officers to properly police the event, site, and
contiguous areas that allowing the event would unreasonably deny law
enforcement protection to the remainder of the city and its residents;
   (F)   Another event permit application has already been approved to hold
another event at the same time and place requested by the applicant or so close
in time and place as to cause undue traffic congestion, or the city is unable

property, and the control of traffic; provided that such conditions shall not
unreasonably restrict the right of free speech.

      (1)   Alteration of the date(s), time(s), route, or location of the event
proposed;
      (2)   Elimination of an activity at the event which cannot be mitigated

under the following circumstances:
   (A)   The applicant or officer of the sponsoring organization signs a

burdensome that it would constitute an unreasonable burden on the right of
First Amendment expression;

verified statement that the insurance coverage required by this subchapter is
impossible to obtain; or
   (C)   The City Council determines that the insurance requirements are in

   Any permit issued pursuant to this subchapter may be summarily revoked by

public calamity, riot, or other emergency, the law enforcement officer
determines that the safety of the public or property requires such revocation.
The City Clerk-Treasurer may also summarily revoke any event permit issued
pursuant to this subchapter if he or she finds that the permit has been issued
based upon false information or when the permit holder exceeds the scope of the
permit. Notice of such action revoking a permit shall be delivered in writing

§ 110.01 STATE LAW ADOPTED.
   The provisions of M.S. Ch. 340A, as it may be amended from time to time,
with reference to the definition of terms, conditions of operation,
restrictions on consumption, provisions relating to sales, hours of sale, and
all other matters pertaining to the retail sale, distribution, and consumption
of intoxicating liquor and 3.2% malt liquor are hereby adopted by reference and
are made a part of this chapter as if set out in full. It is the intention of
the City Council that all future amendments to M.S. Ch. 340A, as it may be
amended from time to time, are hereby adopted by reference or referenced as if
they had been in existence at the time this chapter is adopted.
(Prior Code, § 10.1)
§ 110.02 CITY MAY BE MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN STATE LAW.
   The Council is authorized by the provisions of M.S. § 340A.509, as it may be
amended from time to time, to impose, and has imposed in this chapter,
additional restrictions on the sale and possession of alcoholic beverages
within its limits beyond those contained in M.S. Ch. 340A, as it may be amended
from time to time.
(Prior Code, § 10.2)
§ 110.03 DEFINITIONS.
   In addition to the definitions contained in M.S. § 340A.101, as it may be
amended from time to time, the following terms are defined for purposes of this
chapter:
   LIQUOR. As used in this chapter, without modification by the words
“intoxicating” or “3.2% malt” includes both intoxicating liquor and 3.2% malt
liquor.
   RESTAURANT. An eating facility, other than a hotel, under the control of a
single proprietor or manager, where meals are regularly prepared on the
premises, where full waitress/waiter table service is provided, where a
customer orders food from printed menus and where the main food course is
served and consumed while seated at a single location. To be a RESTAURANT as
defined by this section, an establishment shall have a license from the state
as required by M.S. § 157.16, as it may be amended from time to time, and meet
the definition of either a “small establishment”, “medium establishment”, or
“large establishment” as defined in M.S. § 157.16, Subd. 3d, as it may be
amended from time to time. An establishment which serves prepackaged food that
receives heat treatment and is served in the package or frozen pizza that is

this chapter unless it meets the definitions of a “small establishment”,
“medium establishment”, or “large establishment”.
(Prior Code, § 10.3)
§ 110.04 NUDITY ON THE PREMISES OF LICENSED ESTABLISHMENTS PROHIBITED.
   (A)   The City Council finds that it is in the best interests of the public
health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the city that nudity is
prohibited as provided in this section on the premises of any establishment
licensed under this chapter. This is to protect and assist the owners,
operators, and employees of the establishment, as well as patrons and the
public in general, from harm stemming from the physical immediacy and
combination of alcohol, nudity, and sex. The Council especially intends to
prevent any subliminal endorsement of sexual harassment or activities likely to
lead to the possibility of various criminal conduct, including prostitution,
sexual assault, and disorderly conduct. The Council also finds that the
prohibition of nudity on the premises of any establishment licensed under this
chapter, as set forth in this section, reflects the prevailing community
standards of the city.
   (B)   It is unlawful for any licensee to permit or allow any person or
persons on the licensed premises when the person does not have his or her
buttocks, anus, breasts, and genitals covered with a non-transparent material.

§ 110.05 CONSUMPTION IN PUBLIC PLACES.

chapter, in a municipal liquor dispensary if one exists in the city, or where
the consumption and display of liquor is lawfully permitted. Notwithstanding
the above, intoxicating liquor and 3.2% malt liquor may be consumed on a public
sidewalk if the liquor license includes the sidewalk as part of the premises
described on the liquor license and a sidewalk use permit under §
111.01 is obtained from the city.

location of the event; type of fund raising event (silent auction, raffle, or

§ 110.12 APPLICATION FOR LICENSE.
   (A)   Form. Every application for a license issued under this chapter shall
be on a form provided by the city. Every application shall state the name of
the applicant, the applicant’s age, representations as to the applicant’s
character, with references as the Council may require, the type of license
applied for, the business in connection with which the proposed license will
operate and its location, a description of the premises, whether the applicant
is owner and operator of the business, how long the applicant has been in that
business at that place, and other information as the Council may require from
time to time. An application for an on-sale intoxicating liquor license shall
be in the form prescribed by the Commissioner of Public Safety and shall also
contain the information required in this section. The form shall be verified
and filed with the city. No person shall make a false statement in an
application.
   (B)   Financial responsibility. Prior to the issuance of any license under
this chapter, the applicant shall demonstrate proof of financial responsibility
as defined in M.S. § 340A.409, as it may be amended from time to time, with
regard to liability under M.S. § 340A.801, as it may be amended from time to
time. This proof will be filed with the city and the Commissioner of Public
Safety. Any liability insurance policy filed as proof of financial
responsibility under this section shall conform to M.S. § 340A.409, as it may
be amended from time to time. Operation of a business, which is required to be
licensed by this chapter, without having on file with the city at all times
effective proof of financial responsibility is a cause for revocation of the
license.
(Prior Code, § 10.12)
§ 110.13 DESCRIPTION OF PREMISES.
   The application shall specifically describe the compact and contiguous
premises within which liquor may be dispensed and consumed. The description may

permit from the city pursuant to §
111.01.
(Prior Code, § 10.13) (Ord. 2018-03, passed - -)
§ 110.14 APPLICATION FOR RENEWAL.
   At least 90 days before a license issued under this chapter is to be
renewed, an application for renewal shall be filed with the city. The decision
whether or not to renew a license rests within the sound discretion of the
Council. No licensee has a right to have the license renewed.
(Prior Code, § 10.14)
§ 110.15 TRANSFER OF LICENSE.
   No license issued under this chapter may be transferred without the approval
of the Council. Any transfer of stock of a corporate licensee is deemed to be a
transfer of the license, and a transfer of stock without prior Council approval
is a ground for revocation of the license. An application to transfer a license
shall be treated the same as an application for a new license, and all of the
provisions of this code applying to applications for a license shall apply.
(Prior Code, § 10.15)
§ 110.16 INVESTIGATION.
   (A)   Preliminary background and financial investigation. On an initial
application for a license, on an application for transfer of a license and, in
the sound discretion of the Council that it is in the public interest to do so,
on an application for renewal of a license, the city shall conduct a
preliminary background and financial investigation of the applicant or it may
contract with the Commissioner of Public Safety for the investigation. The
applicant shall pay with the application an investigation fee of an amount as
set forth by City Council from time to time, which shall be in addition to any
license fee. If the cost of the preliminary investigation is less than an
amount as set forth by City Council from time to time, the unused balance shall
be returned to the applicant. The results of the preliminary investigation
shall be sent to the Commissioner of Public Safety if the application is for an
on-sale intoxicating liquor license or an on-sale wine license.
   (B)   Comprehensive background and financial investigation. If the results
of a preliminary investigation warrant, in the sound discretion of the Council,
a comprehensive background and financial investigation, the Council may either
conduct the investigation itself or contract with the Commissioner of Public
Safety for the investigation. The investigation fee for this comprehensive
background and financial investigation to be paid by the applicant shall be an
amount as set forth by City Council from time to time, less any amount paid for
the initial investigation if the investigation is to be conducted within the
state, and an amount as set forth by City Council from time to time, less any
amount paid for the initial investigation, if the investigation is required
outside the state. The unused balance of the fee shall be returned to the
applicant whether or not the application is denied. The fee shall be paid in
advance of any investigation and the amount actually expended on the
investigation shall not be refundable in the event the application is denied.
The results of the comprehensive investigation shall be sent to the
Commissioner of Public Safety if the application is for an on-sale intoxicating
liquor license or an on-sale wine license.
(Prior Code, § 10.16)
§ 110.17 HEARING AND ISSUANCE.
   The Council shall investigate all facts set out in the application and not
investigated in the preliminary or comprehensive background and financial
investigations. Opportunity shall be given to any person to be heard for or
against the granting of the license. After the investigation and hearing, the
Council shall, in its sound discretion, grant or deny the application. No
license shall become effective until the proof of financial security has been
approved by the Commissioner of Public Safety.

snow melt drainage patterns in the design of his or her proposed subdivision.
The subdivider shall be responsible to provide adequate drainage facilities for
his or her development and upstream properties.
   (B)   All subdivisions shall demonstrate provisions for adequate surface or
subsurface runoff of storm water and snow melt directed to natural drainage
ways.
   (C)   All natural drainage ways draining properties upstream from the
subject property shall be identified and preserved, and no structures shall be
less than one foot above the water level in the drainage way created by a storm
of a 100-year, 24-hour rain event. No filling of areas inundated by the 100-
year, 24-hour rain event shall be allowed.
   (D)   Additional runoff for a 100-year, 24-hour rain event from all streets
and building sites at build-out shall be accounted for and maintained within
the development.
   (E)   Natural or human-made storage areas shall be utilized where needed and
shall be designated by drainage and utility easement by the subdivider. All
storage areas shall be vegetated and designed to lower naturally after a storm.
   (F)   All drainage structures or improvements provided shall be sufficient
in size to pass a 100-year, 24-hour storm event through the natural drainage
way.

§ 151.10 DEDICATION TO THE PUBLIC STANDARDS.
   (A)   In accordance with the provisions of M.S. § 462.358, as it may be
amended from time to time, or amendments thereto, the subdivider shall
dedicate, to the public, lands for highway rights-of-way, street rights-of-way,
utility easements, wetland easements, and similar lands required for perpetual
and public improvements.
   (B)   The city finds it in the public interest and necessary to provide
future parks, trails, and other public open and recreational spaces for the
citizens of the city. As such, for every new subdivision of land involving
three or more lots which are to be developed for residential purposes, the City
Council, with the recommendation of the Planning Commission, shall require a
payment or dedication to the city of any one of the following, to be reviewed
on an annual basis at the beginning of each calendar year:
      (1)   A reasonable portion of a land dedication for conservation purposes
or for public use as parks, recreational facilities, playgrounds, trails,
wetlands, or open space, up to 0.016 acres per resident expected in the
proposed development, using the most recent average household size as
determined by the State Demographer’s office and the U.S. Census Bureau;
      (2)   A payment of up to $416 per expected resident in the proposed
subdivision, using the most recent average household size as determined by the
State Demographer’s office and the U.S. Census Bureau; or
      (3)   A combination of land dedication and cash payment to the city for
parks and open space purposes that reflects the values contained herein and in
the city’s comprehensive land use plan.
   (C)   The amount of land and/or payment shall be set by the City Council,
from the recommendation of the Planning Commission, after taking into
consideration the open space, park, recreational, or common area facilities
which the applicant proposes to reserve for public use within the subdivision.
The city shall grant preference to payment in lieu of land dedication unless an
area within the land to be platted has been identified by the city for park
acquisition. The following factors shall be taken into consideration when
reviewing potential lands for park dedication:
      (1)   The suitability of the land for its intended purpose;
      (2)   The future needs of the community regarding parks, trails, and open
spaces;
      (3)   The amount of any fees imposed, consistent with the requirements
and limitations contained in this section;
      (4)   Whether the land is adjacent to or near other public recreation
lands;
      (5)   Whether there is an opportunity to extend an existing or proposed
trail or to enlarge an existing or proposed park or recreational facility;
      (6)   Whether the land dedication would protect environmentally or
historically significant or sensitive sites; and
      (7)   Whether the land dedication provides a unique public benefit or
contains unique natural features.
   (D)   Where private open space for park or recreation purposes is provided
in a conventional subdivision and such space is to be privately owned and
maintained by the future residents of the subdivision or owners of the
development, the Planning Commission may consider granting a credit for park
dedication. A credit of up to 2.5% of the buildable area of the proposed open
space may be given, provided that the following conditions are met:
      (1)   The land area designated as open space and used in the calculation
of the 2.5% credit shall not include any area that is otherwise considered
unbuildable, including, but not limited to, wetlands, steep slopes exceeding
12%, and the area within setbacks from property lines, required buffer zones,
bluffs, and the ordinary high water mark, among others;
      (2)   The land area designated as open space within the development is
not occupied by non-recreational buildings, such as maintenance or care taking
buildings, and is available for use to all residents of the proposed
subdivision;
      (3)   The use of the private open space is restricted for park and
recreational purposes by recorded covenants which run with the land in favor of
the future owners of the property within the development and which cannot be
defeated or eliminated without the consent of the city; and
      (4)   The area required to obtain increased densities shall not be
included in the computation of such private open space.
   (E)   For conservation subdivisions where the conservation parcel is
publicly dedicated, there shall be no further dedication required. For
conservation subdivisions where the conservation parcel is not publicly
dedicated, the fee calculated in this section shall be reduced by 50% due to
the permanent preservation of open space.
   (F)   Funds received by the city, in lieu of land dedication, shall be
placed in a special fund in accordance with M.S. § 462.358, Subd. 2b, as it may
be amended from time to time.
   (G)   All land dedication pursuant to this chapter shall be conveyed to the
city through a warranty deed drafted by the City Attorney.

CONSERVATION SUBDIVISION AND PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS
§ 151.41 GENERAL.
   (A)   Conservation subdivision and planned unit development (PUD) requires
the assistance of professional planning and usually involves the approval of
multiple agencies or other governmental bodies. Where circumstances are
favorable, conservation subdivision and PUDs provide more latitude in land use
than normal development to allow for planning, clustering facilities,
consolidating green spaces, and internal recreation amenities.
   (B)   Mixed use PUD, where appropriate, may be allowed provided the use not
normally allowed in the zoning district does not exceed 35% of the building
floor area.
   (C)   Provisions of each zoning district shall govern within that district
except where specifically addressed in this section.
(Ord. 2016-03, passed - -)
§ 151.42 SUITABILITY.
   The city must consider the following criteria in the examination of a parcel
for suitability as a PUD:
   (A)   Existing recreational use of the surface waters and likely increases
in use associated with planned unit developments;
   (B)   Physical and aesthetic impacts of increased density;
   (C)   Suitability of lands for the planned unit development approach;
   (D)   Level of current development in the area;
   (E)   Amounts and types of ownership of undeveloped lands; and
   (F)   Size of the parcel and amount, if any, of shoreline.
(Ord. 2016-03, passed - -)
§ 151.43 DESIGN CRITERIA FOR NEW CONSERVATION SUBDIVISIONS AND PUDS.
   (A)   Minimum size. All developments must contain at least three contiguous
acres of buildable area with a lot width of 400 feet.
   (B)   Buffer.
      (1)   A 50-foot vegetative buffer will be maintained or established along
the boundary of the PUD. There shall be no units or impervious coverage within
this buffer with the exception of access roads or utilities. The buffer will
serve to screen the adjacent parcels and the lake, where applicable, from the
units within the PUD. The screening will contain both low growing (e.g., brush)
and high growing (e.g., trees) vegetation.
      (2)   Adjacent parcels and the lake, where applicable, shall be a minimum
of 50% screened, as measured by the Planning and Zoning Administrator, from the
adjacent parcel or the lake during leaf-on conditions. An earthen berm may be
used where, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, the existing vegetation
cannot be enhanced to meet the 50% screening criteria. Use of a berm shall not
preclude the maintaining of a 50-foot buffer or the installation of screening
as part of the berm.
   (C)   Minimum structure setbacks.
 
Shoreland Class Ordinary High Water Level Structure Setback (Feet)
General development                                 120
Natural environment                                 200
Recreational development                            150
 
   (D)   Common open space. At least 50% of the total project area must be
permanently preserved as common open space. Common open space must include
areas with physical characteristics unsuitable for development in their natural
state, and areas containing significant historic sites or unplatted cemeteries,
and at least 75% of the common open space must be upland area. At least 33% of
the common open space shall be retained in a contiguous area.
      (1)   The land area of all dwelling units/sites and accessory structures,
the space between buildings in a cluster, an area of 25 feet around each
structure, all road rights-of-way, and all land covered by impervious surfaces,
road surfaces, parking areas, or structures, shall not be included in the
computation of common open space.
      (2)   Common open space may include any outdoor recreational facilities
for use by owners of the dwelling units or sites, or the public.
      (3)   Common open space may include areas used for storm water retention
or management and areas used for sanitary sewer collection or disposal. Where
common space includes sanitary sewage treatment systems, the use of the space
shall be restricted where necessary to avoid adverse impacts on the systems.
      (4)   All of the shore impact zones must be included as common open
space.
      (5)   Common open space must not include commercial facilities or uses,
but may contain water-oriented facilities.
      (6)   The appearance and use of common space areas, including topography,
vegetation, and allowable uses, must be preserved by use of restrictive deed
covenants, permanent easements, public dedication and acceptance, or other
equally effective and permanent means acceptable to the city.
   (E)   Sanitary sewer and water supply standards.
      (1)   Planned unit developments shall be connected to publicly owned
water supply and sewer systems, if available. On-site water supply and sewage
treatment systems must be centralized and designed and installed to meet or
exceed applicable standards or rules of the state’s Department of Health and
the state’s Pollution Control Agency. On-site sewage treatment systems must be
located on the most suitable areas of the development, and sufficient area free
of limiting factors must be provided for a replacement standard soil treatment
system for each sewage system.
      (2)   Conservation subdivisions shall be connected to publicly owned
water supply and sewer systems, if available. Where publicly owned water supply
and sewer systems are not available, conservation subdivisions shall either
establish dedicated areas for individual sewage treatment systems or establish
centralized water supply and sewage treatment systems to serve the entire
subdivision.
   (F)   Erosion control and storm water management. Erosion control and storm
water management for developments must meet the standards in the City of Crosby
Stormwater Ordinance 2016-06. For planned unit developments, the impervious
surface coverage shall not exceed 15% in either the total project area or the
first tier. For conservation subdivisions, the impervious surface coverage for
lots must meet the standards in §
154.034. Erosion control and storm water management shall be designed by
certified personnel in erosion and sediment control using the best management
practices found in the latest Pollution Control Agency’s Storm Water Best
Management Practices Manual, approved by the local government, and effectively
implemented.
      (1)   For post construction storm water management, when possible,
existing natural drainage ways, wetlands, and vegetated soil surfaces must be
used to convey, store, filter, and retain storm water runoff before discharge
to public waters. When development density, topographic features, and soil and
vegetation conditions are not sufficient to adequately handle storm water
runoff using natural features and vegetation, various types of constructed
facilities such as diversions, settling basins, skimming devices, dikes,
waterways, and ponds may be used. Preference must be given to designs using
surface drainage, vegetated filter strips, bioretention areas, rainwater
gardens, enhanced swales, offline retention areas, and natural depressions for
infiltration rather than buried pipes and human-made materials and facilities.
      (2)   Development must be planned and conducted in a manner that will
minimize the extent of disturbed areas, runoff velocities, erosion potential,
and reduce and delay runoff volumes. Erosion prevention and sediment control
practices must be used to retain sediment on site. Disturbed soil areas must be
stabilized and protected as soon as possible. The maximum time the soil in a
project area can remain exposed when the area is not actively being worked is
three days. Temporary or permanent cover for the exposed areas is required at
that time but should be installed sooner if possible. All deltas and sediment
deposited in surface waters, including drainage ways, catch basins, and other
drainage systems must be removed within 14 days unless precluded by legal,
regulatory, or physical access restraints. The areas where sediment removal
results in exposed soil must be stabilized within seven days after completing
the removal.
      (3)   To the maximum extent possible, land-disturbing activities must not
occur within the shore impact zone.
      (4)   Impervious surface coverage.

   (G)   Exterior lighting. All exterior lighting shall be directed downward.
Lighting shall not illuminate parcels adjacent to the development, either
directly or indirectly.
   (H)   Shore recreation facilities.
      (1)   Shore recreation facilities, including, but not limited to,
swimming areas, docks, and watercraft mooring areas and launching ramps, must
be centralized and located in areas suitable for them. Evaluation of
suitability must include consideration of land slope, water depth, vegetation,
soils, depth to ground water and bedrock, or other relevant factors.
      (2)   No more than 20% of the shore impact zone shall be used for shore
recreation facilities.
      (3)   The number of spaces provided for continuous beaching, mooring, or
docking of watercraft shall not exceed one for each first-tier unit that would
be allowed as calculated in §
151.46(A). The number may be reduced based on the suitability of the site.
      (4)   Facilities for mooring of individual watercraft, including boat
lifts and canopies, shall be earth-tone in color and shall be positioned so as
to minimize their visibility from the lake. Canopies may be disallowed if they
would have a strong visual presence.
   (I)   Building standards. Units must be clustered in one or more groups and
located on suitable areas of the development. All structures within a PUD must
meet the minimum standards:
      (1)   New multi-family dwellings of four units or larger shall be
designed by an architect;
      (2)   New multi-family buildings shall meet the state code for fire and
sound ratings;
      (3)   Water systems must be winterized;
      (4)   Parking and driving areas must be paved; and
      (5)   All buildings shall be earth tone in color and shall be designed,
constructed, and positioned to be compatible, in color, character, and mass,
with the surrounding land use.
(Ord. 2016-03, passed - -)
§ 151.44 DESIGN CRITERIA FOR EXISTING PUDS.
   (A)   All existing PUDs shall meet the design criteria for a new PUD, where
possible.
   (B)   Additional development within an existing PUD shall not bring the PUD
further out of compliance with the basic design criteria.
(Ord. 2016-03, passed - -)
§ 151.45 COMPUTING PUD BUILDABLE AREA.
   Buildable area in a PUD is calculated using the following procedure.
   (A)   The project parcel is divided into tiers by locating one or more lines
approximately parallel to a line that identifies the ordinary high water level
at the following intervals, proceeding landward.
 
Shoreland Tier Dimensions Feet
GD lakes - first tier     200
GD lakes - second tiers   267
NE lakes - all tiers      400
RD lakes - all tiers      267
 
   (B)   The buildable area within each tier is next calculated. This area is
then subjected to the development density evaluation steps to arrive at an
allowable number of dwelling units/sites. In areas with overlapping tiers due
to close proximity of public waters to each other, topographic divides shall be
used to determine which shoreland standard would apply, and in those areas
where the topographic divide can not be determined, the more restrictive rules
for the area shall be used.
   (C)   Beyond the second tier, all property is classified as “third tier and
beyond”.
(Ord. 2016-03, passed - -)
§ 151.46 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS.
   (A)   Density. The buildable area within each tier is divided by the
shoreline residential buildable lot area contained in §
154.034. This calculation determines the maximum number of dwelling units or
sites authorized for each tier. Structures that straddle tiers shall be rated
as part of the tier closer to the ordinary high water level.
   (B)   Transferability. Allowable densities may be transferred from any tier
to any other tier further from the shoreland water body or watercourse, but
must not be transferred to any other tier closer.
   (C)   Administration and maintenance requirements. Prior to final approval
of any residential planned unit developments, the city will require adequate
provisions developed for preservation and maintenance in perpetuity of open
spaced and for the continued existence and functioning of the development as a
community.
      (1)   Common open space preservation. Deed restrictions, permanent
conservation easements, public dedication and acceptance, or other equally
effective and permanent means must be provided to ensure perpetual preservation
and maintenance of common open space. For areas greater or equal to ten acres,
easements shall be held by the city, conservation organization, land trust, or
similar organization authorized to hold interest in real property pursuant to
M.S. § 84C.01-05, as it may be amended from time to time, as approved by the
city. The city may also hold or co-hold an easement. The instruments of the
easement must include all of the following protections:
         (a)   Commercial uses shall be prohibited for noncommercial
developments;
         (b)   Vegetation and topographic alterations other than to prevent
personal injury or property damage and for restoration efforts based on an
approved shoreland vegetation buffer plan shall be prohibited;
         (c)   Construction of additional buildings, impervious surfaces, or
storage of vehicles and other materials shall be prohibited;
         (d)   Beaching of motorized watercraft shall be prohibited; and
         (e)   Dumping, storage, processing, burning, burying, or landfill of
solid or other wastes shall be prohibited.
      (2)   Development organization and functioning. Unless an equally
effective alternative community framework is established, when applicable, all
residential developments shall use an owners’ association with the following
features.
         (a)   Membership shall be mandatory for each dwelling unit or site
purchaser and any successive purchasers.
         (b)   Each member must pay a pro rata share of the association’s
expenses, and unpaid assessments can become liens on units or sites.
         (c)   Assessments must be adjustable to accommodate changing
conditions.
         (d)   The association shall be responsible for insurance, taxes, and
maintenance of all commonly owned property and facilities, and it must enforce
covenants, deed restrictions, and easements. The association must have a land
stewardship plan for common open space areas greater or equal to ten acres,
specifically focusing on the long-term management of these open space lands.
      (3)   Amendments or revisions to covenants or deed restrictions. Before
establishing or recording any common interest community, the developer shall
submit documents, including all covenants, conditions, restrictions, easements,
and operating rules and procedures associated with the development, for review
and approval by the city pursuant to M.S. § 515B.1-106, as it may be amended
from time to time. Under no circumstances shall covenants or deed restrictions
be modified without the city’s determination that the proposed changes fully
comply with the requirements of Chapter 15-8.2.
   (D)   Conversions. Existing commercial planned unit developments other land
uses and facilities may be converted to residential developments if all of the
following standards are met.
      (1)   Proposed conversions must be evaluated using the same procedures
and standards presented in this part for planned unit developments involving
all new construction. Inconsistencies between existing features of the
development and these standards shall be identified and corrected. For
conversions to residential lots, all inconsistencies between existing features
of the development and the standards in Chapter 15-8.2 must be identified and
corrected.
      (2)   Deficiencies involving water supply and sewage treatment,
impervious coverage, common open space, and shore recreation facilities must be
corrected as part of the conversion or as specified in the conditional use
permit.
      (3)   Shore and bluff impact zone deficiencies must be corrected as part
of the conversion. These improvements must include, where applicable, the
following:
         (a)   Removal of extraneous buildings, docks, mooring sites, boat
launching areas and ramps, or other facilities located in shore or bluff impact
zones; and
         (b)   Remedial measures to correct erosion sites and improve
vegetative cover and screening of buildings and other facilities as viewed from
the water to meet shoreland vegetation buffer standards in Chapter 15-8.2(3)
(B).
      (4)   Dwelling units or dwelling site densities shall meet the standards
in this part for conversion to planned unit developments and the standards in
Chapter 15-8.2(6) for conversions to residential lots.

§ 151.65 BOUNDARY LINE ADJUSTMENT.
   A boundary line adjustment is the moving of a boundary line between adjacent
parcels. A boundary line adjustment does not create any new lots, tracts,
parcels, or sites. A boundary line adjustment must also not create or result in
any lot, tract, parcel, or site which contains insufficient area and dimensions
to meet minimum requirements for width, lot size, and area for building as
required by this section. The newly acquired land must be combined on the same
deed for recording purposes as the remainder of the owner’s property.
   (A)   Application. An owner proposing to undertake a boundary line
adjustment must submit a complete application to the city together with the
applicable fees. The owner must submit the following additional information
with its application in order for the application to be considered complete:
      (1)   A certificate of survey showing the current boundary lines and the
proposed boundary lines after adjustment;
      (2)   The current legal descriptions of the parcels; and
      (3)   The resulting legal descriptions of the altered parcels.
   (B)   Procedure. Complete applications must be submitted to the Zoning
Administrator. The Zoning Administrator shall review the application and make a
determination. If a boundary line adjustment is approved, the city will send a
letter to the County Recorder/Registrar of Titles indicating its approval. The
applicant shall be required to prepare and record such documents with the
County Recorder/Registrar of Titles as may be needed to complete the boundary
line adjustment. All boundary line adjustment approvals shall be recorded at
the County Recorder’s office within one year of approval. Any application not
recorded within that time frame shall be deemed void and require a new
application.

§ 151.66 PRELIMINARY PLAT OR PRELIMINARY CONDOMINIUM PLAT APPROVAL.
   (A)   The preliminary plat or preliminary condominium plan approval
constitutes formal approval of the concept and design of the subdivision. The
Planning Commission review shall include a public hearing and may include a
field review at its discretion. All reports of city staff, DNR, and road
authorities shall be reviewed and included in the hearing record. Related
variance requests, rezoning requests, and conditional use requests shall be
heard concurrently with a subdivision request.
   (B)    The subdivider shall submit nine copies of the proposed plat or
condominium plat to the Zoning Administrator 30 days prior to the normal

feet, by regular mail and shall advertise the hearing once in the legal section
of the official newspaper at least ten days ahead of the public hearing,
including sufficient legal property description in the advertisement. The
Zoning Administrator shall distribute one copy to each Planning Commission
member, if the proposal is adjacent to a county highway, one copy to the County
Engineer, and if the plat is in shorelands, one copy to the DNR postmarked at
least ten days before the public hearing for review and comment.

Commission of his or her findings.
   (E)   The subdivider shall make additional application for the necessary
permits at least 30 days prior to the normal Planning Commission or Board of
Adjustment meeting as applicable, if subdivider desires to have a concurrent
public hearing for variance, conditional use, or rezoning.
   (F)   The Planning Commission shall hold the public hearing and may continue
the hearing as it deems necessary to allow all factual input it deems necessary
to allow a decision. Lack of submission of comments by outside agencies shall
be construed to mean the agency has no objections.
   (G)   The Planning Commission shall recommend the approval, where
applicable, of the preliminary plat or preliminary condominium plat to the
Council within the required time frame, and the findings shall be sent to the
subdivider. The Planning Commission shall consider the following in its
decision:
      (1)   Is the property properly zoned?
      (2)   Does the proposal conform to the requirements of this chapter?
      (3)   Does the proposal conform to the requirements of the subdivision

requests, and/or rezoning requests shall either have been decided or be pending
approval simultaneously with the final plat.
   (B)   The subdivider shall submit nine paper copies of the final plat or
final condominium plat and concurrent documents to the Zoning Administrator 30
days prior to the Planning Commission meeting.
   (C)   The Zoning Administrator shall distribute the information received to
the City Attorney and the City Engineer, who shall review the submission for
conformance with the standards and comment thereupon to the Planning
Commission. The Zoning Administrator shall compare the final plat to the
preliminary plat and comment thereupon. The Attorney shall ascertain that all
parties with an interest in the parcel to be divided are indicated as signers
of the documents. The engineer shall determine that the improvements required
have been completed or have been included in a development contract and that
the required security has been posted with the City Council. An independent
licensed land surveyor, as designated by the city, shall compare the approved

and verify that the final plat meets the survey standards required by state
statutes.
   (D)   The Planning Commission shall review the reports of the attorney,

dangerous to the life, health, property, or safety of the public or the
occupants of the structure by not providing minimum safeguards to protect or
warn occupants in the event of fire, or because such structure contains unsafe
equipment or is so damaged, decayed, dilapidated, structurally unsafe, or of
such faulty construction or unstable foundation, that partial or complete
collapse is possible.
      (2)   Unsafe equipment. Unsafe equipment includes any boiler, heating
equipment, elevator, moving stairway, electrical wiring or device, flammable

life, health, property, or safety of the public or occupants of the premises or
structure.

occupancy whenever the Code Official finds that such structure is unsafe,
unlawful, or, because of the degree to which the structure is in disrepair or
lacks maintenance, is unsanitary, vermin or rat infested, contains filth and

nuisance. Upon failure of the owner to close up the premises within the time
specified in the order, the Code Official shall cause the premises to be closed
and secured through any available public agency or by contract or arrangement
by private persons and the cost thereof shall be charged against the real
estate upon which the structure is located and shall be a lien upon such real
estate and may be collected by any other legal resource.

10.033,
10.045 to
10.046, and
10.060 to
10.063. The order shall also state that failure to abate the public nuisance or
request a hearing within the applicable time periods will result in summary
abatement procedures, and that the cost of abatement will be assessed against
the subject property. Upon expiration of the time required by the notice, the
Code Official, Building Official, Police Department personnel, or any
authorized representative may abate the nuisance unless a request for a hearing
has been timely filed.
      (2)   Any property owner who feels aggrieved by an order of the Code
Official, Building Official, Police Department personnel, or any authorized

the total unpaid charges for each abatement made under this chapter against
each separate lot or parcel to which they are attributable. The City Council
may then spread the charges or any portion thereof against the property
involved as a special assessment under other pertinent statutes, for
certification to the County Auditor and collection the following year along
with current taxes. Such assessment shall be payable in no more than ten equal
annual installments, pursuant to M.S. Ch. 429, as it may be amended from time

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 153.001 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The legislature of the state has, in M.S. Ch. 103F and Ch. 462, as it may be
amended from time to time, delegated the responsibility to local government
units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the
City Council does ordain as follows.
(Ord. 2017-03, passed 7-24-2017)
§ 153.002 PURPOSE.
   (A)   This chapter regulates development in the flood hazard areas of the
city. These flood hazard areas are subject to periodic inundation, which may
result in loss of life and property, health, and safety hazards, disruption of
commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood
protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base. It is the purpose of
this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare by
minimizing these losses and disruptions.
   (B)   This chapter is adopted to comply with the rules and regulations of
the National Flood Insurance Program, codified as 44 C.F.R. Parts 59 to 78, as
amended, so as to maintain the community’s eligibility in the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (C)   This chapter is also intended to preserve the natural characteristics
and functions of watercourses and floodplains in order to moderate flood and
storm water impacts, improve water quality, reduce soil erosion, protect
aquatic and riparian habitat, provide recreational opportunities, provide
aesthetic benefits and enhance community and economic development.
(Ord. 2017-03, passed 7-24-2017)
§ 153.003 APPLICATION.
   (A)   This chapter applies to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city
within the boundaries of the Floodway, Flood Fringe, or General Floodplain
Districts. The boundaries of the zoning districts are determined by scaling
distances on the flood insurance rate map, or as modified in accordance with
division (C) below.
   (B)   The Floodway, Flood Fringe, and General Floodplain Districts are
overlay districts that are superimposed on all existing zoning districts. The
standards imposed in the overlay districts are in addition to any other
requirements in this chapter, in case of a conflict, the more restrictive
standards will apply.
   (C)   Where a conflict exists between the floodplain limits illustrated on
the official floodplain maps and actual field conditions, the flood elevations
shall be the governing factor in locating the regulatory floodplain limits.
   (D)   Persons contesting the location of the district boundaries will be
given a reasonable opportunity to present their case to the Planning Commission
and to submit technical evidence.
(Ord. 2017-03, passed 7-24-2017)
§ 153.004 INCORPORATION OF MAPS BY REFERENCE.
   The following maps, together with all attached material, are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of the official zoning map and this
chapter. The material includes the Flood Insurance Study for Crow Wing County,
Minnesota, and Incorporated Areas, dated August 15, 2017 and the flood
insurance rate map panels enumerated below, dated August 15, 2017, all prepared
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. These materials are on file in the
City Clerk-Treasurer’s office: 27035C0338C, 27035C0451C, 27035C0339C,
27035C0452C, 27035C0350C, and 27035C0456C.
(Ord. 2017-03, passed 7-24-2017)
§ 153.005 CONFLICT WITH PRIOR AGREEMENTS.
   It is not intended by this chapter to repeal, abrogate, or impair any
existing easements, covenants, or other private agreements. However, where this
chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter prevail.
All other ordinances inconsistent with this chapter are hereby repealed to the
extent of the inconsistency only.
(Ord. 2017-03, passed 7-24-2017)
§ 153.006 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   This chapter does not imply that areas outside the Floodplain Districts or
land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or flood
damages. This chapter does not create liability on the part of the city or its
officers or employees for any flood damages that result from reliance on this
chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.
(Ord. 2017-03, passed 7-24-2017)
§ 153.007 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ACCESSORY USE OR STRUCTURE. A use or structure on the same lot with, and of
a nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal use or
structure.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION. The elevation of the “regional flood”. The term BASE
FLOOD ELEVATION is used in the flood insurance survey.
   BASEMENT. Any area of a structure, including crawl spaces, having its floor
or base subgrade (below ground level) on all four sides, regardless of the
depth of excavation below ground level.
   CONDITIONAL USE. A specific type of structure or land use listed in the
official control that may be allowed but only after an in-depth review
procedure and with appropriate conditions or restrictions as provided in the
official zoning controls or building codes, and upon a finding that:
      (1)   Certain conditions as detailed in the zoning ordinance exist; and
      (2)   The structure and/or land use conform to the comprehensive land use
plan if one exists and are compatible with the existing neighborhood.
   CRITICAL FACILITIES. Facilities necessary to a community’s public health and
safety, those that store or produce highly volatile, toxic, or water-reactive
materials, and those that house occupants that may be insufficiently mobile to
avoid loss of life or injury. Examples of CRITICAL FACILITIES include
hospitals, correctional facilities, schools, day care facilities, nursing
homes, fire and police stations, wastewater treatment facilities, public
electric utilities, water plants, fuel storage facilities, and waste handling
and storage facilities.
   DEVELOPMENT . Any human-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading,
paving, excavation or drilling operations, or storage of equipment or
materials.
   EQUAL DEGREE OF ENCROACHMENT. A method of determining the location of
floodway boundaries so that floodplain lands on both sides of a stream are
capable of conveying a proportionate share of flood flows.
   FARM FENCE. A fence as defined by M.S. § 344.02, Subd. 1(a)-(d), as it may
be amended from time to time. An open type fence of posts and wire is not
considered to be a structure under this chapter. FENCES that have the potential
to obstruct flood flows, such as chain link fences and rigid walls, are
regulated as structures under this chapter.
   FLOOD. A temporary increase in the flow or stage of a stream or in the stage
of a wetland or lake that results in the inundation of normally dry areas.
   FLOOD FREQUENCY. The frequency for which it is expected that a specific
flood stage or discharge may be equaled or exceeded.
   FLOOD FRINGE. The portion of the special flood hazard area (1% annual chance
flood) located outside of the floodway. FLOOD FRINGE is synonymous with the
term FLOODWAY FRINGE used in the flood insurance study for the county.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP. An official map on which the Federal Insurance
Administrator has delineated both the special hazard areas and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community. A FIRM that has been made available
digitally is called a digital flood insurance rate map (DFIRM).

source.
   FLOODPLAIN. The beds proper and the areas adjoining a wetland, lake, or
watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regional flood.

those portions of the adjoining floodplain which are reasonably required to
carry or store the regional flood discharge.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, used solely for parking
of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a basement area,
is not considered a building’s LOWEST FLOOR; provided, that such enclosure is
not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-
elevation design requirements of 44 C.F.R. § 60.3.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include the term “recreational vehicle”.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. Structures, including additions and improvements, and
placement of manufactured homes, for which the start of construction commenced
on or after the effective date of this chapter.

projection, excavation, channel modification, culvert, building, wire, fence,
stockpile, refuse, fill, structure, or matter in, along, across, or projecting
into any channel, watercourse, or regulatory floodplain which may impede,
retard, or change the direction of the flow of water, either in itself or by
catching or collecting debris carried by such water.
   ONE HUNDRED YEAR FLOODPLAIN. Lands inundated by the “regional flood” (see
definition).
   PRINCIPAL USE OR STRUCTURE. All uses or structures that are not accessory
uses or structures.
   REACH. A hydraulic engineering term to describe a longitudinal segment of a
stream or river influenced by a natural or human-made obstruction. In an urban
area, the segment of a stream or river between two consecutive bridge crossings
would most typically constitute a REACH.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle that is built on a single chassis, is 400
square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, is
designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and
is designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary
living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. For the
purposes of this chapter, the term RECREATIONAL VEHICLE is synonymous with the
term TRAVEL TRAILER/TRAVEL VEHICLE.
   REGIONAL FLOOD. A flood which is representative of large floods known to
have occurred generally in the state and reasonably characteristic of what can
be expected to occur on an average frequency in the magnitude of the 1% chance
or 100-year recurrence interval. REGIONAL FLOOD is synonymous with the term
“base flood” used in a flood insurance study.
   REGULATORY FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION (RFPE). An elevation not less than one
foot above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in flood
elevation caused by encroachments on the floodplain that result from
designation of a floodway.
   REPETITIVE LOSS. Flood related damages sustained by a structure on two
separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at
the time of each such flood event on the average equals or exceeds 25% of the
market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA. A term used for flood insurance purposes
synonymous with ONE HUNDRED YEAR FLOODPLAIN.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Includes substantial improvement, and means the
actual START of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement, or other improvement that occurred before the permit’s expiration
date. The actual START is either the first placement of permanent construction
of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers,
foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   STRUCTURE. Anything constructed or erected on the ground or attached to the
ground or on-site utilities, including, but not limited to, buildings,
factories, sheds, detached garages, cabins, manufactured homes, recreational
vehicles not meeting the exemption criteria specified in §
153.115(C) and other similar items.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure where the
cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or
exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Within any consecutive 365-day period, any
reconstruction, rehabilitation (including normal maintenance and repair),
repair after damage, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of
which equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the
“start of construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures that
have incurred “substantial damage”, regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include either:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a “historic structure”, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
“historic structure”. For the purpose of this chapter, HISTORIC STRUCTURE is as
defined in 44 C.F.R. § 59.1.
(Ord. 2017-03, passed 7-24-2017)
§ 153.008 ANNEXATION.
   The flood insurance rate map panels adopted by reference into §

surveyor that the finished fill and building elevations were accomplished in
compliance with the provisions of this chapter. Floodproofing measures must be
certified by a registered professional engineer or registered architect.
Accessory structures designed in accordance with §
153.081(B) are exempt from certification, provided sufficient documentation is
provided.
   (C)   Certificate of zoning compliance for a new, altered, or nonconforming
use. No building, land, or structure may be occupied or used in any manner
until a certificate of zoning compliance has been issued by the Zoning
Administrator stating that the use of the building or land conforms to the
requirements of this chapter.
   (D)   Record of first floor elevation. The Zoning Administrator must
maintain a record of the elevation of the lowest floor, including basement, of
all new structures and alterations or additions to existing structures in the
floodplain. The Zoning Administrator must also maintain a record of the
elevation to which structures and alterations or additions to structures are
floodproofed.
   (E)   Notifications for watercourse alterations. Before authorizing any
alteration or relocation of a river or stream, the Zoning Administrator must
notify adjacent communities. If the applicant has applied for a permit to work
in public waters pursuant to M.S. § 103G.245, as it may be amended from time to
time, this will suffice as adequate notice. A copy of the notification must
also be submitted to the Chicago Regional Office of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA).
   (F)   Notification to FEMA when physical changes increase or decrease base
flood elevations. As soon as is practicable, but not later than six months
after the date such supporting information becomes available, the Zoning

§ 153.022 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Variance applications. An application for a variance to the provisions
of this chapter will be processed and reviewed in accordance with applicable
state statutes and §
154.011.
   (B)   Adherence to state floodplain management standards. A variance must
not allow a use that is not allowed in that district, permit a lower degree of
flood protection than the regulatory flood protection elevation for the
particular area, or permit standards lower than those required by state law.
   (C)   Additional variance criteria. The following additional variance
criteria of the Federal Emergency Management Agency must be satisfied.
      (1)   Variances must not be issued by a community within any designated
regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood
discharge would result.
      (2)   Variances may only be issued by a community upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      (3)   Variances may only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   (D)   Flood insurance notice. The Zoning Administrator must notify the
applicant for a variance that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to
amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and
      (2)   Such construction below the base or regional flood level increases
risks to life and property. Such notification must be maintained with a record
of all variance actions.
   (E)   General considerations. The community may consider the following
factors in granting variances and imposing conditions on variances and
conditional uses in floodplains:
      (1)   The potential danger to life and property due to increased flood
heights or velocities caused by encroachments;
      (2)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands or
downstream to the injury of others;
      (3)   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems, if any, and the
ability of these systems to minimize the potential for disease, contamination,
and unsanitary conditions;
      (4)   The susceptibility of any proposed use and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      (5)   The importance of the services to be provided by the proposed use
to the community;
      (6)   The requirements of the facility for a waterfront location;
      (7)   The availability of viable alternative locations for the proposed
use that are not subject to flooding;
      (8)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and
development anticipated in the foreseeable future;
      (9)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive land use
plan and floodplain management program for the area;
      (10)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles; and
      (11)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site.
   (F)   Submittal of hearing notices to the Department of Natural Resources
(DNR). The Zoning Administrator must submit hearing notices for proposed
variances to the DNR sufficiently in advance to provide at least ten days’
notice of the hearing. The notice may be sent by electronic mail or U.S. Mail
to the respective DNR area hydrologist
   (G)   Submittal of final decisions to the DNR. A copy of all decisions
granting variances must be forwarded to the DNR within ten days of such action.
The notice may be sent by electronic mail or U.S. Mail to the respective DNR
area hydrologist.
   (H)   Record-keeping. The Zoning Administrator must maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and must report
such variances in an annual or biennial report to the Administrator of the
National Flood Insurance Program, when requested by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency.

§ 153.024 NONCONFORMITIES.
   (A)   A use, structure, or occupancy of land which was lawful before the
passage or amendment of this chapter but which is not in conformity with the
provisions of this chapter may be continued subject to the following
conditions. Historic structures, as defined in §
153.007, are subject to the provisions of divisions (B) to (G) below.
   (B)   A nonconforming use, structure, or occupancy must not be expanded,
changed, enlarged, or altered in a way that increases its flood damage
potential or degree of obstruction to flood flows except as provided in
division (C) below. Expansion or enlargement of uses, structures, or
occupancies within the Floodway District is prohibited.
   (C)   Any addition or structural alteration to a nonconforming structure or
nonconforming use that would result in increasing its flood damage potential
must be protected to the regulatory flood protection elevation in accordance
with any of the elevation on fill or floodproofing techniques (i.e., FP-
1 through FP-4 floodproofing classifications) allowable in the State Building
Code, except as further restricted in division (E) below.
   (D)   If any nonconforming use, or any use of a nonconforming structure, is
discontinued for more than one year, any future use of the premises must
conform to this chapter.
   (E)   If any structure experiences a substantial improvement, as defined in
§
153.007, then the entire structure must meet the standards of §§
153.065 to
153.068 or §§
153.080 to
153.083 for new structures, depending upon whether the structure is in the
Floodway or Flood Fringe District, respectively. If the current proposal,
including maintenance and repair during the previous 365 days, plus the costs
of any previous alterations and additions since the first flood insurance rate
map exceeds 50% of the market value of any nonconforming structure, the entire
structure must meet the standards of §§
153.065 to
153.068 or §§
153.080 to
153.083.
   (F)   If any nonconformity is substantially damaged, as defined in this
chapter, it may not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions
of this chapter. The applicable provisions for establishing new uses or new
structures in §§
153.065 to
153.068 or §§
153.080 to
153.083 will apply depending upon whether the use or structure is in the
Floodway or Flood Fringe District, respectively.
   (G)   If any nonconforming use or structure experiences a repetitive loss,
as defined in §
153.007, it must not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions
of this chapter.

   (C)   Any facility that will be used by employees or the general public must
be designed with a flood warning system that provides adequate time for
evacuation if the area is inundated to a depth and velocity such that the depth
(in feet) multiplied by the velocity (in feet per second) would exceed a
product of four upon occurrence of the regional (1% chance) flood.
(Ord. 2017-03, passed 7-24-2017)
§ 153.067 CONDITIONAL USES.
   The following uses may be allowed as conditional uses following the
standards and procedures set forth in §
153.023 and further subject to the standards set forth in §
153.068, if otherwise allowed in the underlying zoning district or any
applicable overlay district:
   (A)   Structures accessory to the uses listed in §

   (G)   Levees or dikes intended to protect agricultural crops for a frequency
flood event equal to or less than the ten-year frequency flood event.
(Ord. 2017-03, passed 7-24-2017)
§ 153.068 STANDARDS FOR FLOODWAY CONDITIONAL USES.
   (A)   All uses. A conditional use must not cause any increase in the
regional flood elevations or cause an increase in flood damages in the reach or
reaches affected.
   (B)   Fill; storage of materials and equipment.
      (1)   Fill, dredge spoil, and other similar materials deposited or stored
in the floodplain must be protected from erosion by vegetative cover, mulching,
riprap, or other acceptable method. Permanent sand and gravel operations and
similar uses must be covered by a long-term site development plan.
      (2)   Temporary placement of fill, other materials, or equipment which
would cause an increase to the stage of the 1% chance or regional flood may
only be allowed if the city has approved a plan that assures removal of the
materials from the floodway based upon the flood warning time available.
   (C)   Accessory structures. Accessory structures, as identified in §
153.067(A), may be permitted, provided that:
      (1)   Structures are not intended for human habitation;
      (2)   Structures will have a low flood damage potential;
      (3)   Structures will be constructed and placed so as to offer a minimal
obstruction to the flow of flood waters;
      (4)   Service utilities, such as electrical and heating equipment, within
these structures must be elevated to or above the regulatory flood protection
elevation or properly floodproofed;
      (5)   Structures must be elevated on fill or structurally dry
floodproofed in accordance with the FP-1 or FP-2 floodproofing classifications
in the State Building Code. All floodproofed structures must be adequately
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement and designed to
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
      (6)   As an alternative, an accessory structure may be internally/wet
floodproofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 floodproofing classifications in the State
Building Code, provided the accessory structure constitutes a minimal
investment. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a
registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following criteria:
         (a)   To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there
must be a minimum of two “automatic” openings in the outside walls of the
structure, with a total net area of not less than one square inch for every
square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; and
         (b)   There must be openings on at least two sides of the structure
and the bottom of all openings must be no higher than one foot above the lowest
adjacent grade to the structure. Using human intervention to open a garage door
prior to flooding will not satisfy this requirement for automatic openings.
   (D)   Change to waterways. Structural works for flood control that will
change the course, current, or cross section of protected wetlands or public
waters are subject to the provisions of M.S. § 103G.245, as it may be amended
from time to time.
   (E)   Increased risk of flood. A levee, dike, or floodwall constructed in
the floodway must not cause an increase to the 1% chance or regional flood. The
technical analysis must assume equal conveyance or storage loss on both sides
of a stream.
   (F)   Hydraulic capacity. Floodway developments must not adversely affect
the hydraulic capacity of the channel and adjoining floodplain of any tributary
watercourse or drainage system.

§ 153.081 STANDARDS FOR FLOOD FRINGE PERMITTED USES.
   (A)   All structures, including accessory structures, must be elevated on
fill so that the lowest floor, as defined, is at or above the regulatory flood
protection elevation. The finished fill elevation for structures must be no
lower than one foot below the regulatory flood protection elevation and the
fill must extend at the same elevation at least 15 feet beyond the outside
limits of the structure.
   (B)   As an alternative to the fill requirements of division (A) above,
structures accessory to the uses identified in §
153.080 may be permitted to be internally/wet floodproofed to the FP-3 or FP-
4 floodproofing classifications in the State Building Code, provided that:
      (1)   The accessory structure constitutes a minimal investment, does not
exceed 576 square feet in size, and is only used for parking and storage;
      (2)   All portions of floodproofed accessory structures below the
regulatory flood protection elevation must be:
         (a)   Adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement and designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls;
         (b)   Be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage; and
         (c)   Must have all service utilities be watertight or elevated to
above the regulatory flood protection elevation.
      (3)   Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a
registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following criteria:
         (a)   To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there
must be a minimum of two “automatic” openings in the outside walls of the
structure, with a total net area of not less than one square inch for every
square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; and
         (b)   There must be openings on at least two sides of the structure
and the bottom of all openings must be no higher than one foot above the lowest
adjacent grade to the structure. Using human intervention to open a garage door
prior to flooding will not satisfy this requirement for automatic openings.
      (4)   The cumulative placement of fill or similar material on a parcel
must not exceed 1,000 cubic yards, unless the fill is specifically intended to
elevate a structure in accordance with division (A) above, or if allowed as a
conditional use under §
153.082;
      (5)   The storage of any materials or equipment must be elevated on fill
to the regulatory flood protection elevation;
      (6)   All service utilities, including ductwork, must be elevated or
watertight to prevent infiltration of flood waters;
      (7)   All fill must be properly compacted and the slopes must be properly
protected by the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable method;
      (8)   All new principal structures must have vehicular access at or above
an elevation not more than two feet below the regulatory flood protection
elevation, or must have a flood warning/emergency evacuation plan acceptable to
the city;
      (9)   Accessory uses such as yards, railroad tracks, and parking lots may
be at an elevation lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation.
However, any facilities used by employees or the general public must be
designed with a flood warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation
if the area is inundated to a depth and velocity such that the depth (in feet)
multiplied by the velocity (in feet per second) would exceed a product of four
upon occurrence of the regional (1% chance) flood; and
      (10)   Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles must meet the
standards of §§
153.114 and
153.115.

floodproofed, meeting the FP-1 or FP-2 floodproofing classification in the
State Building Code, which requires making the structure watertight with the
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the
effects of buoyancy.
   (D)   The placement of more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill or other similar
material on a parcel, other than for the purpose of elevating a structure to
the regulatory flood protection elevation, must comply with an approved
erosion/sedimentation control plan.
      (1)   The plan must clearly specify methods to be used to stabilize the
fill on site for a flood event at a minimum of the regional (1% chance) flood
event.
      (2)   The plan must be prepared and certified by a registered
professional engineer or other qualified individual acceptable to the city.
      (3)   The plan may incorporate alternative procedures for removal of the
material from the floodplain if adequate flood warning time exists.
   (E)   Storage of materials and equipment below the regulatory flood
protection elevation must comply with an approved emergency plan providing for
removal of such materials within the time available after a flood warning.

   (C)   The determination of floodway and flood fringe must include the
following components, as applicable:
      (1)   Estimate the peak discharge of the regional (1% chance) flood;
      (2)   Calculate the water surface profile of the regional flood based
upon a hydraulic analysis of the stream channel and overbank areas; and
      (3)   Compute the floodway necessary to convey or store the regional
flood without increasing flood stages more than one-half foot. A lesser stage
increase than one-half foot is required if, as a result of the stage increase,
increased flood damages would result. An equal degree of encroachment on both
sides of the stream within the reach must be assumed in computing floodway
boundaries.
   (D)   The Zoning Administrator will review the submitted information and
assess the technical evaluation and the recommended Floodway and/or Flood
Fringe District boundary. The assessment must include the cumulative effects of
previous floodway encroachments. The Zoning Administrator may seek technical
assistance from a designated engineer or other expert person or agency,
including the Department of Natural Resources. Based on this assessment, the
Zoning Administrator may approve or deny the application.
   (E)   Once the Floodway and Flood Fringe District boundaries have been
determined, the Zoning Administrator must process the permit application
consistent with the applicable provisions of §§
153.065 to

reports and recommendations of the Planning Commission, the City Council shall
place the amendment request on the agenda of the next regular meeting and

§ 154.011 VARIANCE; APPEALS.
   (A)   Appeals. The City Council shall be the Planning Commission and shall
act upon any and all of the following items.
      (1)   The City Council shall act as an appeal authority on all questions
as they may arise in the administration of this chapter, including the
interpretation of zoning maps, and shall hear and make recommendation on
appeals from and review any order, requirement, decision, or determination made
by an administrative official charged with enforcing this chapter. Such appeal
may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department board, or
commission of the city. The recommendations on appeals are forwarded to the
City Council for approval or denial at their next available Council meeting.
      (2)   The City Council shall conduct hearings on a request for a variance
to the strict application of any of the requirements of this chapter in the
case of exceptionally irregular, narrow, or shallow lots, or other exceptional
physical conditions, whereby such strict application would result in practical
difficulty or unnecessary hardship that would deprive the owner of the
reasonable use of the land or building involved, but in no other uses except as
specifically described. The Council shall have the authority to grant or deny
any such variance request by a majority vote of the Council.
      (3)   The City Council’s decisions shall be final except on appeal to the
District Court.
   (B)   Variances.
      (1)   Applications. Application for variances shall be filed with the
Zoning Administrator who shall forward to the Planning Commission/Board of
Adjustment:
         (a)   A copy of the application and additional information determined
by the Zoning Administrator to be pertinent to the application; and
         (b)   A certificate of survey shall be required showing:
            1.   Property boundary with dimensions shown including square
footage of parcel;
            2.   Buildable area;
            3.   Location, size and height dimensions of all existing and
proposed structures/additions;
            4.   Location of all wells (existing and proposed) and septic
systems;
            5.   Location and size of all existing and proposed driveways,
roads and easements;
            6.   Nonconforming structure setbacks including all pertinent
dimensions;
            7.   Two foot contours;
            8.   Existing and proposed impervious surface calculations;
            9.   Bluff or steep slopes;
            10.   Ordinary high water elevation;
            11.   Delineated wetlands;
            12.   Stormwater management plan according to §
154.119 of this chapter; and
            13.   No-maintenance shoreline buffer according to §§
154.069 and
154.119 of this chapter.
         (c)   The Zoning Administrator shall have the discretion to determine
whether an application may be forwarded to the Board of Adjustment without an
accompanying certificate of survey. A determination by the Zoning Administrator
that a certificate of survey is not necessary shall be made in writing by the
Zoning Administrator.
      (2)   Public hearing. Acting in its capacity as the Board of Adjustment,
the Planning Commission/Board of Adjustment shall hold at least one public
hearing on an application for a variance pursuant to M.S. § 462.357, Subd. 3,
as it may be amended from time to time. and its adopted rules of business. The
Planning Commission/Board of Adjustment may hold additional public hearings
when it determines that such hearings will be in the public interest.
      (3)   Delayed action. In considering the application for a variance, the
Planning Commission/Board of Adjustment may adjourn the hearing to a future
time and defer action or consideration until further information desired from
the applicant is submitted. The applicant shall be notified in writing of the
information needed or reason for tabling the item. The provisions for action on
an application shall be in compliance with M.S. § 15.99, as it may be amended
from time to time.
      (4)   Variance criteria. Variances may only be granted in accordance with
M.S. § 462.357, Subd. 6(2), as it may be amended from time to time. No variance
shall be granted that would allow any use that is prohibited in the land use
district in which the subject property is located. In considering a variance
request, the Board of Adjustment must consider whether a practical difficulty
exists by considering the following factors:
         (a)   Is the variance request in harmony with the purposes and intent
of the land use ordinance?
         (b)   Is the variance consistent with the comprehensive plan?
         (c)   Is the property owner proposing to use the property in a
reasonable manner not permitted by the land use ordinance?
         (d)   Is the need for a variance due to circumstances unique to the
property and not created by the property owner?
         (e)   Will the issuance of a variance maintain the essential character
of the locality?
         (f)   Does the need for a variance involve more than economic
considerations?
      (5)   Conditions may apply.
         (a)   If the variance criteria in subsection (4) above have been met,
the Planning Commission/Board of Adjustment, in approving any such application,
may require additional conditions and mitigating requirements to protect the
public health, safety, or the environment, as may be reasonable under all
circumstances concerned therewith, to be imposed as a condition for granting of
the permit that shall fulfill the purposes of this chapter. A condition must be
directly related to and must bear a rough proportionality to the impact created
by the variance. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to, the
following:
            1.   Mitigation actions to off-set environmental consequences of
variance approval;
            2.   Increased setbacks from the ordinary high water level;
            3.   Limitations on the natural vegetation to be removed or the
requirement that additional vegetation be planted;
            4.   Special provisions for the location, design, size and use of
allowed structures, sewage treatment systems, and vehicle parking areas; and
            5.   Performance security.
         (b)   The department may conduct follow-up inspections as necessary to
insure that the conditions established by the Board of Adjustment are met.
         (c)   Failure to comply with variance conditions as imposed by the
Planning Commission/Board of Adjustment is a violation of this chapter.
      (6)   Variance decision. After reviewing the application, considering all
pertinent facts, and hearing testimony at the public hearing, the Planning
Commission/Board of Adjustment may approve, deny, or modify the variance
request. The Planning Commission/Board of Adjustment shall prepare written
findings of fact to support its decision. A copy of the decision and findings
of fact shall be forwarded to the applicant via U.S. mail. If the variance is
approved, the Zoning Administrator shall cause a copy of the variance to be
recorded with the land records for the subject property in the Office of the
County Recorder. A copy of the final decision granting a variance within a
shoreland area shall be sent to the Commissioner of the Department of Natural
Resources within ten days of final action.
(Prior Code, § 13.09) (Ord. 2019-05, passed 10-28-2019)
§ 154.012 ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTS.
   (A)   Intent. It is the intent of this section to implement the
environmental review procedures to follow the provisions of M.S. Ch. 116D, as
it may be amended from time to time, relating to the Environmental Review
Program, and any rules adopted under that chapter by the State Environmental
Quality Board. All terms used in this section shall have the same meaning as
the terms used in M.S. Ch. 116D, as it may be amended from time to time. The
provisions of the rules for the Environmental Review Program are adopted and
are on file in the Zoning Administrator’s office.
   (B)   Cost of preparation and review.
      (1)   The applicant for a permit for any action for which environmental
documents are required either by state law or rules or by the City Council
shall supply all unprivileged data or information reasonably requested by the
city that the applicant has in his or her possession or to which he or she has
reasonable access.
      (2)   The applicant for a permit for any action for which an
environmental assessment worksheet (EAW) is required, either by state law or
rules or by the City Council, shall pay all costs of preparation and review of
the EAW and, upon the request of and in the manner prescribed by the city,
shall provide all necessary data and research to prepare a draft EAW.
      (3)   The city and the applicant for a permit for any action for which an
environmental impact statement (EIS) is required shall comply with the
provisions of the rules governing assessment of cost for environmental impact
statements, one copy of which is on file in the office of the Zoning
Administrator, unless the applicant and the City Council provide otherwise by a
written agreement.
      (4)   No permit for an action for which an EAW or an EIS is required
shall be issued until all costs of preparation and review which are to be paid
by the applicant are paid, and all information required is supplied, and until
the environmental review process has been completed as provided in this chapter
and the rules adopted by reference by this chapter, and pursuant to any written
agreement entered into by the applicant for the permit or permits and the City
Council.
      (5)   The applicant for a permit for any action for which an EAW or EIS
is required and the City Council may, in writing, agree as to a different
division of the costs of preparation and review of any EAW or EIS.
   (C)   Administration.
      (1)   The Zoning Administrator shall be the person responsible for the
administration of the environmental review program, this section, and rules
adopted by reference by this section.
      (2)   The Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for determining
whether an action for which a permit is required is an action for which an EAW
is mandatory. The Zoning Administrator shall also determine those proposed
actions for which an optional EAW may be required under the provisions of this
chapter and shall notify the Planning Commission and the City Council of these
proposed actions.
      (3)   All EAWs and EISs shall be prepared under the supervision of the
Zoning Administrator, reviewed by the Planning Commission, and reviewed and
approved by the City Council.
      (4)   When reviewing an EAW or EIS, the Zoning Administrator and the
Planning Commission may suggest design alterations which would lessen the
environmental impact of the action. The City Council may require these design
alterations to be made as a condition for issuing the permit when it finds that
the design alterations are necessary to lessen the environmental impact of the
action.
      (5)   After an EAW is prepared, the Planning Commission shall review the
EAW and recommend to the City Council whether or not it should require the
preparation of an EIS. The City Council shall require an EIS when it finds
under state rules that an action is major and has potential for significant
environmental effects.
   (D)   Discretionary or optional EAW. The Planning Commission may, upon
recommendation by the Zoning Administrator, require that an optional EAW be
prepared on any proposed action if the action may be a major action and appears
to have the potential for significant environmental effects. The following
guidelines shall also be considered in determining whether an optional EAW
shall be required:
      (1)   Is the action to be in or near an area that is considered to be
environmentally sensitive or aesthetically pleasing?
      (2)   Is the action likely to have disruptive effects such as generating
traffic and noise?
      (3)   Are there public questions or controversy concerning the
environmental effects of the proposed actions?
      (4)   A four-fifths vote of the controlling authority shall be required
to order a discretionary EAW.
   (E)   Enforcement. No permit shall be issued for a project for which
environmental documents are required until the entire environmental review
procedures established by this chapter are completed. No work shall commence
and any work in progress on any project for which environmental documents are
required shall cease until the environmental review procedures established by
this chapter are fully complied with.
(Prior Code, § 13.10)
§ 154.013 BUILDING PERMITS; CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY.
   (A)   Building permits required. No building or structure shall be erected
or moved or construction on an existing structure shall be started until a
lawful building permit has been issued by the Zoning Administrator or the
designated representative. Fees for all building permits shall be established
by the City Council in accordance with the State Building Code as adopted by
the city.
   (B)   Certificate of occupancy. No building or structure shall be occupied
or used in whole or in part until a certificate of occupancy is issued stating
that the building or structure complies with the provisions of this chapter.

finding the building or structure satisfactory.
(Prior Code, § 13.11)
§ 154.014 ENFORCEMENT; VIOLATIONS.

action for any violations of this chapter at the direction of the City Council
and through the City Attorney as deemed necessary.
(Prior Code, § 13.12)
§ 154.015 HARDSHIP ASSESSMENT DEFERRALS.
   (A)   The City Council may, at its discretion, defer the payment of special
assessments for any homestead property:
      (1)   Owned by a person 65 years of age or older for whom it would be a
hardship to make the payments;
      (2)   Owned by a person who is retired by virtue of a permanent and total
disability for whom it would be a hardship to make the payments; or
      (3)   Owned by a person who is a member of the state’s National Guard or
other military reserves who is ordered into active military service, as defined
in M.S. § 190.05, Subd. 5b or 5c, as it may be amended from time to time, as
stated in the person’s military orders, for whom it would be a hardship to make
the payments.
   (B)   (1)   For purposes of this section, the determination of hardship
shall be made by the City Council upon consideration of the following:
         (a)   The total assets and liabilities of the person claiming the
hardship;
         (b)   The total income of such person whether taxable or non-taxable;
         (c)   The value of any assets transferred by the applicant within
three years of the application for deferral of the assessment; and
         (d)   The total expenses of such person.
      (2)   Determination of hardship can also be made on the basis of
exceptional and unusual circumstances not covered by the standards and
guidelines where the determination is made in a nondiscriminatory manner and
does not give the applicant an unreasonable preference or advantage over other
applicants.
   (C)   For purposes of this section, a person is deemed to be retired by
virtue of a permanent and total disability if such person is determined to be
permanently and totally disabled by the Social Security Administration.
   (D)   For purposes of this section, the burden of proving the existence of a
hardship shall be the responsibility of the applicant for such deferral of any
payment of a special assessment.
   (E)   The procedure to obtain a deferred assessment is as follows.
      (1)   A homeowner shall make application for deferred payment of special
assessments on forms prescribed by the City Administrator and the County
Auditor. Such application may be made at any time while payments of assessments
are due on such property.
      (2)   The application shall be considered for completeness by the Finance
Committee no later than 14 days after receipt of the application by the Clerk-
Treasurer. If the Finance Committee deems the application complete, it shall
refer the application, with its recommendation, to the City Council, to be
heard at the City Council’s next regularly scheduled meeting. A decision shall
be made on such application at such meeting unless additional information is
required by the City Council. In such event, the City Council shall make its
decision at its first regular meeting following receipt of all information it
requires to make its decision. Written notification of the decision of the City
Council shall be provided to the applicant.
      (3)   The City Council shall consider all evidence of hardship presented
to it and make its decision on any application on the basis of written findings
of fact. The City Council shall not grant any request for a deferral of any
payment of a special assessment unless it determines that the payment of such
special assessment would leave the applicant with insufficient funds to pay
applicant’s reasonable living expenses.
      (4)   If the deferred assessment is granted, the City Administrator shall
record a notice thereof with the County Recorder which shall set forth the
amount of the assessment;
      (5)   The City Council may determine by ordinance or resolution the
amount of interest, if any, on the deferred assessment and this rate shall be
recorded by the City Administrator along with and in the same manner as the
amount of the assessment.
      (6)   The applicant must reapply for the deferred assessment each
following year upon the filing of a similar application not later than October
31.
   (F)   The option to defer the payment of special assessments shall terminate
and all amounts accumulated plus applicable interest shall become due upon the
occurrence of any of the following events:
      (1)   The death of the owner, provided that the spouse (if any) is
otherwise not eligible for the benefits hereunder;
      (2)   The sale, transfer, or subdivision of the property or any part
thereof;
      (3)   If the property should for any reason lose its homestead status; or
      (4)   If for any reason the City Council shall determine that there would
be no hardship to require immediate or partial payment.

SHORELAND AND FLOODPLAIN OVERLAY DISTRICT
§ 154.085 INTENT.
   The uncontrolled use of shorelands in the city affects the public health,
safety, and general welfare not only by contributing to pollution of public
waters, but also by impairing the local tax base. Therefore, it is in the best
interests of the public health, safety, and welfare to provide for the wise
development of shorelands and floodplain areas. The state legislature has
delegated responsibility to the municipalities of the state to regulate the
subdivision, use, and development of the shorelands and floodplains and thus
preserve and enhance the quality of surface waters, preserve the economic and
natural values of shorelands, and provide for the wise utilization of waters
and related land resources.
(Prior Code, § 13.28)
§ 154.086 SHORELAND MANAGEMENT CLASSIFICATION.
   (A)   In order to guide the wise development and utilization of shorelands
of public waters for the preservation of water quality, natural
characteristics, economic values, and the general health, safety, and welfare,
all public waters in the city have been given a shoreland management
classification.
   (B)   The public waters of the city have been classified by the Commissioner
of Natural Resources as follows:
      (1)   Natural environment lakes and streams: none identified within the
city;
      (2)   Recreational development lakes and streams: none identified within
the city; and
      (3)   General development lakes and streams: Serpent Lake and Serpent
Creek.
(Prior Code, § 13.29)
§ 154.087 SHORELAND OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   (A)   Intent. The shorelands of the city are designated as a Shoreland
Overlay District. The purpose of the Shoreland Overlay District is to provide
for the wide utilization of shoreland areas in order to preserve the quality
and natural character of the public waters of the city.
   (B)   Permitted uses. All permitted uses allowed and regulated by the
applicable zoning district underlying this Shoreland Overlay District as
indicated on the official zoning map of the city are permitted.
   (C)   Conditional uses. All conditional uses and applicable attached
conditions allowed and regulated by the applicable zoning district underlying
this Shoreland Overlay District as indicated on the official zoning map of the
city are conditional uses. The Department of Natural Resources must be notified
of all conditional uses, amendments, and variances ten days prior to the public
hearing so they may comment. The Department of Natural Resources must be
notified of the final action taken.
   (D)   Nonconforming septic systems. All sanitary facilities inconsistent
with this chapter shall be brought into conformity or discontinued within five
years from June of 1998.
   (E)   General provisions. The standards in this division shall apply to
shorelands of all public waters within the city. Where the requirements of the
underlying zoning district as shown on the official zoning map are more
restrictive than those set forth in this section, the more restrictive
standards shall apply.
   (F)   Impervious surface coverage. Impervious coverage may be increased by
an additional 10% in a Shoreland Overlay District if the following is provided
and approved by the city:
      (1)   A storm water retention plan created by a licensed engineer showing
containment of the five-year, 24-hour storm event on the parcel; and
      (2)   Direct runoff of storm water to water bodies, adjacent properties,
and wetlands shall be eliminated through the use of berms, infiltration ponds,

(Prior Code, § 13.31)
§ 154.089 FLOODPLAIN PROVISIONS.
   (A)   These floodplain provisions are provided for the protection and
preservation of water channels and adjoining floodplains which are reasonably
required to carry the discharge of flood waters and are provided in accordance
with the requirements of state law. This section does not imply that areas
outside the boundaries of these provisions are not subject to flooding and
shall not create liability on the part of the city for any flood damages which
result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully
made under this chapter.
   (B)   These floodplain provisions shall be applied to and superimposed in
conjunction with the shoreland standards and those areas indicated on the
official zoning map shall be subject to these provisions.
   (C)   The area within the floodplain is divided into floodway and flood
fringe. A floodway includes the channel and a ten-foot landward strip on both
sides of Serpent Creek. A flood fringe includes the area outside of the
floodway, but subject to inundation by the regional flood.
   (D)   (1)   Uses having a low flood damage potential and not obstructing
flood flows shall be permitted within the floodway area to the extent that they
are not prohibited by any other ordinance and are allowed within the
residential, commercial, or industrial district which jointly applies, and
provided they do not require structure, fill, or storage of materials or
equipment. In addition, no use shall adversely affect the capacity of the
channels, or floodway of any tributary to the main stream, drainage ditch, or
any other drainage facility or system. Permitted uses are limited to the
following:
         (a)   Residential lawns, gardens, parking areas, and play areas;
         (b)   Industrial-commercial loading areas and parking areas; and
         (c)   Public and private recreational uses.
      (2)   No residential structures shall be allowed within the floodway.
   (E)   In the enforcement of these provisions, the city may request the
Department of Natural Resources to make any appropriate determinations relative
to any proposed development. The city, in its own discretion, may use these
determinations in deciding whether or not to allow a requested use within any
floodplain area.
(Prior Code, § 13.32)
MINERAL EXTRACTIONS
§ 154.100 INTENT.
   The city finds that the extraction of minerals by underground and/or surface
mining is a basic and essential activity making an important contribution to
the economic well-being of the city. The economical availability of iron ore,
sand, gravel, rock, soil, and other materials is vital to their continued
growth. The city further finds that it is not practicable to extract minerals
required by society without disturbing the surface of the earth and producing
waste materials. The danger exists that no compatible land uses could
unnecessarily deny the benefit of these materials to society in the future. It
is further found that the character of mining may create undesirable land and
water conditions which can be detrimental to the health, safety, and welfare
and property rights of the citizens of the community. However, if properly
regulated and if rehabilitation of surface mined lands is required, mining can
take place within the city in such a manner that undesirable side effects of
the operation may be restricted to an acceptable level.
(Prior Code, § 13.33)
§ 154.101 MINERAL EXTRACTION PERMIT.
   (A)   Except as provided in this section, it shall be unlawful for any
operator to engage in the extraction of minerals without having first obtained
a conditional use permit from the city authorizing the work as regulated
further by this section.
   (B)   The permit requirements established by this section shall not apply to
emergency work necessary to preserve life or property. When emergency work is
performed under this section, the operator performing it shall report the
pertinent facts relating to the work to the Zoning Administrator prior to the
commencement of the extraction. The Zoning Administrator shall review the facts
and determine whether an emergency exists and shall by written memorandum
authorize commencement of the emergency exception. An operator commencing
emergency work shall, within ten days following the commencement of that
activity, apply for the issuance of an extraction permit and, on its issuance,
may be required to perform such work as determined to be reasonably necessary
to correct any environmental impairment occasioned by such work.
   (C)   Operators now conducting operations governed by this section and for
which this section requires a permit may continue such operations, but within
60 days of the effective date of the ordinance from which this section derives
shall make application for a permit. Failure to apply for a permit shall be a
violation of this section; however, on request and for cause, the City Council
may extend the time for the initial application to 90 days.
   (D)   An application for a mineral extraction permit shall contain:
      (1)   The name and address of the operator and owner of the land;
      (2)   The correct legal description of the property where the extraction
is proposed to occur;
      (3)   The names of all land owners owning property within one-half mile
of the boundary of the property described previously;
      (4)   Specification of the following, using appropriate maps,
photographs, and surveys:
         (a)   The physical relationship of the proposed mining area to the
community and existing community development;
         (b)   Site topography and natural features, including location of
watercourses and water bodies within the planned mining area;
         (c)   The quality and quantity of minerals to be excavated;
         (d)   The depth of water tables throughout the planned mining area;
and
         (e)   The average thickness of overburden in the area.
      (5)   The purpose of the operation;
      (6)   The estimated time required to complete the operation;
      (7)   The plan of operation, including processing (any operation other
than direct mining and removal), nature of the processing and equipment,
location of the plant, source of water, disposal of water, and reuse of water;
      (8)   Travel routes to and from the site;
      (9)   The plans for drainage, wind and water erosion control
sedimentation, and dust control; and
      (10)   The rehabilitation plan providing for the orderly and continuing
rehabilitation of all excavated land. Such plan shall illustrate, using
appropriate photographs, maps, and surveys, the following:
         (a)   The contour of land prior to excavation, after completion of
excavation, and after completion of rehabilitation;
         (b)   Those areas of the site currently used for storage of topsoil
and overburden;
         (c)   A schedule setting forth the timetable for excavation and
rehabilitation of land lying within the excavation facility; and
         (d)   The depth of all water bodies, the slope of all slopes after
rehabilitation, and a description of the type and quantity of plantings where
revegetation is to be conducted.
   (E)   A permit shall be issued for a period of five years and shall be
renewable for three-year periods thereafter.
   (F)   The mineral extraction permit may be terminated for violation of this
section or any conditions of the permit. No permit shall be terminated until
notification of violation or other cause for termination has been served upon
the operator along with an order that the condition be remedied. The operator
shall have 30 days within which to remedy the condition. No permit may be
terminated until the City Council has held a public hearing to determine
whether the permit should be terminated, at which time the operator shall be
afforded an opportunity to contest the termination.
   (G)   It shall be unlawful to conduct mineral extraction after a permit has
been terminated pursuant to this section.
   (H)   Requests for renewal of the permit shall be made 60 days prior to the
expiration date. If application for renewal is not made within the required
time, all operations shall be terminated; and the reinstatement of the permit
may be granted only upon compliance with the procedures set forth in this
section for an original application.
   (I)   (1)   An extraction permit may be approved or renewed subject to
compliance with conditions in addition to those set forth in this section when
such conditions are reasonable and necessary to ensure compliance with the
requirements and purpose of this section. When such conditions are established,
they shall be set forth specifically in the permit. Conditions may, among other
matters, limit the size, kind, or character of the proposed operation; require
the construction of structures; require the staging of extraction over time;
require the alteration of the site design to ensure compliance with the
standards; and/or require the provision of a performance bond by the operator
to ensure compliance with this division.
      (2)   Neither the issuance of a permit nor compliance with its conditions
nor with the provisions of this division shall relieve any person from any
responsibility otherwise imposed by law for damage to persons or property, nor
shall the issuance of any permit serve to impose any liability on the city, its
officers or employees, for any injury or damage to persons or property.
      (3)   A permit issued pursuant to this division does not relieve the
permittee of the responsibility of securing and complying with any other permit
which may be required by any other law, ordinance, or regulation.
(Prior Code, § 13.34) Penalty, see §
154.999

PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS
§ 154.115 INTENT.
   (A)   The purpose of this subchapter is to provide for the grouping of land
parcels for development as an integrated, coordinated unit as opposed to
traditional parcel by parcel, piecemeal, sporadic, and unplanned approach to
development. This subchapter is intended to introduce flexibility of site
design and architecture for the conservation of land and open space through
clustering of buildings and activities.
   (B)   It is further intended that planned unit developments are to be
characterized by central management, integrated planning and architecture,
joint or common use of parking, maintenance, or open space and other similar
facilities, and a harmonious selection and efficient distribution of uses.
These regulations are not intended as subdivision regulations and should not be
confused as such.
(Prior Code, § 13.37)
§ 154.116 PROCEDURES AND REQUIREMENTS FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF A PLANNED UNIT
DEVELOPMENT.
   (A)   Generally. An application for a conditional use permit shall be filed

unit’s service may be shut off by the city, in addition to the normally
supplied shutoff at the street.
      (2)   Sewer connections. Where more than one unit is served by a sanitary
sewer lateral which exceeds 300 feet in length, provisions must be made for a
manhole to allow adequate cleaning and maintenance of the lateral. All
maintenance and cleaning shall be the responsibility of the property owners’
association or owner.
   (D)   Building types. In addition to the conventional type of construction
and arrangements of building, structure uses and property as allowed by this
subchapter, it shall be permissible to cluster, adjoin, and attach structures
in a row house, townhouse, patio home, or similar style of development within
the planned unit development.
   (E)   Density increases. The number of residential units or structures
within the planned unit development may be increased under provisions within
this section if the City Council finds that the project meets the criteria
established for granting conditional use permits and if the amount of permanent
open space within the project area is at least 25% of the project area. As a
consequence of all planned unit developments’ planned and integrated character,
the number of dwelling units allowed within the respective zoning district may
be increased by 25%. The building, parking, and similar requirements for these
extra units shall be observed in compliance with this chapter.
   (F)   Subdivision and ownership. It shall be permissible within a planned
unit development to subdivide properties into lesser size parcels for
individual ownership and create common open space areas in undivided
proportions under joint ownerships. Such ownership arrangements are commonly
defined as condominium and/or cooperative developments. The joint area of the
project must conform to the minimum area requirements established for the
respective district classification which jointly applies to the property.
   (G)   Minimum project size.
      (1)   Within Residential Districts, a planned unit development shall not
be applied to a parcel of land containing less than one acre.

land, in any district, is discontinued for a period of more than one year, or
is changed to a conforming use, any future use of said structure or land shall
be in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
   (D)   When any nonconforming structure is destroyed by fire or other peril,
such as collapse, explosion, public enemy, act of war or act of God to the
extent of greater than 50% of its market value, and no building permit has been
applied for within 180 days of when the property is damaged, in this case the
city may impose reasonable conditions upon a building permit in order to
mitigate any newly created impact on adjacent property.
   (E)   Any structure which will, under this chapter, become nonconforming but
for which a building permit has been lawfully granted prior to the effective
date hereof, or of amendments thereto, may be completed in accordance with the
approved plans; provided construction is started within 60 days of the
effective date hereof, or amendment thereof, and continues to completion within
one year. Such structure shall thereafter be a legally existing nonconforming
structure.
   (F)   Normal maintenance of a building or other structure containing or
related to a lawful nonconforming use is permitted, including necessary
nonstructural repairs and incidental alterations which do not extend or
intensify the nonconforming use.

are not specifically allowed by M.S. § 462.357, Subd. le shall require a
variance.
(Ord. 2021-04, passed 7-26-2021)
§ 154.296 NONCONFORMING LOTS.
   (A)   Any preexisting lot for which a deed, recorded contract for deed, or
other legal conveyance or plat has been recorded prior to the effective date of
the ordinance from which this chapter derives shall be deemed a permittable lot
without requiring a variance, provided all the setbacks can be maintained and
sanitary provisions for well and sewage disposal can be maintained, and the lot
is at least 50 feet in width and contains at least 5,000 square feet.
   (B)   If two or more preexisting contiguous lots in total could not be
divided into two or more lots meeting 80% of the requirements of this chapter
for a new lot, and are held by the same owner on the effective date of this
chapter, they shall be considered one lot for building and zoning purposes. The
lots shall be tied together with a restriction filed with the County Recorder
permanently requiring that the lots be considered as one lot only. This shall
be required before a building permit is issued.
   (C)   Any lot, preexisting as described in division (A) above, which has
been assessed sanitary sewer and has a separate stub shall be considered a
permittable lot regardless of lot width; however, no lot containing less than
5,000 square feet shall be considered permittable. Commercial sewered lots with
a structure in existence on June of 1998, shall be permittable regardless of
width or area.
   (D)   Nonconformities in Shorelands. Nonconformities located within the
Shoreland Overlay District are subject to the provisions of M.S. § 462.357,
Subd. 1e, paragraphs (d) to (j).
