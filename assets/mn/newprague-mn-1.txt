thirty (30) days in which to file additional signature papers and to correct
the petition in all other particulars. If at the end of that period the City
Council finds that the petition is still insufficient or irregular, the
Secretary of the City Council shall file the petition in the office of the City
Administrator and notify the sponsoring committee. The final finding that the
petition is insufficient or irregular shall not prejudice the filing of a new
petition for the same purpose nor shall it prevent the City Council from
referring the ordinance to the voters at the next regular or special election
at its option.
(Ord. 277, passed 11-17-14)
   Section 5.05. INITIATIVE. Any ordinance that is legislative in character and

budget or capital program, the appropriation of money, the levy of taxes, the
salaries of the City officers or employees, or the conveyance or sale of land),
may be proposed by a petition which shall state at the head of each page or
attached thereto the exact text of the proposed ordinance. If the City Council
passes the proposed ordinance with amendments and a majority of the sponsoring
committee do not disapprove the amended form by a statement filed with the
Secretary of the City Council within ten (10) days of its passage by the City
Council, the ordinance need not be submitted to the voters. If the City Council
fails to enact the ordinance in an acceptable form within sixty (60) days after
the final determination of sufficiency of the petition, the ordinance shall be
placed on the ballot at the next election occurring in the City. If no election
is to occur within one hundred twenty (120) days after the filing of the
petition, the City Council shall call a special election consistent with the
requirements of the laws of the State of Minnesota on the ordinance to be held
within such period. If a majority of those voting on the ordinance vote in its
favor, it shall become effective thirty (30) days after adoption unless the
ordinance specifies a later effective date.
(Ord. 277, passed 11-17-14)
   Section 5.06. REFERENDUM. Any ordinance subject to an initiative that is
legislative in character and that does not involve administrative or quasi-
judicial acts of the City may be subjected to referendum by a petition which
shall state, at the head of each page or on an attached paper, a description of
the ordinance. If the ordinance is not thereafter entirely repealed, it shall
be placed on the ballot at the next election or at a special election called
for that purpose, as the City Council determines. If a majority of the voters
voting thereon favors the ordinance, it shall remain in effect; if a majority
of the voters voting thereon vote against the ordinance, it shall be considered
repealed upon certification of the election results.

margin required by the laws of the State of Minnesota shall be levied as

related to governmental functions; and 3) primarily benefit the public
interest, not a private interest. In establishing, reviewing, and approving the
Policy, the City Council shall consider the opinion of the City Attorney and
statewide sources of authority, which may include judicial determinations,
Minnesota Attorney General opinions, and findings of the Office of the State
Auditor.
   Expenditures related to any of the following activities shall be deemed

anticipated situations, such planning is of little worth if the planning is not
reduced to written form. Personnel familiar with unwritten plans may be
unavailable at the very time it becomes necessary to implement them. A written
plan will furnish a documentary record which can be referred to as needed. This

§ XXII ANNEX L, ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARD RESPONSE.
   (A)   Purpose. To provide an overview of how the City of New Prague will
respond to a radiological hazardous materials accident/incident.
   (B)   Response to hazardous materials accident or incident.
      (1)   Radiological incidents/accidents. In addition to Scott County, the
New Prague Fire Department is responsible for attempting to develop and
maintain the radiological protection response capability necessary to minimize
the threat to citizens in the event of a radiological accident/incident/enemy
attack. This capability includes: monitoring, reporting, assessment,
containment, decontamination and protective actions. Specific responsibilities
are as follows:
         (a)   Peacetime accidents/incidents. In all likelihood, most peacetime
accidents or incidents will be confined to a relatively small area, and will be
minor in impact. However, if an accident/incident is beyond the capabilities of
the city, the Scott County Emergency Management Director can be called upon for
assistance. If the accident/incident is beyond the capability of the County,
the Minnesota Department of Health, Radiation Control Section, has the trained
personal, equipment and authority to provide assistance. For all accidents or
incidents, the city will be responsible for: controlling access to the scene,
providing medical care for victims, preventing the spread of contamination by
people and vehicles, obtaining basis information as to what has happened, and
notifying that State Duty Officer telephone number 651-649-5451.
         (b)   Enemy attack. Although plans and preparations have been made at
the State and Federal levels to assist local governments during periods of
widespread radiological emergency causes by nuclear denotations, such
assistance would probably be slow in coming. Therefore, the city should be
prepared to provide for its own radiological monitoring and decontamination
needs.
      (2)   Other hazardous materials incidents/accidents.
         (a)   Pre-identification and analysis of risk. In response to the
requirements and recommendations contained in the Superfund Amendments and
            Re authorization Act (SARA) or 1986, as well as other legislation,
the following specific risk sites/locations within the city have been pre-
identified:
            1.   “Covered facilities.” (Facilities that possess extremely
hazardous materials.) ( See attachment #6.)
            2.   Other facilities that may contribute to additional risk due to
their closeness to “covered facilities.” ( See Attachment #7.)
            3.   Facilities (schools, hospitals, nursing home, and the like) at
risk due to their facilities with extremely hazardous materials. (See
Attachment #7.)
            4.   Transportation routes for extremely hazardous materials. (See
Attachment #8.)
         (b)   Determination that a release of hazardous materials has
occurred. Facilities located within the city that use, store, manufacture or
transport hazardous materials are responsible for developing systems and
training their employees so as to be able to promptly determine and report that
a release of hazardous materials has occurred. In the event a release occurs
the facility shall immediately contact 911. Similarly, city government
employees who respond to transportation and other accidents/incidents will
receive training designed to help them determine if hazardous materials are
present.
         (c)   Response to a release of hazardous materials.
            1.   Facilities within the city that possess extremely hazardous
materials are required to develop and maintain a procedure that their employees
will follow in the event of a release of those materials. The city should have
the general outline of such a procedure available, should it be requested by
any of the above facilities. The procedure consists of immediately contacting
911, advising the dispatcher of the following information:
               a.   A brief description of the incident (Fire, Explosion,
Release);
               b.   Give a specific location (Building number, side of
building);
               c.   Location where emergency vehicles are needed;
               d.   Any injuries;
               e.   Have an employee(s) meet and direct emergency responders,
with appropriate information as to the type of substance (chemical, gas and the
like) involved;
               f.   Contact the Minnesota Duty Officer (651) 649-5451;
               g.   Contact the National Response Center (1-800-424-8802).
In the event that the public is at risk, notification will be made through
media resources. The procedure should be on file at the New Prague Fire
Department and updated on an annual basis.
            2.   The Scott County Emergency Management Office has conducted a
vulnerability analysis to determine potential populations and facilities which
might be affected by a hazardous materials emergency. The approaches used to
decide the area of the city likely to be affected were the following: resource
manuals: (Technical Guidance for Hazardous Analysis, or U.S. DOT Emergency
Response Guidebook), the CAMEO and facility preplan, and/or other systems.
         (d)   Hazardous materials response capabilities.
            1.   Within the city, the New Prague Fire Department has the
primary responsibility for responding to a serious hazardous materials accident
of incident. Fire Department Personal are trained and equipped to handle the
following type of hazardous materials response; Level I.
            2.   In addition, other Mutual Aid Departments may participate in
the response. These departments will have developed whatever Standard Operating
Guidelines (SOG) they may need in order to carry out the responsibilities
associated with the type of hazard.
            3.   City emergency “first responders” will begin their
determination of the area affected by a hazardous materials release by
identifying/verifying the hazardous materials involved, with the use of CAMEO,
ALOHA, MARPLOT and the Emergency Response Guidebook. ARCVIEW will be used to
aid in determining the plume coverage area.
         (e)   A listing of the major emergency equipment and facilities within
the city are located with the Scott County Emergency Management Department.
   (C)   State support. In the event of other hazardous materials accidents/
incidents that are beyond the capabilities of local government, assistance from
the state hazardous materials response team can be requested. Such requests
will be submitted to the State Duty Officer through the Scott County Emergency
Management Office.
   (D)   Supporting/reference documents.
      (1)   FEMA Civil Preparedness Guide 1-30. Guide for the design and
development of a Local Radiological Defense Support System.
      (2)   The National Response Team’s Hazardous Materials Emergency Plan

the property owner from the connection at the curb stop valve to the property's
water meter. It shall be the property owner's responsibility to maintain and
repair the connections and lines from the connection at the curb stop valve to
the property's water meter.
      (1)   In the case of failure of any water line or connection, it will be
the responsibility of the property owner to make the required repairs. The city
may shut off water to the property and will not turn it back on until the water
line or connection has been repaired.
      (2)   When, at the discretion of the city, a failure, leak, or other
damage will likely result in a significant wasting of water or when damage to
persons or property is likely to occur as a result from the failure, leak, or
damage, the water will be turned off if the property owner does not immediately
proceed with the repair.
   (B)   The New Prague Utilities Commission (NPUC) will repair or replace all
service lines (at the discretion of the NPUC) that meet the following criteria:
      (1)   Must be one inch or smaller in size and that serve a dwelling that
has an individual water meter.
      (2)   The NPUC will be responsible for the section of water service lines
that is connected to the city water main to include the corporation at the
water main and curb stop valve and standpipe located in public right-of-way or
utility easement.
      (3)   The NPUC will repair all sections of the street, curb and sidewalk
that are required to be removed to make the repairs.
      (4)   Should the water service line be located in a driveway, the NPUC
will remove the required amount of driveway to make repairs safely and backfill
accordingly, but the property owner shall be responsible for all costs
associated to repair the driveway surface after the repairs are completed.
      (5)   Damages to the public right-of-way will be repaired by the NPUC if
the service leak is on the city side of the curb stop valve. If the service
leak is determined or discovered to be on the property owner's side of the curb
stop valve, it will be the property owner's responsibility to make repairs and
restore all property in the public right-of-way.

connected to the city water main, such as with homeowners associations, where
the associations will be responsible for all related repairs.
      (8)   The NPUC shall not be responsible for restoring or maintain any
landscaping near a curb stop.
   (C)   In the event that water service lines to a building or property are no
longer in service or unfit for future service, it shall be the property owner's
responsibility to shut down the services at the connection to the city's water
main. All expenses incurred are to be the property owner's responsibility.
   (D)   Deficiency of water and shutting off water. The city is not liable for
any deficiency or failure in the supply of water to customers whether
occasioned by shutting the water off for the purpose of making repairs or
connections or by any other cause whatever. In case of fire, or alarm of fire,
water may be shut off to ensure a supply for the fire fighting. In making
repairs or construction of new water lines, water may be shut off at any time
and kept off so long as may be necessary.
   (E)   Increasing size of water service. When it is desired to increase the
size of water service from the main, the property owner must apply for a new
permit and pay the regular tapping charge as if this were a new service.
   (F)   Service lines. Every service line must be laid in such manner as to
prevent rupture by settlement. The service line shall be placed not less than
seven feet below the surface in all cases and shall be so arranged as to
prevent rupture and stoppage by freezing. Frozen service lines between the main
and the building shall be the responsibility of the property owner. Service
lines must extend from the curb stops to the inside of the building, or if not
taken into a building, then to the hydrant or other fixtures which they are
intended to supply. A valve, the same size as the service pipe, shall be placed
close to the inside wall of the building, ahead of the meter and well protected
from freezing. Joints on copper tubing shall be compression-fitted and kept to
a minimum. Not more than one joint shall be used for a service line up to 90
feet in length. All joints shall be left uncovered until inspected. Minimum
size connection with the water mains shall be one inch in diameter.

water system shall be connected with any pump, well, pipe, tank or any device
that is connected with any other source of water supply and when such are
found, the city shall notify the owner or occupant to disconnect the same and,
if not immediately done, the city water shall be turned off. Before any new
connections to the city system are permitted, the city shall ascertain that no
cross connections will exist when the new connections are made. When a building
is connected to the city water system, all private water supplies shall be
disconnected.
   (H)   Opening hydrants. It is unlawful for any person, other than members of
the Fire Department, NPUC or other person duly authorized by the city, in
pursuance of lawful purpose, to open any fire hydrant or attempt to draw water
from the same or in any manner interfere therewith. It is also unlawful for any
person so authorized to deliver or allow to be delivered to any other person
any hydrant key or wrench, except for the purposes strictly pertaining to their
lawful use.
   (I)   Water meters.
      (1)   All water meters shall be purchased, owned and maintained by the
city. Costs for water meters in new construction will be billed to the property
owner as part of the building permit application. Installation of new meters
shall be the responsibility of the property owner or their contractor. All
repairs to water meters not resulting from normal usage shall be the
responsibility of the property owner. All repairs due to normal usage and
replacement of non-functioning meters shall be the city's responsibility.
      (2)   After installation of the water meter the city shall do testing of
such meter, from time to time, to determine accuracy. A fee, as determined by
the NPUC, shall be imposed upon any consumer who requests a meter change or
request testing of an existing meter. If testing of a meter indicates that it
registers in excess of 10% error, the testing fee shall be reimbursed and the
charge to the consumer for the billing period within such test is made, shall
be adjusted.
      (3)   When a multi-unit residential building has only one water meter,
that water meter account must remain in the landlord's name.
   (J)   Code requirements. All piping, connections and appurtenances shall be
installed and performed strictly in accordance with the current Minnesota
Plumbing Code, and only plumbers or authorized employees of the city shall be
permitted to do any work on service pipes or fixtures connected with the water
system. Plumbers requesting connection shall give notice at least 16 business
hours in advance of their need. Failure to install or maintain the same in
accordance therewith, or failure to have or permit required inspections shall,
upon discovery by the city, be an additional ground for termination of water
service to any consumer.
   (K)   Charges and fees. No water will be turned on until all charges,
deposits and fees are paid in full, including any unpaid usage charges for the

be uniformly enforced.
   (B)   The water consumption as determined from the water meter shall be the
valid basis for computing the wastewater flow and sanitary sewer service
charges, all as set forth in this section.
   (C)   Sanitary sewer service user charges provided for in this division
shall be included as a separate item on the regular bill for water. Charges
shall be paid at the same time that the water charges of the person become due,
and payment for water services shall not be accepted without payment also of
the sewer service charge.
   (D)   The total charge for sanitary sewer service shall include a monthly
base rate plus a rate per 1,000 gallons of metered water usage as determined by
resolution, and calculated as follows:
      (1)   Residential customers shall be billed using a monthly sanitary
sewer base rate plus a rate per 1,000 gallons of metered water usage as
calculated by using a customer's November, December and January water
consumption and averaging the usage for those three months. However,
residential customers that have a zero water consumption usage in at least one
month during the months of November, December, or January, shall be billed the
city-wide residential "three month water average," or their actual monthly
water consumption, whichever is less.
      (2)   New accounts, builders and landlords shall be billed using their
actual monthly water consumption up to, but not to exceed, the city-wide
residential three-month (November through January) average of water consumption
plus a monthly base rate; until the next sewer calculation period of November
through January and then shall be billed using their three-month water
consumption average.
   (E)   For multiple dwellings in which separate water meters are not provided
for each residential unit, a monthly base rate shall be billed at the rate set
by resolution for each residential unit. Service to more than one sanitary
sewer customer through one water meter under a single billing will be allowed.
The sanitary sewer base rate will be multiplied by the number of residential
units served. The property owner shall receive only one bill for the multiple
occupancies.
   (F)   Commercial and industrial customers shall be billed using their actual
monthly water consumption.
   (G)   Customers may elect to install a secondary water meter at their
personal expense for purposes of irrigation that will not be subject to any
sanitary sewer charges.

   (B)   For the purpose of calculating storm water drainage fees, all
developed single-family and duplex parcels shall be considered to have an
acreage of one-third acre. The storm water drainage rate shall be as set by
resolution by the City Council.
(Ord. 178, passed 10-5-92)
§ 52.23 CREDITS.
   The Council may adopt policies, recommended by the City Engineer, by
resolution for adjustment of the storm water drainage fee for parcels based
upon hydrologic data to be supplied by the property owner, which data
demonstrates a hydrologic response substantially different from the standards.
The adjustment of storm water drainage fees shall not be made retroactively.
(Ord. 178, passed 10-5-92)
§ 52.24 EXEMPTIONS.
   The following land uses are exempt form storm water drainage fees:

drainage fee questions the correctness of the fee, the person may have the
determination of the charge recomputed by written request to the City Engineer.
   (C)   Each monthly billing for storm water drainage fees not paid when due
shall incur a penalty charge of 10% of the amount past due.
   (D)   Any past due storm water drainage fees in excess of 90 days past due
on October 1 of any year may be certified to the County Auditor for collection
with real estate taxes in the following year, pursuant to M.S. § 444.075,
Subdivision 3, as it may be amended from time to time. In addition, the city
shall also have the right to bring civil action or to take other legal remedies
to collect unpaid fees.

   (A)   The purpose of this section is to protect the public health and safety
arising out of the use of skateboards, roller blades, roller skates and roller
skis within the city. The City Council finds that there are certain public
streets and public property wherein the operation and use of skateboards,
roller blades, roller skates and roller skis create an unnecessary potential
danger to either the user of the devices or the general public, and that the
use of the devices in an improper manner may cause destruction of property.
   (B)   For the purpose of this section, the following definition shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      ROLLER DEVICE. Any one of the following devices:

device to transport a rider, which device is not otherwise secured to the
rider’s feet or shoes.
   (C)   The City Council shall designate streets and public areas prohibited
from roller device use as is necessary. This section, however, does not
prohibit roller device users from crossing prohibited streets at intersections
marked by a crosswalk.
   (D)   The City Council may, in the future and by resolution, prohibit the
use of devices defined in division (B) above in areas of the city in addition
to those prohibited in Traffic Schedule I upon recommendation of the Chief of
Police or the Parks and Recreation Director.
   (E)   Any person who is using any roller device on any of the streets or
roadways within the city which are not specified as prohibited must observe the
same rules of the road as required of bicycles pursuant to M.S. Chapter
169.222, as it may be amended from time to time. Violation of this section is a

places and parties bitten, and shall be given 14 days to appeal this order by
requesting a hearing before the City Council for a review of this
determination.
      (1)   If no appeal is filed, the orders issued will stand or the Animal
Control Officer may order the animal destroyed.
      (2)   If an owner requests a hearing for determination as to the
dangerous nature of the animal, the hearing shall be held before the City
Council, which shall set a date for hearing not more than three weeks after
demand for the hearing. The records of the Animal Control or City Clerk’s
office shall be admissible for consideration by the Animal Control Officer

TALL GRASS AND WEEDS
§ 92.35 LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (A)   It is declared to be the purpose and intent of this subchapter to
protect and preserve the city’s neighborhoods and the public health, safety and
welfare of those who live there. The City Council determines that keeping the
city free of tall grass and noxious weeds improves the quality of life of all
residents by improving aesthetics, by eliminating harbor for rodents and
insects, and by eliminating fire hazards. At the same time, the City Council
recognizes that requiring the mowing of grasses and noxious weeds is sometimes
unreasonable or impractical under certain circumstances.
   (B)   The City Council also determines that a variety of properly maintained
landscaping treatment adds diversity and richness to the quality of life, and
does not want to discourage the preservation, restoration and maintenance of
diverse, biologically stable, and natural plant communities or environmentally
sound practices. The City Council finds that the establishment of prairie,
naturalistic and meadow plant communities are acceptable landscape treatments.
However, as a protection for the larger community, these types of landscaping
treatments must be properly planned, managed and maintained, and the length of
transition period must be minimized or they are likely to cause a public
nuisance.
   (C)   The City Council also determines that a variety of properly cultivated
agricultural crops on vacant lands, including platted but vacant commercial,
industrial and residential land within the city, is an acceptable interim use
for property prior to its permanent development.
(Ord. 255, passed 3-19-12)

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 92.50 NUISANCE ABATEMENT PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Notice. Whenever the city determines that a public nuisance is being
maintained or exists on a premises in the city, the City Administrator or his
or her designated representative may abate the nuisance after providing written
notice to the affected record property owner.
      (1)   The notice shall be given to the affected record property owner by
U.S. mail or personal delivery. Refusal by the recipient to accept the notice
shall not constitute a defense that the notice was not received. If the record
owner is not able to be found, the city shall attach a copy of the notice or a
door hanger with the same information to main entrance door of the principal
structure on the property. The notice shall state the following information:
         (a)   The date;
         (b)   The address or legal description of the property;
         (c)   A description of the nuisance and the section of the city code
which was violated;
         (d)   The steps to be taken in order to abate the nuisance;
         (e)   The date by which the nuisance must be abated (grass and weed
violations must be abated within five calendar days from the date of the
notice);
         (f)   That if the nuisance is not abated by the date stated, the city
will abate the nuisance and the costs incurred by the city will be charged, and
if left unpaid, will be certified to the County Auditor for collection with
property taxes or specially assessed;
         (g)   That the recipient has the right to request a hearing before the
City Council and the date the hearing request must be made by; and
         (h)   A description of the penalties that may apply if the condition
is not corrected.
   (B)   Abatement. If the nuisance is not abated by the date stated in the
notice and no hearing has been requested, the city may abate the nuisance. City
staff must keep a record of the total cost of the abatement attributable to the
property and report the information to the City Administrator.
   (C)   Abatement charges. When the abatement has been completed and the cost
determined, the city shall prepare a bill and mail it to the record owner and
thereupon the amount shall be immediately due and payable. If the record owner
fails to pay the bill, the total charges may be certified by the city to the
County Auditor for collection with property taxes as set forth in §
34.01 of this code or specially assessed in accordance with M.S. §§ 429.101 and
429.061, as they may be amended from time to time, whichever may be applicable.
   (D)   Emergency abatement. Nothing in this subchapter shall prevent the
city, without notice or other process, from immediately abating any nuisance
condition in an emergency situation which poses an imminent and serious hazard
to the pubic health, safety, or welfare. To proceed with immediate abatement,
the city official shall determine that a public nuisance exists or is being
maintained on the premises and that delay in abatement will unreasonably
endanger the public health, safety, or welfare. If at all possible, the city
official shall attempt to notify the record owner of the nature of the nuisance
and the abatement prior to the abatement. If notification prior to abatement is
not possible, the city official shall notify the record owner as soon as
practicable after abatement.

sidewalk in question shall be made within 20 days of the notice.
   (D)   If the work shall not be fully done and the sidewalk shall not be

an emergency situation which poses an imminent and serious hazard to the public
health, safety, or welfare. To proceed with immediate correction, the Public
Works Director or his or her designated representative shall determine that an
imminent or serious hazard exists and that delay in correction will

where possible. To the extent any provision of this subchapter cannot be
interpreted consistently with the Minnesota Rules, that interpretation most

(Ord. 342, passed 10-2-2023)
§ 93.65 WORK DONE WITHOUT A PERMIT.
   (A)   Emergency situations.  
      (1)   Each registrant shall immediately notify the city of any event
regarding its facilities which it considers to be an emergency. The registrant
of the facilities may proceed to take whatever actions are necessary to respond
to the emergency. Excavators’ notification to Gopher State One Call regarding
an emergency situation does not fulfill this requirement. Within two business
days after the occurrence of the emergency, the registrant shall apply for the
necessary permits, pay the fees associated therewith and fulfill the rest of
the requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with this chapter
for the actions it took in response to the emergency.
      (2)   If the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding facilities, the
city will attempt to contact the local representative of each registrant
affected, or potentially affected, by the emergency. In any event, the city may
take whatever action it deems necessary to respond to the emergency, the cost
of which shall be borne by the registrant whose facilities occasioned the
emergency.
   (B)   Non-emergency situations. Except in an emergency, any person who,
without first having obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or excavates a
right-of-way must subsequently obtain a permit, and as a penalty pay double the
normal fee for the permit, pay double all the other fees required by this code,
deposit with the city the fees necessary to correct any damage to the right-of-
way and comply with all of the requirements of this chapter.
(Ord. 342, passed 10-2-2023)
§ 93.66 SUPPLEMENTARY NOTIFICATION.
   If the obstruction or excavation of the right-of-way begins later or ends
sooner than the date given on the permit, the permittee shall notify the
Director of the accurate information as soon as this information is known.
(Ord. 342, passed 10-2-2023)
§ 93.67 REVOCATION OF PERMITS.
   (A)   Substantial breach. The city reserves its right, as provided herein,
to revoke any right-of-way permit, without a fee refund if there is a
substantial breach of the terms and conditions of any statute, ordinance, rule
or regulation, or any material condition of the permit. A substantial breach by
the permittee shall include, but shall not be limited, to the following:
      (1)   The violation of any material provision of the right-of-way permit;
      (2)   An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the right-
of-way permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit
upon the city or its citizens;
      (3)   Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a
right-of-way permit;
      (4)   The failure to complete the work in a timely manner; unless a
permit extension is obtained or unless the failure to complete work is due to
reasons beyond the permittees control; or
      (5)   The failure to correct, in a timely manner, work that does not
conform to a condition indicated on an order issued pursuant to §
93.64.
   (B)   Written notice of breach. If the city determines that the permittee
has committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any statute,
ordinance, rule, regulation or any condition of the permit the city shall make
a written demand upon the permittee to remedy that violation. The demand shall
state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. A
substantial breach, as stated above, will allow the city, at its discretion, to
place additional or revised conditions on the permit to mitigate and remedy the
breach.
   (C)   Response to notice of breach.  Within 24 hours of receiving
notification of the breach, the permittee shall provide the city with a plan,
acceptable to the city, that will cure the breach. The permittee’s failure to
so contact the city, or the permittee’s failure to submit an acceptable plan,
or the permittee’s failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be
cause for immediate revocation of the permit. Further, permittee’s failure to
so contact the city, or permittee’s failure to submit an acceptable plan, or
permittee’s failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall
automatically place the permittee on probation for one full year.
   (D)   Cause for probation. From time to time, the city may establish a list
of conditions of the permit, which if breached will automatically place the
permittee on probation for one full year, such as, but not limited to, working
out of the allotted time period or working on right-of-way grossly outside of
the permit authorization.
   (E)   Automatic revocation. If a permittee, while on probation, commits a
breach as outlined above, permittee’s permit will automatically be revoked and
permittee will not be allowed further permits for one full year, except for
emergency repairs.
   (F)   Reimbursement of city costs. If a permit is revoked, the permittee
shall also reimburse the city for the city’s reasonable costs, including
restoration costs and the costs of collection and reasonable attorneys’ fees
incurred in connection with the revocation.
(Ord. 342, passed 10-2-23)
§ 93.68 MAPPING DATA.
   (A)   Information required. Each registrant and permittee shall provide
mapping information required by the city in accordance with Minn. Rules, parts
7819.4000 and 7819.4100. Within 90 days following completion of any work
pursuant to a permit, the permittee shall provide the Director accurate maps
and drawings certifying the “as-built” location of all equipment installed,
owned, and maintained by the permittee. Such maps and drawings shall include
the horizontal and vertical location of all facilities and equipment and shall
be provided consistent with the city’s electronic mapping system, when
practical or as a condition imposed by the Director. Failure to provide maps
and drawings pursuant to this subsection shall be grounds for revoking the
permit holder’s registration.
   (B)   Service laterals. All permits issued for the installation or repair of
service laterals, other than minor repairs as defined in Minn. Rules, part
7560.0150, subp. 2, shall require the permittee’s use of appropriate means of
establishing the horizontal locations of installed service laterals and the
service lateral vertical locations in those cases where the Director reasonably
requires it. Permittees or their subcontractors shall submit to the Director
evidence satisfactory to the Director of the installed service lateral
locations. Compliance with this section and with applicable Gopher State One
Call law and Minnesota Rules governing service laterals installed after Dec.
31, 2005, shall be a condition of any city approval necessary for:
      (1)   Payments to contractors working on a public improvement project,
including those under M.S. Ch. 429; and
      (2)   City approval under development agreements or other subdivision or
site plan approval under M.S. Ch. 462. The Director shall reasonably determine
the appropriate method of providing such information to the city. Failure to
provide prompt and accurate information on the service laterals installed may
result in the revocation of the permit issued for the work or future permits to
the offending permittee or its subcontractors.
(Ord. 342, passed 10-2-23)
§ 93.69 LOCATION AND RELOCATION OF FACILITIES.
   (A)   Compliance required. Placement, location, and relocation of facilities
must comply with applicable laws, and with Minn. Rules parts 7819.3100,
7819.5000 and 7819.5100, as they may be amended from time to time, to the
extent the rules do not limit authority otherwise available to cities.
   (B)   Corridors. The city may assign a specific area within the right-of-
way, or any particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of
facilities that is or, pursuant to current technology, the city expects will
someday be located within the right-of-way. All excavation, obstruction, or
other permits issued by the city involving the installation or replacement of
facilities shall designate the proper corridor for the facilities at issue. Any
registrant who has facilities in the right-of-way in a position at variance
with the corridors established by the city shall, no later than at the time of
the next reconstruction or excavation of the area where the facilities are
located, move the facilities to the assigned position within the right-of-way,
unless this requirement is waived by the city for good cause shown, upon
consideration of such factors as the remaining economic life of the facilities,
public safety, customer service needs, and hardship to the registrant.
   (C)   Nuisance. One year after the passage of this section, any facilities
found in a right-of-way that have not been registered shall be deemed to be a
nuisance. The city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in
equity, including, but not limited to, abating the nuisance or taking
possession of the facilities and restoring the right-of-way to a useable
condition.
   (D)   Limitation of space.  To protect the health, safety, and welfare or
when necessary to protect the right-of-way and its current use, the Director
shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional
facilities within the right-of-way. In making those decisions, the Director
shall strive to the extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential
users of the right-of-way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of
the public interest, the public’s needs for the particular utility service, the
condition of the right-of-way, the time of year with respect to essential
utilities, the protection of existing facilities in the right-of-way, and
future city plans for public improvements and development projects which have
been determined to be in the public interest.
(Ord. 342, passed 10-2-23)
§ 93.70 PRE-EXCAVATION FACILITIES LOCATION.
   In addition to complying with the requirements of M.S. § 216D.01-09 (“One
Call Excavation Notice System”) before the start date of any right-of-way
excavation, each registrant who has facilities or equipment in the area to be
excavated shall mark the horizontal and vertical placement of all said
facilities. Any registrant whose facilities are less than 20 inches below a
concrete or asphalt surface shall notify and work closely with the excavation
contractor to establish the exact location of its facilities and the best
procedure for excavation.
(Ord. 342, passed 10-2-23)
§ 93.71 DAMAGE TO OTHER FACILITIES.
   When the city does work in the right-of-way and finds it necessary to
maintain, support, or move a registrant’s facilities to protect it, the
Director shall notify the local representative as early as is reasonably
possible. The costs associated therewith will be billed to that registrant and
must be paid within 30 days from the date of billing. Each registrant shall be
responsible for the cost of repairing any facilities in the right-of-way which
it or its facilities damages. Each registrant shall be responsible for the cost
of repairing any damage to the facilities of another registrant caused during
the city’s response to an emergency occasioned by that registrant facilities.
(Ord. 342, passed 10-2-23)
§ 93.72 RIGHT-OF-WAY VACATION.
   If the city vacates a right-of-way which contains the facilities of a
registrant, the registrant’s rights in the vacated right-of-way are governed by
Minn. Rules part 7819.3200, as it may be amended from time to time.
(Ord. 342, passed 10-2-2023)
§ 93.73 INDEMNIFICATION AND LIABILITY.
   By applying for and accepting a permit under this chapter, a permittee
agrees to defend and indemnify the city in accordance with the provisions of
Minn. Rules 7819.1250, as it may be amended from time to time.
(Ord. 342, passed 10-2-2023)
§ 93.74 ABANDONED AND UNUSABLE FACILITIES.
   (A)   Discontinued operations. A registrant who has determined to
discontinue all or a portion of its operations in the city must provide
information satisfactory to the city that the registrant’s obligations for its
facilities in the right-of-way under this subchapter have been lawfully assumed
by another registrant.
   (B)   Removal. Any registrant who has abandoned facilities in any right-of-
way shall remove it from that right-of-way if required in conjunction with
other right-of-way repair, excavation, or construction, unless this requirement
is waived by the city.
(Ord. 342, passed 10-2-23)
§ 93.75 APPEAL.
   A right-of-way user that has been denied registration; has been denied a
permit; has had permit revoked; or believes that the fees imposed are not in
conformity with M.S. § 237.163, subd. 6; or disputes a determination of the
Director regarding § 93.68(B), may have the denial, revocation, or fee
imposition reviewed, upon written request, by the City Council. The City
Council shall act on a timely written request at its next regularly scheduled
meeting provided the right-of-way user has submitted its appeal with sufficient
time to include the appeal as a regular agenda item. A decision by the City
Council affirming the denial, revocation, or fee as imposition will be in
writing and supported by written findings establishing the reasonableness of
the decision.
(Ord. 342, passed 10-2-23)
§ 93.76 RESERVATION OF REGULATORY AND POLICE POWERS.
   A permittee's or registrant's rights are subject to the regulatory and
police powers of the city to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to
protect the health, safety and welfare of the public.
(Ord. 342, passed 10-2-2023)
§ 93.77 SEVERABILITY.
   If any portion of this section is for any reason held invalid by any court
of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct,
and independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the
remaining portions thereof. Nothing in this section precludes the city from
requiring a franchise agreement with the applicant, as allowed by law, in
addition to requirements set forth herein.
(Ord. 342, passed 10-2-23)
§ 93.78 RIGHT-OF-WAY ENCROACHMENTS.
   (A)   Purpose. The public welfare requires that the public rights-of-way
within the city, including highways, roads, streets and alleys, be reserved for
public uses. Public use of the full width of the rights- of-way is necessary to
public safety and the proper and efficient maintenance of the rights-of-way.
However, it is recognized that limited private use or encroachment onto the
rights-of-way is not necessarily inconsistent with public use. It is the
purpose of this section to provide for lawful private use of public rights-of-
way not inconsistent with public use.
   (B)   Permit to encroach.
      (1)   Permit required. The right to use public rights-of-way within the
city for any private use or purpose other than the primary purpose of public
travel, whether the use constitutes a substantial or incidental use, may be
acquired only through issuance of a permit pursuant to this section.
      (2)   Application for permit. Any person may apply to the City
Administrator or his or her designated representative for a permit to
construct, install or locate and maintain private property or improvements
within a publicly-owned right-of-way. The application shall be in writing and
must describe with specificity the private property or improvement and right-
of-way involved and the nature and extent of the requested encroachment. The
applicant shall further provide a hand made drawing (to scale) or survey
drawing showing the location of the proposed encroachment within the right-of-
way. The permit shall become effective upon an associated encroachment
agreement being duly recorded at the offices of the County Recorder. The city
shall be the party responsible for recording the encroachment agreement at the
offices of the County Recorder.
      (3)   Application fee. Each application for a license required by the
provisions of this section shall be accompanied by an application fee in an
amount established by resolution of the City Council, which fee shall be
retained by the city whether or not a license is issued.
      (4)    Issuance of permit; conditions. The City Administrator or his or
her designated representative may grant the permit and draft an encroachment
agreement if it is determined that the encroachment applied for is not
inconsistent with safe and efficient public use of the public right-of-way.
However, no permit will be issued until the landowner has agreed in writing to
waive any right to recover from the city for damage occurring to the item of
encroachment within the right-of-way. The landowner must also agree to hold the
city harmless from any claim of damage or liability against the city arising
out of the encroachment.
      (5)   Revocation of permit. The city reserves the right to revoke any
permit and encroachment agreement granted under this section as may be required
by the public interest.
   (C)   Unlawful encroachments. Any privately-owned property located within or
encroaching upon public rights-of-way which has not been authorized in
accordance with this section shall be unlawful and be subject to removal by the
city at the owner's expense.
   (D)    Exemptions from provisions. The use of the public right-of-way for
the placement of the following items shall be exempt from the permit
requirements of this section:
      (1)   Mailboxes with the following conditions:
         (a)   The mailbox is positioned or clustered according to specific
directions of the city and/or United States Postal Service;
         (b)   Mailboxes servicing a planned unit development (PUD) are
positioned or clustered within the platted portion of the PUD;
         (c)    The location of the mailbox or mailboxes does not interfere
with the city's maintenance of the right-of-way.
      (2)   Grass, ground cover, or flowers that do not extend more than two
feet in height from the ground (trees and shrubs shall not be allowed).
      (3)   Sprinkler systems with an approved lawn sprinkler permit.

creation of a regulatory scheme which establishes areas around locations where
children or vulnerable adults regularly congregate in concentrated numbers. The
purpose of this chapter is to create such a regulatory scheme to further the
city's compelling interest in maintaining public safety by prescribing where
predatory offenders may reside within the city.

offender.
      (2)   A property owner's failure to comply with provisions of this
section shall constitute a violation and shall subject the property owner to
the enforcement provisions and procedures as provided in this chapter and the
city code.
(Ord. 295, passed 2-21-17)
§ 94.04 MEASUREMENT OF DISTANCE.
   For purposes of determining the minimum distance separation, the requirement
shall be measured by following a straight line from the outer property line of
the permanent residence or temporary residence to the nearest outer property
line of the applicable prohibited location. The City Administrator shall
maintain an official map showing prohibited locations as defined by this
chapter. The City Administrator shall update the map at least annually to
reflect any changes in the location of prohibited zones.
(Ord. 295, passed 2-21-17)

§ 110.02 NUDITY ON THE PREMISES OF LICENSED ESTABLISHMENTS PROHIBITED.
   (A)   The City Council finds that it is in the best interests of the public
health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the city that nudity is
prohibited as provided in this section on the premises of any establishment
licensed under this chapter. This is to protect and assist the owners,
operators, and employees of the establishment, as well as patrons and the
public in general, from harm stemming from the physical immediacy and
combination of alcohol, nudity, and sex. The Council especially intends to
prevent any subliminal endorsement of sexual harassment or activities likely to
lead to the possibility of various criminal conduct, including prostitution,
sexual assault, and disorderly conduct. The Council also finds that the
prohibition of nudity on the premises of any establishment licensed under this
chapter, as set forth in this section, reflects the prevailing community
standards of the city.
   (B)   It is unlawful for any licensee to permit or allow any person or
persons on the licensed premises when the person does not have his or her
buttocks, anus, breasts, and genitals covered with a non- transparent material.
It is unlawful for any person to be on the licensed premises when the person
does not have his or her buttocks, anus, breasts, and genitals covered with a
non-transparent material.
   (C)   A violation of this section is a misdemeanor punishable as provided by
law, and is justification for revocation or suspension of any liquor, wine,
brewer taproom, small brewer, or 3.2% malt liquor license or the imposition of
a civil penalty under the provisions of §
10.99.

§ 110.16 ISSUANCE OF LICENSE.
   (A)   Each application shall be in the form prescribed by the Commissioner
of Public Safety. The application shall state, in addition to any other
information required by the Council, the name of the applicant, the age of the
applicant, representations as to the character of the applicant with any
references as the Council may require, the citizenship of the applicant, the
type of license applied for, the business in connection with which the proposed
license would be issued and its location, whether the applicant is owner and

at that location. Every application for issuance or renewal of a license shall
also include a copy of each summons received by the applicant under M.S. §
340A.802, as it may be amended from time to time, during the previous year.
   (B)   On the initial application for an on-sale intoxicating liquor license
or an application for a transfer of an existing on-sale intoxicating liquor
license, the city shall conduct a preliminary background and financial
investigation of the applicant. If the Council, or the Commissioner on the
Commissioner's own initiative, determines that a comprehensive background
investigation of the applicant is necessary, the Council may conduct the
investigation itself or contract with the Commissioner for the investigation.
In addition, an investigation may be required prior to renewal of an existing
on-sale-license, when the Council deems it in the public interest. An
investigation fee, as set forth in the fee schedule, shall be charged an
applicant by the city if the investigation is conducted within the state, or
the actual cost, not to exceed $10,000, if investigation is required outside
the state. No license shall be issued, transferred or renewed if the results of
the investigation show, to the satisfaction of the Council, that issuance,
transfer or renewal would not be in the public interest.
   (C)   Prior to approving an application for issuance of a license, the
Council shall provide an opportunity for interested persons to speak for or
against issuance of the license. After full consideration of all relevant
factors, including results of the investigation conducted pursuant to division
(B) above and the comments of interested persons, the Council shall decide
whether or not to approve the application and issue the license.
   (D)   No on-sale wine license or off-sale intoxicating liquor license shall
become effective until approved by the Commissioner of Public Safety.
   (E)   Each license shall be issued only to the applicant and only for the
premises described in the application. A license may not be transferred without
the prior approval of the Council. Where a license is held by a corporation, a
change in the ownership of 10% or more of the stock of the corporation must be
reported in writing to the Council within ten days after the transfer.

M.S. § 340A.409, as it may be amended from time to time. Proof of financial
responsibility shall be filed with the Commissioner of Public Safety. Unless
otherwise specified by the Council or Commissioner of Public Safety, the
minimum requirements for proof of financial responsibility specified in M.S. §
340A.409, Subdivision 1, as it may be amended from time to time, shall be
sufficient. Operation of a licensed business without having on file with the
city at all times effective security as required in this section is cause for
revocation or suspension of the license.

alcoholic beverages. Except in cases of failure of financial responsibility, no
suspension or revocation shall be imposed by either the City Council or the
City Administrator until the licensee has been afforded an opportunity for a
hearing pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, the same being M.S. §§
14.57 through 14.70, as they may be amended from time to time. The penalties
shall be imposed and administrated by the City Administrator. The civil penalty

there exists substantial reason making it more appropriate to deviate. When
deviating from these standards, the city must provide written finding that
supports the penalty.
   (B)   Lapse of required dram shop insurance or bond, or withdrawal of a
required deposit of cash or securities, shall effect an immediate suspension of
any license issued pursuant to the subchapter without further action of the
City Council. Notice of cancellation, lapse of a current liquor liability
policy or bond, or withdrawal of the deposited cash or securities shall also
constitute notice to the licensee of the impending suspension of the license.
The holder of a license who has received notice of lapse of required insurance,
or withdrawal of a required deposit, or of suspension or revocation of a
license may request a hearing thereon, and if the request is made in writing to
the City Administrator, a hearing shall be granted within ten days or a longer
period as may be requested. Any suspension under this division shall continue
until the City Council determines that the financial responsibility
requirements of this subchapter have again been met.
   (C)   Payment of the civil penalty shall be made within 30 days of issuance
of the citation. All multiple-day license suspensions shall run consecutively
starting on the first Friday following the day of the expiration of the time to

The franchisee shall, to the extent of the cable system’s available channel
capacity, provide to each of the subscribers who receive some or all of the
services offered on the system, reception on at least one specially designated
access channel. This specially designated access channel may be used by local
educational authorities and local government on a first-come, first served,
nondiscriminatory basis if the demand for that time arises.
   (B)   During those hours that the specially designated access channel is not
being used by the local educational authorities or local government, the
franchisee shall lease time to commercial or noncommercial users on a first-
come, first-served nondiscriminatory basis if the demand for that time arises.
The franchisee may also use this specially designated access channel for local
origination or other programming during those hours when the channel is not in
use by local educational authorities, local government, or commercial or non-

if needed to each city owned building and public school within 200 feet of

public school served. Any internal wiring and additional outlets requested by
the city or public school for these buildings will be paid for by the city or
school. Installation of a cable drop to any city or public school beyond 200
feet from franchisee’s cable plant that the city or public school wishes to
have served with cable service will be paid for on a time and materials basis

intends to purchase the system.
   (B)   If the city elects to purchase the cable system, the price, terms, and
conditions of the city’s purchase shall be the same as those set forth in the

   (C)   The city’s right to purchase the cable system pursuant to this section
is triggered only when the assets of the cable system are offered for sale. The
city’s rights pursuant to this section are not triggered by the sale or
transfer of stock that creates a new controlling interest in the franchisee,
and are not triggered by any fundamental corporate change in the franchisee.
(Ord. 186, passed 4-17-00)
§ 113.16 REDRESS.
   In case of the failure of the franchisee to substantially perform and carry

the provisions of this chapter, or practices of fraud or deceit upon the
franchising authority, the city may, after a public hearing, determine the
failure. If the franchisee has not cured any failure upon the expiration of the
30-day period, the city may take any steps as it deems necessary to terminate
the franchise. However, before the franchise may be terminated, the franchisee
shall be provided with an opportunity to be heard before the City Council and
to contest the city’s determination, which may include the opportunity for
alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, no penalty or sanction of any kind including revocation or
termination may be imposed when the action or omission is due to acts of God or
reasons beyond the control of the franchisee.

so, then the franchisee shall not be required to comply with those terms of
this chapter which are not also imposed upon the multichannel video
distributor.
   (C)   If the city makes a decision to commence construction and operation of
a cable system in the city, or should construction of a cable system by the
city commence without an identifiable final decision, then franchisee may seek
modification of this agreement as of the date of the final decision to commence
construction and operation, or at the commencement of construction if it begins
without an identifiable final decision, in the manner described below:
      (1)   Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this

§ 116.01 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The City Council finds that pawnbrokers and secondhand goods dealers
potentially provide an opportunity for the commission of crimes and their
concealment because these businesses have the ability to receive and transfer
stolen property quickly and easily, and consumer protection warrants the
regulation of transactions involving pawnbrokers and secondhand goods dealers
as defined herein.
   (B)   Furthermore, the City Council finds that based upon the experiences of
other communities which have pawnbrokers and secondhand goods dealers within
their communities, there is a significant increase in the time spent by local
law enforcement personnel in the checking and regulating of the businesses
through record checking, patrol, checking of inventory, searches and the like.
(Ord. 184, passed 5-18-98)
§ 116.02 ADOPTION OF STATE STATUTES.
   M.S. Chapter 325J, as the same may be amended from time to time, is hereby
adopted in its entirety and incorporated herein and made a part hereof the same
as if completely set forth in full, and is referenced herein as the
“Pawnbrokers Regulations.”
(Ord. 184, passed 5-18-98)
§ 116.03 DEFINITION.
   For the purpose of this chapter, and in addition to the definition set forth
in the Pawnbrokers Regulations, the following definition shall apply unless the
context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   SECONDHAND GOODS DEALER. A person whose regular business includes selling
and/or receiving tangible personal property and whose business is organized for
the sales, excluding motor vehicles, furniture, childrens toys, kitchen
appliances and clothing and related accessories previously used, rented, owned
or leased. The SECONDHAND GOODS DEALER shall obtain a secondhand goods dealer’s
license as herein provided.
(Ord. 184, passed 5-18-98)
§ 116.04 LICENSE REQUIRED.
   In addition to the provisions of the Pawnbrokers Regulations, the following
requirements must be met:
   (A)   No person shall engage in or carry on the business of pawnbroker or
secondhand goods dealer without a license issued therefore by the city for each
and every separate office or place of business operated by the licensee within
the corporate limits of the city.
   (B)   The annual fee for a pawnbroker’s license shall be the sum of $10,000,
and each license shall expire on December 31 of the year of issuance. After the
initial year, each license shall commence on January 1 of each year and
terminate on December 31 of the year of issuance.
   (C)   The annual license fee shall be paid in full before the application
for a license is accepted. In the event the initial license is for less than a
full year, the annual license fee shall be prorated on a monthly basis, or any
part thereof exceeding 15 days. In the event a license is terminated during the
license year, there shall be no refunding of the unused portion of the license
fee.
   (D)   In the event an application for a pawnbroker’s license is not issued
for any reason, including a background investigation of the applicants as
hereinafter provided, the license fee shall be refunded, less the sum of $250
for the investigation. Together with and in addition to the license fee above
provided, a $500 fee for a background check, as provided by §
116.05, shall accompany all applications.
   (E)   A license under this section shall authorize the licensee to carry on
a pawnbroker’s business only at the permanent place of business designated in
the license. No license may be transferred to a different location or to a
different licensee without approval of the city. Any change, directly or
beneficially, in the ownership of any licensee or licensed business location
shall require the application for a new license, and the new owner must meet
all the qualifications and eligibility requirements hereunder, and any fees
required hereunder shall be paid.
   (F)   Any and all property or buildings used for storage of items related to
the business of a pawnbroker must be identified in the application.
   (G)   A pawnbroker may not operate or engage in the business of a secondhand
goods dealer without having obtained a separate license therefore in addition
to a pawnbroker’s license, and a secondhand goods dealer may not conduct,
operate or engage in the business of pawnbroker without having first obtained a
pawnbroker’s license. The procedures and fees for obtaining a secondhand goods
dealer’s license shall be the same as for a pawnbroker’s license.
   (H)   The aforementioned license requirements do not apply to or include the
following:

      (5)   The business of buying or selling only those secondhand goods taken

having an established place of business or of goods sold at open sale from
bankrupt stock;
      (7)   Goods sold at a public market;
      (8)   Goods sold at an exhibition;

and related accessories; and/or
      (10)   Antique dealers and antique shops engaged in the business of
buying and selling antique goods of the type commonly found in antique shops.
   (I)   No pawnbroker’s license or secondhand goods dealer license approved by
the city grants to the licensee a property right or entitlement to the license.
The city may refuse to issue, renew or revoke the license for any reason and
will not incur liability for any damages including, but not limited to direct,
consequential, or incidental damages, deprivation of property, loss of income,

device, or electronic delivery device. This division shall not apply to a
person under the age of 21 that is lawfully involved in a compliance check

authorization and an order prohibiting renewal of the licensee's license for
the prescribed period. No suspension, revocation or other penalty may take
effect until the licensee has received notice, served personally or by mail, of
the alleged violation and an opportunity for a hearing before the City Council.
A decision that a violation has occurred must be in writing.
   (B)   An individual who sells, gives, or otherwise furnishes tobacco, a

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 119.01 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   Studies conducted by the Minnesota Attorney General, the American
Planning Association, and cities such as St. Paul, Minnesota; Indianapolis,
Indiana; Hopkins, Minnesota; Ramsey, Minnesota; Minnetonka, Minnesota;
Rochester, Minnesota; Phoenix, Arizona; Los Angeles, California; and Seattle,
Washington have studied the impacts that adult establishments have on those
communities. These studies have concluded that adult establishments have
adverse impacts on the surrounding neighborhoods. These impacts include
increased crime rates, lower property values, increased transiency,
neighborhood blight, and potential health risks.
   (B)   Based on these studies and findings, the City Council concludes:
      (1)   Adult establishments have adverse secondary impacts of the types
set forth above.
      (2)   The adverse impacts caused by adult establishments tend to diminish
if adult establishments are governed by geographic, licensing, and health
requirements.
      (3)   It is not the intent of the City Council to prohibit adult
establishments from having a reasonable opportunity to locate in the city.
      (4)   M.S. § 394.21, as it may be amended from time to time, allows the
city to adopt regulations to promote the public health, safety, morals and
general welfare.
      (5)   The public health, safety, morals and general welfare will be
promoted by the city adopting regulations governing adult establishments.

TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL PRODUCTS
§ 121.01 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to regulate the sale of legalized adult-use
of any product that contains tetrahydrocannabinol and that meets the
requirements to be sold for human or animal consumption under M.S. § 151.72 for
the following reasons:
   (A)   The city recognizes that, based on the most reliable and up-to-date
scientific evidence, the rapid introduction of newly legalized adult-use THC
products, presents a significant potential threat to the public health, safety,
and welfare of the residents of New Prague, and particularly to youth.
   (B)   The city has the opportunity to be proactive and make decisions that
will mitigate this threat and reduce exposure of young people to the products
or to the marketing of these products and improve compliance among THC product
retailers with laws prohibiting the sale or marketing of THC products to
minors.
   (C)   A local regulatory system for THC product retailers is appropriate to
ensure that retailers comply with THC product laws and business standards of
the city to protect the health, safety, and welfare of our youth and most
vulnerable residents.
   (D)   M.S. § 151.72 requires THC product retailers to check the
identification of purchasers to verify that they are at least 21 years of age,
comply with certain packaging and labeling requirements to protect children and
youth, and meet certain potency and serving size requirements.
   (E)   State law authorizes the Board of Pharmacy to adopt product and
testing standards in part to curb the illegal sale and distribution of THC
products and ensure the safety and compliance of commercially available THC
products in the State of Minnesota.
   (F)   State law does not preempt the authority of a local jurisdiction to
adopt and enforce local ordinances to regulate THC product businesses
including, but not limited to, local zoning and land use requirements and
business license requirements.
   (G)   A requirement for a THC product retailer license will not unduly
burden legitimate business activities of retailers who sell or distribute THC
products to adults but will allow the city to regulate the operation of lawful
businesses to discourage violations of state and local THC product-related
laws.
   (H)   In making these findings and enacting this chapter, it is the intent
of the City Council to ensure responsible THC product retailing, allowing legal
sale and access without promoting increases in use, and to discourage
violations of THC product-related laws, especially those which prohibit or
discourage the marketing, sale or distribution of THC products to youth under
21 years of age.
(Ord. 331, passed 11-7-22)

121.30 of this code are not required to obtain a city license to sell lower-

      (1)   No license shall be issued to a movable place of business as per §

this chapter.
      (2)   No license shall be issued to an exclusive liquor store as defined
in M.S. § 340A.101(10).
   (B)   (1)   An application for a license to sell licensed products shall be

minimum, the full name of the applicant, the applicant’s residential and
business address and telephone numbers, the name of the proposed license
holder, the business location for which the license is sought, and any
additional information the city deems necessary. The completed application

either individually or beneficially for others. It is the duty of each business

in the business. Any change in the ownership or control of the business shall

business, the licensee shall pay an additional investigation fee to be
determined by the city. The city may at any reasonable time examine the

identify the owners, and the city may examine the business records of any other
licensee to the extent necessary to disclose the interest which persons other
than the licensee have in the licensed business. The City Council may revoke
any license issued upon its determination that a change of ownership of a
licensee has actually resulted in the change of control of the licensed
business so as materially to affect the integrity and character of its
management and its operation, but no such action shall be taken until after a
hearing by the City Council on notice to the licensee.
   (C)   The City Council may either approve or deny the license, or may delay
action for a reasonable period of time as is required to permit the city to

necessary. If approved, a license shall be issued to the applicant. If denied,
a notice of denial shall be issued to the applicant at the business address
provided on the application along with the reasons for the denial. The notice
shall also inform the applicant of their right to appeal the City Council’s
decision. If a license is mistakenly issued or renewed to an applicant or
license holder, it shall be revoked by the City Council upon the discovery that
the person, applicant or license holder was ineligible for the license under
this section. If a license application is denied, the earliest an applicant may
reapply is 12 months from the date the license is denied.
   (D)   All licenses are issued for a period of one year. The license period
is from January 1 to December 31. The initial license term will expire at the

a license under this section. The following is not exhaustive or exclusive:

in reasonable stability in the development and redevelopment of the city for
now and in the future, and that the regulations are in the public interest and
for the public good.

§ 131.01 PURPOSE.
   The City Council desires to protect the health, safety and welfare of all
persons living in and visiting the city. The use of alcohol by persons under
the age of 21 is prohibited by State Statute. The City Council intends to
discourage underage possession and consumption of alcohol, even if done within
the confines of a private residence, and intends to hold persons criminally
responsible who host events or gatherings where persons under the age of 21
possess or consume alcohol regardless of whether the person hosting the event
or gathering supplied the alcohol or was present.
(Ord. 238, passed 7-20-09)
§ 131.02 FINDINGS.
   The City Council finds that:
   (A)   Alcohol is an addictive drug which, if used irresponsibly, could have
drastic effects on those who use it as well as those who are affected by the
actions of an irresponsible user.
   (B)   Consumption of alcohol by persons under the age of 21 is harmful to
those persons and constitutes a potential threat to public safety from injuries
related to alcohol consumption, such as alcohol overdose or alcohol-related
traffic collisions.
   (C)   As a result, events and gatherings held on private or public property
where alcohol is possessed or consumed by persons under the age of 21 should be
prevented as much as possible.
   (D)   Events or gatherings involving underage possession and consumption
often occur outside the presence of parents or other responsible adults.
However, there are times when a parent or other adult is present and condones
the activity, and, in some circumstances, provides the alcohol.
   (E)   Even though giving or furnishing alcohol to an underage person is a
crime, it is difficult to prove, and an ordinance is necessary to help further
combat underage consumption.
   (F)   A deterrent effect will be created by holding a person criminally
responsible for hosting an event or gathering where underage possession or
consumption occurs.
(Ord. 238, passed 7-20-09)

§ 152.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   Statutory authorization. This floodplain chapter is adopted pursuant
to the authorization and policies contained in M.S. Ch. 103F; Minn. Rules,
Parts 6120.5000 through 6120.6200; the rules and regulations of the National
Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) in 44 CFR §§ 59 through 80; and the planning and
zoning enabling legislation in M.S. Ch. 462.
   (B)   Purpose.
      (1)   This chapter regulates development in the flood hazard areas of the
City of New Prague. These flood hazard areas are subject to periodic
inundation, which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare by minimizing these losses and disruptions.
      (2)   This chapter is adopted in the public interest to promote sound
land use practices, and floodplains are a land resource to be developed in a
manner which will result in minimum loss of life and threat to health, and
reduction of private and public economic loss caused by flooding.
      (3)   This chapter is adopted to maintain eligibility in the National
Flood Insurance Program.
      (4)   This chapter is also intended to preserve the natural
characteristics and functions of watercourses and floodplains in order to
moderate flood and stormwater impacts, improve water quality, reduce soil
erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitat, provide recreational
opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits and enhance community and economic
development.
   (C)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. It is not intended by this
chapter to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or
private agreements. The standards in this chapter take precedence over any less
restrictive, conflicting local laws, ordinances, or codes. All other ordinances
inconsistent with this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the
inconsistency only.
   (D)   Warning and disclaimer of liability. This chapter does not imply that
areas outside the floodplain districts or land uses permitted within such
districts will be free from flooding or flood damages. Not all flood risk is
mapped. Larger floods do occur and the flood height may be increased by man-
made or natural causes, such as ice jams or bridge openings restricted by
debris. This chapter does not create liability on the part of the City of New
Prague or its officers or employees for any flood damages that result from
reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made
hereunder.
(Ord. 349, 5-20-24)
§ 152.02 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined, words or phrases used in this chapter must be
interpreted according to common usage and so as to give this chapter its most
reasonable application.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year. BASE FLOOD is synonymous with the term “regional flood” used in
Minn. Rules, Part 6120.5000.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation of the base flood, regional flood,
or 1% annual chance flood. The term BASE FLOOD ELEVATION is used in the flood
insurance study.
   DEVELOPMENT. Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate
including, but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations, or storage of
materials or equipment.
   FARM FENCE. An open type of fence of posts and horizontally run wire,
further specified in M.S. § 344.02, Subd. l(a) through 1(d).
   FLOOD FRINGE. The portion of the 1% annual chance floodplain located outside
of the floodway.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map of a community, on which
the Federal Insurance Administrator has delineated both the special hazard
areas and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. A FIRM that has
been made available digitally is called a digital flood insurance rate map 
(DFIRM).
   FLOODPLAIN. The beds, channel and the areas adjoining a wetland, lake or
watercourse, or other source which have been or hereafter may be inundated by
the base flood.
   FLOODWAY. The bed of a wetland or lake and the channel of a watercourse and
those portions of the adjoining floodplain which must be reserved to carry or
store the base flood discharge without cumulatively increasing the water
surface elevation more than one-half foot.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include the term “recreational vehicle.”
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle that is built on a single chassis, is 400
square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, is
designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and
is designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary
living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. Those
vehicles not meeting this definition shall be considered a structure for the
purposes of this chapter. For the purposes of this chapter, the term
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE is synonymous with the term “travel trailer/travel
vehicle.”
   REGULATORY FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION (RFPE). An elevation no lower than one
foot above the elevation of the base flood plus any increases in water surface
elevation caused by encroachments on the floodplain that result from
designation of a floodway. These increases in water surface elevations are
typically identified in the floodway data tables, found in the flood insurance
study.
   STRUCTURE. A roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that
is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. Recreational
vehicles not considered travel-ready, as detailed in §
152.04(C)(10), shall also be considered a nonconforming STRUCTURE for the
purposes of this chapter.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure where the
cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or
exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred “substantial
damage,” regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
      (2)   Any alteration of a “historic structure,” provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
“historic structure.” For the purpose of this chapter, “historic structure” is
defined in 44 CFR § 59.1.
(Ord. 349, passed 5-20-24)

   (B)   Activities not requiring a permit. Certain uses or activities may be
exempt from obtaining a permit, such as planting a garden, farming, or other
obviously insignificant activities such as putting up a mailbox or flagpole.
Farm fences, as defined in §
152.02, are not considered to be an obstruction, and as such, do not require a
permit. A local permit is not required if a public waters work permit has been
obtained from the Department of Natural Resources, unless a significant area
above the ordinary high water level is also to be disturbed. The continuation
of existing uses, when the associated activities do not encroach further on the
regulatory floodplain or trigger associated standards in this chapter, do not
require a permit.
   (C)   Minimum development standards.
      (1)   All development must:
         (a)   Be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement resulting from hydrodynamic and
hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy;
         (b)   Be constructed with materials and equipment resistant to flood
damage;
         (c)   Be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood
damage;
         (d)   Be reasonably safe from flooding and consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage;
         (e)   Be assured to provide adequate drainage to reduce exposure to
flood hazards;
         (f)   Not be detrimental to uses in adjoining areas; and
         (g)   Not adversely affect the efficiency or restrict the flood
carrying capacity of the channel and adjoining floodplain of any tributary
watercourse or drainage system.
      (2)   Buildings and structures.  No new structures, such as buildings or
accessory structures may be permitted in the regulatory floodplain.
Modifications and alterations of nonconforming structures is subject to the
standards in §
152.05.
      (3)   Subdivisions. All new lots must be able to accommodate for a
building site with a natural grade outside of the floodplain. All subdivisions
must have vehicular access both to the subdivision and to the individual
building sites no lower than two feet below the regulatory flood protection
elevation (RFPE).
      (4)   Encroachment analysis. Development in the following areas requires
hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed by a professional engineer, or
using other standard engineering practices (e.g. projects that restore the site
to the previous cross-sectional area).
         (a)   In a floodway, development may not result in any of the
following during the 1% annual chance flood: cause a stage increase of 0.00
feet or greater, obstruct flood flows, or increase velocities.
         (b)   In areas where a floodway has not been delineated, development
may not allow stage increases more than one-half foot at any point during the
1% chance flood. This evaluation must include the cumulative effects of
previous encroachments. A lesser water surface elevation increase than one-half
foot is required if, due to the water surface level increase, increased flood
damages would potentially result.
      (5)   Fences not meeting the definition of farm fences are not permitted.
      (6)   Transportation facilities. Railroad tracks, roads, and bridges must
be elevated to the regulatory flood protection elevation (RFPE) where such
facilities are essential to the orderly functioning of the area, or where
failure or interruption would result in danger to public health or safety.
Minor or auxiliary roads or railroads may be constructed at a lower elevation
where failure or interruption of transportation services would not endanger the
public health or safety. All public transportation facilities should be
designed to minimize increases in flood elevations.
      (7)   Public utilities. All utilities such as gas, electrical, sewer, and
water supply systems to be located in the floodplain must be elevated and/or
floodproofed to the regulatory flood protection elevation (RFPE), be located
and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage, and be designed to
eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the
systems into flood waters. All public utilities should be designed to minimize
increases in flood elevations. New solid waste management facilities, as
defined in Minn. Rules, Part 7035.0300, are prohibited. Water supply systems
are subject to the provisions in Minn. Rules, Part 4725.4350.
      (8)   Potential pollutants. Materials that, in time of flooding, are
buoyant, flammable, explosive, or could be injurious to human, animal, or plant
life, as well as those likely to cause pollution of the waters, such as sewage;
sand; rock; wrecked and discarded equipment; dredged spoil; municipal,
agricultural or industrial waste; and other wastes as further defined in M.S. §
115.01, are prohibited.
      (9)   Land alterations. In areas within 25 feet of the ordinary high
water level, land alterations
shall be restricted to:
         (a)   The minimum required to accommodate beach and access areas, not
to exceed a volume
greater than ten cubic yards; and
         (b)   The minimum required to accommodate for public utilities, roads,
railroad tracks, bridges, and shoreline stabilization projects to correct an
identified erosion problem, as verified by a qualified resource agency or the
Zoning Administrator.
      (10)   Recreational vehicles must be travel-ready, meeting the following
criteria:
         (a)   The vehicle must be fully licensed;
         (b)   The vehicle must be ready for highway use, meaning on wheels or
the internal jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type
utilities; and
         (c)   No permanent structural type additions may be attached to the
vehicle.
      (11)   Private, on-site water supply, individual sewage treatment
systems, and other service facilities shall be subject to applicable provisions
detailed in division (C)(7) of this section. Replacement of on-site sewage
treatment systems are to be constructed to avoid impairment to them or
contamination from them during times of flooding, shall not be located in a
designated floodway, and are subject to the provisions in Minn. Rules, Part
7080.2270. No new private service facilities may be permitted in the regulatory
floodplain.
(Ord. 349, passed 5-20-24)
§ 152.05 NONCONFORMITIES.
   (A)   Continuance of nonconformities. A use, structure, or occupancy of land
which was lawful before the passage or amendment of this chapter, but which is
not in conformity with the provisions of
this chapter, may be continued subject to the following conditions:
      (1)   Within the floodway, or where the floodway has not been delineated,
any expansion or enlargement of uses or structures is prohibited.
      (2)   Any addition, modification, rehabilitation, repair, or alteration
shall be in conformance with the provisions of this chapter, shall not increase
the flood damage potential or increase the degree of obstruction to flood
flows, and where applicable, must be protected to regulatory flood protection
elevation (RFPE).
      (3)   If any nonconforming structure is determined to be substantially
damaged or substantially improved based on the procedures in division (C) of
this section, it may not be reconstructed except in conformity with the
provisions of this chapter.
      (4)   If any nonconforming use, or any use of a nonconforming structure,
is discontinued for more than one year, any future use of the premises must
conform to this chapter.
   (B)   Standards for modifications and alterations of nonconforming
structures. In addition to the standards identified in §
152.04(C), the following standards and procedures apply to additions,
modifications, rehabilitations, repairs, alterations, or maintenance of
nonconforming structures:
      (1)   All structures, including manufactured homes, must be elevated on
fill so that the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement)
is at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation (RFPE). The finished
fill elevation shall be at or above the elevation associated with the base
flood plus any stage increases that result from designation of a floodway. Fill
must extend at the same elevation at least 15 feet beyond the outside limits of
the structure. Elevations must be certified by a registered professional
engineer, land surveyor or other qualified person designated by the Zoning
Administrator.
      (2)   Electrical, heating, ventilation, ductwork, plumbing, and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities are designed and/or located
so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components
during conditions of flooding.
   (C)   Substantial improvement and substantial damage determinations. Prior
to issuing any permits for additions, modifications, rehabilitations, repairs,
alterations, or maintenance to nonconforming structures, the Zoning
Administrator is required to determine if such work constitutes substantial
improvement or repair of a substantially damaged structure. A determination
must be made in accordance with the following procedures:
      (1)   Estimate the market value of the structure. In the case of repairs,
the market value of the structure shall be the market value before the damage
occurred and before any restoration or repairs are made.
      (2)   Estimate the cost of the project. The property owner shall
accommodate for inspection, and furnish other documentation needed by the
Zoning Administrator to evaluate costs.
         (a)   Improvement costs shall be comprised of the market rate of all
materials and labor, as well as the costs of all ordinary maintenance and
upkeep carried out over the past one year.
         (b)   Costs to repair damages shall be comprised of the market rate of
all materials and labor required to restore a building to its pre-damaged
condition regardless of the work proposed, as well as associated improvement
costs if structure is being restored beyond its predamaged condition.
      (3)   Compare the cost of the improvement, repairs, or combination
thereof to the estimated market value of the structure, and determine whether
the proposed work constitutes substantial improvement or repair of a
substantially damaged structure, as defined in §
152.02.
      (4)   Based on this determination, the Zoning Administrator shall prepare
a determination letter and notify the property owner accordingly. Structures
determined to be substantially damaged or substantially improved may not be
reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 349, passed 5-20-24)
§ 152.06 ADMINISTRATION.
   (A)   Duties.  A Zoning Administrator or other official must administer and
enforce this chapter.
      (1)   Permit application requirements. Permit applications must be
submitted to the Zoning Administrator. The permit application must include the
following, as applicable:
         (a)   A site plan showing all existing or proposed buildings,
structures, service facilities, potential obstructions, and pertinent design
features having an influence on the permit.
         (b)   Location and detail of grading, fill, or storage of materials.
         (c)   Copies of any required local, state or federal permits or
approvals.
         (d)   Other relevant information requested by the Zoning Administrator
as necessary to properly evaluate the permit application.
      (2)   Recordkeeping. The Zoning Administrator must maintain applicable
records in perpetuity
documenting:
         (a)   Encroachment analysis, as detailed in §
152.04(C)(4).
         (b)   Final elevations, as applicable, detailing the elevation to
which structures and improvements to structures are constructed or
floodproofed. Elevations shall be determined by an engineer, architect,
surveyor or other qualified individual, as approved by the Zoning
Administrator.
         (c)   Substantial damage and substantial improvement determinations,
as detailed in §
152.05(C), including the cost of improvements, repairs, and market value.
         (d)   All variance actions, including justification for their
issuance, and must report such variances as requested by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
   (B)   Variances.
      (1)   An application for a variance to the provisions of this chapter
will be processed and reviewed in accordance with M.S. § 462.357, Subd. 6(2)
and this section.
      (2)   Variances must not be issued within any designated regulatory
floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
      (3)   Variances from the provisions in this chapter may only be issued by
a community upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      (4)   Variances from the provisions in this chapter may only be issued
upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering
the flood hazard, to afford relief.
      (5)   Variances must be consistent with the general purpose of these
standards and the intent of applicable provisions in state and federal law.
      (6)   Though variances may be used to modify permissible methods of flood
protection, no variance shall permit a lesser degree of flood protection than
the regulatory flood protection elevation (RFPE).
      (7)   The Zoning Administrator must notify the applicant for a variance
that:
         (a)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the
base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and
         (b)   Such construction below the base or regional flood level
increases risks to life and property. Such notification must be maintained with
a record of all variance actions.
   (C)   Notifications for watercourse alterations. Before authorizing any
alteration or relocation of a river or stream, the Zoning Administrator must
notify adjacent communities. If the applicant has applied for a permit to work
in public waters pursuant to M.S. § 103G.245, this will suffice as adequate
notice. A copy of the notification must also be submitted to FEMA.
   (D)   Notification to FEMA when physical changes increase or decrease base
flood elevations. Where physical changes affecting flooding conditions may
increase or decrease the water surface elevation of the base flood, the City of
New Prague must notify FEMA of the changes in order to obtain a letter of map
revision (LOMR), by submitting a copy of the relevant technical or scientific
data as soon as practicable, but no later than six months after the date such
supporting information becomes available. Within areas where the floodway has
not been delineated, a map revision is only required if development results in
stage increases greater than one-half foot.
   (E)   Notifications to the Department of Natural Resources.
      (1)   All notices of public hearings to consider variances or conditional
uses under this chapter must be sent via electronic mail to the Department of
Natural Resources respective area hydrologist at least ten days before the

      (2)   A copy of all decisions granting variances and conditional uses
under this section must be sent via electronic mail to the Department of
Natural Resources respective area hydrologist within ten days of final action.
(Ord. 349, passed 5-20-24)
§ 152.07 PENALTIES AND ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Uses in violation of the chapter. Every structure, fill, deposit, or
other use placed or maintained in the floodplain in violation of this chapter
shall be considered a public nuisance.
   (B)   Civil remedies. The creation of a public nuisance may be enjoined and
the maintenance of a public nuisance under this chapter may be abated by an
action brought by the City of New Prague or the Department of Natural
Resources.
   (C)   Enforcement. Violation of the provisions of this chapter constitutes a
misdemeanor and is punishable as defined by law. The Zoning Administrator may
utilize the full array of enforcement actions available to it including but not
limited to prosecution and fines, injunctions, after-the-fact permits, orders
for corrective measures or a request to the National Flood Insurance Program
for denial of flood insurance. The City of New Prague must act in good faith to
enforce these official controls and to correct chapter violations to the extent
possible so as not to jeopardize its eligibility in the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 349, passed 5-20-24)
§ 152.08 AMENDMENTS.
   (A)   Ordinance amendments. Any revisions to the floodplain maps by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or annexations of new map panels require an
ordinance amendment to update the map references in §
152.03(B).
   (B)   Required approval. All amendments to this chapter must be submitted to
the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) for review and approval prior to

managers are responsible to take necessary reasonable actions to ensure that
the persons who occupy such rental units live in surroundings that are safe,
secure, and sanitary.
   (B)   Scope. This chapter applies to rental dwelling units described herein
that are rented or leased in whole or in part, including apartment buildings,
town houses, single-family and multifamily housing, guest and caretaker houses,
and condominiums, regardless of the duration of such rentals or leases. It also
includes any accessory structures of the rental dwellings, such as garages and
storage buildings, and appurtenances such as sidewalks, driveways, and
retaining walls, which are on the property of the rental dwelling. This chapter
does not apply to on-campus college or university housing units; Minnesota
Department of Health licensed rest homes; convalescent care facilities;
licensed group homes; nursing homes; hotels; motels; owner-occupied units; or
any other residential facility that is subject to a regular inspection program
implemented by the county, state, or federal government.

§ 154.03 LICENSING OF RENTAL UNITS.
   (A)   License required.
      (1)   Beginning on January 1, 2024, no person shall operate a rental
dwelling without first having obtained a license to do so from the city. A
license shall be granted pursuant to the provisions of this chapter by the
compliance official.
      (2)   Exceptions.
         (a)   An owner whose only rental dwelling is a single-family dwelling
homesteaded by a relative is exempted. Compliance of this exemption may require
written proof from the county.
         (b)   A residential property owned by a "snowbird" where the property
is rented to another person for a period of less than 120 consecutive days
while the owner is residing out of the State of Minnesota is exempted. The
owner must occupy the property during the remainder of the year to qualify for
the exception.
         (c)   The following are also exempted: on-campus college or university
housing units; Minnesota Department of Health licensed rest homes; convalescent
care facilities; licensed group homes; nursing homes; hotels; motels; owner-
occupied units; or any other residential facility that is subject to a regular
inspection program implemented by the county, state, or federal government.
      (3)   When more than one building containing rental dwelling units exists
on one property, a separate license shall be required for each building.
      (4)   Licenses shall be issued for a single rental dwelling unit in the
case of a freestanding dwelling, a condominium, a townhouse, a dwelling in a
cooperative, or a dwelling in a nonresidential structure; for a two-unit rental
dwelling; or for an apartment building.
   (B)   License term. Except for a provisional license as identified herein, a
rental license issued by the city under this chapter will be valid for up to a
two-year time period unless a renewal term otherwise qualifies for a four-year
term as authorized in §
154.03(D). All licenses may be reviewed at any time by the compliance official
after the commencement of the license term to determine whether the rental
dwelling continues to be in compliance with this chapter.
   (C)   License application and renewal. The license application or renewal
shall be made by the owner, property manager, or local agent. Application forms
are available from the city and must be completed in full and accompanied by
the appropriate license fee as established by the City Council. Every licensee
shall give notice in writing to the city within ten business days after any
change of information on the application or if the licensed premises is sold or
otherwise conveyed in any way. Depending on the nature of changes, the city may
require a new inspection of the licensed premises.
   (D)   License period; renewals.  
      (1)   The license period shall be for no longer than two years, and to
maintain staggering renewals, all licenses for rental dwellings located in Le
Sueur County shall expire on December 31 of odd-numbered years and all licenses
for rental dwellings located in Scott County shall expire on December 31 of
even-numbered years. An application for renewal of a license and the
appropriate fee must be filed with the city at least 30 days prior to the
expiration date of an existing license. Any renewal license application and fee
not received before the expiration date shall be assessed a late fee as
established by the City Council.
      (2)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, a renewed license term for any
rental dwelling that is duly requested by the existing licensee shall be
effective for four years if the following two conditions are satisfied at the
time of such renewal: (i) there are no documented violations associated with
the respective rental dwelling during the prior license term; and (ii) there
are no new adult occupants residing in the respective rental dwelling since the
date the license was issued for the prior license term. Any licensee requesting
such four-year renewal shall provide the city with proof of occupancy so that
adherence to the above conditions can be confirmed.
   (E)   Inspections. Within 30 days of receipt of a completed application and
license fee required by this chapter, for both new applications and renewals,
the inspector shall schedule an inspection. No license shall be granted or
renewed until the inspector has determined that all life, health safety
violations, or application inconsistencies have been corrected. In cases where
a weather deferral for repairs has been granted by the inspector, the license
may be granted on conditions of the repairs being completed before a specific
date in the future. If the license application is incomplete, or the applicant
does not meet the requirements of this section during the term of a provisional
license issued under §
154.04, the application shall be denied.
   (F)   License and inspection fees. 
      (1)   License fees, as set forth by City Council resolution, shall be due
30 days prior to the license expiration date; in the cases of new unlicensed
units, license fees shall be due at time of application. Fees are
nonrefundable. A delinquency penalty of 15% of the amount of the license fee
may be charged to the operators of the dwelling unit when fees are not paid on
time.
      (2)   Fees for inspections of a rental dwelling are part of paid license
fees. Reinspection fees will only be charged for subsequent inspections after
failure to comply with official orders or when the owner or agent fails to keep
a scheduled inspection without prior notice to the inspector. All reinspection
fees are listed on the city's fee schedule. If the reinspection is being
performed as part of the licensing process, fees must be paid prior to the time
of license issuance or renewal.
   (G)   Minimum licensing standards. The following minimum standards and
conditions must be met in order for an owner to renew or be granted a rental
dwelling license under this chapter. Failure to comply with any of these
standards or conditions shall be adequate grounds for denial, nonrenewal,
suspension or revocation of a rental dwelling license.
      (1)   The licensee or applicant must have a current, complete, and
accurate rental dwelling application on file with the city.
      (2)   The licensee or applicant shall have paid the required license fee
and any other fees required by this chapter.
      (3)   The licensee or applicant must be current on the payment of all
utility fees, property taxes, assessments, fines, penalties, or other financial
claims due to the city on the licensed premises and any other rental dwelling
in the city owned by the licensee or the applicant. In the event a suit has
been commenced under M.S. §§ 278.01 through 278.03 questioning the amount or
validity of taxes, the city may upon request of the licensee or applicant waive
strict compliance with this provision; provided, however, that no waiver may be
granted for taxes or any portion thereof that remain unpaid for a period
exceeding one year after becoming due.
      (4)   The rental dwelling must be in compliance with all federal, state
and local laws, including but not limited to all provisions of this chapter and
all applicable zoning laws.
(Ord. 344, passed 11-6-23)
§ 154.04 PROVISIONAL LICENSE.
   The city may issue a provisional license to the owner of a rental dwelling
who has submitted an application, paid the license fee and the compliance
official has conducted an initial inspection resulting in written orders to
correct violations that, in the sole discretion of the compliance official, do
not prevent safe occupancy. A provisional license authorizes the continued
occupancy of the rental dwelling unit(s) in actual existence, pending issuance
of a rental license. A provisional license is valid for up to 180 days until a
license is issued or it is determined that license requirements have not been
met and the city will not issue a license.
(Ord. 344, passed 11-6-23)
§ 154.05 LICENSE REQUIREMENTS.

liability companies or other recognized business associations that own a rental
dwelling to be licensed under this chapter shall submit, upon request of the

tenant by law, lease, or ruling, licensees shall furnish and maintain approved
devices, equipment or facilities for the prevention of insect, rodent, and pest
infestation within a rental dwelling and when such infestation has taken place,
shall be responsible for its abatement. For purposes of this division, the term
“infestation” shall mean the presence within a rental dwelling of insects,
rodents or other pests in a manner that materially endangers one or more
persons.
         (b)   Smoke detectors. No smoke detector installed in a rental
dwelling shall be allowed to remain disabled or nonfunctional. The tenant of a

extinguisher shall be located within the individual dwelling unit or in a
common hallway or corridor within 50 feet of the dwelling unit door.
         (e)   Fire suppression/alarm systems. All fire suppression/alarm
systems shall be maintained in accordance with the current Minnesota State Fire

         (k)   Means of egress. Within the dwelling units, a minimum three-
foot-wide path shall be maintained to all points of egress (e.g. front/main
door and egress windows in sleeping rooms). Common areas in multi-family
structures (shared hallways, stairs and other common paths of travel) shall be
clear of storage items for the full width of the means of egress system.
         (l)   Refuse. Unless lawfully made the express responsibility of a
tenant by law, lease, or ruling, licensees shall equip rental dwellings with

dwelling units shall be maintained in a manner that provides for adequate
protection of the structural elements of the building from weather and other
elements.
   (I)   License not transferable. The rental license issued pursuant to this
chapter is for the property owner and the premises named on the approved
license application. No transfer of a license is permitted from place to place
or from the owner to another person or entity without complying with the
requirements of an original application, except in the case in which an
existing licensee is merely changing a business or corporate name or in the
case in which an existing noncorporate licensee is incorporating and the
incorporation does not affect the ownership or control of the property or the
rental business.
(Ord. 344, passed 11-6-23)
§ 154.06 ENFORCEMENT AND INSPECTIONS.
   (A)   Authority. The compliance official is responsible for administering
and enforcing the provisions of this chapter and is hereby authorized to cause
inspections on a biannual basis for all licensed rental dwellings and also when
reasonable grounds exist to believe that a violation of this chapter has been
or is being committed. Inspections shall be conducted during reasonable times,
and the compliance official shall present evidence of official capacity to the
tenant, owner, or agent at the time of inspection of the rental dwelling.
Inspections shall include all common areas, utility and mechanical rooms,
accessory structures, interiors of each dwelling unit, exteriors of all
structures and exterior property areas.
   (B)   Inspection access. Pursuant to M.S. § 504B.211, the owner or agent
shall provide proper notification of an inspection to the tenants after
receiving notice of the time and date of the inspection from the compliance
official. Each tenant of a dwelling unit shall give the owner or agent access
to any part of such dwelling unit at reasonable times for the purpose of
effecting inspection, maintenance, repairs or alterations as are necessary to
comply with the provisions of this chapter. If any owner, agent or tenant of a
dwelling unit fails to provide the tenant with requisite notice of the
inspection or otherwise refuses to permit entry to the dwelling unit under its
control for an inspection pursuant to this section, the compliance official may
seek a warrant authorizing such inspection.
   (C)   Official order; service.  
         (1)   Whenever the compliance official determines that any rental
dwelling or portion thereof, or the premises surrounding any of these, fails to
meet the provisions of this chapter or the city code, an official order setting
forth the violations and ordering the owner or agent to correct such violations
shall be issued. This official order shall:
            (a)   Be in writing;
            (b)   Describe the location and nature of the violation(s);
            (c)   Establish a reasonable time for the correction of such
violation(s);
            (d)   Indicate the right to appeal;
            (e)   Identify the implications of noncompliance with the official
order; and
            (f)   Be provided to the owner or agent, as the case may require.
         (2)   Such notice shall be deemed to be properly provided upon the
owner or agent if a copy thereof is:
            (a)   Served upon owner or agent personally;
            (b)   Sent by First Class mail to his/her last known address on
file with the city; or
            (c)   Upon failure to effect notice by personal service or First
Class mail, posted at a conspicuous place in or about the rental dwelling, or
portion thereof, that is affected by the notice. Communications with the owner
or agent may also be by electronic mail.
         (3)   Such notice shall also be provided to the tenant(s) residing in
the licensed premises that is the subject of the official order. Such notice
shall be deemed to be properly provided to the tenant(s) if a copy is properly
posted on the dwelling unit or at a conspicuous place in or about the rental
dwelling.
   (D)   Action plan. The compliance official may require an action plan to be
completed by the licensee or agent in a designated time frame that indicates
the steps taken to correct identified violations and the measures to be taken
to ensure ongoing compliance with city ordinances and all applicable codes.
   (E)   Unfit for human habitation.
      (1)   Any rental dwelling or portion thereof that is damaged, decayed,
dilapidated, unsanitary, unsafe, vermin or rodent infested, or that lacks
provision for basic illumination, ventilation or sanitary facilities to the
extent that the defects create a hazard to the health, safety or welfare of the
tenants or of the public may be declared unfit for human habitation. Whenever
any rental dwelling or licensed premises has been declared unfit for human
habitation, the compliance official shall order the same vacated within a
reasonable time and shall post a placard on same indicating that it is unfit
for human habitation under the Minnesota State Building Code, and any license
previously issued for such rental dwelling units shall be revoked pursuant to §
154.07 herein.
      (2)   It shall be unlawful for such rental dwelling or portion thereof to
be used for human habitation until the defective conditions have been corrected
and written approval has been issued by the city. It shall be unlawful for any
person to deface or remove the declaration placard from any such rental
dwelling.
   (F)   Hazardous building declaration. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent
the city from initiating a hazardous building action in accordance with M.S.
Ch. 463.
   (G)   Right of appeal. When it is alleged by any person to whom an official
order is directed that such official order is based upon erroneous
interpretation of this chapter, such person may appeal the official order to
the City Council sitting as a Board of Appeals. Such appeals must be in
writing, must specify the ground for the appeal, and must be filed with the
city within ten business days after receipt of the official order. The filing
of an appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed
from, unless such a stay would cause imminent peril to life, health, or
property.
   (H)   Board of Appeals decision. Upon at least ten business days' notice to
the appellant of the time and place for hearing the appeal, and within 45
calendar days after said appeal is filed, the Board of Appeals shall hold a
hearing thereon, receive evidence, and consider any advice and recommendation
from the compliance official. The Board of Appeals may reverse, modify, or
affirm, in whole or in part, the official order.
   (I)   Restrictions on transfer of ownership. It shall be unlawful for the
owner of any rental dwelling, or portion thereof, upon whom a pending official
order has been served to sell, transfer, lease, or otherwise convey said rental
dwelling to another person until the provisions of the order have been complied
with, unless the owner first furnishes to the prospective grantee or lessee a
true copy of the official order, obtains a written acknowledgment of receipt
from said grantee or lessee, and files a copy of the same with the city. Anyone
securing an interest in the rental dwelling, or portion thereof, who has
received and acknowledged such notice of an official order shall be bound by
the same without further service and shall be subject to all penalties and
procedures provided by this chapter.
   (J)   Failure to correct official orders. Any person who fails to comply
with an official order and any person who fails to comply with a modified
official order within the time set therein, upon conviction thereof shall be
guilty of violating this chapter. Nothing in this chapter however is deemed to
limit other remedies or civil penalties available to the city under this code
or state law. Each day of such failure to comply may constitute a separate
punishable offense.
(Ord. 344, passed 11-6-23)
§ 154.07 LICENSE DENIAL; SUSPENSION; NONRENEWAL; AND REVOCATION.
   (A)   Applicability. Every application for a license, renewal for a license
or an existing license issued under the provisions of this chapter are subject
to denial, suspension, nonrenewal, or revocation by the compliance official. In
the event that a license is revoked, or not renewed by the compliance official,
it shall be unlawful for the owner or agent to rent the rental dwelling.
   (B)   Grounds for adverse license action. The compliance official may
revoke, suspend, decline to renew or impose reasonable conditions or
restrictions upon any license issued under this chapter upon any of the
following criteria:
      (1)   False statements, misrepresentations, or fraudulent statements on
any application or other information or report required by this chapter to be
given by the applicant or licensee.
      (2)   Failure to pay any fee, fine or penalty, special assessments, real
estate taxes, or other financial claims due to the city as required by this
chapter.
      (3)   Failure to continuously comply with any property maintenance,
zoning, health, building, nuisance, or other city codes; or failure to correct
deficiencies noted in an official order in the time specified in the order.
      (4)   The failure to eliminate imminent health and life safety hazards as
determined by the city compliance official after issuance of the compliance
order.
      (5)   The abandonment of the licensed premises by the owner as determined
by the inability to make contact with the owner or his or her agent due to
inaccurate contact information.
      (6)   Failure to operate or maintain the licensed premises in conformity
with all applicable federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations, and
ordinances.
      (7)   Any person(s) who has had an interest in two or more licensed
properties that have been revoked, suspended or denied pursuant to this
section, shall be ineligible to hold or have any interest in a rental dwelling
license or provisional license for period of two years.
   (C)   License action sections. A license revocation, suspension, nonrenewal
or imposition of reasonable conditions or restrictions on a license may be
brought under any applicable provision of this chapter.
   (D)   Notification, hearing, and decision.
      (1)   Written notice; hearing. A recommendation to revoke, deny, suspend,
not renew or impose reasonable conditions or restrictions on a license shall be
preceded by written notice to the applicant or licensee of the grounds
therefore and the applicant or licensee will be given an opportunity to
challenge the recommendation at a hearing conducted before the City Council
before final action to revoke, deny, not renew or impose reasonable conditions
or restrictions on a license.
      (2)   Decision. The City Council shall give due regard to the frequency
and seriousness of violations, the ease with which such violations could have
been cured or avoided and good faith efforts to comply. The City Council shall
issue a decision to deny, suspend, not renew, revoke or impose reasonable
conditions or restrictions on a license only upon written findings.
   (E)   Written decision; compliance. Written decisions to revoke, deny, not
renew or impose reasonable conditions or restrictions on a license or
application shall specify the part or parts of the rental dwelling to which it
applies. Thereafter, and until a license is reissued or reinstated, no rental
units becoming vacant in such part or parts of the rental dwelling may be re-
let or occupied. Revocation or nonrenewal of a license shall not excuse the
owner from compliance with all terms of state laws and codes and this city code
for as long as any units in the rental dwelling are occupied. Failure to comply
with all terms of this section during the term of revocation, or nonrenewal is
a misdemeanor and grounds for extension of the term of such revocation, or
nonrenewal and as otherwise set forth in this section. Further license action
such as revoking a license may also be taken for failure to comply.
   (F)   Notification of decision. The city shall cause a notice of the City
Council's decision of a revocation, suspension, nonrenewal or the imposition of
reasonable conditions or restrictions on a rental license to be provided to the
licensee or applicant either by personal delivery or by First Class mail. In
addition, notice of the City Council's decision calling for the revocation,
suspension or nonrenewal of a rental license shall also be mailed to each
tenant in the licensed premises and prominently posted on the rental dwelling.
The notice provided to the tenant(s) shall indicate the date upon which the
tenants must vacate the licensed premises and clearly indicate which dwelling
units are impacted by the City Council's decision. Tenants of an unlicensed
rental unit will be provided a reasonable time to arrange for alternative
housing and remove their possessions.
   (G)   License actions; reapplication.
      (1)   Revocation, denial, nonrenewal. Licenses that are revoked will not
be reinstated until the owner has applied for and secured a new license. Upon a
decision to revoke, deny or not renew a license, no approval of any application
for a new license for the same rental dwelling is effective until after the
period of time specified in the City Council's written decision, which shall
not exceed one year. The City Council shall specify in its written decision the
date when an application for a new license will be accepted. A decision not to
renew a license may take the form of a revocation. A decision to deny an
initial application shall state conditions of reapplication.
      (2)   Reinstatement fees. All reapplications must be accompanied by a
reinstatement fee, as specified by City Council resolution, in addition to all
other fees required by this chapter.
   (H)   New licenses prohibited. A person who has a rental license revoked may
not receive a rental license for another rental dwelling within the city for a
period of one year from the date of revocation. The person may continue to
operate other currently licensed rental dwellings if maintained in compliance
with city codes and other applicable laws, rules, and regulations.
   (I)   Misdemeanor. Any person who violates any part of this chapter, upon
conviction thereof, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable in accordance
with state law. Nothing in this chapter is deemed to limit other remedies or
civil penalties available to the city under city code or state law. Each day
that a violation continues is deemed a separate punishable offense.
   (J)   No warranty. By enacting and undertaking to enforce this chapter, the
city, City Council, its agents, and employees do not warrant or guaranty the
safety, fitness or suitability of any rental dwelling in the city. Owners,
agents, and tenants of rental dwellings should take whatever steps they deem
appropriate to protect their interests, health, safety and welfare.
   (K)   Applicable laws. Licenses are subject to all of the ordinances of the
city and the laws, rules, and regulations of the State of Minnesota and the
United States relating to rental dwellings. This chapter shall not be construed
or interpreted to supersede or limit any other such applicable law.
