codes, titles, chapters, and sections, shall be known and designated as the
“St. Anthony City Code,” for which designation “code of ordinances,” “codified

referred to and cited by its name, such as the “Traffic Code.” Sections may be

gender shall be deemed to include the feminine and neuter genders; words in the

§ 10.19 ADOPTIONS OF STATUTES AND RULES AND SUPPLEMENTS BY REFERENCE.
   (A)   It is the intention of the City Council that, when adopting this code,
all future amendments to any state or federal rules and statutes adopted by
reference in this code or referenced in this code are hereby adopted by
reference or referenced as if they had been in existence at the time this code
was adopted, unless there is clear intention expressed in the code to the
contrary.
   (B)   It is the intention of the City Council that, when adopting this code,
all future supplements are hereby adopted as if they had been in existence at
the time this code was enacted, unless there is clear intention expressed in
the code to the contrary.
§ 10.20 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Any licensed peace officer of the city’s Police Department, or the
County Sheriff, or any Deputy Sheriff, shall have the authority to enforce any
provision of this code.
   (B)   As permitted by M.S. § 626.862, as it may be amended from time to
time, the City Clerk shall have the authority to administer and enforce this
code. In addition, under that statutory authority, certain individuals
designated within the code, or by the Clerk or City Council, shall have the
authority to administer and enforce the provisions specified. All and any
person or persons designated may issue a citation in lieu of arrest or
continued detention to enforce any provision of the code.
   (C)   The City Clerk and any city official or employee designated by this
code who has the responsibility to perform a duty under this code may, with the
permission of a licensee of a business or owner of any property or resident of
a dwelling, or other person in control of any premises, inspect or otherwise
enter any property to enforce compliance with this code.
   (D)   If the licensee, owner, resident, or other person in control of a
premises objects to the inspection of or entrance to the property, the City
Clerk, peace officer, or any employee or official charged with the duty of
enforcing the provisions of this code may, upon a showing that probable cause
exists for the issuance of a valid search warrant from a court of competent
jurisdiction, petition and obtain a search warrant before conducting the
inspection or otherwise entering the property. This warrant shall be only to
determine whether the provisions of this code enacted to protect the health,
safety, and welfare of the people are being complied with and to enforce these
provisions only, and no criminal charges shall be made as a result of the
warrant. No warrant shall be issued unless there be probable cause to issue the
warrant. Probable cause occurs if the search is reasonable. Probable cause does
not depend on specific knowledge of the condition of a particular property.
   (E)   Every licensee, owner, resident, or other person in control of
property within the city shall permit at reasonable times inspections of or
entrance to the property by the City Clerk or any other authorized city officer
or employee only to determine whether the provisions of this code enacted to
protect the health, safety, and welfare of the people are being complied with
and to enforce these provisions. Unreasonable refusal to permit the inspection
of or entrance to the property shall be grounds for termination of any and all
permits, licenses, or city service to the property. Mailed notice shall be
given to the licensee, owner, resident, or other person in control of the
property, stating the grounds for the termination, and the licensee, owner,
resident, or other person in control of the property shall be given an
opportunity to appear before the City Clerk to object to the termination before
it occurs, subject to appeal of the Clerk’s decision to the City Council at a
regularly scheduled or special meeting.
   (F)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of
the city to enter private property in urgent emergency situations where there
is an imminent danger in order to protect the public health, safety, and
welfare.
§ 10.98 SUPPLEMENTAL ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES.
   (A)   In addition to those administrative penalties established in this code
and the enforcement powers granted in §
10.20, supplemental administrative penalties are hereby established. They may
not proscribe administrative penalties for traffic offenses designated by M.S.
§ 169.999, as it may be amended from time to time.
   (B)   These administrative penalty procedures in this section are intended
to provide the public and the city with an informal, cost effective, and
expeditious alternative to traditional criminal charges for violations of
certain provisions of this code. The procedures are intended to be voluntary on
the part of those who have been charged with those offenses.
   (C)   Administrative penalties for violations of various provisions of the
code, other than those penalties established in the code or in statutes that
are adopted by reference, are hereby established. In order to be effective, an
administrative penalty for a particular violation must be established before
the violation occurred.
   (D)   In the discretion of, and upon the finding of probable cause to
believe that a violation has occurred, the peace officer, City Clerk, or other
person giving notice of an alleged violation of a provision of this code, in a
written notice of an alleged violation, sent by first class mail to the person
who is alleged to have violated the code, the person giving notice may request
the payment of a voluntary administrative penalty for the violation directly to
the City Treasurer within 14 days of the notice of the violation. A sample
notice is contained in the appendix to this chapter. In the sole discretion of
the person giving the notice of the alleged violation, the time for payment may
be extended an additional 14 days, whether or not requested by the person to
whom the notice has been given. In addition to the administrative penalty, the
person giving notice may request in the notice to the alleged violator to adopt
a compliance plan to correct the situation resulting in the alleged violation
and may provide that if the alleged violator corrects the situation resulting
in the alleged violation within the time specified in the notice, that the
payment of the administrative penalty will be waived.
   (E)   At any time before the payment of the administrative penalty is due,
the person who has been given notice of an alleged violation may request to
appear before the City Council to contest the request for payment of the
penalty. After a hearing before the Council, the Council may determine to
reduce, withdraw, or renew the request for payment. Because the payment of the
administrative penalty is voluntary, there shall be no appeal from the decision
of the Council.
   (F)   At any time after the date the payment of the administrative penalty
is due, if the administrative penalty remains unpaid or the situation creating
the alleged violation remains uncorrected, the city, through its Attorney, may
bring an action to enforce in accordance with state law and this code.
Likewise, the city, in its discretion, may bring charges for a violation in the
first instance, rather than requesting the payment of an administrative
penalty, even if a penalty for the particular violation has been established.
If the administrative penalty is paid, or if any requested correction of the
situation resulting in the violation is completed, no charges shall be
initiated by the city for the alleged violation.
§ 10.99 GENERAL PENALTY AND ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Penalty not specified. Any person, firm, or corporation who violates
any provision of this code for which another penalty is not specifically
provided, shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor. The penalty which
may be imposed for any crime which is a misdemeanor under this code, including
Minnesota Statutes or Rules specifically adopted by reference, shall be a
sentence of not more than 90 days in jail or a fine of not more than $1,000, or
both.
   (B)   Petty misdemeanor. Any person, firm, or corporation who violates any
provision of this code, including Minnesota Statutes specifically adopted by
reference, which is designated to be a petty misdemeanor shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a petty misdemeanor. The penalty which may be imposed
for any petty offense which is a petty misdemeanor shall be a sentence of a
fine of not more than $300.
   (C)   Cost of prosecution. Pursuant to M.S. § 631.48, as it may be amended
from time to time, in either the case of a misdemeanor or a petty misdemeanor,
the costs of prosecution may be added. A separate offense shall be deemed
committed upon each day during which a violation occurs or continues.
   (D)   Officer/employee of the city not in violation. The failure of any
officer or employee of the city to perform any official duty imposed by this
code shall not subject the officer or employee to the penalty imposed for a
violation.
   (E)   Additional proceedings. In addition to any penalties provided for in
this section or in §
10.98, if any person, firm, or corporation fails to comply with any provision
of this code, the Council, or any city official designated by it, may institute
appropriate proceedings with a hearing before City Council, at law or at
equity, to restrain, correct, or abate the violation.
   (F) Issuance of citation for violation.
      (1)   Upon probable cause to believe that a violation has been committed
and that the violator has committed the violation or is legally responsible for
the commission of the violation or for allowing the condition constituting the
violation to exist, an issuer is authorized to issue a citation, complying with
the standards set forth below, to the violator.
      (2)   In the case of a violation which constitutes a property violation,
the citation may, in addition, include a directive to eliminate the condition
giving rise to the property violation.
      (3)   If reasonably practical, the issuer shall deliver the citation to
the violator in person. If the violator is not present at the time that the
citation is issued, cannot be reasonably contacted for the purpose of delivery
of the citation, or refused to accept delivery of the citation, the issuer may
deliver the citation to the violator by depositing it in the U.S. mail
addressed to the violator at an address of public record for the violator,
which may include but need not be limited to an address taken from area
telephone directories, from records of the city assessor, from records of city-
owned utilities or from other public sources. Delivery by such alternative
means shall be deemed to be valid delivery and shall be deemed to be effective
three days after the deposit of the citation in the U.S. mail.
   (G)   Permits. When any person initiates any work which requires a city
permit of any type, but who has not procured the applicable permit prior to
initiating said work, the city may impose a fee and penalty that is an amount
equal to two times the fee required by the city’s fee schedule. No permit shall
be finally approved, nor certificate of occupancy issued, if applicable, until
the levied fees and penalty, if imposed, have been fully paid. This penalty
shall be in addition to any other remedies available to the city.

   (B)   Special meetings. The Mayor or any two members of the City Council may

specify the time, place, and purpose of the meeting and will identify the
person or persons who called the meeting. The notice will be delivered to the
City Councilmember personally or to the City Councilmember’s home by mail. When
written notice of a special meeting is not given in accordance with this
division (B), a meeting attended by all the members of the City Council or
where any member unable to attend gives written notice to the City Council that
he or she waives written notice of the special meeting, will be a valid special
meeting for the transaction of any business that comes before the meeting. Only
business specified in the notice of the special meeting will be transacted and
voted on at the special meetings, unless the meeting is attended by all members
of the City Council and the additional items brought forth are approved for
discussion by a majority of the City Council.
   (C)   Public meetings. All City Council meetings, including special and
adjourned meetings and meetings of City Council committees, will be open to the

M.S. § 429.101, as it may be amended from time to time, which are in addition
to and/or different than the normal street lighting installed and operated at
the city’s sole expense (hereinafter referred to in this subchapter as special
street lighting). The order will state the location and type of the special
street lighting work to be done. The City Manager or designee will transmit a

Council by resolution from time to time shall determine to charge under this
subchapter, will be charged with the frequency as the City Council by
resolution from time to time determines, to each owner of each separate lot or
parcel of land benefitted by the special street lighting, in proportion to the
benefits conferred upon the lots or parcels. If any charge is made for a cost
to be incurred and, based upon subsequent actual costs, is found to be
excessive, subsequent charges shall be reduced by the excess, and, if
deficient, subsequent charges shall be increased by the deficiency. Any charge
not paid in full by November 15 of each year shall be levied as a special
assessment against the lot or parcel of land benefitted by the special street
lighting.

assessment roll assessing all costs for the special street lighting reported
under this subchapter against each separate lot or parcel of land benefitted by
the special street lighting, in proportion to the benefits conferred upon the
lots or parcels. The City Council will examine the assessment roll submitted by
the City Clerk, and if satisfactory, will call a public hearing and levy
special assessments for any unpaid charges for the special street lighting in
accordance with M.S. § 429.061, as it may be amended from time to time. All the
special assessments will be payable in a single installment, or the additional
annual installments, not to exceed ten, as may be fixed by the resolution
approving the special assessments, with interest thereon at the rate fixed in
the resolution approving the special assessments, but not to exceed the highest

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 50.01 CITY MANAGER TO CONTROL.
   The City Manager or designee, under the direction of the City Council, will
have control of the storm water and sanitary sewer systems, repair, and
maintenance of the systems and connections to the systems.
(Prior Code, § 50.01)
§ 50.02 PLANS TO BE APPROVED.
   No storm sewer or sanitary sewer line will be built, repaired, extended, or

(Prior Code, § 50.02) Penalty, see §
50.99
§ 50.03 PREREQUISITES TO ISSUE OF PERMITS.
   No storm sewer or sanitary sewer line may be built, repaired, extended, or
connected with the public systems, except by a person duly licensed, in
accordance with the provisions of this code and M.S. § 326B.44, as it may be
amended from time to time, relating to the licensing of plumbers, to perform
the work; nor shall a permit be issued or approved except when granted to the
person. A permit will not be issued until the property owner agrees in writing
to pay for the connection and the connection fee established by the City
Council.
(Prior Code, § 50.03) Penalty, see §
50.99
§ 50.04 SEWER PERMITS.
   All applicants for sanitary or storm sewer permits must be made on forms

Before beginning the work, the applicant must file with the City Manager or
designee a plan for the work showing the whole course of the line from its
connection with the public sewer to the house or other building, with the
location of all branches, traps, and fixtures to be connected to the sewer. The
applicant must also file drawings of the sewer proposed to be constructed. If
the proposed sewer, as shown in the drawings, complies with the provisions of
the plumbing code and other applicable laws, regulations, and ordinances, the
permit will be issued.
(Prior Code, § 50.04)
§ 50.05 CONNECTION WITH PUBLIC SEWER.
   All work will be in accordance with the plan and drawings approved by the
city. The permit holder shall notify the City Public Works Director or
contracted Plumbing Inspector of the progress of the work at the stage in the

Plumbing Inspector may direct. The permit holder must notify the City Public
Works Director or contracted Plumbing Inspector when the construction of the
sewer is complete and ready for connection with the public sewer, but before
the connection is made. When the inspector signs the connection permit, the
sewer may then be connected to the public sewer. Work must be inspected by the
City Public Works Director or contracted Plumbing Inspector after it is

(Prior Code, § 50.05) Penalty, see §
50.99
§ 50.06 RESPONSIBILITY FOR REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.

line, the pipe may not be covered until it has been duly inspected by the City
Public Works Director or contracted Plumbing Inspector and approved. The
requirements of §
50.14 regulating excavations in public streets are to be strictly complied with
in excavations for sewers.
(Prior Code, § 50.07) Penalty, see §
50.99
§ 50.08 SEPARATE CONNECTIONS.

in or on any trap or catch basin so as to obstruct the sewer. No person may
injure, or break, or remove any portion of any catch basin, covering flag, gull
grating, flush tank, or manhole, or any part of any sewer, nor do any act

materials, radioactive substances, and toxic chemicals, including those
substances listed in the United States Department of Transportation Hazardous
Materials Table (49 C.F.R. § 172.101);
   (B)   Refuse from butcher shops, rendering establishments, packing houses,

   (D)   Items prohibited by state law.
(Prior Code, § 50.12) Penalty, see §
50.99
§ 50.13 INSPECTION AND REPAIRS.
   The City Public Works Director or contracted Plumbing Inspector has the
right to enter upon any premises or into any building within the city at all
the reasonable hours, to inspect the sewers and drains and traps and fixtures
connected with the sewer. If it is found from the inspection or otherwise that
the provisions of law are not being complied with in any respect or that any
part of the drainage system is in need of clearing out or repairs, the City
Public Works Director or contracted Plumbing Inspector shall serve a notice
upon the owner and the occupant specifying the work to be done to make the
sewer system comply with the law, or to put it in good working condition. The
notice will also specify the time as is reasonable, considering the amount of
work to be done and the nature of the emergency, within which the defects must
be remedied. It will then become the duty of every person served with the
notice to comply with it; and if the notice is not complied with, the City
Council may cause the work to be done at the expense of any person so served.
(Prior Code, § 50.13)
§ 50.14 STREET EXCAVATING.
   No person may make any excavation in any street, sidewalk, or public ground
without first having secured a permit from the City Manager or designee. The
fee for the permit is the amount set forth in Chapter 33. When a fee is paid
for a sewer construction permit or a permit to connect with the water supply,
the excavation permit for the necessary digging incidental to the installation
of the sewer or water pipes shall also be obtained.
(Prior Code, § 50.14) Penalty, see §
50.99
§ 50.15 SURETY BOND.
   If the applicant for an excavation permit is any person other than a
licensed plumber with a bond already on file, the applicant must file a bond of
the same sort required to be filed by every licensed plumber with the City
Manager or designee before the permit will be issued.
(Prior Code, § 50.15)
§ 50.16 PROHIBITED DISCHARGES INTO SANITARY SYSTEM.
   (A)   Applicability and purpose. This section shall apply to all water
entering the sanitary sewer system unless explicitly exempted by the city. The
city and its representatives are authorized to administer, implement, and
enforce the provisions of this section.
      (1)   The City Council finds that the discharge from roofs, rainspouts,
yard drains, surfaces, groundwater, sump pumps, footing tiles or swimming
pools, foundation drains, yard fountains, ponds, cistern overflows, water
discharged from any nonresidential air conditioning unit or system, or other
means of transmitting natural precipitation and surface waters, collectively
referred to as excess infiltration and inflow, into the sanitary sewer system,
will and has in the past overloaded the sanitary sewer system. The City
Council, therefore, finds it essential for compliance with mandated city code
requirements that the provisions of this section be strictly enforced.
      (2)   This section is not intended to modify or repeal any other
ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law. The requirements of
this section are in addition to the requirements of any other ordinance, rule,
regulation, or other provision of law, and where any provision of this section
imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule,
regulation or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive
or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment
shall apply.
   (B)   Clear water drainage. CLEARWATER DRAINAGE, for the purpose of this
section, is defined as stormwater, natural precipitation, melting snow, ground
water or flow from roof runoff, ground surface runoff, subsurface drainage,
down spouts, eave troughs, rainspouts, yard drains, sump pumps, footing tiles
or swimming pools, foundation drains, yard fountains, ponds, cistern overflows,
water discharged from any nonresidential air conditioning unit or system, or
any other water that is not required to be treated by state or federal law,
that enters the sanitary sewer system through any separation, gap, crack,
fracture, collapse or other structural defect in the sewer lateral. Swimming
pool water that is required to be treated in accordance with city, county or
state regulations shall not be considered clear water.
   (C)   Private sewer lateral. PRIVATE SEWER LATERAL, for the purpose of this
section, is defined as all sewer service pipes extending from the city sanitary
sewer main to the dwelling, building or structure it serves.
   (D)   Ownership responsibility. The property owner shall own and be
responsible for the routine maintenance and repair of the sanitary private
sewer lateral, including the connection to the city sanitary sewer main.
   (E)   Prohibited discharges into the sanitary sewer system. It shall be
unlawful for any person whose property is provided with sanitary sewer service
to directly or indirectly cause or permit to be discharged, pumped or drained
any clear water drainage into the city's sanitary sewer system.
   (F)   Prohibited connections. No person shall make or maintain a connection
between any conductor, device or system designed to move clear water drainage
from its source to any pipe, cleanout, floor drain, foundation drain, sink or
any other apparatus with a direct connection to the city's sanitary sewer
system.
   (G)   Sump pumps. A sump pump is a mechanical device used to remove liquid
collected in a sump usually constructed below the normal grade of the gravity
system, usually below basement floor level. Dwellings and other buildings and
structures that require a sump pump system to collect and discharge excess
clear water drainage because of the infiltration of water into basements, crawl
spaces and the like shall obtain a permit and have a permanently installed
discharge line that complies with the following:
      (1)   It shall not any time discharge water into the city's sanitary
sewer system or be capable of connection or reconnection to the city's sanitary
sewer system;
      (2)   It shall provide for year-round discharge capability to the outside
of the dwelling, building or structure, to the city's storm sewer system;
      (3)   It shall consist of a rigid discharge line constructed ofrigid
piping material inside the dwelling or building, without any connections for
altering the path of discharge, and if connected to the city's storm sewer
line, must include a check valve of an approved type and diameter; and
      (4)   It must be directed toward the front or rear yard so as not to
trespass or discharge onto adjoining properties.
   (H)   Single-family, owner-occupied properties. No person shall sell,
advertise for sale, give or transact a change in title or property ownership of
real property with one or more buildings or structures, without first obtaining
a certificate of inflow and infiltration (I&I) compliance from the city or
complying with division (L) of this section. Inspections shall be required for
purposes of complying with the mandates of this section to eliminate clear
water drainage into the sanitary sewer system. Failure to have an inspection as
required in this section is a violation of the city code.
      (1)   Sump pump inspections for all properties that discharge into the
city's sanitary sewer system for the limited purpose of confirming that there
is no sump pump discharge of clear water drainage shall be conducted by the
Public Works Director or his or her designee. Such inspection shall be at no
expense to the owner.
      (2)   Private service lateral inspections for all properties that
discharge into the city’s sanitary sewer system for the limited purpose of
confirming that there is no inflow and infiltration (I&I) shall be conducted by
a licensed plumber to determine whether the property use is in accordance with
city sanitary sewer service regulations as provided in division (I)(3) and
submit the inspection report and video to the city. The applicant for a
certificate of I&I compliance inspection is responsible for all expenses
associated to providing an inspection of the property. The entire property and
all buildings on the property shall be made available for inspection.
      (3)   Inspections shall not be required under the following
circumstances:
         (a)   It is a newly constructed dwelling and title to the property is
transferred to the first owner;
         (b)   It is the sale or other transfer of title of any property with a
dwelling that is being conveyed to a public body;
         (c)   It is the sale or transfer of title of any property that
contains a dwelling that will be demolished;
         (d)   It is the sale or conveyance of any property that contains a
dwelling by a sheriff or other public or court officer in the performance of
their official duties. This exception does not apply to the sale by a person
appointed by a probate court; or
         (e)   The property has no public sewer access or has been granted a
connection waiver by the city.
      (4)   Video inspections shall be valid for three years from the
inspection date. Only videos containing a time stamp and location stamp clearly

the video inspection, the city shall issue a certificate of compliance if the
inspection verifies the conditions provided in division (I) are met.
   (I)   I&I certificates of compliance.
      (1)   Issuance. If, following inspection, it is determined that the
property is in compliance with this section, the city shall issue a certificate
of compliance. No new inspections or certificates for single- family, owner-
occupied properties shall be required unless the property is offered for sale,
or conveyance by deed, or contract for deed.
      (2)   Certificate of compliance period. Certificates of compliance are
valid as follows:
         (a)   For any property that had a full sewer service line and/or
lining replacement, the certificate is valid for 25 years from the date of
issuance.
         (b)   For any property that had a partial sewer service line and/or
lining replacement, the certificate is valid for ten years from the date of
issuance.
      (3)   The city shall issue a certificate of compliance if the inspection
verifies that all of the following conditions are met:
         (a)   There is no sewer pipe joint degradation, as evidenced by root
intrusion and mineral staining, scaling and deposits;
         (b)   There are no prohibited discharges or connections as defied by
divisions (E) and (F) above;

   (J)   Residential rental properties. For residential rental properties, the
property owner is required to locate the building’s sewer cleanout, open the
cleanout to ensure functionality, identify any private manholes or outside
cleanouts and locate all sump pump systems (if applicable). The property owner
shall obtain an independent inspection and submit an inspection report to the
city upon submission of a new or renewal rental license application. The
inspection report shall indicate that the property is free from prohibited
discharges and prohibited connections, including illegal sump pumps. If any
violations are discovered, corrections must be made pursuant to division (L)
above. The city shall receive a post- repair video to verify compliance. Upon
verification that the corrections have been made, the city shall issue a
certificate of compliance.
   (K)   Commercial, industrial and HOA properties. For commercial and
industrial properties and condominium or townhome residential properties with a
homeowners’ association (“HOA properties”), property owners are required to
locate the building’s sewer cleanout, open the cleanout to ensure
functionality, identify any private manholes or outside cleanouts and location
of all sump pump systems (if applicable). The property owner shall obtain an
independent inspection and submit an inspection report to the city. The
inspection report shall indicate that the property is free from prohibited
discharges and prohibited connections, including illegal sump pumps. If any
violations are discovered, corrections must be made pursuant to division (L)
below. The city shall receive a post-repair video to verify compliance. Upon
verification that corrections have been made, the city shall issue a
certificate of compliance.
   (L)   Violations.
      (1)   Violations, generally. Except as provided in division (L)(2) below,
for owner-occupied single-family private sewer lateral violations discovered
during a time of sale inspection, if an inspection discloses there has been a
violation of any provision of this division, the city will give notice of the
violation to the owner and occupant in writing and allow time for compliance as
follows.
         (a)   For single-family properties, private sewer lateral violations
shall be corrected within 18 months from the date of the sale of the property.
         (b)   For residential rental, commercial, industrial and HOA
properties, private sewer lateral violations shall be corrected within 24
months of the property’s annual rental license renewal.
         (c)   For all sump pump violations, regardless of the classification
of the property, the violation shall be corrected within 14 days of discovery
of the violation.
      (2)   Violations discovered at time of sale.
         (a)   Seller responsibilities. If the inspection discloses there has
been a violation of any provision of this section prior to the sale, the seller
is responsible for correcting the violations prior to the sale, unless the
buyer has assumed such responsibility as provided in division (L)(2)(b) below.
Failure of a seller to disclose to a buyer that there are uncorrected
violations of this section is a violation of the city code. When correcting the
violations, all necessary permits shall be obtained from the city. Upon
completion of the corrections, the seller shall provide a copy of a post-repair
video to the city to verify compliance.
         (b)   Buyer responsibilities. If a seller cannot correct the
violations prior to the sale, the seller must require the buyer to assume the
responsibility for correcting the violations, in which case, the seller and the
buyer shall sign and submit a written acknowledgment to the city that includes:
            1.   The buyer's acceptance and assumption of responsibility for
correcting the violations within 18 months from the date of the sale of the
property;
            2.   The buyer's understanding that a copy of a post-repair video
must be provided to the city in order to verify that the corrections have been
completed;
            3.   The buyer's agreement to hold the city harmless from
liabilities and claims if the buyer occupies the dwelling prior to corrections
of the violations; and
            4.   The buyer's understanding that failure to correct violations
or deficiencies, failure to provide a post-repair video or failure to allow a
reinspection is a violation of the city code and subjects the buyer to
penalties as stated in divisions (M), (O), and (R).
      (3)   Violations and corrections under the roadway. When the inspection
discloses that there has been a violation of any provision of this section and
the violations are under the roadway, the property owner will perform the
repairs, except as stated in division (L)(4) below. However, a property owner
shall not excavate in the roadway without permission from the Public Works
Director.
      (4)   Non-excavation violations and corrections. When the property owner
is correcting violations of the private sewer lateral between the street and
the building using a cured in place pipe ("pipe liner") or similar approved
repair methods, and the corrections only involve the lining of the private
sewer lateral, the contractor shall terminate the pipe liner as close to the
connection with the city's public sanitary sewer main as possible. If the pipe
liner extends into the public main, the contractor shall trim off the excess
portion and report its approximate location to the Public Works Department as
soon as possible.
      (5)   The city reserves the right to periodically reinspect any property
or structure to confirm continued compliance with this section. Any property
found not to be in compliance upon reinspection or any person refusing to allow
their property to be reinspected shall, following notification from the city,
comply within 14 calendar days or be subject to the surcharge hereinafter
provided for.
   (M)   Penalty.
      (1)   A monthly penalty of $100 for owner-occupied, single-family
properties; and a monthly penalty of $300 for residential rental, commercial,
industrial and HOA properties shall be sent an invoice if:
         (a)   An owner fails to complete an inspection pursuant to divisions
(H), (J) and (K);
         (b)   An owner whose property was found in violation of this section
did not make the necessary repairs and furnish proof of those changes to the
city within the time frames required by this section;
         (c)   An owner fails to allow an inspection or reinspection to verify
compliance; or
         (d)   The property owner or occupant reconnects a clear water
discharge line to the municipal sanitary sewer system after it has been
previously disconnected at the city's or a court's direction. The property
owner will be subject to the penalty for all months between the last
inspection.
      (2)   The surcharge shall be added every month until the property is
determined by the city to be in compliance with this section. The city shall
not issue building, plumbing, electrical, or mechanical permits for any
property that is not in compliance with this section until the property is
determined by the city to be in compliance with this section.
   (N)   Temporary waiver. The City Council, upon recommendation of the Public
Works Director or his or her designee, shall hear and decide requests for
temporary waivers from the provisions of this section where strict enforcement
would cause a threat to public safety because of circumstances unique to the
individual property under consideration. Any request for a temporary waiver
shall be submitted to the Public Works Director in writing. Upon approval of a
temporary waiver from the provisions of this section, the property owner shall
agree to pay an additional fee for sanitary sewer services based on the number
of gallons discharged into the sanitary sewer system as estimated by the Public
Works Director or his or her designee.
   (O)   Public Works Director. The Public Works Director may set conditions to
any temporary waiver issued. The Public Works Director may terminate the waiver
upon a failure to comply with any conditions imposed in the temporary waiver or
may take appropriate legal action to enforce those conditions. The Public Works
Director must give a five-day written notice of the termination to the property
owner and occupant setting forth the reasons for the termination. After
expiration or termination of a temporary waiver, the property owner must comply
with the provisions of this section.
   (P)   If a property owner demonstrates a financial hardship to pay for the
disconnection cost of a noncompliant system, they may petition the City Council
to assess the disconnection cost on the property. Under this petition, the
property owner must waive their right to a public hearing and waive their right
to appeal the assessments. Assessments initiated in this manner and associated
interest charges must be paid back to the city within five years.
   (Q)   Remedies. The remedies provided in this section do not limit the right
of the city to pursue any other available legal remedy.
   (R)   Violation of this section is a misdemeanor and each day that the
violation continues is a separately prosecutable offense. The imposition of the
surcharge shall not limit the city's authority to prosecute the criminal
violations, seek an injunction in district court ordering the person to
disconnect the nonconforming connection to the sanitary sewer, or for the city
to connect the violation and certify the costs of connection as an assessment
against the property on which the connection was made.

§ 50.36 SUSPENSION OF MS4 ACCESS.
   (A)   Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The City
Council may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person
when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge
which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the
environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of
the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order
issued in an emergency, the authorized enforcement agency may take such steps
as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the
United States, or to minimize danger to persons.
   (B)   Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this subchapter may have his, her, or
their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an
illicit discharge. The authorized enforcement agency will notify a violator of
the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the
authorized enforcement agency for reconsideration and a hearing. A person
commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated
pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the authorized
enforcement agency.

50.99
§ 50.37 INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES.
   Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES storm
water discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof
of compliance with the permit may be required in a form acceptable to the City
Council prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4.
(Prior Code, § 50.37) (Ord. 2009-002, passed 2-24-2009)
§ 50.38 MONITORING OF DISCHARGES.
   (A)   Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have storm
water discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction
activity.
   (B)   Access to facilities.
      (1)   The authorized enforcement agency shall be permitted to enter and
inspect facilities subject to regulation under this subchapter as often as may
be necessary to determine compliance with this subchapter. If a discharger has
security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance
before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary
arrangements to allow access to representatives of the authorized enforcement
agency.
      (2)   Facility operators shall allow the authorized enforcement agency
ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection,
sampling, examination, and copying of records that must be kept under the
conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge storm water, and the performance of
any additional duties as defined by state and federal law.
      (3)   The authorized enforcement agency shall have the right to set up on
any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the
authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the
facility’s storm water discharge.
      (4)   The authorized enforcement agency has the right to require the
discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility’s
sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All
devices used to measure storm water flow and quality shall be calibrated to
ensure their accuracy.
      (5)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the authorized enforcement agency
and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by
the operator.
      (6)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the authorized enforcement agency
access to a permitted facility is a violation of a storm water discharge permit
and of this subchapter. A person who is the operator of the facility with a
NPDES permit to discharge storm water associated with industrial activity
commits an offense if the person denies the authorized enforcement agency
reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any
activity authorized or required by this subchapter.
      (7)   If the authorized enforcement agency has been refused access to any
part of the premises from which storm water is discharged, and the city is able
to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
subchapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a
routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this
subchapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public
health, safety and welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement
agency may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent
jurisdiction.

§ 50.39 REQUIREMENT TO PREVENT, CONTROL, AND REDUCE STORM WATER POLLUTANTS BY
THE USE OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.
   (A)   The city will adopt requirements identifying best management practices
(BMPs) of any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to
pollution or contamination of storm water, the storm drain system, or waters of
the United States.
   (B)   The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment
shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm
drain system or watercourses through the use of these structural and non-
structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premises,
which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to
implement, at the person’s expense, additional structural and non-structural
BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate
storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES
permit authorizing the discharge of storm water associated with industrial
activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliant with the
provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a storm water pollution
prevention plan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the
NPDES permit.
(Prior Code, § 50.39) (Ord. 2009-002, passed 2-24-2009)
§ 50.40 WATERCOURSE PROTECTION.
   Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person’s lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles
that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so
that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical
integrity of the watercourse.
(Prior Code, § 50.40) (Ord. 2009-002, passed 2-24-2009)
§ 50.41 NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS.
   Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation, has information of any known or suspected release of
materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants
discharging into storm water, the storm drain system, or water of the United
States, that person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery,
containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of
hazardous materials, the person shall immediately notify emergency response
agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a
release of non-hazardous materials, the person shall notify the authorized
enforcement agency in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next
business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written
notice addressed and mailed to the city within three business days of the phone
notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or
industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall
also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to
prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three
years.
(Prior Code, § 50.41) (Ord. 2009-002, passed 2-24-2009)
§ 50.42 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Notice of violation. Whenever the city finds that a person has
violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this subchapter, the
authorized enforcement agency may order compliance by written notice of
violation to the responsible person. Such notice may require without
limitation:
      (1)   The performance of monitoring, analysis, and reporting;
      (2)   The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;

and
      (6)   The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
   (B)   Deadline and failure to comply. If abatement of a violation and/or
restoration of affected property is required, the notice shall set forth a
deadline within which such remediation or restoration must be completed. The
notice shall further advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or
restore within the established deadline, the work will be done by a designated
governmental agency or a contractor and the expense thereof shall be charged to
the violator.
(Prior Code, § 50.42) (Ord. 2009-002, passed 2-24-2009)
§ 50.43 ENFORCEMENT MEASURES AFTER APPEAL.
   If the violation had not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set
forth in the notice of violation, or, in the event of an appeal, within 15 days
of the decision of the municipal authority upholding the decision of the
authorized enforcement agency, then representatives of the authorized
enforcement agency shall enter upon the subject private property and are
authorized to take any and all measures necessary to abate the violation and/or

   Within 30 days after abatement of the violation, the owner of the property
will be notified of the cost of abatement, including administrative costs. The
property owner may file a written protest objecting to the amount of the
assessment within 15 days. If the amount due is not paid within a timely manner
as determined by the decision of the municipal authority, the charges shall
become a special assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on
the property for the amount of the assessment. Any person violating any of the
provisions of this subchapter shall become liable to the city by reason of such
violation.
(Prior Code, § 50.44) (Ord. 2009-002, passed 2-24-2009)
§ 50.45 INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.
   It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to

§ 51.01 ESTABLISHMENT OF STORM WATER FACILITIES FUND.
   Pursuant to M.S. § 444.075, as it may be amended from time to time, the city
establishes a Storm Water Facilities Fund and authorizes the imposition of just
and equitable charges for the use and availability of storm sewer facilities.
For purposes of this chapter, all provisions of M.S. § 444.075, as it may be
amended from time to time, relating to storm water facilities are incorporated
by reference and are made a part of this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 51.01)
§ 51.02 FINDINGS AND DETERMINATIONS.
   (A)   In the exercise of its governmental authority and in order to promote
the public health, safety, convenience, and general welfare, the city has
constructed, operated, and maintained a storm sewer system, including mains,
holding areas, and ponds, and other appurtenances and related facilities (the
“facilities”). This chapter is adopted in the further exercise of the authority
in the future, for the same purposes, and for purposes of financing the cost of
building, constructing, reconstructing, repairing, operating, maintaining,
enlarging, improving, or in any other manner obtaining, the facilities or any
portion of them (the “facilities costs”).
   (B)   The facilities have heretofore been financed and paid for through the
imposition of special assessments and ad valorem taxes. It is now necessary and
desirable to provide an alternative method of recovering some or all of the
future facilities costs through the imposition of charges as provided in this
chapter.
   (C)   In imposing charges for the facilities (“facilities charges”), it is
necessary to establish a procedure designed to make the charges just and
equitable. Taking into account the status of completion of the facilities, past
methods of recovering facilities costs, the topography of the city, and other
relevant factors, it is determined that it would be just and equitable to
assign responsibility for some or all of the future facilities costs on the
basis of the expected storm water runoff from the various parcels of land
within the city during a standard rainfall event. For purposes of this chapter,
a standard rainfall event is defined as a ten-year rainfall of 24-hour
duration, assuming Hydrologic Soil Group §B§ soils according to methods in the
Hydrology Guide for Minnesota, published by the Soil Conservation Service.
   (D)   The City Council finds that assigning costs and making facilities
charges based upon expected typical storm water runoff cannot be done with
mathematical precision but can only be accomplished within reasonable and
practical limits. The provisions of this chapter undertake to establish a
reasonable and practical method for imposing the charges.
(Prior Code, § 51.02)
§ 51.03 RATES AND CHARGES.
   (A)   Rates and charges for the use and availability of the facilities will
be determined by the use of a residential equivalent factor (“REF”). For
purposes of this chapter, one REF is defined as the ratio of runoff volume (in
inches) for a particular land use, to the runoff volume (in inches) for a
typical single-family residential lot.
   (B)   The City Council hereby adopts the charges set forth in §
33.090 for the use and availability of the facilities. The charges to be made
against each parcel of land in the city will be determined by multiplying the
REF for the parcel, based on actual land use, times the parcel’s acreage, times
the facilities charge per acre, except that all R-1, R-1A, and R-2 residential
parcels will be presumed to be one-third acre per dwelling unit on the
presumption that most such parcels in the city are approximately that size and
in order to avoid computation of the actual area of every such parcel in the
city.
(Prior Code, § 51.03)
§ 51.04 OTHER LAND USES.
   Other land uses not listed in the table in §
33.090 will be classified by the Public Works Director or designee by assigning
them to classes most nearly like the listed uses from the standpoint of runoff
volume for the standard rainfall event. An appeal from the Public Works
Director’s determination of the property classification may be made to the City
Council.
(Prior Code, § 51.04)
§ 51.05 EXEMPTIONS.
   The following land uses are exempt from facilities charges:
   (A)   City, county, and state road and highway rights-of-way;
   (B)   Lakes and ponds; and
   (C)   City-owned property.
(Prior Code, § 51.05)
§ 51.06 SEPARATE FUND.
   All facilities charges, when collected, and all moneys received from the
sale of any facilities or equipment, or any byproducts, will be placed in a
separate fund, and used first to pay the normal, reasonable, and current costs
of operating and maintaining the facilities. The net revenues received in
excess of the costs may be pledged by resolutions of the City Council, or may
be used though not so pledged, for the payment of principal and interest on
obligations issued as provided in M.S. § 444.075, Subd. 2, as it may be amended
from time to time, or to pay the portion of the principal and interest as may
be directed in the resolutions.
(Prior Code, § 51.06)
§ 51.07 ADJUSTMENT OF CHARGES.
   The City Council may by ordinance adopt policies providing for the
adjustment of facilities charges for parcels or groups of parcels, based upon
land use data supplied by affected property owners, which data demonstrates a
runoff volume for the standard rainfall event substantially different from the
REF being used for the parcel or parcels. The adjustment will be made only upon
recommendation of the Public Works Director or designee and will not be made
effective retroactively.
(Prior Code, § 51.07)
§ 51.08 PUBLIC HEARING AND NOTICE.
   The city will hold a hearing prior to determining whether to build,
construct, enlarge, or improve facilities financed in whole or in part by the
imposition of facility charges. Notice of the hearing will be published in the
official city newspaper at least ten days prior to the date of hearing. Owners
of all property adjoining a proposed improvement will be mailed or served with
a notice at least ten days in advance of the hearing. Failure to give mailed
notice or any defects in the notice will not invalidate the proceedings.
(Prior Code, § 51.08)
§ 51.09 ESTABLISHMENT OF A TAX LIEN.
   Any facilities charges in excess of 90 days past due on October 1 of any
year may be certified to the County Auditor for collection with real estate
taxes in the following year pursuant to M.S. § 444.075, Subd. 3, as it may be
amended from time to time. In addition, the city may bring a civil action or
exercise other legal remedies to collect unpaid facilities charges.
(Prior Code, § 51.09)
§ 51.10 RECALCULATION OF CHARGES.
   If a property owner or other person responsible for paying facilities
charges questions the correctness of the charges, the person may have the
determination of the facilities charges recomputed by written request to the
Public Works Director or designee. The request must be made within 30 days of
the mailing of the billing in question.

Chapter 33 must be paid before water service is connected.
(Prior Code, § 52.01) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 52.02 ACCOUNT NAME AND LIABILITY.
   Applications for water service are to be made on forms provided by the City
Manager or designee. All accounts will be carried in the name of the owner of
the property served or the owner’s lessee who personally, or by an authorized
agent, applies for the service. In all cases, including those where application
for water service is made by a lessee, the property owner will be liable for
water service.
(Prior Code, § 52.02)
§ 52.03 RATES AND CHARGES.
   Rates, charges, and prepayments for water use and service will be in the
amounts set forth in
Chapter 33.
(Prior Code, § 52.03)
§ 52.04 METERS.
   For properties in all zoning districts other than R-1, R-1A, R-2, and R-3,
meters meeting city specifications shall be purchased and maintained by the
property owner at the owner’s expense. The city will determine where the water
meter will be installed. City employees have the authority to enter upon
premises served by city water at any reasonable hour for the purposes of
inspection or repair of meter and for turning service on or off. Tampering with
meters is prohibited. Once a meter for a property in an R-1, R-1A, R-2, or R-
3 district has been paid for by the owner, the city will repair and maintain
the meter at city’s expense.
(Prior Code, § 52.04) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 52.05 WATER READING AND BILLING.
   (A)   Meter reading. All water meters will be read quarterly on or before
January 3, April 3, July 3, and October 3.
   (B)   Billing and payment. Quarterly water statements will be sent out on or
around January 20, April 20, July 20, and October 20, and are payable on or
before the twentieth day of the following month. If payment is made by U.S.
mail, a bill will be considered paid as of the date of postmark. If the payment
date deadline falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, payment may be
made on or prior to the first day thereafter on which city offices are open. If
payment is not timely made, a late fee in the amount set forth in
Chapter 33 is due. If payment on a quarterly statement is not made on or prior
to March 5, June 5, September 5, or December 5 respectively, the city retains
the right to send a final notice of payment overdue to the customer by
certified mail, notifying the customer that: payment must be received at the
City Hall within five days; failure to make the payment in full within the
five-day period will result in the discontinuance of water service; and the
customer has the right to a hearing before the Public Works Director before
water service is discontinued, provided the customer has made a request for a
hearing within the five-day period. If a request for a hearing is timely made
by the customer, a hearing will be held in accordance with the provisions of §
52.06. If a payment is not received and a hearing request is not timely made,
the city may discontinue service to the customer. A charge will be made to the
customer in the case of discontinuance of service for nonpayment of a water
bill, and a charge will also be made to the customer for turning on the water
service after it has been shut off for nonpayment, each in the amounts set
forth in Chapter 33. Payments of any bill must be made at the City Hall, and
employees of the Water Department are not authorized to accept payment of any
bill.
(Prior Code, § 52.05)
§ 52.06 RIGHT TO DISCONTINUE SERVICE.
   No water service will be shut off for nonpayment until the customer has been
afforded an opportunity for an impartial hearing pursuant to §
52.05(B). If no hearing is requested within the required time, service will be
shut off. If a hearing is requested, service will be shut off unless a valid
reason for nonpayment is demonstrated at the hearing. If a hearing is so
requested, it will be held by the City Manager, or the City Manager’s designee,
within six working days of the request. If, as a result of the hearing, the
City Manager, or the City Manager’s designee, finds that the amount claimed to
be owing is actually due and unpaid and that there is no legal reason why the
water service may not be discontinued, then the city may discontinue water
service.
(Prior Code, § 52.06)
§ 52.07 TAKING WATER WITHOUT AUTHORITY.
   It is unlawful for any person to use city water service without proper
authority.
(Prior Code, § 52.07) Penalty, see §

   To promote and protect the public health, safety, and welfare of the city
and its residents, it may be necessary during periods of drought or unusual
water use for the City Council to declare the existence of an emergency with
respect to the use of city water and to provide for restricted use. The City
Council will sit as an Emergency Water Supply Board, which may declare the
existence of the emergencies as, and when, it may be necessary to impose and
enforce water use restrictions.
(Prior Code, § 52.08)
§ 52.09 SPRINKLING REGULATIONS.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 71.01 CERTAIN STOPPING AND PARKING PROHIBITED.
   (A)   Rights-of-way. No person may drive upon or across, stop, leave
standing, or park a vehicle, whether attended or unattended, upon any boulevard
or other portion of a public right-of-way abutting the traveled portion of a
roadway. This prohibition will not apply to driveways which give access from a
roadway. In the event of an emergency resulting from vehicle failure in an area
where the parking is prohibited, the vehicle operator must attempt where
practical to move the vehicle off the traveled portion of the roadway. A clear
and unobstructed width of at least 15 feet of the traveled part of the roadway
opposite the standing vehicle must be left for the free passage of other
vehicles.
   (B)   Obstruction of mailboxes. No person may park a vehicle so as to
obstruct a mailbox.
   (C)   Order to proceed. No person may stop or park a vehicle on a roadway
when directed or ordered to proceed by a police officer.
   (D)   Signs and posting. No person may stop or park a vehicle at any place
where official signs prohibit the stopping or parking. When a roadway is
temporarily posted by order of the police for the purpose of traffic control,
removal of snow, ice, or waste, maintenance, or improvement or otherwise,
evidence of the posting constitutes prima facie evidence of the order of the
police and notice of same.
(Prior Code, § 72.01) Penalty, see §

of any official sign, or operate at a speed greater than is safe and reasonable
under the conditions then existing, and in no event at a speed in excess of 15
mph. Parking of vehicles on semi-public property must conform to any designated
stalls or positions for parking. No vehicles may be parked or allowed to stand
in an area designated or used as a lane for moving traffic so as to interfere
with the movement of traffic. The Police Department may post signs at any
entrance to semi-public property from a roadway to designate one-way traffic
for entrance or exit, and the driver of any vehicle entering or leaving the
semi-public property must comply with any one-way sign so posted.

unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ABANDONED MOTOR VEHICLE. A motor vehicle which:
      (1)   Has remained for a period of more than 48 hours on public property
illegally or without vital operating component parts;
      (2)   Has remained for a period of more than 48 hours on private property
without the consent of the person who controls the property;
      (3)   Remains on private property, is not in a garage, and is in such an
inoperable condition that it has no substantial potential further use
consistent with its usual functions; or
      (4)   Has been impounded and not reclaimed by its owner within the period
prescribed in this section.
   CITY IMPOUND. The person or company designated by the City Manager or
designee to be responsible for towing and storage of vehicles impounded by the
city.
   MOTOR VEHICLE or VEHICLE. A vehicle as defined in M.S. § 169.011, Subd. 92,
as it may be amended from time to time, which is powered all or in part by a
motor or engine.
   VITAL COMPONENT PARTS. Those parts of a motor vehicle essential to the
mechanical functioning of the vehicle, including, but not limited to, the
motor, drive train, and wheels.
(Prior Code, § 72.30)
§ 71.31 VEHICLES IMPOUNDED.
   The following motor vehicles may be impounded by the city impound at the
direction of any police officer:
   (A)   Any unoccupied motor vehicle found in violation of any provision of
any traffic or parking provision of this code or resolution of the city, or any
disabled or abandoned motor vehicle;
   (B)   A motor vehicle tagged by a police officer to be impounded, unless the
owner or operator of the vehicle appears before the tagged vehicle has been
towed, in which case the vehicle will be released without the payment of any
fee, other than towing or service charges already incurred; and/or
   (C)   A motor vehicle directed by a police officer to be impounded because
the officer considers possession of the vehicle necessary in the prosecution of
a person for violation of law.
(Prior Code, § 72.31)
§ 71.32 STORAGE OF IMPOUNDED VEHICLES.
   Any vehicle directed to be impounded, from the time it is in possession of
the city impound until the time it is released, will be considered to be in the
custody of the law. No work may be done on the vehicle by the city impound, nor
may the city impound permit anyone to do any work on the vehicle or remove any
part, or change or repair any part.
(Prior Code, § 72.32)
§ 71.33 DISPOSITION OF IMPOUNDED VEHICLES.
   (A)   Notice of impoundment. When a motor vehicle has been impounded, the
Police Department will give notice of the impoundment within ten days after it
is taken into custody. The notice will set forth the date and place of the
taking, the year, make, model, and serial number of the vehicle, and the place
where the vehicle is being held. The notice will inform the owner and any
readily identifiable lienholders of their right to reclaim the vehicle, and
state that failure of the owner or lienholders to exercise their right to
reclaim the vehicle within the prescribed time period will be deemed a waiver
by them of all right, title, and interest in the vehicle, and a consent to the
sale of the vehicle at public auction or by sealed bid. When a motor vehicle is
more than seven model years of age, is lacking vital component parts, and does
not display a license plate currently valid in the state, or any other state or
foreign country, it will immediately be eligible for sale at public auction or
by sealed bid, and will not be subject to the notification provided herein.
   (B)   Notice sent by mail. The notice will be sent by mail to the registered
owner, if known, of the impounded vehicle and to all readily identifiable
lienholders of record. If it is not reasonably possible to determine the
identity and address of the registered owner and all lienholders or record, the
notice will be published once in a newspaper of general circulation in the area
where the motor vehicle was abandoned.
   (C)   Right to reclaim. The owner or any lienholder of an impounded motor
vehicle has a right to reclaim the vehicle upon payment of all towing, storage,
and impounding charges resulting from taking the vehicle into custody. The
reclamation must occur within 15 days after the date the notice was given.
Reclamation may not occur when the police consider the retention of the vehicle
necessary for the prosecution of any person for violation of law. The city
impound will provide to the City Manager or designee a schedule of charges
acceptable to the City Manager or designee for the towing, storage, and
impounding of vehicles, and the schedule will be kept in the Police Department.
Upon receipt of the release payment, the city impound will release the vehicle
by a written release stating the date of the release, together with the
enumerated charges and the purpose for which the charges were made. The release
must be made in one original and three copies, all of which must be signed by
the city impound and the owner of the vehicle to whom the release is made. The
city impound is to retain the original of the release, deliver one copy to the
owner of the vehicle, one copy to the Police Department, and one copy to the
City Manager or designee.
   (D)   Sale of vehicle. An impounded motor vehicle subject to sale under this
subchapter may be sold to the highest bidder at public auction or sale or by
sealed bid, following published notice of the sale. The purchaser will be given
a receipt in a form prescribed by law, which will be sufficient title to
dispose of the vehicle. The receipt will also entitle the purchaser to register
the vehicle and receive a certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
claims of ownership. The proceeds of the sale of a motor vehicle will be used
to pay the cost of towing, storage, and impounding the vehicle, all notice and
publication costs, and all other costs reasonably incurred by this city with
respect to the vehicle. Any remainder from the proceeds of a sale will be held
for the owner of the vehicle or entitled lienholder for 90 days, and thereafter
will be deposited in the state treasury. If no bid is received for an abandoned
motor vehicle, the vehicle may be disposed of in accordance with division (E)
below.
   (E)   Disposal of vehicles not sold at public sale. The city may contract
with any person licensed by the State Pollution Control Agency for the
collection, storage, incineration, volume reduction, transportation, or other
services necessary to prepare abandoned motor vehicles and other scrap metal
for recycling or other methods of disposal. Where no bid has been received for
an abandoned motor vehicle, the city may dispose of the vehicle pursuant to the
contract.
(Prior Code, § 72.33)
§ 71.34 REPORTS OF POLICE OFFICERS AND CITY IMPOUND.
   (A)   Traffic tags will be used by police officers when directing the towing
and impounding of a vehicle. The tag is to be in the form prescribed by the
Chief of Police and will include the make and license number of the vehicle
tagged, the date and time of the offense, the nature of the offense charged,
and any further information which the Chief of Police deems necessary and
advisable. The police officer will, if possible, await the arrival of a tow
truck.
   (B)   When a vehicle is towed and impounded, it is the duty of the city
impound to keep a “tow sheet,” on a form furnished by the City Manager or
designee, on any tows. The tow sheet must give the description of the vehicle,
with an inventory of any personal property visible in the vehicle at the time
of the arrival of the vehicle at the city impound. The description and
inventory must include the make and license number of the vehicle and the time
of arrival at the city impound, together with a statement of information as may
be necessary to describe the vehicle and property. All tow sheets will be
consecutively numbered. The original and one copy of each tow sheet must be
delivered to the Police Department, which will deliver a copy to the City
Manager or designee.
(Prior Code, § 72.34)
§ 71.35 AUTHORIZATION.
   Whenever it is found necessary under any section of this code or state law
to remove a vehicle illegally parked on a roadway, any police officer is hereby
authorized to provide for the removal of the vehicle to the nearest convenient
garage, impound lot, or other place of safety.

§ 71.36 PARKING DURING SNOW REMOVAL.
   (A)   No person shall park a vehicle on any city street for a period of 48
hours, commencing immediately after two inches or more of continuous snowfall,
or until snow removal has been completed curb to curb.

of traffic, plowing, and/or the removal of snow, ice, or waste, or maintenance
or improvement of any highway or street to remove any vehicle standing on a
highway or street in the city, then any police officer is authorized to provide
for the removal of the vehicle and have the same removed to the nearest
convenient garage or other place of safety. The cost of removal and storage of
the vehicle will be charged to the owner of the vehicle, and to the person
causing the violation.

   The Communications Act of 1934, as amended by the Telecommunication Act of
1996, being 47 U.S.C. §§ 201 et seq., grants the Federal Communications
Commission jurisdiction over many aspects of telecommunications services. The
city’s regulation of towers and WTFs in the city will not have the effect of
prohibiting any person from providing wireless telecommunications services in
violation of the Act.
(Prior Code, § 90.01)
WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS TOWERS
§ 90.15 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The general purpose of this chapter is to regulate the placement,
construction, and modification of towers and WTFs in order to protect the
health, safety, and welfare of the public, while at the same time encouraging
the development of the competitive wireless telecommunications marketplace in
the city.
   (B)   The specific purposes of this subchapter are:
      (1)   To allow the location of telecommunication towers and WTFs in the
city;
      (2)   To protect residential areas from potential adverse impact of
towers and WTFs;
      (3)   To minimize adverse visual impact of towers and WTFs through
careful design, siting, landscaping, and innovative camouflaging techniques;
      (4)   To promote and encourage shared collocation of towers and antenna
support structures as a primary option rather than construction of additional
single-use towers;
      (5)   To promote and encourage utilization of technological designs that
will either eliminate or reduce the need for erection of new tower structures
to support WTFs;
      (6)   To avoid potential damage to property caused by towers and WTFs by
ensuring the structures are soundly and carefully designed, constructed,
modified, maintained, and removed when no longer used or are determined to be
structurally unsound;
      (7)   To ensure that towers and WTFs are compatible with surrounding land
uses;
      (8)   To overcome the potential adverse impacts that poorly or
unregulated towers and WTFs could have on the public health, safety, and
welfare; and
      (9)   Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services
to provide the services to the community quickly, effectively, and efficiently.
(Prior Code, § 90.02)
§ 90.16 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ANTENNA. Any exterior transmitting or receiving device mounted on a tower,
building, or other structure and used in communications that radiate or capture
electromagnetic waves, digital signs, analog signals, radio frequencies

(Prior Code, § 90.03)
§ 90.17 TOWER AND FACILITY BUILDING AND DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (A)   Generally. All towers and WTFs must be constructed in accordance with
the following standards.
   (B)   Specifically.
      (1)   Siting. WTFs located on or attached to existing structures are
regulated by the provisions of the zoning district for each parcel. Towers may
only be located on parcels within commercial and light industrial zoning
districts (as defined by the city’s zoning and land use regulations) and on
city-owned property. Towers are not permitted in public rights-of-way.
      (2)   Color and architecture. All WTFs shall be concealed or camouflaged
and shall utilize materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping to
blend in with the surrounding natural setting and built environment. If a WTF
is proposed on any part of a building or structure, it must blend with the
structure’s design, architecture, and color, including exterior finish. The
term CAMOUFLAGE shall not mean invisible, but rather appearing as part of
another structure, such as a building, wall, or roof, or designed to appear as
another structure, such as a building, clock tower, chimney, flag pole, light
pole, or tree.
      (3)   Landscaping. The following requirements shall govern the
landscaping surrounding towers; provided, however, that the City Council, after
considering the recommendation of city staff, may waive the requirements if the
visual impact of a proposed tower or WTF would be minimal or if the purposes of
this subchapter would otherwise be better served thereby.
         (a)   Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant
materials that effectively screens the view of the tower compound from property
used for residences. The standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip at
least four feet wide outside the perimeter of the compound.
         (b)   Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site
shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as
towers sited on large, wooded lots, natural growth around the property
perimeter may be sufficient buffer. Existing mature trees and other vegetation
at the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible.
      (4)   Signs. The use of any portion of a tower or WTF for signs or
advertising other than warning or equipment information signs is prohibited.
      (5)   Lighting. WTFs or towers shall not be illuminated by artificial
means and shall not display strobe lights unless the lighting is specifically
required by the Federal Aviation Administration or other federal or state
authority. When incorporated into the approved design of a WTF, light fixtures
used to illuminate ball fields, parking lots, or similar areas may be attached
to the tower.
      (6)   Monopole. New towers shall be of a monopole design, without guide
wires, unless the City Council determines that an alternative design would
better blend into the surrounding environment.
      (7)   Setbacks. Towers and WTFs shall comply with the principal structure
setbacks of the underlying zoning district and the following additional
standards.
         (a)   The tower or WTF is setback from all residential dwellings at
least one foot for each foot in height.
         (b)   Towers and WTFs shall not encroach upon any easements unless
permission is obtained from the underlying property owner and holder of the
easement.
         (c)   Towers and WTFs shall not be located between a principal
structure and a public street.
         (d)   The required setbacks may be reduced or the location in relation
to a public street modified, at the sole discretion of the city, when the WTF
is integrated into an existing or proposed structure such as a building, light,
or utility pole.
      (8)   Height.
         (a)   The height of any tower shall not exceed 75 feet.
         (b)   Antennas located on an existing structure that is taller than
the limit allowed in the underlying zoning district may extend up to five feet
above the height of the structure.
      (9)   Safety and environmental standards.
         (a)   Building codes; safety standards. To ensure the structural
integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in
compliance with standards contained in applicable state or local building codes
and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic
Industries Alliance, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the
city concludes that a tower fails to comply with the codes and standards and
constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to
the owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring the tower into
compliance with the standards. Failure to bring the tower into compliance
within the 30-day period shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower
or antenna at the owner’s expense.
         (b)   Interference with public safety telecommunications. No tower or
WTF shall interfere with public safety telecommunications. All towers or WTFs
shall comply with FCC regulations and licensing requirements.
         (c)   Security fencing. Towers shall be enclosed by security fencing
not less than six feet in height and shall also be equipped with an appropriate
anticlimbing device; provided, however, that the City Council, after
considering the recommendations of the city staff, may waive the requirements,
as it deems appropriate.
         (d)   Noise. If the proposed WTF includes equipment that causes or a
WTF otherwise causes significant increased sound levels, sound buffers may be
required, including, but not limited to, baffling, barriers, enclosures, walls,
and plantings.
         (e)   Radio frequency emissions and interference. WTFs must comply
with Federal Communication Commission standards for radio frequency emissions
and interference.
         (f)   Risk of danger. Towers and WTFs shall not pose an unreasonable
risk of explosion, fire, or other danger due to its proximity to volatile,
flammable, explosive, or hazardous materials.
         (g)   Maintenance. All commercial towers or WTFs shall at all times:
            1.   Be kept and maintained in good condition, order, and repair so
that the same shall not menace or endanger the life or property of any person;
and
            2.   Allow sufficient access for service vehicles and personnel.
      (10)   Collocation requirements. To every extent possible:
         (a)   All proposed WTFs shall be placed on an existing tower,
building, or structure located within one-half mile of the desired location for
the proposed WTF;
         (b)   All wireless telecommunication providers shall cooperate with
each other in collocating WTFs and shall exercise good faith in collocating
with other licensed carriers and in the sharing of sites, including the sharing
of technical information necessary to evaluate the feasibility of collocation.
In the event a dispute arises as to a collocation issue, the city may require a
third-party technical study to evaluate the feasibility of collocating at the
expense of either or both wireless telecommunications providers;
         (c)   All new towers and any pre-existing tower owned by a wireless
telecommunications provider shall be made available for use by the owner or
initial user thereof, together with as many other licensed carriers as can be
technically located thereon;
         (d)   If determined appropriate by the city, all new towers shall be
designed and constructed in such a manner as to accommodate at least one other
comparable WTF in addition to the applicant’s; and
         (e)   All new wireless telecommunications towers that are less than 75
feet shall be designed and constructed in a manner that allows the tower to be
expanded to a height of 75 feet in order to allow for future collocation.
      (11)   Exceptions to collocation. The city may waive any or all of the
collocation requirements, if it is determined that:
         (a)   The planned WTF would exceed the structural capacity of the
existing or approved tower, building, or structure, as documented by a
qualified and licensed professional engineer, and the existing or approved
tower, building, or structure cannot be reinforced, modified, or replaced to
accommodate planned or equivalent equipment;
         (b)   The planned WTF would cause interference materially impacting
the usability of other existing or planned WTFs at the structure as documented
by a qualified radio frequency engineer selected by the city and the
interference cannot be prevented; and
         (c)   No existing tower, building, or structure within an applicant’s
search radius can or will accommodate the planned equipment at a height
necessary to function reasonably as documented by a qualified radio frequency
engineer selected by the city.
(Prior Code, § 90.04) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 90.18 PERMITTED USES/ADMINISTRATIVE APPROVAL.
   (A)   Towers and WTFs shall be a permitted use in a light industrial
district, as described in Chapter 154, and on city-owned property. Towers and
WTFs proposed in a light industrial district or on city-owned property may be
administratively approved.
   (B)   The following provisions shall govern the issuance of administrative
approvals for towers and WTFs.
      (1)   Each applicant for administrative approval shall submit an
application to the City Manager or designee providing the information set forth
in §
90.20, when applicable, and a nonrefundable fee as established by resolution of
the City Council to reimburse the city for the costs of reviewing the
application.
      (2)   The City Manager or designee shall review an application for
administrative approval of a tower or WTF and determine if the proposed use
complies with this chapter.
      (3)   The City Manager or designee shall respond to each such application
within 60 days after the filing of the application by either approving or
denying the application. If the City Manager or designee fails to respond to
the applicant within 60 days, then the application shall be deemed to be
approved, unless the time has been extended under M.S. § 15.99, as it may be
amended from time to time.
      (4)   In connection with any such administrative approval, the City
Manager or designee may, in order to encourage shared use, or the use of
alternative tower structures, administratively waive or modify any zoning
district setback requirements in or separation distances between towers by up
to 50%.
      (5)   If an administrative approval is denied, the applicant may file an
appeal to the City Council. Any appeal must be filed by the applicant within 30
days of the receipt of the City Manager’s or designee’s decision.
   (C)   The following uses may be approved by the City Manager or designee
after conducting an administrative review:
      (1)   Locating a tower or WTF, including the placement of additional
buildings or other supporting equipment used in connection with a tower or WTF,
in any light industrial district or on city-owned property; and/or
      (2)   Locating antennas on existing structures or towers consistent with
the terms of divisions (C)(2)(a) and (C)(2)(b) below:
         (a)   Antennas on existing structures. Any WTF proposed to be affixed
to an existing building or structure may be approved by the City Manager or
designee as an accessory use to the building or structure, provided:
            1.   The antenna does not extend more than 30 feet above the
highest point of the building or structure;
            2.   The antenna complies with all applicable federal regulations;
and
            3.   The antenna complies with all applicable building codes.
         (b)   Antennas on existing towers. Any WTF which is proposed to be
attached to an existing tower may be administratively approved by the City
Manager or designee and, to minimize adverse visual impacts associated with the
proliferation and clustering of towers, collocation of antennas by more than
one carrier on existing towers shall take precedence over the construction of
new towers, provided the collocation is accomplished in a manner consistent
with the following: a tower which is modified or reconstructed to accommodate
the collocation of an additional antenna shall be of the same tower type as the
existing tower, unless the City Manager or designee allows reconstruction as a
monopole.
(Prior Code, § 90.05) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 90.19 PERMITTED CONDITIONAL USES.
   (A)   Generally. Unless it is a permitted use in accordance with §
90.18, a tower or WTF shall be permitted only if a conditional use permit has
been issued for that use by the City Council. The following provisions shall
govern the issuance of conditional use permits for towers or WTFs by the City
Council.
      (1)   Applications for conditional use permits under this section shall
be subject to the procedures and requirements of
Chapter 154, except as modified in this section.
      (2)   In granting a conditional use permit, the City Council may impose
conditions to the extent necessary to minimize any adverse effect of the
proposed tower or WTF on adjoining properties.
      (3)   Any information of an engineering nature that the applicant
submits, whether civil, mechanical, or electrical, shall be certified by a
licensed professional engineer.
      (4)   An applicant for a conditional use permit shall submit the
information described in this section and a nonrefundable fee as established by
resolution of the City Council to reimburse the city for the costs of reviewing
the application.
   (B)   Towers. In addition to any information required for applications for
conditional use permits pursuant to
Chapter 154, applicants for a conditional use permit for a tower shall submit
the following information:
      (1)   A scaled site plan clearly indicating the location, type, and
height of the proposed tower, on-site land uses and zoning, adjacent land uses
and zoning, adjacent roadways, proposed means of access, setbacks from property
lines, elevation drawings of the proposed tower and any other structures,
topography, parking, and other information deemed by the city staff to be
necessary to assess compliance with this section;
      (2)   The legal description of the property on which the proposed tower
is to be constructed;
      (3)   The setback distance between the proposed tower and the nearest
residential property;
      (4)   The separation distance from other towers and, if known, the type
of construction of the existing tower(s) and the identity of the owner(s)/
operator(s) of the existing tower(s);
      (5)   A landscape plan showing specific landscape materials;
      (6)   Method of fencing, and finished color and, if applicable, the
method of camouflage;
      (7)   A statement of compliance with all applicable federal, state, or
local laws;
      (8)   A notarized statement by the applicant as to whether construction
of the tower will accommodate collocation of additional antennas for future
users;
      (9)   A description of the suitability of the use of existing towers,
other structures, or alternative technology not requiring the use of a tower or
new structure to provide the services to be provided through the use of the
proposed new tower; and
      (10)   A description of the feasible location(s) of future towers or WTFs
within the city based upon existing physical, engineering, technological, or
geographical limitations in the event the proposed tower is erected.
   (C)   Factors considered in granting conditional use permits for towers. In
addition to any standards for consideration of conditional use permit,
applications pursuant to Chapter 154, the City Council shall consider the
following factors in determining whether to issue a conditional use permit, no
one of which shall be conclusive, although the City Council may waive or reduce
the burden on the applicant of one or more of these criteria if city staff or
City Council concludes that the goals of this subchapter are better served
thereby:
      (1)   Height of the proposed tower;
      (2)   Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential
district boundaries;
      (3)   Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties;
      (4)   Surrounding topography;
      (5)   Surrounding tree coverage and foliage;
      (6)   Design of the tower, with particular reference to design
characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual
obtrusiveness;
      (7)   Proposed ingress and egress; and
      (8)   Availability of suitable existing towers, other structures, or
alternative technologies not requiring the use of towers or structures.
   (D)   Existing facilities. No new tower shall be permitted unless the
applicant demonstrates, to the reasonable satisfaction of the City Council,
that there is no existing tower, structure, or alternative technology not
requiring a tower or structure that can accommodate the applicant’s proposed
WTF or tower. An applicant shall submit information requested by the City
Council related to the availability of suitable existing towers, other
structures, or alternative technology. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that
no existing tower, structure, or alternative technology can accommodate the
applicant’s proposed WTF may consist of any of the following.
      (1)   No existing tower or structure is located within the geographic
area that meet the applicant’s engineering requirements.
      (2)   Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet
the applicant’s engineering requirements.
      (3)   Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural
strength to support the applicant’s proposed WTF and related equipment.
      (4)   The applicant’s proposed WTF would cause electromagnetic
interference with one or more WTFs on existing towers or structures, or a WTF
on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the
applicant’s proposed WTF.
      (5)   The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in
order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or
structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development
are presumed to be unreasonable.
      (6)   The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors
that render existing towers and structures unsuitable.
      (7)   The applicant demonstrates that an alternative technology that does
not require the use of towers or structures, such as a cable microcell network
using multiple low-powered transmitters/receivers attached to a wireline
system, is unsuitable. Costs of alternative technology that exceed new tower or
antenna development shall not be presumed to render the technology unsuitable.
   (E)   Separation. All towers for which a conditional use permit is required
shall be separated by a minimum of 750 feet between the proposed tower and any
pre-existing tower; provided, however, that the City Council, after considering
any recommendations of city staff, may reduce the standard separation
requirements if the purposes of this chapter would be better served thereby.
The separation distance shall be measured by drawing or following a straight
line between the base of the existing tower and the proposed base, pursuant to
a site plan, of the proposed tower.
(Prior Code, § 90.06)
§ 90.20 APPLICATIONS FOR TOWERS AND WTFS.
   (A)   Application. In addition to an applicant’s name, address, proposed
site for a WTF antenna or tower, site plan, grading and landscaping plans,
written permission of the property owner (unless the property owner is the
city), and any other similar information, an application for a conditional use
permit, building, or other permit relating to the installation or construction
of a WTF or tower, the applicant shall include the following:
      (1)   A statement indicating that failure to comply with the conditions
of approval shall result in the revocation of the permit and removal of the WTF
and/or tower;
      (2)   A statement indicating that the expenses incurred by the city to
enforce the provisions of the permit shall be reimbursed by the applicant;
      (3)   A statement which requires the applicant to utilize the procedures
established by the Federal Communications Commission to resolve any complaints
received relating to interference allegedly caused by the facility;
      (4)   A statement indicating the applicant will cooperate in good faith
and fair dealing in collocating WTFs;
      (5)   A statement indicating that the WTF or tower will be maintained in
good and safe condition, and its original appearance and concealment, disguise,
or camouflage elements incorporated into the design at the time of approval
shall be preserved. The maintenance shall include, but is not limited to,
painting, repair of equipment, and maintenance of landscaping;
      (6)   A statement authorizing the city to enter the property for the
purpose of periodic inspections to determine that the site complies with the
provisions of this section, any conditions of approval and all safety and
building codes and permits issued. This statement shall give the city the right
to conduct the inspections at any time upon reasonable notice to the property
owner(s), and that all expenses related to the inspections shall be borne by
the applicant;
      (7)   A statement indicating that the applicant understands that a tower
or WTF which has not been used for 12 successive months shall be deemed
abandoned and may, at the sole discretion of the city, be required to be
removed in the same manner and pursuant to the same procedures as for dangerous
or unsafe structures established by M.S. § 463.16, as it may be amended from
time to time;
      (8)   A written acknowledgment of the property owner indicating that the
removal of any unused or abandoned tower or WTF, or portions of any such towers
or WTFs, are ultimately the responsibility of the property owner; and
      (9)   A statement requiring the applicant to notify the city that the WTF
continues to be in operation. The notice of continuing operation shall be hand
delivered or sent to the City Manager or designee annually by certified mail
during the last two weeks of the month of December.
   (B)   Escrowed funds. At the time of application for a tower or WTF
conditional use or building permit, an escrow deposit shall be posted in an
amount determined from time to time by City Council resolution. No interest
shall accrue on any such escrowed funds. The city may charge against this
deposit to recover its costs for reviewing the tower or WTF application. These
costs may include, but are not limited to, city staff time over and above that
covered by the application fee, consultants’ fees, and fees for third-party
review. If a tower or WTF permit is approved, as a condition of approval,
deposit of additional escrow funds may be required. The city will charge
against this deposit to offset the city’s costs to monitor construction and
ensure compliance with the conditions of approval and standards in this
section. These charges may include, but are not limited to, city staff time,
consultants’ fees, and fees for third-party review, monitoring, and inspection.
Once construction has been completed and the applicant has complied with all
conditions of approval, any remaining deposit funds shall be refunded to the
party or entity that posted the escrow deposit. Refunds of the deposit shall
not be construed to limit the city’s ability to recover future costs associated
with review or monitoring ongoing operation of the WTF or future modifications,
amendments, or transfer of the facility.
   (C)   Assessments. In the event the city incurs charges relating to the
enforcement of this section, including, without limitation, expenses relating
to third-party consultants and removal of abandoned towers and WTFs, the city
reserves the right to assess the property owner for the charges in the same
manner in which the city assesses and collects real property taxes.
(Prior Code, § 90.07)
§ 90.21 NONCONFORMING USES.
   (A)   Collocation of additional antennas. Antennas that are collocated, in
accordance with the provisions of this subchapter, shall not be deemed to
constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use or structure.
   (B)   Preexisting towers. Preexisting towers shall be allowed to continue
their usage as they presently exist. Routine maintenance shall be permitted on
the preexisting towers. New construction other than routine maintenance on a
preexisting tower shall comply with the requirements of this subchapter.
   (C)   Rebuilding damaged or destroyed nonconforming towers or antennas. A
nonconforming tower, antenna, or WTF that is damaged or destroyed by wind,
storm, fire, or similar acts of God may be rebuilt without having to first
obtain administrative approval or a conditional use permit. The type, height,
and location of the tower or WTF shall be of the same type and intensity as the
original facility approval. Building permits to rebuild the facility shall
comply with the then applicable building codes and shall be obtained within 180
days from the date the facility is damaged or destroyed. If no permit is
obtained or if the permit expires, the tower or antenna shall be deemed
abandoned as specified in §
90.22.
   (D)   Nonconforming use/abandonment. A nonconforming tower or WTF that
becomes nonfunctional for 30 consecutive days shall be deemed abandoned.
(Prior Code, § 90.08) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 90.22 REMOVAL OF ABANDONED TOWERS AND WTFS.
   Any tower or WTF that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months
shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of the tower or WTF shall remove
the same within 90 days of receipt of notice from the city of the abandonment.
Failure to remove an abandoned tower or WTF within the 90-day period shall be
grounds for the city to remove the tower or WTF at the property owner’s
expense. If there are two or more users of a single tower, then this provision
shall not become effective until all users cease using the tower for a
continuous period of 12 months.
(Prior Code, § 90.09)
§ 90.23 REGULATION OF DISH ANTENNAS.
   (A)   Permits. No dish antenna may be erected, constructed, or placed, or
re-erected, re-constructed, or replaced, anywhere within the city without first
making an application for and obtaining a permit from the city, except for the
following:
      (1)   Dish antennas not greater than nine square feet in cross-sectional
area, which do not exceed six feet in height as measured from the base of the
dish antenna to the highest point of the dish antenna; and
      (2)   Dish antennas and towers erected or constructed by the city for
city purposes.
   (B)   Location. The following additional requirements apply dish antennas
located in any residential district:
      (1)   Dish antennas greater than nine square feet in area may not be
located on the roof or exterior wall of a principal or accessory building;
      (2)   Dish antennas may be located only in the rear yard; and
      (3)   No dish antenna may be located or maintained, at any time,
permanently or temporarily, closer to the allowed buildable area of a principal
building on any adjacent lot than it is to the principal building on the lot on
which it is located.
   (C)   Screening. The Building Official may require, as a condition to a
permit, that a dish antenna installed in a nonresidential district be screened
from residential districts located within 100 feet of the dish antenna.
   (D)   Height. Dish antennas in residential districts may not be in excess of
12 feet in height, measured from the ground elevation at the base of the dish
antenna to the highest point of the dish antenna. In all other zoning
districts, dish antennas may have an overall height of no more than 18 feet for
either a ground mount or roof mount, as measured from the point at which the
antenna is mounted to the roof or the ground elevation to the highest point of
the dish antenna.

(Prior Code, § 98.130)
§ 90.48 INDEMNIFICATION AND DEFENSE OF CITY.
   (A)   Indemnification of city. As a condition of issuance of a small
wireless facility permit, each permittee agrees on its behalf and on behalf of
its agents, successors, or assigns, to indemnify, defend, protect, and hold
harmless the city from and against any and all claims of any kind arising
against the city as a result of the issuance of the small wireless facility
permit including, but not limited to, a claim allegedly arising directly or
indirectly from the following:
      (1)   Any act, omission, or negligence of a permittee or its any agents,
successors, or assigns while engaged in the permitting or collocation of any

collocation of any small wireless facility or installation or replacement of
any wireless support structure authorized under the small wireless facility
permit;
      (2)   Any accident, damage, death, or injury to any of a permittee’s
contractors or subcontractors, or any officers, agents, or employees of either

authorized by a small wireless facility permit, or while in or about the public
right-of-way that are subject to the small wireless facility permit, for any
reason connected with the performance of the work authorized by the small
wireless facility permit, including from exposure to radio frequency emissions;
      (3)   Any accident, damage, death, or injury to any person or accident,
damage, or injury to any real or personal property in, upon, or in any way
allegedly connected with the collocation of any small wireless facility or
installation or replacement of any wireless support structure authorized by a
small wireless facility permit, or while in or about the public right-of-way
that are subject to the small wireless facility permit, from any causes or
claims arising at any time, including any causes or claims arising from
exposure to radio frequency emissions; and
      (4)   Any release or discharge, or threatened release or discharge, of
any hazardous material caused or allowed by a permittee or its agents about,
in, on, or under the public right-of-way.
   (B)   Defense of city. Each permittee agrees that, upon the request of the
Department, the permittee, at no cost or expense to the city, shall indemnify,
defend, and hold harmless the city against any claims as set forth in this
section, regardless of the alleged negligence of the city or any other party,
except only for claims resulting directly from the sole negligence or willful
misconduct of the city. Each permittee acknowledges and agrees that it has an
immediate and independent obligation to defend the city from any claims that
actually or potentially fall within the indemnity provision, even if the
allegations are or may be groundless, false, or fraudulent, which obligation
arises at the time such claim is tendered to the permittee or its agent by the
city and continues at all times thereafter. Each permittee further agrees that
the city shall have a cause of action for indemnity against the permittee for
any costs the city may be required to pay as a result of defending or
satisfying any claims that arise from or in connection with a small wireless
facility permit, except only for claims resulting directly from the sole
negligence or willful misconduct of the city. Each permittee further agrees
that the indemnification obligations assumed under a small wireless facility
permit shall survive its expiration or completion of collocation of any small
wireless facility authorized by the small wireless facility permit.
   (C)   Additional requirements. The Department may specify in a small
wireless facility permit such additional indemnification requirements as are
necessary to protect the city from risks of liability associated with the
permittee’s collocation of any small wireless facility or installation or
replacement of any wireless support structure.
(Prior Code, § 98.140)
§ 90.49 FEES AND COSTS.
   (A)   Application fees. The Department shall charge a fee for reviewing and
processing a small wireless facility permit application. These fees shall be

Department shall adjust the application fees annually by the consumer price
index for the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area.
   (B)   Annual small wireless facility permit fee. The Department shall charge
an annual small wireless permit fee for each small wireless facility permit
issued to a permittee. The annual small wireless permit fee shall be determined
by the director and listed in the city’s fee schedule. The annual small
wireless permit fee shall be based upon the recovery of the city’s rights-of-
way management costs.
   (C)   City-owned wireless support structure fees. The Department shall
charge a fee or fees to the owner of any small wireless facility collocated on

   (E)   Discretion to require additional fees. In instances where the review
of a small wireless facility permit application is or will be unusually costly
to the Department, the Director, in his or her discretion, may, after
consulting with other applicable city departments, agencies, boards, or
commissions, require an applicant to pay a sum in excess of the other fee
amounts charged pursuant to this section. This additional sum shall be
sufficient to recover the actual, reasonable costs incurred by the Department
and/or other city departments, agencies, boards, or commissions, in connection
with a small wireless facility permit application and shall be charged on a
time and materials basis. Whenever additional fees are charged, the Director,
upon request, shall provide in writing the basis for the additional fees and an
estimate of the additional fees. The Department may not require a fee imposed
under this subchapter through the provision of in-kind services by an applicant
as a condition of consent to use to city’s public right-of-way or to obtain a
small wireless facility permit.
   (F)   Reimbursement of city costs. The Department may determine that it
requires the services of an expert in order to evaluate a small wireless
facility permit application. In such cases, the Department shall not issue a
small wireless facility permit pursuant to the application unless the applicant
agrees to reimburse the Department for the actual, reasonable costs incurred
for the services of a technical expert.

   (A)   Incorporation by reference. M.S. §§ 347.50 through 347.565, as they
may be amended from time to time, are hereby incorporated by reference and
adopted as part of this subchapter. Incorporation of said statutes shall not be
a release by the city of any powers or authority which it has without such
incorporation.
   (B)   Designation. Police officers or others designated by the City Manager
or designee may declare a dog to be a dangerous dog or a potentially dangerous
dog as defined by M.S. § 347.50, as it may be amended from time to time. If a

amended from time to time, shall also be a violation of this subchapter. Any
person with authority to enforce this subchapter will impound animals kept or

§ 91.36 RECLAIMING ANIMALS.
   (A)   Notice. When an animal is impounded, the keeper of the pound will
provide the police with a description of the animal impounded within 24 hours
of the impoundment. The keeper must make a reasonable effort to determine
whether a license for the animal has been issued by the city or any adjoining
city, and to ascertain the name and address of the person to whom the license
was issued. If the license was issued during the preceding license year, then
before the animal may be disposed of, by sale or otherwise, the keeper of the
pound must give notice to the license holder not less than 24 hours before any
disposal of the animal. If the license holder gives notice to the keeper of
intent to reclaim the animal, the animal must be kept available for reclaiming
for 24 hours after receipt of that notice.
   (B)   Payment of fees. The city may employ or contract with a person or
organization for capturing and impounding animals not properly licensed,
collared, and tagged, and all other domesticated animals kept in violation of
this subchapter. All animals impounded will be kept with kind treatment and
sufficient food and water for their comfort for at least five regular business
days, unless sooner reclaimed by their owners. A dog or other domesticated
animal may be reclaimed upon payment by the license holder or owner of the
impounding fee set forth in
Chapter 33, plus the pound fee and cost of the food and care at the rates
established between the pound and the city, plus any medical costs reasonably
incurred while the animal was impounded. For each subsequent violation for the
same animal, the impounding fee will be double the amount of the previous
impounding fee. If an animal which is required to be licensed is unlicensed,
the regular license fee must be paid in addition to the foregoing amounts.
(Prior Code, § 91.40) (Ord. 08-007, passed 12-8-2008) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 91.37 QUARANTINE.
   If a dog or other animal within the city bites any person or is reported as
diseased, the police may require that the animal be impounded at the designated
pound for observation for sufficient time to determine whether it is diseased.
The animal may not be killed or reclaimed and returned to the owner until
ordered by the police. Any animal impounded for having bitten a person, which
is subsequently released by the police, may be reclaimed by its owner upon
payment of the impounding fee, cost of food and care, and any medical costs
incurred while impounded.
(Prior Code, § 91.41) (Ord. 08-007, passed 12-8-2008)
§ 91.38 DISPOSITION OF ANIMALS.
   At the expiration of at least seven full calendar days, including five full
regular business days from the time any animal is impounded, except in the case
of an animal ordered held in quarantine for a longer period by the police, if
the animal has not been reclaimed and the fees paid under §
91.36(B), the keeper of the pound may cause the animal to be humanely killed.
Alternatively, the keeper may sell the animal, as abandoned and unclaimed by
the owner, to any person upon payment of a sum of money not less than the
license fee and not more than the amount the owner would have to pay to reclaim
the dog. Notwithstanding the five-day limitation, if an animal has not been
disposed of, it may be reclaimed upon payment of the amounts provided for in §
91.36(B). For purposes of this section and §
91.36, REGULAR BUSINESS DAY means a day on which the establishment having

§ 91.56 KEEPING OF CERTAIN ANIMALS.
   (A)   General prohibition.  Except as allowed for bees in division (B) of
this section, no person may keep farm animals or wild animals as defined in
this code, nor more than two dogs or three dogs allowed under §§
91.01 through
91.03, or fowl, within the city nearer than 500 feet to any human habitation or
platted land, without approval of the City Council.
   (B)   Keeping of bees. 
      (1)   Purpose. The purpose of this division is to establish certain
requirements for beekeeping within the city and to avoid issues that might
otherwise be associated with beekeeping in populated areas. Compliance with
this division shall not be a defense to a proceeding alleging that a given
colony constitutes a nuisance, but such compliance may be offered as evidence
of the beekeeper's efforts to abate any proven nuisance. Compliance with this
division shall not be a defense to a proceeding alleging that a given colony
violates applicable ordinances regarding public health, but such compliance may
be offered as evidence of the beekeeper’s compliance with acceptable standards
of practice among hobby beekeepers in the state.
      (2)   City Council approval required. No person may keep, harbor,
maintain or allow to be kept any hive or other facility for the housing of
honeybees on or in any parcel in the city without approval of the City Council.
If the applicant is a tenant, they must also provide proof of approval by the
property owner permitting the keeping of bees on the property.
      (3)   Training and education required. Beekeeping training and education
is required for beekeeper applicants prior to the approval of the City Council.
At the time of request, the beekeeper must submit a certificate of completion
of an approved honeybee-keeping course.
      (4)   Any person desiring keeping of honeybees shall make written
application to the City Manager or designee, accompanied by a site plan of the
real property upon which bees are to be kept, showing:
         (a)   A site plan of the parcel, showing the location and size of the
proposed apiary, setbacks from the apiary to property lines and surrounding
buildings, including houses and buildings on adjacent lots;
         (b)   Inclusion of and location of safety fencing, flyaway barriers
and water supply;
         (c)   Proof of the applicant having completed coursework on beekeeping
acceptable to the City Manager;
         (d)   Agreement that property may be inspected by the city at all
reasonable times;
         (e)   The property must be in compliance with all other applicable
city regulations in order to receive approval.
         (f)   If the applicant fails to maintain the required conditions set
forth herein after issuance of a beekeeping approval, the City Manager or their
designee may revoke the approval.
         (g)   The application materials shall include a statement that the
applicant will at all times keep the bees in accordance with the provisions of
this division and any additional restrictions, limitation conditions or
prohibitions specified in the permit as necessary to safeguard public health
and general welfare.
      (5)   Residence required. The beekeeper approved to maintain the apiary
must reside upon the parcel in which the apiary is located.
      (6)   Term. Permission for beekeeping will be valid as long as the
applicant continues to comply with the terms of this division. Any finding of
noncompliance, or lapse of continued use for more than 12 months, shall require
a new request prior to reestablishment of any beekeeping on the subject parcel.
      (7)   Limitations for allergies. The property must be in compliance with
all other applicable city regulations in order to receive approval and renewal.
To ensure that concerns over bee allergies are addressed, the city shall notify
property owners of any parcel adjoining or across any public right-of-way from
the applicant’s subject parcel of the date on which the City Council will
consider a beekeeping application. Responses from notified residents prior to
the Council meeting that a resident has a medically documented bee-sting
allergy will disqualify the application. The city shall keep a record of
beekeeping approval locations available for public review. Changes in occupancy
of neighboring properties that result in new residents with allergies shall not
disqualify an existing beekeeping approval, provided it continues to otherwise
remain in compliance with other requirements of this division.
      (8)   Approval non-transferable. Beekeeping approvals are non-
transferable and do not run with the land.
      (9)   Location.
         (a)   Approved beekeeping shall be allowed only on property zoned R-l,
Single-Family Residential.
         (b)   Hives must be located in the rear yard and must be located a
minimum of 15 feet from all property lines and 30 feet from any neighboring
building.
         (c)   When a proposed hive location is on a parcel abutting any parcel
zoned other than R-l, Single-Family Residential, the hive shall be placed on
the site in a location that maximizes the distance from the adjoining non-R-
1 property.
      (10)   Conditions for beekeeping consideration.
         (a)   No more than two colonies may be kept on the subject parcel at
the same time.
         (b)   For each colony permitted to be maintained in this division,
there may also be maintained upon the same apiary parcel, one nucleus colony in
a hive structure, not to exceed one standard, nine-and-five-eighths-inch-depth
box, a ten-frame hive body with a maximum of five supers.
         (c)   Honeybee colonies must be kept in hives with removable frames
that must be kept in sound and usable condition.
         (d)   Each colony on the apiary site must be provided with a
convenient source of water that must be located within ten feet of each active
colony.
         (e)   Materials from a hive, such as wax combs or other materials that
might encourage robbing by other bees, must be promptly disposed of in a sealed
container or placed within a building or other bee- and vermin-proof enclosure.
         (f)   Each beekeeper shall maintain their beekeeping equipment in good
condition, including keeping the hives painted if they have been painted but
are peeling or flaking, and securing unused equipment from weather, potential
theft or vandalism and occupancy by swarms. It shall not be a defense to this
division that a beekeeper’s unused equipment attracted a swarm and that the
beekeeper is not intentionally keeping bees.
         (g)   Hives will be continuously managed to provide adequate living
space for their respective honeybees in order to prevent swarming.
         (h)   In any instance in which a colony exhibits unusual aggressive
behavior, it is the duty of the beekeeper to promptly re-queen the colony.
         (i)   Flyway barrier.
            1.   Except as otherwise provided in this division, in each
instance where a colony is kept less than 25 feet from a property line of the
lot upon which the apiary is located, as measured from the nearest point on the
hive to the property line, the beekeeper shall establish and maintain a flyway
barrier at least six feet in height.
            2.   The flyway barrier may consist of a wall, fence, dense
vegetation or a combination thereof, such that bees will fly over rather than
through the material to reach the colony.
            3.   If a flyway barrier of dense vegetation is used, the initial
planting may be four feet in height, so long as the vegetation normally reaches
six feet in height or higher.
            4.   If a wall or fence flyway barrier is used, the materials must
be decay-resistant and maintained in good condition. A wall or fence flyway
barrier shall not exceed the maximum allowable fence height per § 150.087 of
the City Code.
            5.   The flyway barrier must continue parallel to the apiary lot
line for ten feet in either direction from the hive, or contain the hive or
hives in an enclosure at least six feet in height.
            6.   A flyway barrier is not required if the parcel adjoining the
apiary lot line is:
               a.   Undeveloped;
               b.   Zoned agricultural or industrial;
               c.   Outside of the city limits; or
               d.   A wildlife management area or naturalistic park land, with
no horse or foot trails located within 25 feet of the apiary.
If the adjoining property becomes developed, a flyway barrier must be erected
according to the specifications of this division. No allowance for a legal
nonconformity shall accrue under this division.
         (j)   Hives shall be continuously managed to provide adequate living
space for their resident honeybees in order to prevent swarming.
         (k)   Where a flyway barrier is required, the hive openings shall face
the flyway barrier.
      (11)   Inspections.
         (a)   As part of the approval, each beekeeper must allow an inspection
of the apiary site. The City Manager or their designee has the right to inspect
any apiary for the purpose of ensuring compliance with this division, upon
providing prior notice to the owner of the apiary parcel. In the case of a
complaint regarding the apiary, the apiary site may be inspected by the city
without prior notice.
         (b)   If an approved apiary site is found to be noncompliant with any
requirements of this division, a compliance order shall be issued by the City
Manager or their designee. The owner and/or operator of the apiary shall have
up to ten days to bring the apiary into compliance or risk the loss of their
approval.
         (c)   If the City Manager orders the revocation of an existing
beekeeping approval, a hearing before the City Council shall be scheduled as
follows:
            1.   Scheduling of hearing. If the city makes a determination that
it will be revoking an approval pursuant to this subchapter, the City Council
shall conduct a hearing on the matter. The hearing shall be scheduled at the
next regular City Council meeting following the date of the notice of intent to
revoke.
            2.   Hearing. At the hearing, the City Council shall hear all
relevant evidence and arguments, and shall review all testimony, documents and
other evidence submitted. The applicant shall have the opportunity to address
the City Council at the hearing.
            3.   Findings. After the hearing is concluded, the City Council
shall make findings on whether to uphold the order to revoke. The City Council
shall issue a written decision within 30 days following the date of the
hearing, and shall send a copy of its decision to the owner or operator by
mail.
      (12)   Removal or relocation.
         (a)   If any approved beekeeper serves the community by removing a
swarm or swarms of honeybees from locations where they are not desired, that
person will not be considered to be in violation of the colony density
restrictions of this division, if the following conditions are met:
            1.   The person temporarily houses the honeybees at an apiary site
of a beekeeper approved by the city;
            2.   The honeybees are not kept for more than 30 days; and
            3.   The site remains in compliance with the other provisions of
this division.
         (b)   Any resident who has lost their approval shall not be eligible
for a new approval.
         (c)   Any resident who voluntarily forfeits the approved colony may
reapply for a new approval in the future.
         (d)   Any resident who wishes to transport the approved colony must
first establish a new permission in whichever jurisdiction they plan to
relocate to if required in that jurisdiction.

Council under §
10.20 if the city has at the time no Police Department, may enforce the
provisions relating to nuisances. Any peace officer or designated person shall
have the power to inspect private premises and take all reasonable precautions
to prevent the commission and maintenance of public nuisances. Except in
emergency situations of imminent danger to human life and safety, no police
officer or designated person shall enter private property for the purpose of
inspecting or preventing public nuisances without the permission of the owner,
resident, or other person in control of the property, unless the officer or
person designated has obtained a warrant or order from a court of competent
jurisdiction authorizing the entry, as provided in §
10.20.
(Prior Code, § 92.22)
§ 92.09 ABATEMENT.
   (A)   Notice. Written notice of violation; notice of the time, date, place,
and subject of any hearing before the City Council; notice of City Council
order; and notice of motion for summary enforcement hearing shall be given as
set forth in this section.
      (1)   Notice of violation. Written notice of violation shall be served by
a peace officer or designated person on the owner of record or occupant of the
premises either in person or by certified or registered mail. If the premises
is not occupied, the owner of record is unknown, or the owner of record or
occupant refuses to accept notice of violation, notice of violation shall be
served by posting it on the premises.
      (2)   Notice of City Council hearing. Written notice of any City Council
hearing to determine or abate a nuisance shall be served on the owner of record
and occupant of the premises either in person or by certified or registered
mail. If the premises is not occupied, the owner of record is unknown, or the
owner of record or occupant refuses to accept notice of the City Council
hearing, notice of City Council hearing shall be served by posting it on the
premises.
      (3)   Notice of City Council order. Except for those cases determined by
the city to require summary enforcement, written notice of any City Council
order shall be made as provided in M.S. § 463.17, as it may be amended from
time to time.
      (4)   Notice of motion for summary enforcement. Written notice of any
motion for summary enforcement shall be made as provided for in M.S. § 463.17,
as it may be amended from time to time.
   (B)   Procedure. Whenever a peace officer or designated person determines
that a public nuisance is being maintained or exists on the premises in the
city, the officer or person designated shall notify in writing the owner of
record or occupant of the premises of such fact and order that the nuisance be
terminated or abated. The notice of violation shall specify the steps to be
taken to abate the nuisance and the time within which the nuisance is to be
abated. If the notice of violation is not complied with within the time
specified, the officer or designated person shall report that fact forthwith to
the City Council. Thereafter, the City Council may, after notice to the owner
or occupant and an opportunity to be heard, determine that the condition
identified in the notice of violation is a nuisance and further order that if
the nuisance is not abated within the time prescribed by the City Council, the
city may seek injunctive relief by serving a copy of the City Council order and
notice of motion for summary enforcement or obtain an administrative search and
seizure warrant and abate the nuisance.
   (C)   Emergency procedure; summary enforcement. In cases of emergency, where
delay in abatement required to complete the notice and procedure requirements
set forth in divisions (A) and (B) above will permit a continuing nuisance to
unreasonably endanger public health, safety, or welfare, the City Council may
order summary enforcement and abate the nuisance. To proceed with summary
enforcement, the officer or designated person shall determine that a public
nuisance exists or is being maintained on premises in the city and that delay
in abatement of the nuisance will unreasonably endanger public health, safety,
or welfare. The officer or designated person shall notify in writing the
occupant or owner of the premises of the nature of the nuisance and of the
city’s intention to seek summary enforcement and the time and place of the City
Council meeting to consider the question of summary enforcement. The City
Council shall determine whether or not the condition identified in the notice
to the owner or occupant is a nuisance, whether public health, safety, or
welfare will be unreasonably endangered by delay in abatement required to
complete the procedure set forth in division (A) above, and may order that the
nuisance be immediately terminated or abated. If the nuisance is not
immediately terminated or abated, the City Council may order summary
enforcement and abate the nuisance.
   (D)   Immediate abatement. Nothing in this section shall prevent the city,
without notice or other process, from immediately abating any condition which
poses an imminent and serious hazard to human life or safety.
(Prior Code, § 92.23)
§ 92.10 RECOVERY OF COST.
   (A)   Personal liability. The owner of premises on which a nuisance has been
abated by the city shall be personally liable for the cost to the city of the
abatement, including administrative costs. As soon as the work has been
completed and the cost determined, the City Manager or other official shall
prepare a bill for the cost and mail it to the owner. Thereupon, the amount
shall be immediately due and payable at the office of the City Manager.
   (B)   Assessment. After notice and hearing as provided in M.S. § 429.061, as
it may be amended from time to time, if the nuisance is a public health or
safety hazard on private property, the accumulation of snow and ice on public
sidewalks, the growth of weeds on private property or outside the traveled
portion of streets, or unsound or insect-infected trees, the City Manager or
designee shall, on or before September 1 next following abatement of the
nuisance, list the total unpaid charges along with all other charges as well as
other charges for current services to be assessed under M.S. § 429.101, as it
may be amended from time to time, against each separate lot or parcel to which
the charges are attributable. The City Council may then spread the charges
against the property under that statute and other pertinent statutes for
certification to the County Auditor and collection along with current taxes the
following year or in annual installments, not exceeding ten, as the City
Council may determine in each case.
(Prior Code, § 92.24) Penalty, see §

      (2)   Inspections; notice. The City Council, or its designee, shall make
inspections as are necessary to determine that public sidewalks and alleys

registered or certified mail or by personal service, upon the record owner of
the property, ordering the owner to have the sidewalk or alley repaired and
made safe within 30 days and stating that if the owner fails to do so, the city
will do so and that the expense thereof must be paid by the owner, and if

      (3)   Repair by city. If the sidewalk or alley is not repaired within 30
days after receipt of the notice, the City Manager or designee shall report the

equipment, or object or contrivance; or as a result of operating, driving, or
moving any vehicle, equipment, object, or contrivance weighing in excess of the
maximum weight permitted by statute or this code. When the driver is not the
owner of the vehicle, equipment, object, or contrivance, but is operating,
driving, or moving it with the express or implied permission of the owner, then
the owner and the driver shall be jointly and severally liable for any such
damage. Any person who willfully acts or fails to exercise due care and by that
act damages any public property shall be liable for the amount thereof, which
amount shall be collectable by action or as a lien under M.S. § 514.67, as it
may be amended from time to time.
   (H)   Assessment. On or before October 31 of each year, the City Clerk shall

§ 94.01 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   To provide for the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens, and to
ensure the integrity of its streets and the appropriate use of the rights-of-
way, the city strives to keep its rights-of-way in a state of good repair and
free from unnecessary encumbrances.
   (B)   Accordingly, the city hereby enacts this new chapter of this code
relating to right-of-way permits and administration. This chapter imposes
reasonable regulation on the placement and maintenance of facilities and
equipment currently within its rights-of-way or to be placed therein at some
future time. It is intended to complement the regulatory roles of state and
federal agencies. Under this chapter, persons excavating and obstructing the
rights-of-way will bear financial responsibility for their work. Finally, this
chapter provides for recovery of out-of-pocket and projected costs from persons
using the public rights-of-way.
   (C)   This chapter shall be interpreted consistently with 1997 Session Laws,
Chapter 123, substantially codified in M.S. §§ 237.16, 237.162, 237.163,
237.79, 237.81, and 238.086 (the “Act”) and 2017 Session Laws, Chapter 94
amending the Act and the other laws governing applicable rights of the city and
users of the right-of-way, as they may be amended from time to time. This
chapter shall also be interpreted consistent with Minn. Rules parts 7819.0050,
7819.9950, and Minn. Rules Chapter 7560 where possible. To the extent any
provision of this chapter cannot be interpreted consistently with the Minnesota
Rules, that interpretation most consistent with the Act and other applicable
statutory and case law is intended. This chapter shall not be interpreted to

      (2)   Submission of completed permit application form, including all
required attachments, and scaled drawings showing the location and area of the
proposed project and the location of all existing and proposed equipment; and
      (3)   Payment of all money due to the city for:
         (a)   Permit fees, estimated restoration costs, and other management
costs;
         (b)   Prior obstructions or excavations;
         (c)   Any loss, damage, or expense suffered by the city as a result of
the applicant’s prior excavations or obstructions of the rights-of-way or any
emergency action taken by the city;

         (e)   Payment of disputed amounts due the city by posting or
depositing in an escrow account an amount equal to at least 110% of the amount
owing.
   (C)   When an excavation permit is requested for purposes of installing
additional equipment, and a performance and restoration bond which is in
existence is insufficient with respect to the additional equipment in the sole
determination of the city, the permit applicant may be required by the city to
post an additional performance and restoration bond in accordance with §
94.06.
(Prior Code, § 96.12)
§ 94.13 ISSUANCE OF PERMIT; CONDITIONS.
   (A)   If the city determines that the applicant has satisfied the
requirements of this chapter, the city may issue a permit.
   (B)   The city may impose any reasonable conditions upon the insurance of a
permit and the performance of the applicant thereunder in order to protect the
public health, safety, and welfare, to ensure the structural integrity of the
right-of-way, to protect the property and safety of other users of the right-
of-way, to minimize the disruption and inconvenience to the traveling public,
and to otherwise efficiently manage use of the right-of-way.
(Prior Code, § 96.13) (Ord. 2019-05, passed 4-9-2019)
§ 94.14 PERMIT FEES.
   (A)   Excavation permit fee. The excavation permit fee shall be imposed by
the city in an amount sufficient to recover the following costs:
      (1)   The city cost;
      (2)   The degradation of the right-of-way that will result from the
excavation; and
      (3)   Restoration, if done or caused to be done by the city.
   (B)   Disruption fees. The city may establish and impose a disruption fee as
a penalty for unreasonable delays in excavations, obstructions, or restoration.
   (C)   Obstruction permit fee. The city shall impose an obstruction permit
fee in an amount sufficient to recover management costs.
   (D)   Payment of permit fees. No excavation permit or obstruction permit
shall be issued without payment of all fees required prior to the issuance of
the permit unless the applicant shall agree (in manner, amount, and substance
acceptable to the city) to pay the fees within 30 days of billing therefor. All
permit fees shall be doubled during a probationary period. Permit fees that
were paid for a permit which was revoked for a breach are not refundable. Any
refunded permit fees shall be less all city cost up to and including the date
of refund.
   (E)   Use of permit fees. All obstruction and excavation permit fees shall
be used solely for city management, construction, maintenance, and restoration
costs of the right-of-way.
   (F)   Application to franchises. Unless otherwise agreed to in a franchise,
management costs may be charged separately from and in addition to the
franchise fees imposed on a right-of-way user in the franchise.
(Prior Code, § 96.14)
§ 94.15 RIGHT-OF-WAY RESTORATION.
   (A)   Timing. The work to be done under the excavation permit, and the
repair and restoration of the right-of-way as required herein, must be
completed within the dates specified in the permit, increased by as many days
as work could not be done because of extraordinary circumstances beyond the
control of the permit holder or when work was prohibited as unseasonable or
unreasonable under §
94.18. In addition to repairing its own work, the permit holder must restore
the general work area of the work, and the surrounding areas, including the
paving and its foundations, to the same condition that existed before the
commencement of the work and must inspect the area of work and use reasonable
care to maintain the same condition for 36 months thereafter.
   (B)   Repair and restoration. The permit holder shall repair its own work.
In addition, in its application for an excavation permit, the permit holder may
choose either to have the city restore the right-of-way or to restore the
right-of-way itself.
      (1)   City restoration. If the permit holder chooses to have the city
restore the right-of-way, the permit holder shall pay the costs thereof within
30 days of billing. If, during the 36 months following the restoration, the
pavement settles due to the permit holder’s improper backfilling, the permit
holder shall pay to the city, within 30 days of billing, the cost for the
resultant degradation as well as for any and all additional city costs
associated therewith.
      (2)   Permit holder restoration. If the permit holder chooses at the time
of application for an excavation permit to restore the right-of-way itself, the
permit holder shall post an additional performance and restoration bond in an
amount determined by the city to be sufficient to cover the cost of restoring
the right-of-way to its pre-excavation condition. If, 36 months after
completion of the restoration of the right-of-way, the city determines that the
right-of-way has been properly restored, the surety on the performance and
restoration bond posted pursuant to this division (B)(2) shall be released.
   (C)   Standards. The permit holder shall perform the work according to the
standards and with the materials specified by the city. The city shall have the
authority to prescribe the manner and extent of the restoration, and may do so
in written procedures of general application or on a case-by-case basis. The
city, in exercising this authority, shall be guided but not limited by the
following standards and considerations:
      (1)   The number, size, depth, and duration of the excavations,
disruptions, or damage to the right-of-way;
      (2)   The traffic volume catted by the right-of-way; the character of the
neighborhood surrounding the right-of-way;
      (3)   The pre-excavation condition of the right-of-way; remaining life
expectancy of the right-of-way affected by the excavation;
      (4)   Whether the relative cost of the method of restoration to the
permit holder is in reasonable balance with the prevention of an accelerated
depreciation of the right-of-way that would otherwise result from the
excavation, disturbance, or damage to the right-of-way; and
      (5)   The likelihood that the particular method of restoration would be
effective in slowing the deprecation of the right-of-way that would otherwise
take place.
   (D)   Guarantees. By choosing to restore the right-of-way itself, the permit
holder guarantees its work and shall maintain it for 36 months following the
completion. During this 36-month period, it shall, upon notification from the
city, correct all restoration work to the extent necessary, using the method
required by the city. The work shall be completed within five calendar days of
the receipt of the notice from the city, not including days during which work
cannot be done because of extraordinary circumstances or days when work is
prohibited as unseasonable or unreasonable under §
94.18.
   (E)   Failure to restore. If the permit holder fails to restore the right-
of-way in the manner and to the condition required by the city, or fails to
satisfactorily and timely complete all repairs required by the city, the city
at its option may perform or cause to be performed the work. In that event, the
permit holder shall pay to the city, within 30 days of billing, the cost of
restoring the right-of-way. If the permit holder fails to pay as required, the
city may exercise its rights under the performance and restoration bond.
   (F)   Degradation fee in lieu of restoration. In lieu of right-of-way
restoration, a permit holder shall pay to the city a degradation fee to cover
city costs associated with a decrease in the useful life of a public right-of-
way caused by excavation and repairs. Payment of a degradation fee does not
relieve the permit holder of the obligation to make necessary right-of-way
repairs.
(Prior Code, § 96.15)
§ 94.16 JOINT APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   Joint application. Registrants may jointly make application for
permits to excavate or obstruct the right-of-way at the same place and time.
   (B)   With city projects. Registrants who join in and during a scheduled
obstruction or excavation performed by the city, whether or not it is a joint
application by two or more registrants or a single application, are not
required to pay the obstruction and degradation portions of the permit fee.
   (C)   Shared fees. Registrants who apply for permits for the same
obstruction or excavation, which is not performed by the city, may share in the
payment of the obstruction of excavation permit fee. Registrants must agree
among themselves as to the portion each will pay and indicate the same on their
applications.
(Prior Code, § 96.16)
§ 94.17 SUPPLEMENTAL APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   Limitation on area. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the area
of the right-of-way specified in the permit. No permit holder may perform any
work outside the area specified in the permit, except as provided herein. Any
permit holder which determines that an area greater than that specified in the
permit must be obstructed or excavated must before working in that greater area
make application for a permit extension and pay any additional fees
necessitated thereby, and be granted a new permit or permit extension.
   (B)   Limitations on dates. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the
dates specified in the permit. No permit holder may begin its work before the
permit start date or, except as provided therein, continue working after the
end date. If the permit holder does not finish the work by the permit end date,
it must make application for a new permit for additional time it needs, and
receive the new permit or an extension of the old permit before working after
the end date of the previous permit. This supplementary application must be
done before the permit end date.
(Prior Code, § 96.17)
§ 94.18 OTHER OBLIGATIONS.
   (A)   Compliance with other laws. Obtaining a right-of-way permit does not
relieve the permit holder of its duty to obtain all other necessary permits,
licenses, franchises, or other authorizations and to pay all fees required by
the city, any other city, county, state, or federal rules, laws, or
regulations. A permit holder shall comply with all requirements of local,
state, and federal laws, including M.S. §§ 216D.01 through 216D.09, as they may
be amended from time to time. A permit holder shall perform all work in
conformance with all applicable codes and established rules and regulations,
and is responsible for all work done in the right-of-way pursuant to its
permit, regardless of who performed the work.
   (B)   Prohibited work. Except in the case of an emergency, and with the
approval of the city, no right-of-way obstruction or excavation may be
performed when seasonally prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable for
the work.
   (C)   Interference with right-of-way. A permit holder shall not so obstruct
a right-of-way that the natural free and clear passage of water through the
gutters or other waterways shall be interfered with. Private vehicles may not
be parked adjacent to a permit area. The loading or unloading of trucks
adjacent to a permit area is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the
permit.
(Prior Code, § 96.18) Penalty, see §
94.99
§ 94.19 DENIAL OR REVOCATION OF PERMIT.
   (A)   Reasons for denial. The city may deny a permit for failure to meet the
requirements and conditions of this chapter or if the city determines that the
denial is necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare or when
necessary to protect the right-of-way and its current use.
   (B)   Procedural requirements. The denial or revocation of a permit must be
made in writing and must document the basis for the denial. The city must
notify the applicant or right-of-way user in writing within three business days
of the decision to deny or revoke a permit. If an application is denied, the
right-of-way user may address the reasons for denial identified by the city and
resubmit its application. If the application is resubmitted within 30 days of
receipt of the notice of denial, no additional application fee shall be
imposed. The city must approve or deny the resubmitted application within 30
days after submission. (See M.S. § 237.163, Subds. 4(c) and 4(f), as it may be
amended from time to time.)
   (C)   Mandatory denial. Except in the case of an emergency, no right-of-way
permit will be granted:
      (1)   To any person required by §
94.06 to be registered who has not done so;
      (2)   To any person required by §
94.10 to file an annual report but has failed to do so;
      (3)   For any next-year project not listed in the construction and major
maintenance plan required under §
94.08 unless the person used commercially reasonable efforts to anticipate and
plan for the project;
      (4)   For any project which requires the excavation of any portion of a
right-of-way which was constructed or reconstructed within the preceding five
years;
      (5)   To any person who has failed within the past three years to comply,
or is presently not in full compliance, with the requirements of the section;
      (6)   To any person as whom there exists grounds for the revocation of a
permit under §
94.24; and/or
      (7)   If, in the sole discretion of the city, the issuance of a permit
for the particular date and/or time would cause a conflict to interfere with an
exhibition, celebration, festival, or any other event. The city, in exercising
this discretion, shall be guided by the safety and convenience of ordinary
travel of the public over the right-of-way, and by considerations relating to
the public health, safety, and welfare.
   (D)   Permissive denial. The city may deny a permit in order to protect the
public health, safety, and welfare, to prevent interference with the safety and
convenience of ordinary travel over the right-of-way, or when necessary to
protect the right-of-way and its users. The city may consider one or more of
the following factors:
      (1)   The extent to which right-of-way space where the permit is sought
is available;
      (2)   The competing demands for the particular space in the right-of-way;
      (3)   The availability of other locations in the right-of-way or in other
rights-of-way equipment of the permit applicants;
      (4)   The applicability of ordinance or other regulations of the right-
of-way that affect location of equipment in the right-of-way;
      (5)   The degree of compliance of the applicant with the terms and
conditions of its franchise, if any, this chapter, and other applicable
ordinances and regulations;
      (6)   The degree of disruption to surrounding communities and businesses
that will result from the use of that part of the right-of-way;
      (7)   The condition and age of the right-of-way, and whether and when it
is scheduled for a total or partial reconstruction; and
      (8)   The balancing of the costs of disruption to the public and damage
to the right-of-way, against the benefits to that part of the public served by
the expansion into additional parts of the right-of-way.
   (E)   Discretionary issuance. Notwithstanding the provisions of divisions
(D)(3) and (D)(4) above, the city may issue a permit in any case where the
permit is necessary to prevent substantial economic hardship to a customer of
the permit applicant, or to allow the customer to materially improve its
utility service, or to allow a new economic development project; and where the
permit applicant did not have knowledge of the hardship, the plans for
improvement of service, or the development project when the applicant was
required to submit its lists of next-year projects.
   (F)   Permits for additional next-year projects. Notwithstanding the
provisions of division (D)(3) above, the city may issue a permit to a
registrant who was allowed under §
94.10 to submit an additional next-year project, or in the event the registrant
demonstrates that it is used commercially, reasonable efforts to anticipate and
plan for the project, the permit to be subject to all other conditions and
requirements of law, including the conditions as may be imposed under §
94.13.
(Prior Code, § 96.19)
§ 94.20 INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS.
   In accordance with M.S. §§ 237.162, Subd. 8(3) and 237.163, Subd. 8, as they
may be amended from time to time; and other provisions of law, and until the
Public Utilities Commission adopts uniform statewide standards, the excavation,
restoration, and all other work performed in the right-of-way shall be done in
conformance with the standard specifications for street openings as promulgated
by the city and at a location as may be required by §
94.27. The city may enforce local standards prior to adoption of mandatory,
preemptive statewide standards pursuant to its inherent and historical police
power authority.
(Prior Code, § 96.20)
§ 94.21 INSPECTION.
   (A)   Notice of completion of work. When the work under any permit hereunder
is completed, the permit holder shall notify the city.
   (B)   Site inspection. The permit holder shall make the work-site available
to the City Building Official or designee and to all others as authorized by
law for inspection at all reasonable times during the execution and upon
completion of the work.
   (C)   Authority of City Inspector. At the time of inspection the City
Building Official or designee may order the immediate cessation of any work
which poses a serious threat to life, health, safety, or well-being of the
public. The City Building Official or designee may issue an order to the
registrant for any work which does not conform to the applicable standards,
conditions, or codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the
violation will be cause for revocation of the permit. Within ten days after
issuance of the order, the registrant shall present proof to the city that the
violation has been corrected. If the proof has not been presented within the
required time, the city may revoke the permit pursuant to §
94.24.
(Prior Code, § 96.21)
§ 94.22 WORK DONE WITHOUT A PERMIT.
   (A)   Emergency situations.
      (1)   Each registrant shall immediately notify the city of the city’s
designee of any event regarding its equipment which it considers to be an
emergency. The registrant may proceed to take whatever actions are necessary in
order to respond to the emergency. Within two business days after the
occurrence of the emergency, the registrant shall apply for the necessary
permits, pay the fees associated therewith, and fulfill the rest of the
requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with this chapter for
the actions it took in response to the emergency.
      (2)   In the event that the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding
a registrant’s equipment, the city may attempt to contact the local
representative of each registrant affected, or potentially affected, by the
emergency. In any event, the city may take whatever action it deems necessary
in order to respond to the emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the
registrant whose equipment occasioned the emergency.
   (B)   Non-emergency situations. Except in the case of an emergency, any
person who, without first having obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or
evacuates a right-of-way, must subsequently obtain a permit, pay double the
normal fee for the permit, pay double all the other fees required by city
ordinance, necessary to correct any damage to the right-of-way and comply with
all the requirements of this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 96.22)
§ 94.23 SUPPLEMENTAL NOTIFICATION.
   If the obstruction or excavation of the right-of-way begins later or sooner
than the date given on the permit, the permit holder shall notify the city of
the accurate information as soon as this information is known.
(Prior Code, § 96.23)
§ 94.24 REVOCATION OF PERMITS.
   (A)   Substantial breach. Registrants hold permits issued pursuant to this
code as a privilege and not as a right. The city reserves the right, as
provided herein and in accordance with M.S. § 237.163, Subd. 4, as it may be
amended from time to time, to revoke any right-of-way permit, without fee
refund, in the event of a substantial breach of the term and conditioned of any
statute, ordinance, rule, or regulation, or any condition of the permit. A
substantial breach by permit holder shall include, but not be limited to, the
following:
      (1)   The violation of any material provision of the right-of-way permit;
      (2)   An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the right-
of-way permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit
upon the city or its citizens;
      (3)   Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a
right-of-way permit;
      (4)   The failure to maintain the required bonds and/or insurance;
      (5)   The failure to complete the work in a timely manner; or
      (6)   The failure to correct a condition indicated on an order issued
pursuant to §
94.21.
   (B)   Written notice of breach. If the city determines that the permit
holder has committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any
statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, or any condition of the permit, the city
shall make a written demand upon the permit holder to remedy the violation. The
demand shall state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the
permit. Further, a substantial breach, as stated above, will allow the city, at
the city’s discretion, to place additional or revised conditions on the permit.
   (C)   Response to notice of breach. Within 24 hours of receiving
notification of the breach, permit holder shall contact the city with a plan,
acceptable to the City Building Official or designee, for its correction. The
permit holder’s failure to so contact the City Building Official or designee,
the permit holder’s failure to submit an acceptable plan, or the permit
holder’s failure to reasonably implement the approved plan shall be cause for
immediate revocation of the permit. Further, permit holder’s failure to so
contact the City Building Official or designee, or the permit holder’s failure
to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall automatically place the permit
holder on probation for one full year.
   (D)   Cause for probation. From time to time, the city may establish a list
of conditions of the permit which, if breached, will automatically place the
permit holder on probation for one full year, such as, but not limited to,
working out of the allotted time period or working on right-of-way outside of
the permit.
   (E)   Automatic revocation. If a permit holder, while on probation, commits
a breach as outlined above, permit holder’s permit will automatically be
revoked, and permit holder will not be allowed further permits for one full
year, except for emergency repairs.
   (F)   Reimbursement of city costs. If a permit is revoked, the permit holder
shall also reimburse the city for the city’s reasonable costs, including
restoration costs and the costs of collection and reasonable attorney’s fees
incurred in connection with the revocation.
(Prior Code, § 96.24)
§ 94.25 APPEALS.
   (A)   Appeal process. If an applicant has been denied registration of a
right-of-way permit, its right-of-way permit has been revoked, or believes that
the fees imposed on the user by the city do not conform to the requirements of
law, the applicant may have the denial, revocation, or fee imposition reviewed,
upon written request, by the City Council. The City Council shall act on a
timely written request at its next regularly scheduled meeting. A decision by
the City Council affirming the denial, revocation, or fee imposition must be in
writing and supported by written findings establishing the reasonableness of
the decision.
   (B)   Appeal costs. Each party to the arbitrators shall pay its own costs,
disbursements, and attorney fees.
(Prior Code, § 96.25)
§ 94.26 MAPPING DATA.
   (A)   Information required. Except as provided in division (B) below, each
registrant shall provide to the city information indicating the horizontal and
vertical location, relative to the boundaries of the right-of-way, of all
equipment which it owns or over which it has control and which is located in
any right-of-way (“mapping data”). Mapping data shall be provided with the
specificity and in the format requested by the city for inclusion in the
mapping system used by the city. Notwithstanding the foregoing, mapping data
shall be submitted by all registrants for all equipment which is to be
installed or constructed after the date of passage of this chapter at the time
any permits are sought under this chapter.
   (B)   Supplemental information. Within six months of the acquisition,
installation, of construction of additional equipment or any relocation,
abandonment, or disuse of excavating equipment, each registrant shall
supplement the mapping data required herein.
   (C)   Comprehensive equipment plans.
      (1)   Each registrant shall, within six months after the date of passage
of this chapter, submit a plan to the city specifying in detail the steps it
will take economically with the requirements of this chapter. This plan shall
provide for the submission of all mapping data for commercial and industrial
zoning districts within two years after the date of passage of this chapter,
and for the remainder of the city as early as may be reasonable and practical,
but not later than five years after the date of passage of this chapter for the
remainder of the city as early as may be reasonable and practical, but not
later than five years after the date of passage of this chapter.
      (2)   After six months after the passage of this chapter, a new
registrant, or a registrant which has not submitted a plan as required above,
shall submit complete and accurate mapping data for all its equipment at the
time any permits are sought under this chapter.
   (D)   Telecommunications equipment. Information on existing facilities and
equipment of telecommunications right-of-way users need only be supplied in the
form maintained by the telecommunications right-of-way user.
   (E)   Trade secret information. At the request of any registrant, any
information requested by the city, which qualifies as a “trade secret” under
M.S. § 13.37, Subd. 1(b), as it may be amended from time to time, shall be
treated as trade secret information as detailed therein. With respect to the
provision of mapping data, the city may consider unique circumstances from time
to time required to obtain mapping data.
(Prior Code, § 96.26)
§ 94.27 LOCATION OF EQUIPMENT.
   (A)   Undergrounding. Unless otherwise permitted by an existing franchise or
M.S. § 216B.34, as it may be amended from time to time, or unless existing
above ground equipment is repaired or replaced, or unless infeasible such as in
the provision of electric service at certain voltages, new construction,
installation of new equipment, and the replacement of old equipment shall be
done underground or contained within buildings or other structures in
conformity with applicable codes unless otherwise agreed to by the city in
writing, and the agreement is reflected in applicable permits.
   (B)   Corridors. The city may assign specific corridors within the right-of-
way, or any particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of
equipment that is or, pursuant to current technology, the city expects will
someday be, located within the right-of-way. Excavation, obstruction, or other
permits issued by the city for good involving the installation or replacement
of equipment may designate the proper corridor for the equipment at issue, and
the equipment must be located accordingly.
   (C)   Moving of existing equipment to corridors. Any registrant whose
equipment is located, prior to enactment of this chapter, in the right-of-way
in a position at variance with corridors established by the city shall, no
later than at a time of the next reconstruction of excavation of the area where
its equipment is located, move that equipment to its assigned position within
the right-of-way, unless this requirement is waived by the city for good cause
shown, upon consideration of factors such as the remaining economic life of the
facilities, public safety, customer service needs, and headship to the
registrant.
   (D)   Nuisance. One year after the passage of this chapter, any equipment
found in a right-of-way that has not been registered shall be deemed to be a
nuisance. The city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in
equity, including, but not limited to, abating the nuisance or taking
possession of the equipment and restoring the right-of-way to a usable
condition.
   (E)   Limitation of space. To protect health, safety, and welfare, the city
shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new additional
equipment within the right-of-way if there is insufficient space to accommodate
all of the requests of registrant or persons to occupy and use the right-of-
way. In making the decisions, the city shall strive to the extent possible to
accommodate all existing and potential users of the right-of-way, but shall be
guided primarily by considerations of public interest, the public’s needs for
the particular service, the condition of the right-of-way, the time of year
with respect to essential utilities, the protection of existing equipment in
the right-of-way, and future city plans for public improvements and development
projects which have been determined to be the public interest.
(Prior Code, § 96.27)
§ 94.28 RELOCATION OF EQUIPMENT.
   (A)   A registrant must promptly and at its own expense, with due regard for
seasonal working conditions, permanently remove and relocate its equipment and
facilities in the right-of-way whenever the city requests the removal and
relocation, and shall restore the right-of-way to the same condition it was in
prior to the removal or relocation. The city may make the requests in order to
prevent inference by the company’s equipment or facilities with a present or
future city use of the right-of-way; a public improvement undertaken by the
city; an economic development project in which the city has an interest or
investment; when the public health, safety, and welfare requires it; or when
necessary to prevent interference with the safety and convenience or ordinary
travel over the right-of-way.
   (B)   Notwithstanding the forgoing, a person shall not be required to remove
of relocate its equipment from any right-of-way which has been vacated in favor
of nongovernmental entity to the person therefor.
(Prior Code, § 96.28)

§ 94.33 INDEMNIFICATION AND LIABILITY.
   (A)   Limitation of liability. By reason of the acceptance of a registration
or a grant of the right-of-way permit, the city does not assume any liability;

parties other than the registrant or the city; or for claims or penalties of
any sort resulting from the installation, presence, maintenance, or operation
of equipment by registrants or activities of registrants.
   (B)   Indemnification. By registering with the city, a registrant agrees, or
by accepting a permit under this chapter, a permit holder is required to
defend, indemnify, and hold the city whole and harmless from all costs,
liabilities, and claims for damages of any kind arising out of the
construction, presence, installation, maintenance, repair, or operation of its
equipment, or out of any activity undertaken in or near a right-of-way, whether
or not any act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed, or prohibited
by a right-of-way permit. It further agrees that it will not bring, nor cause
to be brought, any action, suit, or other proceeding claiming damages, or
seeking any other relief against the city for any claim nor for any award
arising out of the presence, installation, maintenance, or operation of its
equipment, or any activity undertaken in or near a right-of-way, whether or not
the act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed, or prohibited by
right-of-way permit. The foregoing does not indemnify the city for its own
negligence except for the claims arising out of or alleging the city’s
negligence where the negligence arises out of or is primarily related to the
presence, installation, construction, operation, maintenance, or repair of the

limited to, the insurance of permits and inspection of plans or work. This
section is not, as to third parties, a waiver of any defense or immunity

action every defense or immunity that the city could assert on its own behalf.
(Prior Code, § 96.32)

vested in the city under the Constitution and statutes of the state to regulate
the use of the right-of-way by permit holder; and the permit holder by its
acceptance of a right-of-way permit or of registration under those ordinances
agrees that all lawful powers and rights, regulatory power, or police power, or
otherwise as are or the same may be from time to time vested in or reserved to
the city, shall be in full force and effect and subject to the exercise thereof
by the city at any time. A permit holder or registrant is deemed to acknowledge
that its rights are subject to the regulatory and police powers of the city to
adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to the safety and welfare of the
public and is deemed to agree to comply with all applicable general laws and
ordinances enacted by the city pursuant to the powers. Any conflict between the

Section
   
110.01   City Council findings
   
110.02   Standards for sexually-oriented businesses
§ 110.01 CITY COUNCIL FINDINGS.
   (A)   The City Council has reviewed various reports regarding sexually-
oriented businesses and has considered studies done in other cities, ordinances
of other cities, court cases regarding sexually-oriented businesses, and other
materials pertaining to adult uses and sexually-oriented businesses. In
particular, the City Council has reviewed materials related to the adverse
secondary characteristics related to adult uses and sexually-oriented
businesses. The City Council has reviewed evidence taken from the City of
Minneapolis, where studies have shown a strong correlation between sexually-
explicit businesses and increased crime rates, and from the City of Saint Paul,
where studies have suggested such a correlation as well as a possible
correlation between sexually-oriented businesses and depressed property values.
The City Council has also relied upon evidence taken from reported court cases
involving other municipalities which are smaller suburban cities in the state
and in other states. The City Council believes that the experiences of the
cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul are relevant to the city because of their
close proximity, and that the smaller cities involved in cases from the state
and other states are similar in their position as relatively small suburbs to
major metropolitan areas.
   (B)   After careful consideration of these materials and other materials,
including the Report of the Attorney General’s Working Group on the Regulation
of Sexually-Oriented Businesses (State Attorney General’s Office, June 6,
1989), and in order to prevent the problems that cities around the nation have
encountered with the unregulated location of adult uses and sexually-oriented
businesses in their communities, the City Council has arrived at the following
findings and conclusions.
      (1)   The City Council finds that sexually-oriented businesses have
adverse secondary characteristics, particularly when they may be accessible to
minors or are located near residential properties or schools, churches,
temples, synagogues, day-care centers, libraries, recreational areas and parks,
and the businesses can exert a dehumanizing influence on persons attending or
using the properties.
      (2)   Sexually-oriented businesses can contribute to an increase in
criminal activity in the area in which the businesses are located.
      (3)   Sexually-oriented businesses can significantly contribute to the
deterioration of residential neighborhoods and can impair the character and
quality of the residential housing in the area in which the businesses are
located, thereby exacerbating the shortage of affordable and habitable housing
for city residents.
      (4)   The concentration of sexually-oriented businesses in one area can
have a substantially detrimental effect on the area in which the businesses are
concentrated and on the overall quality of urban life. A cycle of decay can
result from the influx and concentration of sexually-oriented businesses. The
presence of the businesses is perceived by others as an indication that the
area is deteriorating and the result can be very detrimental. In many cases,
other businesses move out of the vicinity and residents flee from the area.
Declining real estate values, which can result from the concentration of the
businesses, erode the city’s tax base and contribute to overall urban blight.
      (5)   The regulation of the location and operation of sexually-oriented
businesses is warranted to prevent the adverse secondary effects of the
businesses on the city’s crime rate, its retail trade, its property values, and
in general, the quality of the city’s neighborhoods, commercial, and industrial
districts, and urban life.
(Prior Code, § 110.01)
§ 110.02 STANDARDS FOR SEXUALLY-ORIENTED BUSINESSES.
   (A)   Generally. The following standards shall apply to all sexually-
oriented businesses in any district or location within the city.
   (B)   Specifically.
      (1)   No sexually-oriented business shall be located closer than 400 feet
from any other sexually-oriented business, or closer than 400 feet from any
daycare facility, church, temple, synagogue, school, library, or publicly-owned
park, playground, or other recreational facilities, or any facility selling
intoxicating liquor, as defined in M.S. § 340A.101, as it may be amended from
time to time. Measurements shall be made in a straight line, without regard to
intervening structures or objections, from the nearest point of the actual
premises of the sexually-oriented business or other facility.
      (2)   No sexually-oriented business shall be located closer than 400 feet
from any property in the R-1, R-1A, R-2, R-3, R-4, R/O, or PUD District, or any
residentially-zoned property in any city adjoining the city. Measurements shall

PAWNBROKERS
§ 113.35 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE STATEMENT.
   (A)   Findings. The City Council makes the following findings regarding the
need to regulate pawnbrokers operating within the city.
      (1)   Pawnbrokers provide an opportunity for the commission of crime and
the concealment of crime, because pawnshops have the ability to receive and
transfer stolen property easily and quickly.
      (2)   The pawn industry has outgrown the city’s current ability to
effectively and efficiently identify criminal activity related to pawnbrokers
and pawn businesses. The adoption of an Automated Pawn System (APS) will allow
law enforcement officials to timely collect and share pawn transaction
information more efficiently.
      (3)   Consumer protection regulation of pawn transactions is warranted in
light of the potential for abuse.
   (B)   Purpose statement. The City Council enacts this subchapter of the city
code in order to further the following objectives:
      (1)   The prevention of pawnshops from being used as facilities for the
commission of crime;
      (2)   The identification of criminal activities through timely collection
and sharing of pawn transaction information;
      (3)   The promulgation of consumer protection standards to be adhered to
by the pawn industry; and
      (4)   The protection of the public health, safety, and general welfare of
the citizens of the city.

charged to be used by the public as a game of skill, amusement, or play.
AMUSEMENT DEVICES include, but are not limited to, shuffle boards; pinball
machines; amusement machines patterned after baseball, basketball, hockey,
bowling, tennis or other games; electric rifle or gun ranges; road racing or
driving games; billiard, pool and table tennis tables; and coin-operated rides
designed for use by small children.
(Prior Code, § 111.025)
§ 114.002 LIMITED NUMBER OF LICENSES.
   No more than 75 licenses for amusement devices, as defined in §
114.001, shall exist in the city at any one given time. Not more than 15
licenses will be issued for any one establishment. If application is made for a
license which if issued would cause the number of amusement device licenses to
exceed the maximum, the City Council shall table action on the license and
shall consider it only when issuance of the license would not be in excess of
the maximum number specified in this section.
(Prior Code, § 111.026)
§ 114.003 ISSUED TO OPERATOR.
   A license for amusement devices shall be issued only to the person or
business entity which directly operates the business establishment in which the
amusement devices are used.
(Prior Code, § 111.027)
§ 114.004 RENEWALS.
   When existing amusement device licenses expire, they will be available for
renewal by the same licensee for a period of 30 days after expiration of the
license. Any renewal will be considered prior to any pending applications for
new licenses.
(Prior Code, § 111.028)
§ 114.005 PRIORITY FOR AVAILABLE LICENSES.
   If action has been tabled on one or more applications for amusement device
licenses and licenses subsequently became available, these applications will be
considered by the City Council according to the chronological priority of the
filing of the applications.
(Prior Code, § 111.029)
§ 114.006 EXPIRATION OF LICENSES FOR FAILURE TO OPERATE.
   If the licensee does not have the amusement devices for which the license
was issued available for use by the public within six months after the license
is issued, or if use of the amusement devices is discontinued for a period of
six months, the license shall expire and shall be available for issuance to
other licensees. No portion of the license fee will be refunded after it is
paid, even if the license is not in effect for its full term.
(Prior Code, § 111.030)
PHYSICAL CULTURE AND HEALTH SERVICES AND CLUBS
§ 114.020 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   MASSAGE. The rubbing, pressing, stroking, kneading, tapping, rolling,
pounding, vibrating, or stimulating the superficial parts of the human body
with the hands or any instrument by a person who is not duly licensed by the
state to practice medicine, surgery, osteopathy, chiropractic, physical
therapy, or podiatry.
   PHYSICAL CULTURE AND HEALTH SERVICES, PHYSICAL CULTURE AND HEALTH CLUB,

from time to time, inclusive, where nonmedical and non-surgical manipulative
exercises or massages are practiced upon the human body for a fee or other
valuable consideration by anyone not duly licensed by the state to practice
medicine, surgery, osteopathy, chiropractic, physical therapy or podiatry, with
or without the use of mechanical, therapeutic, or bathing devices.
(Prior Code, § 111.340)
§ 114.021 BUSINESS LICENSE REQUIRED.
   (A)   Limiting business licenses. It is found and determined that the type
of business activity subject to being licensed under this subchapter is
particularly subject to abuse which may take a number of forms contrary to the
morals, health, safety, and general welfare of the community. Further, it is
found that control of these abuses requires intensive efforts of the Police
Department as well as other departments of the city. These efforts exceed those
required to control and regulate other business activities licensed by the
city. This concentrated use of city services tends to detract from and reduce
the level of service available to the rest of the community and thereby
diminishes the ability of the city to promote the general health, welfare,
morals, and safety of the community. Therefore, the number of business licenses
which may be in force under this subchapter at any one time shall not exceed
seven.
   (B)   Requiring license and defining businesses operating within city. No
person, partnership, corporation, or other organization shall operate a
physical culture and health service or club, reducing club or salon, or
therapeutic massage studio within the city, either exclusively or in connection
with any other operation or enterprise, unless the business is currently
licensed under this subchapter.
   (C)   Certain businesses exempt.
      (1)   The preceding provisions of this subchapter notwithstanding, no
business license shall be required for a business establishment which offers
massage as an accessory use if it meets all of the following criteria as
evidenced by affidavits and other documents submitted to and in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the City Manager or designee.
         (a)   The principal activity of the business shall not be performing
massage for a fee or other consideration.
         (b)   The annual gross revenue of the business from performing massage
is less than 25% of the total annual gross revenue of the business as shown by
financial statements or an affidavit signed by the authorized officer of the
business. In lieu of delivery of the aforementioned affidavit, at the direction
of the city, the business shall be required to deliver, a certification from a
certified public accountant, acceptable to the City Manager or designee, that
the annual gross revenue from massage services, for the preceding 12 months, is
less than 25% of its total annual gross revenue for the period of time.
         (c)   The room or rooms where massage is performed shall not have an
exclusive entrance from or exit to the exterior of the building in which the
principal business is located or to a public concourse or public lobby.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, massage may be performed by an individual at the
residence of the person receiving the massage.
         (d)   All fees or other consideration derived from performing massage
shall be received by and accounted for by the proprietor of the principal
business.
         (e)   All individuals performing massage in connection with the
business shall be employees of the principal business or shall be independent
contractors or agents who perform massage pursuant to a written agreement with
the owner of the principal business and each individual performing massage in
connection with the business shall meet the educational requirements of §
114.032(E).
      (2)   Any business that requests an exemption from the business license
requirement shall submit the required affidavits and documents on an annual
basis. The exemption request shall be due on or before March 15 of each year.
(Prior Code, § 111.341) Penalty, see §
114.999

FIREWORKS DEALERS
§ 114.065 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (A)   The purpose of this subchapter is to regulate the sale of consumer
fireworks in order to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the general
public.
   (B)   The City Council makes the following findings regarding the need to
license and regulate the sale, display, distribution, and storage of consumer
fireworks:
      (1)   The unregulated sale, display, distribution, and storage of
consumer fireworks presents a fire safety hazard because these items contain
pyrotechnic chemical compositions that are combustible;
      (2)   To ensure compliance with the limitations as to chemical content
provided in M.S. § 624.20, Subd. 1(c), as it may be amended from time to time,
regular inspection, sampling, and testing of consumer fireworks held for sale,
display, distribution, and storage is necessary;
      (3)   To prevent the illegal sale of consumer fireworks to minors,
regular police inspections are necessary;
      (4)   Regular inspections by the City Fire Department are necessary to
prevent improper display, storage, and disposal of consumer fireworks;
      (5)   The improper disposal of consumer fireworks presents environmental
hazards; and
      (6)   Accurate information concerning the addresses and locations of
persons holding consumer fireworks for sale, display, distribution, and storage
in the city is necessary to facilitate the inspection of the premises for
compliance with necessary safety regulations and performance standards and to
assist the city in responding to any emergency situation arising at or adjacent
to the premises.
(Prior Code, § 111.370)

111.01 through
111.14.
(Prior Code, § 112.13)
§ 116.14 VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   Compliance checks and inspections. All licensed premises shall be open
to inspection by the Police Department or other authorized city official during
regular business hours. At least once per year, the city shall conduct
compliance checks by engaging persons over the age of 18 and less than 21
years, to enter the licensed premises to attempt to purchase intoxicating or
3.2% malt liquor. Persons used for the purpose of compliance checks shall be
supervised by city designated law enforcement officers or other designated city
personnel. Persons used for compliance checks shall not be guilty of unlawful
possession of intoxicating or 3.2% malt liquor when the items are obtained as a
part of the compliance check. No person used in compliance checks shall attempt
to use a false identification misrepresenting the person’s age, and all minors
lawfully engaged in a compliance check shall answer all questions about the
person’s age asked by the licensee or the licensee’s employee and shall produce
any identification, if any exists, for which the person is asked. Nothing in
this subchapter shall prohibit compliance checks authorized by state or federal
laws for educational, research, or training purposes, or required for the
enforcement of a particular state or federal law.
   (B)   Hearing notice for revocation or suspension of license. Revocation or
suspension of a license by the City Council shall be preceded by public hearing
conducted in accordance with M.S. §§ 14.57 through 14.69, as they may be
amended from time to time. The City Council may appoint a hearing examiner or
may conduct a hearing itself. The hearing notice shall be given at least ten
days prior to the hearing, include notice of the time and place of the hearing,
and state the nature of the charges against the licensee.
   (C)   Grounds for revocation or suspension of license. The City Council may
suspend or revoke any license for the sale of intoxicating liquor or 3.2% malt
liquor for any of the following reasons:
      (1)   False or misleading statements made on a license application or
renewal, or failure to abide by the commitments, promises, or representations
made to the City Council;
      (2)   Violation of any special conditions under which the license was
granted, including, but not limited to, the timely payment of real estate
taxes, and all other charges;
      (3)   Violation of any federal, state, or local law regulating the sale
of intoxicating liquor, 3.2% malt liquor, or controlled substance;
      (4)   Creation of a nuisance on the premises or in the surrounding area;
      (5)   That the licensee suffered or permitted illegal acts upon the
licensed premises or on property owned or controlled by the licensee adjacent
to the licensed premises, unrelated to the sale of intoxicating liquor or 3.2%
malt liquor;
      (6)   That the licensee had knowledge of illegal acts upon or
attributable to the licensed premises, but failed to report the same to the
police;
      (7)   Expiration or cancellation of any required insurance, or failure to
notify the city within a reasonable time of changes in the term of the
insurance or the carriers; and/or
      (8)   Failure of an establishment granted a license to exhibit
satisfactory progress toward completion of construction within six months from
its issuance, or failure of an establishment to operate for a period of six
months. A hearing shall be held to determine what progress has been made toward
opening or reopening the establishment and, if satisfactory progress is not
demonstrated, the City Council may revoke the license.
   (D)   Presumptive civil penalties. The purpose of this section is to
establish a standard by which the City Council determines the length of license
suspensions and the propriety of revocations, and shall apply to all premises
licensed under this chapter. These penalties are presumed to be appropriate for
every case; however, the City Council may deviate in an individual case where
the City Council finds that there exist substantial reasons making it more
appropriate to deviate, such as, but not limited to, a licensee’s efforts in
combination with the state or city to prevent the sale of alcohol to minors.
When deviating from these standards, the City Council will provide written
findings that support the penalty selected.
      (1)   The minimum penalties for convictions or violations must be
presumed as follows (unless specified, numbers below indicate consecutive days’
suspensions):
Type of Violation Appearance
                  First Second Third Fourth
Type of Violation                     Appearance
                                      First      Second   Third      Fourth
After hours display or consumption of $500       Six days 18 days    Revocation
liquor
After hours sale of liquor            $500       Six days 18 days    Revocation
Commission of a felony related to the Revocation N/A      N/A        N/A
licensed activity
Failure to take reasonable steps to
stop person from leaving premises     $500       Six days 18 days    Revocation

sale 3.2% malt liquor license)

Refusal to allow city inspectors or   $500       15 days  Revocation

suspension
 
      (2)   The City Council may impose a three-day suspension for failure to
pay the required fine on the first appearance.
   (E)   Multiple violations. At a licensee’s first appearance before the City
Council, the court must act upon all of the violations that have been alleged
in the notice sent to the licensee. The City Council in that case must consider
the presumptive penalty for each violation under the first appearance column in
division (D) above. The occurrence of multiple violations is grounds for
deviation from the presumed penalties in the City Council’s discretion.
   (F)   Subsequent violations. Violations occurring after the notice of
hearing has been mailed, but prior to the hearing, must be treated as a
separate violation and dealt with as a second appearance before the City
Council, unless the City Manager or designee and licensee agree in writing to
add the violation to the first appearance. The same procedure applies to a
second, third, or fourth appearance before the City Council.
   (G)   Subsequent appearances. Upon a second, third, or fourth appearance
before the City Council by the same licensee, the City Council must impose the
presumptive penalty for the violation or violations giving rise to the
subsequent appearance without regard to the particular violation or violations
that were the subject of the first or prior appearance. However, the City
Council may consider the amount of time elapsed between appearances as a basis
for deviating from the presumptive penalty imposed by this subchapter.
   (H)   Computation of appearances. After the first appearance, a subsequent
appearance by the same licensee will be determined as follows.
      (1)   If the first appearance was within 18 months of the current
violation, the current violation will be treated as a second appearance.
      (2)   If a licensee has appeared before the City Council on two previous
occasions, and the current violation occurred within 30 months of the first
appearance, the current violation will be treated as a third appearance.
      (3)   If a licensee has appeared before the City Council on three
previous occasions, and the current violation occurred within 42 months of the
first appearance, the current violation will be treated as a fourth appearance.
      (4)   Any appearance not covered by divisions (H)(1), (H)(2), or (H)(3)
above will be treated as a first appearance.
   (I)   Other penalties. Nothing in this section shall restrict or limit the
authority of the City Council to suspend up to 60 days, revoke the license, or
impose a civil fine not to exceed $2,000 for each violation, to impose
conditions, or impose any combination of the foregoing sanctions, or take any
other action in accordance with law; provided, that the license holder has been
afforded an opportunity for a hearing in the manner provided for in this
section.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 117.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to establish licensing regulations for the
sale of cannabinoid products derived from hemp as provided in M.S. § 151.72, as
it may be amended from time to time.
(Ord. 2023-03, passed 7-25-2023)
§ 117.02 FINDINGS OF CITY COUNCIL.
   The City Council makes the following findings regarding the need to
regulate, license, and inspect establishments that sell certain cannabinoid
products.
   (A)   By enacting S.L. 2022 Chapter 98, Article 13, the legislature of the
state amended M.S. § 151.72, as it may be amended from time to time, to allow
for the sale of certain cannabinoid products.
   (B)   This new law does not prohibit municipalities from licensing the sale
of cannabinoid products derived from hemp locally.
   (C)   The National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine note that
the growing acceptance, accessibility, and use of cannabis and its derivatives
have raised important public health concerns, while the lack of aggregated
knowledge of cannabis-related health effects has led to uncertainty about the
impact of its use.
   (D)   The legislature of the state recognized the danger of cannabis use
among youth by prohibiting the sale of any product containing cannabinoid or
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) extracted or otherwise derived from hemp to those
under the age of 21 and requiring that edible cannabinoid products be packaged
without appeal to children and in child-resistant packaging or containers.
   (E)   Due to the passage of this new law by the legislature of the state,
the City Council believes the following rules, regulations, and standards for
licensing the sale of cannabinoid products are necessary to promote and protect
the public health, safety, and general welfare of the residents of the city.
(Ord. 2023-03, passed 7-25-2023)

§ 117.04 ENFORCEMENT.

to inspections by law enforcement or other authorized city officials during
regular business hours. From time to time, but at least once per year, the city

other designated personnel.
   (B)   Civil penalty, suspension, or revocation of licenses.

provide notice to the City Attorney’s office. If the City Attorney’s office
determines from the facts and circumstances reported, together with any other
facts and circumstances known to it, that the violation may warrant a civil
penalty, suspension, or revocation of the license held by the licensee, it will
notify the licensee, and set a time and place for a hearing sufficiently in
advance to provide ten days’ written notice of the time, place, and purpose of
such hearing to the licensee.

findings of fact as to whether a violation of the provisions of this chapter or
M.S. Chapter 151, as it may be amended from time to time, have been committed
in the operation of the licensee’s business and whether the violation was
willful in nature. The hearing officer will also make a recommendation as to
what penalty, if any, will be applied. The City Council will adopt the hearing
officer’s findings of fact that the licensee has violated any of the provisions
of this chapter or state law, and may impose a civil fine, suspend, or revoke
the license in accordance with the schedule in §
10.99.
      (4)   Mandatory revocation. The Council will revoke the license of any
licensee under this chapter if the licensee willfully violates any provisions
of this chapter or M.S. Chapter 151, as it may be amended from time to time.

HEMP-DERIVED CANNABINOID PRODUCTS

      (3)   The City Council will consider the facts and recommendation of the
Chief of Police and of the City Manager or designee, together with any material
facts which it may have or obtain, and then, by motion, will approve or deny
the application to the City Clerk together with a copy of the motion. If the
City Council has approved the application, it is the duty of the City Clerk to

         (e)   The applicant is prohibited by federal, state, or other local
law; ordinance; or other regulation from holding a license.

premises proposed to be licensed complies with all applicable zoning
requirements.

license holder with notice of the revocation, along with information on the
right to appeal.

CLANDESTINE DRUG LAB SITES
§ 131.35 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to reduce public exposure to health risks
associated with hazardous chemicals or residue from a clandestine drug lab
site. Professional testing and investigations show that chemicals used in the
production of illicit drugs can condense, penetrate, and contaminate surfaces,
furnishings, and equipment of surrounding structures. The City Council finds
that the sites and the personal property within the sites may contain suspected
chemicals and residues that place people, particularly children or adults of
childbearing age, at risk when exposed through inhabiting or visiting the site
or being exposed to contaminated personal property.
(Prior Code, § 131.35)
§ 131.36 INTERPRETATION AND APPLICATION.
   The provisions of this subchapter must be construed to protect the public
health, safety, and welfare. When the conditions imposed by this subchapter
conflict with comparable provisions imposed by another law, ordinance, statute,
or regulation, the regulations that are more restrictive or that impose higher
standards will prevail.
(Prior Code, § 131.36)

replace the temporary declaration. A copy of the permanent declaration and
order must be posted on all doorway entrances to the site or, in the case of
bare land, in several conspicuous places on the property.
   (B)   Abatement order. After issuing the permanent declaration, the city
must send written notice to the site owner ordering abatement of the public

the declaration of public health nuisance after the city receives documentation
from a city-approved environmental hazard testing and cleaning firm stating
that the suspected health and safety risks, including those to neighbors and
potential occupants, either do not exist or have been sufficiently abated or
corrected to justify amendment or removal of the declaration.
(Prior Code, § 131.41)

finished grade, except that the height of a railing, wall, fence, or screening
affixed to a deck constructed on the ground but raised above ground level, will
be measured from the elevation of the raised deck for that portion which is
affixed to the raised deck. The grade at the fence line shall not be altered in
any way that artificially increases the maximum permitted height of the fence.
Required fence height shall be measured and applied only at each post, and no
section of fence between posts shall exceed the height of the higher of the two
posts between which such fence is constructed.

§ 151.09 EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES.
   No person may occupy, or let to another for occupancy, any dwelling or
dwelling unit which does not comply with all of the following.
   (A)   Sump pumps.
      (1)   Purpose. The discharge of water from roofs, surfaces, ground water
sump pumps, footing tile, swimming pools, or other flow of precipitation into
the city system results in flooding and overloading of the sanitary sewer
system. When this water is discharged into the sanitary sewer system, it is
treated at the sewage treatment plant, resulting in very large and needless
expenditures. The City Council, therefore, finds it in the best interest of the
city to prohibit such discharges.
      (2)   Discharge prohibited. No water from any roof, surface, ground water
sump pump, footing tile, swimming pool, or other flow of storm water shall be
discharged into the sanitary sewer system. Dwellings and other buildings and
structures which require, because of infiltration of water into basements,
crawl spaces, and the like, a sump pump discharge system, may have a
permanently installed discharge line which shall not at any time discharge
water into the sanitary sewer system. A permanent installation shall be one
which provides for year round discharge capability to either the outside of the
dwelling, building, or structure, or is connected to city storm sewer or
discharge through the curb and gutter to the street. Inside piping shall be
rigid pipe with fixed joints, PVC, or equivalent.
      (3)   Disconnection. Before December 31, 1999, any person, firm, or
corporation having a roof surface, ground water sump pump, footing tile, or
swimming pool now connected and/or discharging into the sanitary sewer system
shall be disconnected from the sanitary sewer and redirected in an effective,
professional manner. Unless inspected prior to then, they may have 45 days to
make the disconnection.
      (4)   Inspection. Every person owning improved real estate that
discharges into the city’s sanitary sewer system shall allow an employee of the
city or a designated representative of the city to inspect the buildings to
confirm that there is no sump pump or other prohibited discharge into the
sanitary sewer system. In lieu of having the city inspect his, her, or their
property, any person may furnish a certificate from a licensed plumber
certifying that his, her, or their property is in compliance with this chapter.
      (5)   Correction period; reinspection. Properties which fail during the
first inspection shall be re-inspected within 45 days to allow corrections to
be completed. If property fails the re-inspection, the $100 per month surcharge
shall be imposed on every sewer bill until compliance is achieved.
      (6)   Future inspections. Each sump pump or sump pump basket installation
identified will be re-inspected periodically.
      (7)   New construction. All new dwellings with sumps for which a building
permit is issued after adoption of this chapter, shall have a pump and shall be
piped to the outside of the dwelling, in accordance with this chapter, before a
certificate of occupancy is issued.
      (8)   Surcharge. A surcharge of $100 per month is hereby imposed on every
sewer bill mailed, after a 30-day grace period following inspection or
confirmed attempt at inspection, to property owners who are not in compliance
with this chapter or who have refused to allow their property to be inspected
to determine if there is compliance. All properties found during periodic re-
inspection to have violated this chapter will be subject to the $100 per month
surcharge for all months between the two most recent inspections.
      (9)   Winter discharge. The City Manager’s office is authorized to issue
a permit to allow a property owner to discharge surface water into the sanitary
sewer system. The permit shall authorize such discharge only from November 15
to March 15 and a property owner is required to meet at least one of the
following criteria in order to obtain a permit.
         (a)   The freezing of the surface water discharge from the sump pump
or footing drain is causing a dangerous condition, such as ice buildup or
flooding, on either public or private property.
         (b)   The property owner has demonstrated that there is a danger that

§ 151.13 ACCESS TO MULTI-UNIT HOUSING STRUCTURES BY UNITED STATES CENSUS BUREAU
EMPLOYEES.
   (A)   Declaration and purpose.
      (1)   The United States Constitution directs a decennial census count of
all persons living in the United States.
      (2)   Complete, accurate census data is of critical importance to all
residents of the city for equal political representation, fair distribution of
federal and state funding, and sound planning and investment infrastructure,
real estate, business development, and public policy and programming.
      (3)   During the decennial census, the United States Census Bureau
conducts non-response follow-up operations (NRFU), when employees of the United
States Census Bureau visit households that have not yet submitted a census
form.
      (4)   Renters and others who live in multi-unit housing structures have
historically been at higher risk of being undercounted in the decennial census,
with the number of renter households in an area being the most influential
variable affecting an area’s census self-response rate; in other words, the
more renters in an area, the lower the self-response rate of that area.
      (5)   The risk of an undercount is compounded in areas with high
concentrations of communities that have been consistently undercounted in the
past and who are more likely to be renters, including low income households,
communities of color, Native American/American Indian communities, immigrants
and refugees, and young people.
      (6)   Multi-unit housing structures can be difficult for Census Bureau
employees to enter due to security barriers.
      (7)   It is critical that Census Bureau employees have access to multi-
unit housing structures during the decennial census, so they can reach
households that have not yet participated.
      (8)   13 U.S.C. § 223 authorizes Census Bureau employees to access “any
hotel, apartment house, boarding or lodging house, tenement, or other
building.”
   (B)   Prohibition. It is unlawful for a person, either directly or
indirectly, to deny access to an apartment building, dormitory, nursing home,
manufactured home park, other multi-unit structure used as a residence, or an
area in which one or more single-family dwellings are located on private
roadways, to employees of the United States Census Bureau who display current,
valid Census Bureau credentials and who are engaged in official census counting
operations during the Census Bureau’s standard operational hours of 9:00 a.m.
to 9:00 p.m. (local time) during the decennial census.
   (C)   Access and permissions. Census Bureau employees granted access must be
permitted to leave census materials in an orderly manner for residents at their
doors, except that the manager of a nursing home may direct that the materials
be left at a central location within the facility.
   (D)   Exemptions. This section does not prohibit:
      (1)   Denial of admittance into a particular apartment, room,
manufactured home, or personal residential unit;
      (2)   Denial of permission to visit certain persons for valid health
reasons, in the case of a nursing home or a Registered Housing with Services
Establishment providing assisted-living services meeting the requirements of
M.S. § 292(1), as it may be amended from time to time;
      (3)   Limiting visits to a reasonable number of census employees;
      (4)   Requiring a prior appointment or notification to gain access to the
structure; or
      (5)   Denial of admittance to or expulsion of an individual employee from
a multi-unit housing structure for good cause.

§ 152.01 PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to protect the public health, safety, and
welfare of the community at large and the residents of rental dwellings in the
city and to ensure that rental housing in the city is decent, safe, and
sanitary and is so operated and maintained as not to become a nuisance to the
neighborhood or to become an influence that fosters blight and deterioration or
creates a disincentive to reinvestment in the community. The operation of
rental residential properties is a business enterprise that entails certain
responsibilities. Owners and operators are responsible to take such reasonable
steps as necessary to ensure that the citizens of the city who occupy such
units may pursue the quiet enjoyment of the normal activities of life in
surroundings that are: safe, secure, and sanitary; free from noise, nuisance,
or annoyances; and free from unreasonable fears about safety of persons and
security of property.

automatic renewal of the license. Allowing the owner to continue to rent while
the renewal is being processed does not obligate the city to automatically
renew the license.
   (F)   Transfer of license. Licenses are not transferable. Any change in the
ownership of the rental dwelling requires a new license.
   (G)   Resident agent required. Owners of rental dwellings with five or more
individual units appoint a resident agent who shall reside within the rental
dwelling to be responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of the rental
dwelling and common areas and to handle licensing issues with the city. Owners
of rental dwellings containing fewer than five units who do not reside within
the counties of Ramsey, Hennepin, Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Scott, Washington,
Wright, Chisago, Isanti, or Sherburne shall appoint an agent that resides
within one of these counties that shall be the responsible resident agent.
   (H)   Register of occupancy. The owner, or his, her, or their resident
agent, shall keep a current register of occupancy for each rental dwelling.
This register of occupancy may be reviewed by the city at the time. Said
register of occupancy shall contain, at a minimum, the following information:
      (1)   Address(es) of the rental dwelling;
      (2)   Number of bedrooms of each unit;
      (3)   Number of units in each building; and
      (4)   Number of adults and children (under 18) currently occupying each
unit.

10.99
§ 152.12 INSPECTIONS.
   (A)   Inspections. The city will inspect all rental dwellings periodically
to determine compliance with this chapter, the city code and the International
Property Maintenance Code. After each inspection, the city shall provide the
owner or resident agent with a compliance order pursuant to this section. The
owner or resident agent must correct the violations within the time period
specified in the compliance order. If the violations are not corrected, the
city may suspend or revoke the license under this section, unless it is the
initial license period, in which case, the license is valid until the end of
the owner’s existing lease with the current tenant as noted in this section.
The city may, however, immediately suspend or revoke a license if an unsafe or
dangerous condition exists as described in §
152.11(C).
   (B)   Occupant initiated inspections. An occupant who believes that his or
her rental dwelling is not in compliance with the provision of this chapter,
city code, or the International Housing Maintenance Code may provide written
notice to the owner or resident agent of the rental dwelling specifying the
alleged deficiency. If the owner or resident agent does not take action to
correct the alleged problem the occupant may contact the city and request an
inspection of the rental dwelling by the City Manager or designee upon showing
proof that the owner or resident agent had been properly notified and has been
given a reasonable time in which to correct deficiencies. The cost of the
inspection shall be paid by the owner if the city’s inspection reveals actual
deficiencies as described by the occupant.
(Prior Code, § 150.131) (Ord. 08-003, passed 4-22-2008)
§ 152.13 CONDUCT ON LICENSED PREMISES; VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   Owner responsible. It shall be the responsibility of the owner or
resident agent to see that persons occupying the rental dwelling conduct
themselves in such a manner as not to cause the premises to be disorderly. This
section applies to all licenses. For purposes of this section, a rental
dwelling is disorderly at which any of the following activities occur:
      (1)   Violation of M.S. Chapter 609, Criminal Code, as it may be amended
from time to time;
      (2)   Violation of M.S. Chapter 152, Drugs; Controlled Substances, as it
may be amended from time to time;
      (3)   Violation of M.S. Chapter 340A, Liquor, as it may be amended from
time to time;
      (4)   Violation of M.S. Chapter 624, Crimes; Fireworks; Firearms, as it
may be amended from time to time; or
      (5)   Violation of any of the provisions contained in Titles IX or XIII
of this code.
   (B)   City enforcement. The City Manager or designee is responsible for
enforcement of this section.
   (C)   First violation. Upon determination by the City Manager or designee
that a licensed premises was used in a disorderly manner, as described in
division (A) above, the City Manager or designee must give notice to the
licensee of the violation and direct the licensee to take steps to prevent
further violations.
   (D)   Second violation. If another occurrence of disorderly use of the
licensed premises occurs within six months of an incident for which a notice in
division (C) above was given, the City Manager or designee must notify the
licensee of the violation and must also require the licensee to submit a
written report of the actions taken, and proposed to be taken, by the licensee
to prevent further disorderly use of the premises. This written report must be
submitted to the City Manager or designee within five days of receipt of the
notice of disorderly use of the premises and must detail all actions taken by
the licensee in response to all notices of disorderly use of the premises
within the preceding six months.
   (E)   Third violation.
      (1)   If another instance of disorderly use of the licensed premises
occurs within one year after any two previous instances of disorderly use for
which notices were given to the licensee pursuant to this section, the rental
dwelling license for the premises may be denied, revoked, suspended or not
renewed. Written notification will be issued by the City Manager or designee.
Such written notice must specify all violations of this section, and must state
the date, time, place, and purpose of the hearing. The hearing must be held no
less than ten days and no more than 60 days after giving such notice.
      (2)   Following the hearing, the City Council may deny, revoke, suspend,
or decline to renew the license for all or any part or parts of the licensed
premises or may grant a license upon such terms and conditions as it deems
necessary to accomplish the purposes of this section.
   (F)   No adverse action pending eviction. No adverse license action shall be
imposed where the instance of disorderly use of the licensed premises occurred
during the pending of eviction proceedings (unlawful detainer) or within 30
days of notice given by the licensee to a tenant to vacate the premises where
the disorderly use was related to conduct by that tenant or by other occupants
or guests of the tenant’s unit. Eviction proceedings are not a bar to adverse
license action, however, unless they are diligently pursued by the licensee.
Further, an action to deny, revoke, suspend, or not renew a license based upon
violations of this section may be postponed or discontinued at any time if it
appears that the licensee has taken appropriate measures which will prevent
further instances of disorderly use.
   (G)   Finding of disorderly conduct. A determination that the licensed
premises have been used in a disorderly manner as described in division (A)
above shall be made upon a fair preponderance of the evidence to support such a
determination. It is not necessary that criminal charges be brought in order to
support a determination of disorderly use nor does the fact of dismissal or
acquittal of such a criminal charge operate as a bar to adverse license action
under this section.
   (H)   Service of notices. All notices given by the city under this section
must be personally served on the licensee, sent by certified mail to the
licensee’s last known address or, if neither method of service effects notice,
by posting on a conspicuous place on the licensed premises.
   (I)   Enforcement actions. Enforcement actions provided in this section are
not exclusive, and the City Council may take any action with respect to a
licensee, a tenant, or the licensed premises as is authorized by the city code,
state, or federal law.
(Prior Code, § 150.132) (Ord. 08-003, passed 4-22-2008) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 152.14 CONDITION OF LICENSED PREMISES.
   (A)   Compliance order. Whenever the City Manager or designee determines
that the condition of any rental dwelling or the premises surrounding it fails
to meet the provisions of this chapter, other applicable city code provisions,
or the International Property Maintenance Code, he or she may issue a
compliance order setting forth the specific violations and ordering the owner
to correct such violations.
   (B)   Contents of the compliance order. The compliance order shall:
      (1)   Be in writing;
      (2)   Describe the location and nature of the violations;
      (3)   Set forth a reasonable time for the correction of the violations by
the owner or resident agent; and
      (4)   Be served upon the owner and resident agent either personally or by
certified mail. A copy of the compliance order shall also be provided to the
occupants of the rental dwelling.
   (C)   License action. If the violations listed in the compliance order are
not remedied by the owner or resident agent within the specified time given in
the order, the license for the rental dwelling may be denied, suspended,
revoked, or not renewed by the city. An administrative fine in an amount set
forth from time to time by the City Council by resolution may also be imposed.
If the city decides that it will be denying, suspending, revoking, or not
renewing a license or imposing an administrative fine pursuant to this chapter,
the city shall send a notice of the proposed action to the owner and resident
agent of the rental dwelling.
   (D)   Appeal. When it is alleged by the owner or resident agent that the
compliance order is based upon the erroneous interpretation of this chapter,
other applicable city code provisions, or the International Property
Maintenance Code, the owner or resident agent may appeal the compliance order
to the City Council. Such appeal shall be in writing, must specify the grounds
for the appeal, and must be filed with the city within five business days after
service of the compliance order.
(Prior Code, § 150.133) (Ord. 08-003, passed 4-22-2008) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 152.15 HEARING PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Scheduling of hearing. If the city makes a determination that it will
be denying, suspending, revoking, or not renewing a license pursuant to this
subchapter, or if the owner or resident agent is appealing the compliance order
pursuant to §
152.13, the City Council shall conduct a hearing on the matter. The hearing
shall be scheduled at the next regular City Council meeting following the date
of the notice or receipt of the owner’s notice of appeal of a compliance order.
   (B)   Hearing. At the hearing, the City Council shall hear all relevant
evidence and arguments and shall review all testimony, documents, and other
evidence submitted. The owner or resident agent shall have the opportunity to
address the City Council at the hearing.
   (C)   Findings. After the hearing is concluded, the City Council shall make
findings on whether to uphold the compliance order or to revoke, suspend, deny,
or not renew the license, or impose an administrative fine. The City Council
shall issue a written decision within 30 days following the date of the hearing
and shall send a copy of its decision to the owner and resident agent by mail.
The decision shall specify the rental dwelling or units to which it applies.
   (D)   No occupancy. If a license is revoked, suspended, denied, or not
renewed by the City Council, it shall be unlawful for the owner or the resident
agent to thereafter permit the occupancy of the rental dwelling or the unit. A
notice of the action shall be posted by the City Manager or designee on the
rental dwelling or the unit in order to prevent any further occupancy. No
person shall reside in, occupy, or cause to be occupied that rental dwelling or
unit until a license is obtained or reinstated by the owner.
   (E)   Appeal. An owner may appeal the decision of the City Council as
allowed under §
152.14(D).

(Prior Code, § 151.01)
§ 153.02 REQUIRED INFORMATION.
   (A)   Identification and description. The preliminary plat must use a
proposed name which is not the same as, or deceptively similar to, the name of
any plat previously recorded in Ramsey or Hennepin County. The plat must show
the location by section, township, and range, and any other information as to
definitely establish the location of the property, the name and addresses of
the owners, subdivider, surveyors, and designer of the plat, the graphic scale,

boundary lines of adjoining land within 100 feet in every direction and
ownership of that land. If requested by the city, it must include topographical
survey data.
   (B)   Design features. The preliminary plat must contain the following
design information:
      (1)   Streets. Layout and centerline gradients of proposed streets
showing right-of-way width and names of streets, alleys, and sidewalks;
      (2)   Easements. Location and width of proposed drainage and utility
easements;
      (3)   Drainage. Typical cross-sections of proposed improvements upon
streets and alleys together with an indication of the proposed storm water
runoff showing drainage from other areas that contribute storm waters to the
proposed plat;
      (4)   Lots. Lot numbers, dimensions, and size in square feet;
      (5)   Dimensions. Minimum front, rear, and side setback lines, and street
and building lines, indicating dimensions;

ways, and utility easements, intended to be dedicated to or reserved for public
use;
      (7)   Elevations. Front and rear grade elevations for each lot; and
      (8)   Additional information. Any additional information as deemed
necessary by the city.
(Prior Code, § 151.02)
§ 153.03 PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Copies of preliminary plat. Four copies of the preliminary plat, along
with any additional information required will be filed with the City Manager or
designee and a filing fee as provided in Chapter 33 will be paid.
   (B)   Planning Commission. The City Manager or designee will refer the
preliminary plat to the Planning Commission for review.
   (C)   Public Works Director. The City Manager or designee will refer copies
of the preliminary plat to the Public Works Director and to utility companies
for examination and report to the Planning Commission as to existing and
required easements.
   (D)   Public hearing. The Planning Commission will review the preliminary
plat and related information and conduct a public hearing within 60 days after
receipt of the complete preliminary plat. All property owners of record on the
city tax rolls who live within 350 feet of the land to be subdivided will be
notified by mail at least ten days prior to the hearing. A notice of hearing
identifying the land to be subdivided will be published at least ten days prior
to the date of the hearing. At the hearing, all interested persons will be
heard. The Planning Commission will make its report to the City Council.
   (E)   City Council. The City Council will consider the preliminary plat
within 30 days following issuance of the report of the Planning Commission. If
the preliminary plat is approved, the final plat may be submitted.
(Prior Code, § 151.03)
§ 153.04 FINAL PLAT.
   The final plat must be prepared and certified to by a registered surveyor in
compliance with this code, state law, and the requirements of the county. The
final plat must show all required monuments in place before it is signed on
behalf of the city. The owner must provide the City Council with a
certification showing that all taxes currently due on the property to be
subdivided have been paid in full. The owner must provide the City Attorney
with satisfactory evidence of title to the land to be subdivided. The City
Council shall act on the final plat within 30 days after it was filed with the
City Manager or designee. If the final plat is approved by City Council
resolution, the subdivider must record it with the County Recorder or Registrar
of Titles within 30 days after the date of approval; otherwise the approval of
the final plat will be deemed void. After recording, the owner will furnish the
City Manager or designee with a print of the final plat showing evidence of the
recording.
(Prior Code, § 151.04)
§ 153.05 DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (A)   Streets. The arrangements, character, extent, width, grade, and
location of all streets must conform to the city pattern and must be considered
in their relation to existing and planned streets, to reasonable circulation of
traffic, to topographical conditions, to runoff of storm water, to public
convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses
of the land to be served by the streets. The arrangement of streets in new
subdivisions must make provision for the appropriate continuation of the
streets in adjoining areas. All right-of-way widths must be a minimum of 60
feet unless the City Council deems a different width to be advisable to conform
to the other streets in the area. Private streets and half streets are
prohibited.
   (B)   Easements. Easements at least ten feet wide, centered on rear and
other lot lines, must be provided for utilities, where necessary. They must
have continuity of alignment from block to block, and at deflection points, and
easements for pole-line anchors must be provided where necessary. Where a
subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way, channel, or stream,
there must be provided a right-of-way conforming substantially with the lines
of the watercourse, together with the further width or construction or both, as
will be adequate for storm water runoff.
   (C)   Blocks. Blocks must accommodate the size of residential lots required
in the area by the Zoning Code and must provide for convenient access,
circulation, control, and safety of street traffic. Pedestrian crossings may be
required by the City Council in locations deemed necessary to public health,
convenience, and necessity.
   (D)   Lot requirements.
      (1)   Access. All lots must abut by their full frontage on a public
street.
      (2)   Size. The minimum dimensions for single-family lots are:
         (a)   Seventy-five feet at the building setback line;
         (b)   Sixty feet at the front lot line;
         (c)   Thirty feet at the rear lot line;
         (d)   One hundred ten feet in average depth; and
         (e)   Nine thousand square feet in area.
      (3)   Corner lots. Minimum corner lot widths must be no less than 15 feet
greater than interior lot widths.
      (4)   Butt lots. Butt lots must be platted at least five feet wider than
the average width of interior lots in the block.
      (5)   Side lot lines. Side lines of lots must be substantially at right
angles or radial to the street line.
      (6)   Water courses. Lots abutting upon marsh areas, a water course,
drainage way, channel, or stream must have an additional depth or width, as
required, to assure house sites that are not subject to flooding ground water
seepage.
      (7)   Features. In the subdividing of any land, due regard must be shown
for all natural features, such as tree growth, water courses, historic sites or
similar conditions, which if preserved will add attractiveness and stability to
the proposed development.
      (8)   Lot remnants. All remnants of lots below minimum size left over
after subdividing of a larger tract must be added to adjacent lots; rather than
allowed to remain as unusable parcels.
      (9)   Political boundary line. No lot may extend over a political
boundary or school district line.
(Prior Code, § 151.05) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 153.06 REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS AND FEES.
   (A)   Certifications. No final plat may be approved by the City Council
without first receiving a report by the Public Works Director and the City
Attorney certifying that the proposed improvements together with the agreements
and documents required under this chapter meet city requirements, and a
certification from the City Manager or designee that all fees have been paid,
including all fees of the Public Works Director and City Attorney relating to
the subdivision.
   (B)   Monuments. Monuments must be placed at all block corners, angle
points, points of curves in streets, and at intermediate points as shown on the
final plat before the plat is signed on behalf of the city.
   (C)   Water and sewer facilities. Water and sewer improvements must conform
to specifications of the city, and will be subject to inspection and approval
by the city.
   (D)   Street grading. The full width of the right-of-way must be graded,
including the subgrade of the areas to be paved, in accordance with the
standard plans approved by the city.
   (E)   Street improvements. All streets must be improved with pavement or
wearing course surfaces to an overall width of 30 feet. All cul-de-sacs must
have turnarounds, the pavements of which must have a minimum diameter of 100
feet. Concrete curbs and gutters are to be installed, and each lot will be
provided with a driveway entrance. All street improvements must be constructed
in accordance with applicable standard specifications approved by the city.
   (F)   Utilities. Utility lines for telephone and electric service must be
placed in rearline easements when carried on overhead poles. Where telephone,
electric, and gas services lines are placed underground entirely throughout a
subdivided area, conduits, or cables shall be placed within easements, or
dedicated public ways, in a manner which will not conflict with other
underground service. Further transformer boxes must be located so as not to be
hazardous to the public. All drainage and underground utility installations
which traverse privately-owned property must be protected by easements.
   (G)   Topographic map. The subdivider must furnish the city a topographic
map at the subdivider’s expense to conform with elevations and revised for
subdivision purposes.
   (H)   Railroad crossing. No street dedications will be accepted which
require a crossing of a railroad unless sufficient land is dedicated to provide
for approachers view consistent with safety, in such an area as the City
Council may determine.
(Prior Code, § 151.06) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 153.07 AGREEMENT AND SECURITY.
   Before a final plat is approved, the owner and subdivider must execute an
agreement acceptable to the City Attorney to make and install all required
improvements in accordance with the timetable and plans and specifications,
prepared or approved by the city. The agreement shall be accompanied by a cash
escrow, letter of credit, or performance bond acceptable to the City Attorney
equal to the city’s estimated costs of improvements and all fees to be paid by
the subdivider.
(Prior Code, § 151.07)
§ 153.08 SUBDIVISION WITHOUT PLATTING.
   The City Council may waive compliance with the platting requirements of this
subchapter and approve subdivision by conveyance of land by adoption of a
resolution to that effect based upon findings by the City Council that
compliance with the platting requirements would create an unnecessary hardship
or expense because of the nature of the subdivision, and failure to require the
filing of a plat does not interfere with the purposes of this subchapter. The
City Council may consider the number of parcels resulting from the subdivision,
the complexity of the legal descriptions, the necessity for dedication of
streets or drainage and utility casements, and the probability of future
subdivision of the parcels.
(Prior Code, § 151.08)
§ 153.09 BUILDING PERMIT.
   No building permit will be issued for the construction of any building,
structure, or improvement on any land required to be subdivided by this chapter
until all requirements of this chapter have been fully complied with.
(Prior Code, § 151.09)
§ 153.10 CONVEYANCE BY METES AND BOUNDS FORBIDDEN.
   No conveyance by metes and bounds may be made or recorded if the parcel
described in the conveyance is less than two and one-half acres in area or 150
feet in width, unless the parcel was a separate parcel of record on August 22,
1973.
(Prior Code, § 151.10)
§ 153.11 VARIANCES.
   The City Council may authorize a variance from these regulations when, in
its opinion, undue hardship may result from strict compliance. Any application
for a variance will be dealt with in the same manner as is provided in Chapter
154 relating to zoning variances.
(Prior Code, § 151.11)
§ 153.12 PUBLIC LAND DEDICATION REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Land dedication. The owners of a parcel of land of one acre or more in
size and being subdivided shall dedicate to the city a reasonable portion of
the land for use as public parks, playgrounds, trails or open space, or, in the
alternative, the city may require a cash contribution as provided in division
(B) below. As a general rule, it is deemed reasonable for the City Council to
require as a condition of subdivision, approval dedication of 10% of the total
square foot area of the land being subdivided, or the cash contribution
provided for in division (B). The city may determine the location and
configuration of any land dedicated, taking into consideration the suitability
of the land for its intended purpose and future needs of the community for
park, playground, trail, or open space property. This section shall apply to
all new residential developments, and lot combination/redivisions meant to
facilitate residential development and to all new industrial and commercial
developments. It shall not apply to lot combination/redivisions which do not
increase the number of residential dwellings, conversion of apartments to
condominiums, or internal leasehold improvements.
   (B)   Contribution in lieu of land. At the city’s option, the subdivider
shall contribute an amount in cash, in lieu of all or a portion of the land
required under division (A) above as set forth in Chapter 33 based on the
number and type of dwelling units the subdivision will accommodate in the case
of any residential development and the total square foot area of the land being
subdivided in the case of any commercial or industrial development.
   (C)   Land title. Prior to the dedication of the required property, the
subdivider shall provide the city with an acceptable title opinion or title
insurance policy addressed to the city, which insures the title and the city’s
proposed interest in the property. In any land dedication, the subdivider must
transfer good and marketable title to the city, free and clear of any
mortgages, liens, encumbrances, or assessments, except easements or minor
imperfections of title acceptable to the city. If land is not formally
dedicated to the city in the final plat, the subdivider shall record all deeds
for conveyance of the property to the city at the same time as the final plat
or other appropriate division documents.
   (D)   Land not credited. At the city’s option, the following types of land
shall not be credited for the requirements of this subchapter:
      (1)   Land dedicated or obtained as easements for storm water retention,
drainage, roadway, or utility purposes;
      (2)   Land which is unusable or of limited use; and
      (3)   Land that is protected wetlands/floodplain.
   (E)   Cash contributions. Cash contributions, for single-family residential
development, will be due and payable at the time of final plat approval by the
city. Cash contributions for multi-family residential development will be due
and payable at the time of building permit issuance. The applicant will execute
a document in a form satisfactory to the City Attorney which acknowledges the
obligation to pay amounts due under division (B) above at the time building
permits are secured. The documents will be in recordable form and any fee
charged in connection with the filing thereof shall be paid by the applicant.
   (F)   Park fund. Any cash contribution received pursuant to division (B)
above shall be placed in a separate city fund and used only for park,
playground, trail, or open space purposes.
   (G)   Dedication or contribution not required. In the case of subdivision of
property with existing residential dwelling units already in place where no new
units will be added, no land dedication or cash contribution shall be required.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 154.001 TITLE.
   This chapter will be known as the city’s “Zoning Code.”
(Prior Code, § 152.001)
§ 154.002 INTENT AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   The intent of the Zoning Code is to protect the health, safety, and
general welfare of the city and its people through the establishment of minimum
regulations governing land development and use. The zoning code divides the
city into use districts and establishes regulations for the location, erection,
construction, reconstruction, alteration, and use of land and structures.
   (B)   The Zoning Code is established to:
      (1)   Protect the use districts;
      (2)   Promote orderly development and redevelopment;
      (3)   Provide adequate light, air, and access to property;
      (4)   Prevent congestion in the public streets;
      (5)   Prevent overcrowding of land and undue concentration of structures
by regulating land, buildings, yards, and densities;
      (6)   Provide for compatibility of different land uses;
      (7)   Provide for administration and amendment of the Zoning Code;
      (8)   Prescribe penalties for violations; and
      (9)   Define the powers and duties of the city staff, the Board of
Adjustments and Appeals, the Planning Commission, and the City Council in
relation to the Zoning Code.
(Prior Code, § 152.002)
§ 154.003 SCOPE.
   The use of all property in the city must comply with the Zoning Code. Any
building, structure, or use lawfully existing on August 2, 1976, and continuing
to lawfully exist to the date of adoption of this Zoning Code, but not in
conformity with this Zoning Code, will be regarded as nonconforming. The
nonconforming uses and structures may be continued subject to the provisions of
§§
154.225 and
154.226.
(Prior Code, § 152.003)
§ 154.004 INTERPRETATION.
   The intent and purposes set forth in §
154.002 will be considered in interpreting and applying the Zoning Code. If
provisions of the Zoning Code impose greater restrictions than those of any
statute, other ordinance, or regulation, the provisions of the Zoning Code will
control. If provisions of any statute, other ordinance, or regulation impose
greater restrictions than the Zoning Code, the provisions of the statute, other
ordinance, or regulation will control. In this Zoning Code, the singular
includes the plural and the plural the singular, the present tense includes the
past and future tenses, the word “building” includes the word “structure,” and
the word “lot” includes the word “parcel.”
(Prior Code, § 152.004)
§ 154.005 PERMITS REQUIRED.
   Except as provided in the Zoning Code, no building, structure, or premises
may be erected, converted, enlarged, reconstructed, altered, used, or occupied
unless it is in compliance with the Zoning Code, and an appropriate building
permit has been issued.
(Prior Code, § 152.005)
§ 154.006 USES NOT SPECIFIED.
   If a use is not specifically permitted, permitted by conditional use permit,
or prohibited, the use will be considered prohibited.

§ 154.187 SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEMS.
   (A)   Purpose. Regulations governing solar energy systems are established to
provide for appropriate locations for solar energy systems, to ensure
compatibility with surrounding uses, and to promote safe and effective use of
solar energy to increase opportunities for generation of renewable energy. The
city finds that it is in the public interest to encourage the use and
development of renewable energy systems that enhance energy conservation
efforts, but result in limited adverse impacts on nearby properties. As such,
the city supports the use of solar energy systems.
   (B)   Permitted uses and specific standards.
      (1)   In general. Solar energy systems shall be permitted in those zoning
districts where permitted as an accessory use, subject to the standards of this
subchapter. Solar collector surfaces and all mounting devices shall comply with
the minimum yard requirements of the district in which they are located, unless
otherwise specified herein. Screening of solar collector surfaces shall not be
required, except as required in division (C)(1) below.
      (2)   Building-mounted solar energy systems.
         (a)   Zoning district standards.
            1.   Residential District standards.
               a.   Notwithstanding the height limitations of the zoning
district, building mounted solar energy systems shall be constructed and
maintained at or below the ridge level of a roof on a structure with a gable,
hip, or gambrel roof as long and not visible from the nearest edge of the
street frontage right-of-way other than an alley.
               b.   Building mounted solar energy systems that are visible from
the nearest edge of the street frontage right-of-way shall be flushmounted and
not have a highest finished pitch steeper than the roof pitch on which the
system is mounted, and shall be no higher than 12 inches above the roof
surface. Solar energy systems on all accessory structures shall be
flushmounted, regardless of the location on the structure.
               c.   Building-integrated solar energy systems shall be allowed
regardless of whether the system is visible from the public right-of-way,
provided the building component in which the system is integrated meets all
required setbacks, land use, or performance standards for the district in which
the building is located.
            2.   Commercial, Industrial, and Recreational Open Space (ROS)
Zoning Districts. Notwithstanding the height limitations of the zoning
district, building mounted solar energy systems shall be constructed and
maintained at or below the ridge level of a roof on a structure with a gable,
hip, or gambrel roof and shall not extend higher than ten feet above the
surface of the roof when installed on flat or shed roof.
         (b)   The solar collector surface and mounting devices for building-
mounted solar energy systems shall be setback not less than one foot from the
exterior perimeter of a roof for every one foot that the system extends above
the roof surface on which the system is mounted to ensure ready roof access in
the event of a fire or other safety related occurrence whereby roof access is
needed. Solar energy systems that extend less than one foot above the roof
surface shall be exempt from this provision, however shall be setback from the
roof edge by a minimum of one foot.
         (c)   The collector surface and mounting devices for building-mounted
solar energy systems shall not extend beyond the exterior perimeter of the
building on which the system is mounted or built.
         (d)   Solar energy systems shall be designed to blend into the
architecture of the building to the maximum extent practical. The color of the
solar collector is not required to be consistent with the roofing materials.
         (e)   Building-mounted systems, excluding building-integrated systems,
shall not cover more than 80% of the roof upon which the panels are mounted to
ensure ready roof access in the event of a fire or other safety occurrence
whereby roof access is needed.
         (f)   A conditional use permit is required for any solar installations
in the commercial district, subject to the conditions and criteria for review
in accordance with §
154.243.
      (3)   Free-standing solar energy systems.
         (a)   Free-standing solar energy systems, measured to the highest
point of the system, shall not exceed ten feet in height and shall meet double
the minimum setback requirements of an accessory structure as outlined in §
154.176, as measured from the outermost perimeter of the solar panel to the
property line. Free-standing solar energy systems are only permitted in rear
yards.
         (b)   In all residential districts, the area of the solar collector
surface of freestanding solar energy systems shall not exceed 3% of the lot
area. In all other districts, the area of the solar collector surface of free-
standing solar energy systems shall not exceed 5% of the lot area.
Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, the maximum area of solar
energy systems shall be calculated independently of the floor area of all other
accessory structures on the zoning lot.
         (c)   The supporting framework for freestanding solar energy systems
shall not include unfinished lumber.
      (4)   Lightpole-mounted solar energy systems. Any solar installation on a
light pole shall require the issuance of a conditional use permit, and shall
take into account the surrounding land uses, the proposed visual impact, and
the structural integrity relative to size and height of the proposed solar
installation. No lightpole-mounted solar installation shall exceed three square
feet in size.
   (C)   Design and performance standards. In addition to the standards
required above, the folio-wing standards shall apply to all solar energy
systems.
      (1)   Compatibility with nearby properties. The visual impact of rooftop
equipment on nearby properties shall be minimized through such means as
location on the roof, flushmounting to the roof, screening, or other
integration into the roof design. Screening shall be of durable permanent
materials that are compatible with the primary building materials. Screening
shall be done to the extent possible without reducing the system’s efficiency.
      (2)   Feeder lines. Any lines accompanying a solar energy systems, other
than those attached to on-site structures by leads, shall be buried within the
interior of the subject parcel, unless there are existing lines in the area
which the lines accompanying a solar energy system can be attached. The City
Manager or designee may grant exemptions to this requirement in instances where
shallow bedrock, water courses, or other elements of the natural landscape
interfere with the ability to bury lines.
      (3)   Maintenance. Solar energy systems shall be kept in good repair and

to buildings, trees, or other structures that would diminish solar access.
   (F)   Legal nonconformities. Solar energy systems in existence prior to
adoption of this section shall be permitted to exist and be repaired in their
current form. However, any changes, expansions, or upgrades in the solar energy
system that would require a building permit shall necessitate conformance with
this section.

or designee from time to time to conduct a review of all development plans for
any PUD.
   FINAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN. A final development plan based upon the preliminary
development plan and presented by a PUD applicant as provided in §
154.214(D), and including the requirements set forth in §
154.214(E).
   PRELIMINARY DEVELOPMENT PLAN. A formal development plan in preliminary form
presented by a PUD applicant as provided in §
154.214(C), and including the requirements set forth in §
154.214(E).
   PROPERTY. All land included within the PUD.
   PUD. A zoning district and development plan which may include single or
mixed uses, and one or more lots or parcels, and which is intended to create a
more flexible, creative, and efficient approach to the use of land. Any PUD
shall be subject to the procedures, standards, and regulations contained in
this subchapter. A PUD SITE must be at least three acres in size, and
applications for PUD approval will not be considered for sites of less than
three acres.
   PUD AGREEMENT. The agreement to be entered into between the developer and
the city to incorporate all term, requirements, and conditions of the PUD
approval.
   SKETCH PLAN. An informal development plan presented by a PUD applicant as
provided in §
154.214(B).
(Prior Code, § 152.201)
§ 154.207 AUTHORIZATION.
   A PUD approval may allow the following:
   (A)   Variety. Within a comprehensive site design concept, a mixture of land
uses, housing types, and densities;
   (B)   Sensitivity. Through the departure from the strict application of
required setbacks, yard areas, lot sizes, minimum house sizes, minimum
requirements, and other performance standards associated with traditional
zoning, a PUD can maximize the development potential of land while remaining
sensitive to its unique and valuable natural characteristics;
   (C)   Efficiency. The consolidation of areas for recreation and reductions
in street lengths and other utility-related expenses;
   (D)   Density transfer. The project density may be clustered, basing density
on a number of units per acre in place of specific lot dimensions; and
   (E)   District integration. The combination of uses which are allowed in
separate zoning districts such as:
      (1)   Mixed residential uses to allow both densities and unit types to be
varied within the project;
      (2)   Mixed residential uses with increased density based upon the
greater sensitivity of PUD projects to regulation; and
      (3)   Mixed land uses with the integration of compatible land uses within
the project.
(Prior Code, § 152.202)
§ 154.208 ALLOWED USES.
   Uses within a PUD may include only those uses generally considered
associated with the general land use category shown for the area on the
official Comprehensive Land Use Plan. However, in some unique situations, the
PUD may allow the approval of use or uses that are not listed as either
permitted or conditional uses in any underlying zoning district. The specific
allowed uses and performance standards for each PUD shall be delineated in an
ordinance and development plan. The PUD development plan shall identify all the
proposed land uses, which shall become permitted uses if the final development
plan is approved. Any change in the uses presented in the final development
plan will be considered an amendment to the PUD and must follow the procedures
specified in this subchapter.
(Prior Code, § 152.203)
§ 154.209 REQUIRED STANDARDS.
   The city shall consider a proposed PUD from the point of view of all
standards and purposes of the Comprehensive Land Use Plan to achieve a maximum
coordination between the proposed development and the surrounding uses, the
conservation of woodlands and wetlands, and the protection of health, safety,
and welfare of the community and residents of the PUD. To these ends, the City
Council shall consider the location of the buildings, compatibility, parking
areas, and other features with respect to the topography of the area and
existing natural features such as streams and large trees; the efficiency,
adequacy, and safety of the proposed layout of internal streets and driveways;
the adequacy and location of green areas; the adequacy, location, and screening
of parking areas; and any other matters as the City Council may find to have a
material bearing upon the stated standards and objectives of the Comprehensive
Land Use Plan.
(Prior Code, § 152.204)
§ 154.210 COORDINATION WITH SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS.
   If a PUD involves the subdivision of land, then the subdivision review shall
be carried out under Chapter 153 simultaneously with the review of the PUD. The
plans required under this subchapter shall be submitted in a form which will
satisfy the requirements of
Chapter 153 for the preliminary plat and final plat.
(Prior Code, § 152.205)
§ 154.211 REVISIONS AND/OR CHANGES.
   (A)   Minor changes in location, placement, and height. Minor changes in the
location, placement, and height of structures may be authorized by the
Development Review Committee if required by engineering or other circumstances
not foreseen at the time the final plan was approved and filed with the City
Manager or designee.
   (B)   Significant changes in use, location, size, and height. Changes in
uses, significant changes in location, size, or height of structures, any
rearrangement of lots, blocks, and building tracts, changes in provision of
common open spaces, and all other changes to the approved final development
plan may be made only after a public hearing conducted by the Planning
Commission. Upon determination by the Development Review Committee that a major
change has been proposed, the developer shall apply for an amended PUD. The
application to amend the PUD shall be treated as a new zoning application. Upon
acceptance of a complete application, the Planning Commission shall hold a
hearing as set forth in §§
30.45 through
30.48. Any changes shall be recorded as amendments to the recorded copy of the
final development plan.
   (C)   Provisions of original district apply. All of the provisions of the
zoning district within which the PUD is established shall apply to the amended
PUD except as otherwise provided in approval of the final development plan. The
effective date of the PUD shall be after:
      (1)   Approval of the PUD amendment and text and final development plan;
and
      (2)   Publication of the ordinance.
   (D)   Review. If substantial development has not occurred within a
reasonable time after approval of the PUD, the City Council may instruct the
Planning Commission to initiate rezoning to the original zoning district. It
shall not be necessary for the City Council to find that the rezoning was in
error.
   (E)   Formal review periods. Within the PUD agreement, the city may schedule
formal City Council review periods on an annual or less frequent basis to
ascertain that actual development on the site meets the conditions of the
approved PUD.
(Prior Code, § 152.206)
§ 154.212 PHASING AND GUARANTEE OF PERFORMANCE.
   (A)   Comparison with approved development schedule. The Planning Commission
shall compare the actual development accomplished in the various portions of
the PUD with the approved development schedule.
   (B)   Extension of limits of development schedule. Upon recommendation of
the Planning Commission and for good cause shown by the developer, the City
Council may extend the limits of the development schedule.
   (C)   Construction rates of dwelling and open space. The construction and
provision of all of the common open space and public and recreational
facilities which are shown on the final development plan must proceed at the
same rate as the construction of dwelling units, if any. The Development Review
Committee shall review all of the building permits issued for the PUD and
examine the construction which has taken place on the site. If they find that
the rate of construction of dwelling units is greater than the rate at which
common open spaces and public and recreational facilities have been constructed
and provided, they shall forward this information to the City Council for
action.
   (D)   Security. A letter of credit in form acceptable to the city shall be
required to guarantee performance by the developer. The amount of the letter of
credit and the specific elements of the development program that it is intended
to guarantee will be stipulated in the PUD agreement.
(Prior Code, § 152.207)
§ 154.213 CONTROL OF PUD FOLLOWING COMPLETION.
   (A)   Final development plan governs. After a certificate of occupancy has
been issued for all or any portion of a PUD, the use of the land covered by the
certificate of occupancy and the construction, modification, and alteration of
any buildings or structures within the PUD shall be governed by the final
development plan.
   (B)   Changes after issuance of certificate of occupancy. After a
certificate of occupancy has been issued for all or any portion of a PUD, no
changes shall be made in the approved final development plan except upon
application as provided below.
      (1)   Any minor extensions, alterations, or modifications of existing
buildings or structures may be authorized by the Development Review Committee
if they are consistent with the purposes and intent of the final development
plan. No change authorized by this section may increase the mass or volume of
any building or structure by more than 10%.
      (2)   Any building or structure that is totally or substantially
destroyed may be reconstructed only in compliance with the final development
plan unless an amendment to the final development plan is approved under this
subchapter.
      (3)   Changes in the use of the common open spaces may be authorized by
an amendment to the final development plan by the City Planning Commission
after a public hearing as provided in §§
30.45 through
30.48 and without all the documents necessary for the original application.
      (4)   Any other changes in the final development plan must be authorized
by an amendment of the final development plan under this subchapter.
(Prior Code, § 152.208)
§ 154.214 PROCEDURE FOR PROCESSING A PUD.
   (A)   Application conference. Upon filing of an application for a PUD, the
developer shall arrange for and attend a conference with the Development Review
Committee. The primary purpose of the conference shall be to provide the
developer with an opportunity to gather information and obtain guidance as to
the general suitability of developer’s proposal for the area for which it is
proposed and its conformity to the provisions of this subchapter before
incurring substantial expense in the preparation of plans, surveys, and other
data.
   (B)   Sketch plan. The sketch plan provides an opportunity for an applicant
to submit an informal plan to the city showing the applicant’s basic intent and
general nature of the development. The sketch plan is optional and is intended
to provide feedback from the Planning Commission before the applicant incurs
substantial cost in the preparation of formal plans. The sketch plan shall be
considered a partial, incomplete application prior to formal submittal of the
complete application and scheduling of hearings.
   (C)   Preliminary development plan. The purpose of a preliminary development
plan is to formally present a PUD application, and a preliminary plat
application if subdivision of land is a part of the PUD, in a public hearing
before the Planning Commission as set forth in §§
30.45 through
30.48. The plan shall include the following:
      (1)   Overall maximum PUD density range;
      (2)   General location of major streets and pedestrian ways;
      (3)   General location and extent of public and common and open space;
      (4)   General location of residential and nonresidential land uses with
approximate type of intensities of development;
      (5)   Staging and time schedule of development; and
      (6)   Other special criteria for development.
   (D)   Final development plan. Following approval of the preliminary
development plan, the applicant shall submit an application for the final
development plan, and a final plat if subdivision of land is a part of the PUD.
The application shall proceed and be acted upon in accordance with §
154.206 for zoning district changes. If appropriate, because of the limited
scale of the proposal, the Development Review Committee may permit the
preliminary development plan and final development plan to proceed through the
review and approval processes simultaneously.
   (E)   Procedures. The procedures to be followed by the applicant with
respect to a PUD, shall be as follows.
      (1)   Schedule.
         (a)   Developer shall meet with the Development Review Committee to
discuss the proposed developments.

assign an ordinance numerical reference to each final development plan and PUD
agreement text approved. The City Council may attach the additional conditions
as it deems reasonable. Approval shall require a four-fifths vote of the entire
City Council. After approval by the City Council, the PUD zoning ordinance map
amendment shall be published, with reference made to the PUD agreement text.
The developer shall be responsible for recording the ordinance and PUD
agreement in the office of the Hennepin or Ramsey County Recorder and/or
Registrar of Titles prior to issuance of any building permit or within 60 days,
whichever is less. The official PUD ordinance and PUD agreement shall also be

NONCONFORMING USES, STRUCTURES, AND LOTS
§ 154.225 INTENT FOR NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES.
   It is the intent of this subchapter to permit and recognize the existence of
nonconforming uses and structures which were lawful when established but which
no longer meet all ordinance requirements, as defined in §
154.003, to continue until they are removed, to encourage the elimination of
nonconformities or reduce their impact on adjacent properties, to discourage
the enlargement, expansion, intensification, or extension of nonconformities,
and to regulate the repair, replacement, restoration, and improvement of
nonconformities to prevent and abate nuisances, and to protect the public
health, safety, or welfare.
(Prior Code, § 152.220) (Ord. 2014-01, passed 4-8-2014)
§ 154.226 LIMITED CONTINUATION.
   Except as otherwise provided by law, any nonconformity, including a
nonconforming use or occupation of land or premises, may be continued,
including through repair, replacement, restoration, maintenance, or
improvement, but not including expansion, unless:
   (A)   Change to conforming use. The property used for a nonconforming use is
subsequently used for a conforming use;
   (B)   Discontinued use. The nonconformity or occupancy is discontinued for a
period of more than one year;
   (C)   Destruction of building. Any nonconforming use is destroyed by fire or
other peril to the extent of greater than 50% of the estimated market value, as
indicated by the records of the County Assessor at the time of damage, and no
building permit has been applied for within 180 days of when the property is
damaged; and
   (D)   Expansion. An expansion of any nonconformity use or structure may not
be done without first obtaining a variance pursuant to §
154.245.
(Prior Code, § 152.226) (Ord. 2011-05, passed 6-28-2011; Ord. 2014-01, passed
4-8-2014) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 154.227 INTENT FOR NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   It is the intent of this subchapter to permit nonconforming lots of record,
as defined in §
154.007, to continue to be used for the legal use for which it is zoned in
accordance with the criteria for continuance as specified in this code.
Nonconforming lots of record within the shoreland area must conform to the
provisions as outlined in M.S. § 462.357, Subd. 1e, as it may be amended from
time to time. A lawful conforming lot of record shall be deemed buildable,
without a variance. If a group of two or more undeveloped, vacant, and
contiguous lots under common ownership, any individual lot does not meet the
minimum dimensional requirements must be combined with the one or more
contiguous lots. All additions or expansion to a structure on a nonconforming
lot of record shall meet the setback, height, density, and other requirements
of the code. Any deviation from the requirements of the code may not be done
without first obtaining a variance pursuant to §
154.245.

   (B)   City Council approved. Variances to the dimensional provisions of the
Zoning Code may be granted by the City Council upon recommendation of the Board
of Adjustments and Appeals, after a hearing is held by the Board of Adjustments
and Appeals. Variances will not be granted with respect to uses. A majority
affirmative vote of City Councilmembers present is required to approve a
variance.
   (C)   Evidence. No variance will be granted unless the evidence presented
discloses all of the following facts.
      (1)   The subject matter of the application is within the scope of this
section.
      (2)   Strict enforcement would cause practical difficulties because:
         (a)   The property owner proposes to use the property in a reasonable
manner not permitted by the Zoning Code;
         (b)   The plight of the property owner is due to circumstances unique
to the property not created by the property owner;
         (c)   The variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character
of the locality; and
         (d)   Economic considerations alone are not the basis of the practical
difficulties.
      (3)   The variance, if granted, would be consistent with the city’s
Comprehensive Land Use Plan.
      (4)   The granting of the variance is in harmony with the general
purposes and intent of the Zoning Code.
   (D)   Planning Commission recommendation. The Planning Commission will
consider the application at a public hearing at any regular or special meeting.
Notice for the hearing will be given in accordance with §§
30.45 through
30.48. The Planning Commission, sitting as the Board of Adjustments and
Appeals, will make a recommendation to the City Council as follows:
      (1)   Recommend that the variance application be granted because the
evidence considered at the meeting supports each of the findings required under
division (C) above; and/or
      (2)   Recommend that the variance application be denied because the
applicant did not present sufficient evidence for the Planning Commission to
make all of the findings required under division (C) above.
   (E)   City Council consideration. After the minutes of the Planning
Commission meeting have been forwarded to the City Council, the City Council
will consider the application and recommendation of the Planning Commission.
Within 60 days after its first consideration, the City Council will by motion
grant or deny the application according to the provisions of division (C) above
and will make a record in the minutes stating its conclusions with respect to
each of the findings required under division (C) above.
   (F)   Expiration of variance. If a variance is granted but the building or
other structure permitted by the variance is not constructed within one year
from the date the variance is granted, the variance will expire and will be of
no further force or effect.

155.08. The Commission shall recommend approval, approval with conditions, or
denial. Following Planning Commission action, the plan shall be submitted to
the City Council at its next available meeting. City Council action on the plan
must be accomplished within 120 days following the date the application is
filed with the Public Works Director or designee.
   (B)   Duration. Approval of a plan shall expire one year after the date of
approval unless construction has commenced in accordance with the plan, unless
the applicant makes a written request to the Public Works Director or designee
for an extension of setting forth the reasons for it. The Public Works Director
or designee shall make a decision on the extension within 30 days. The Public
Works Director or designee may grant one extension of not more than 12 months.
Any plan may be revised in the same manner as originally approved.
   (C)   Conditions. A plan may be approved subject to conditions related to
the requirements of this chapter. The conditions may, among other matters,
limit the size, kind, or character of the proposed development, require the
construction of structures, drainage facilities, storage basins and other
facilities, require replacement of vegetation, establish required monitoring
procedures, stage the work over time, require alteration of the site design to
insure buffering, and require the conveyance to the city or other public entity
of certain lands or interests therein.
   (D)   Security. Prior to approval, the applicant shall execute an agreement
in form acceptable to the City Council to construct any required improvements,
to dedicate property or easements, and to comply with any required conditions.
The agreement must be accompanied by cash or a letter of credit in form and
amount determined by the City Council sufficient to secure performance of the
applicant’s obligations.
   (E)   Fees. All applications for plan approval shall be accompanied by a
processing and approval fee of $150.
(Prior Code, § 153.07)
§ 155.08 APPROVAL STANDARDS.
   (A)   Requirements. The standards contained in this chapter must be met to
the degree required by the City Council.
   (B)   Site dewatering. Water pumped from the site shall be treated by
temporary sedimentation basins, grit chambers, sand filters, upflow chambers,
hydro-calcines, swirl concentrators, or other controls as appropriate. Water
may not be discharged in a manner that causes erosion or flooding of the site
or receiving channels, or a wetland.
   (C)   Waste and material disposal. All waste and unused building materials
(including garbage, rubbish, debris, cleaning wastes, waste water, toxic
materials, or hazardous materials) shall be properly disposed of off-site and
not allowed to be carried by runoff into a receiving channel or storm sewer
system.
   (D)   Tracking. Each site shall have graveled roads, access drives, and
parking areas of sufficient width and length to prevent sediment from being
tracked onto public or private roadways. Any sediment reaching a public or
private road shall be removed by street cleaning (not flushing) before the end
of each workday.
   (E)   Drain inlet protection. All storm drain inlets shall be protected
during construction until control measures are in place with a straw bale, silt
fence, or equivalent barrier meeting accepted design criteria, standards, and
specifications contained in the state’s Pollution Control Agency publication
Protecting Water Quality in Urban Areas.
   (F)   Site erosion control. The requirements of this division (F) apply only
to construction activities that result in runoff leaving the site.
      (1)   Channelized runoff from adjacent areas passing through the site
shall be diverted around disturbed areas, if practical. Otherwise, the channel
shall be protected as described below. Sheetflow runoff from adjacent areas
greater than 10,000 square feet in area shall also be diverted around disturbed
areas, unless shown to have resultant runoff velocity of less than one-half
foot per second across the disturbed area for the one-year storm. Diverted
runoff shall be conveyed in a manner that will not erode the conveyance and
receiving channels.
      (2)   All activities on the site shall be conducted in a logical sequence
to minimize the area of bare soil exposed at any one time.
      (3)   Runoff from the entire disturbed area on the site shall be
controlled by meeting either divisions (F)(3)(a) and (F)(3)(b) below or
divisions (F)(3)(a) and (F)(3)(c) below.
         (a)   All disturbed ground left inactive for 14 or more days shall be
stabilized by seeding or sodding (only available prior to September 15) or by
mulching, or covering, or other equivalent control measure.
         (b)   For sites with more than three acres disturbed at one time, or
if a channel originates in the disturbed area, one or more temporary or
permanent sedimentation basins shall be constructed. Each sedimentation basin
shall have a surface area of at least 1% of the area draining to the basin and
at least three feet of depth and constructed in accordance with accepted design
specifications. Sediment shall be removed to maintain a depth of three feet.
The basin discharge rate shall also be sufficiently low as to not cause erosion
along the discharge channel or the receiving water.
         (c)   For sites with less than ten acres disturbed at one time, silt
fences, straw bales, or equivalent control measure shall be placed along all
side slope and downslope sides of the site. If a channel or area of
concentrated runoff passes through the site, silt fences shall be placed along
the channel edges to reduce sediment reaching the channel. The use of silt
fences, straw bales, or equivalent control measure must include a maintenance
and inspection schedule.
      (4)   If remaining for more than seven days, they shall be stabilized by
mulching, vegetative cover, tarps, or other means. Erosion from piles which
will be in existence for less than seven days shall be controlled by placing
straw bales or silt fence barriers around the pile. In-street utility repair or
construction soil or dirt storage piles located closer than 25 feet of a
roadway or drainage channel must be covered with tarps or suitable alternative
control, if exposed for more than seven days, and the storm drain inlets must
be protected with straw bale or other appropriate filtering barriers.
   (G)   Storm water management criteria for permanent facilities. Storm water
management criteria for permanent facilities shall be in conformance with the
city’s current Comprehensive Water Resource Management Plan.
   (H)   Design standards. Storm water detention facilities constructed in the
city shall be designed in conformance with the city’s current Comprehensive
Water Resource Management Plan.
   (I)   Wetlands. Wetlands shall be maintained and protected in conformance
with the city’s current Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plan,
   (J)   Steep slopes. No land disturbing or development activities shall be
allowed on slopes of 18% or more.
   (K)   Catch basins. When deemed necessary by the Public Works Director or
designee, all newly installed and rehabilitated catch basins shall be provided
with a sump area for the collection of coarse-grained material. The basins
shall be cleaned when they are half filled with material.
   (L)   Drain leaders. When deemed necessary by the Public Works Director or
designee, all newly constructed and reconstructed buildings will route drain
leaders to pervious areas wherein the runoff can be allowed to infiltrate. The
flow rate of water exiting the leaders shall be controlled so no erosion occurs
in the previous areas.
   (M)   Inspection and maintenance. All storm water management facilities
shall be designed to minimize the need of maintenance, to provide access for
maintenance purposes and to be structurally sound. All storm water management
facilities be inspected and maintained in accordance with the city’s
Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plan. It shall be the responsibility of
the applicant to obtain any necessary easements or other property interests
allow access to the storm water management facilities for inspection
maintenance purposes.
   (N)   Models/methodologies/computations. Hydrologic models and design
methodologies used for the determination of runoff and analysis of storm water
management structures shall be approved by the Public Works Director or
designee. Plans, specifications, and computations for storm water management
facilities submitted for review shall be sealed and signed by a registered
professional engineer. All computations shall appear on the plans submitted for
review, unless otherwise approved by the Public Works Director or designee.
   (O)   Watershed management plans/ground water management plans. Plans shall
be consistent with adopted watershed management plans and ground water
management plans prepared in accordance with M.S. §§ 103B.231 and 103B.255, as
they may be amended from time to time, respectively, and as approved by the
State Board of Water and Soil Resources in accordance with the state law.
   (P)   Easements. If a plan involves direction of some or all runoff off of
the site, it shall be the responsibility of the applicant to obtain from
adjacent property owners any necessary easements or other property interests
concerning flowage of water.
   (Q)   Lawn maintenance education. The city shall participate in on-going
educational opportunities to inform the residents of the harmful impacts.

AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   STRUCTURE. For floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building,
including gas or liquid storage tanks, that is principally above ground. The
term includes recreational vehicles and travel trailers on site for more than
180 days.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of the
structure either, before the improvement or repair is started, or if the
structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred.
For the purposes of this definition, SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT is considered to
occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other
structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration
affects the external dimensions of the structure regardless of the actual work
performed. The term does not, however, include either any project for
improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health,
sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure
safe living conditions or any alteration of a “historic structure,” provided
that the alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as
a historic structure.
(Prior Code, § 154.09)
§ 156.10 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTION.
   This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing
easements, covenants, or deed restriction. However, where this chapter and
other ordinances, easements, covenants, or deed restrictions conflict or
overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 157.01 TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known as the “sign ordinance.”
(Prior Code, § 155.01)
§ 157.02 FINDINGS, PURPOSE, AND EFFECT.
   (A)   Findings. The City Council hereby finds as follows:
      (1)   Exterior signs have a substantial impact on the character and
quality of the environment;
      (2)   Signs provide an important medium through which individuals may
convey a variety of messages;
      (3)   Signs can create traffic hazards, aesthetic concerns, and
detriments to property values, thereby threatening the public health, safety,
and welfare;
      (4)   The city’s code of ordinances have, since as early as 1983,
established standards which would permit businesses in the city a reasonable
and equitable opportunity to identify themselves. The regulation of signs is an
effort to provide adequate means of expression and to promote the economic
viability of the business community;
      (5)   To preserve and promote civic beauty and protect the city and its
citizens from a proliferation of signs of a type, size, location, and character
that would adversely impact upon the aesthetics of the community and threaten
the health, safety, and welfare of the community; and
      (6)   To preserve and protect the value of land and buildings, and to
preserve and protect landscapes.
   (B)   Purpose and intent. It is not the purpose or intent of this chapter to
regulate the message displayed on any sign; nor is it the purpose or intent of
this chapter to regulate any building design or any display not defined as a
sign, or any sign which cannot be viewed from outside a building. The purpose
and intent of this chapter is to:
      (1)   Regulate the number, location, size, type, illumination, and other
physical characteristics of signs within the city in order to promote the
public health, safety, and welfare;
      (2)   Maintain, enhance, and improve the aesthetic environment of the
city by preventing visual clutter that is harmful to the appearance of the
community;
      (3)   Improve the visual appearance of the city while providing for
effective means of communication, consistent with constitutional guarantees and
the city’s goals of public safety and aesthetics; and
      (4)   Provide for fair and consistent enforcement of the sign regulations
set forth herein under the zoning authority of the city.
   (C)   Effect. A sign may be erected, mounted, displayed, or maintained in
the city if it is in conformance with the provisions of these regulations. The
effect of this sign chapter, as more specifically set forth herein, is to:
      (1)   Allow a wide variety of sign types in commercial zones, and a more
limited variety of signs in other zoning districts, subject to the standards
set forth in this sign chapter;
      (2)   Allow certain small, unobtrusive signs incidental to the principal
use of a site in all zoning districts when in compliance with the requirements
of this sign chapter;
      (3)   Prohibit signs whose location, size, type, illumination, or other
physical characteristics negatively affect the environment and where the
communication can be accomplished by means having a lesser impact on the
environment and the public health, safety, and welfare; and
      (4)   Provide for the enforcement of the provisions of this sign chapter.

10.99
§ 157.24 DYNAMIC DISPLAYS.
   (A)   Findings.
      (1)   Studies show that there is a correlation between dynamic displays
on signs and the distraction of roadway drivers. Distraction can lead to
traffic accidents. Drivers can be distracted not only by a changing message,
but also by knowing that the sign has a changing message. Drivers may watch a
sign waiting for the next change to occur. Additionally, drivers are more
distracted by special effects used to change the message, such as fade-ins and
fade-outs. Time and temperature signs appear to be an exception to these
concerns because the messages are short, easily absorbed, and become inaccurate
without frequent changes.
      (2)   Despite these public safety concerns, there is merit to allowing
new technologies to easily update messages. Except as prohibited by state or
federal law, sign owners should have the opportunity to use these technologies
with certain restrictions. The restrictions are intended to minimize potential
driver distraction and to minimize proliferation in residential districts where
signs can adversely impact residential character.
      (3)   Spacing requirements enforced by this code could interfere with the
equal opportunity to use such technologies and are not included. Without those
requirements, however, there is the potential for multiple dynamic displays to
exist along a corridor. If more than one dynamic display can be seen from a
given location on a corridor, the minimum display time becomes critical. If the
display time is too short, a driver could be subjected to a view that appears
to have constant movement. This impact would be compounded in a corridor with
multiple signs. If dynamic displays become pervasive and there are no
meaningful limitations on each sign’s ability to change frequently, drivers may
be subjected to an unsafe degree of distraction and sensory overload.
Therefore, a longer display time is appropriate.
      (4)   Additionally, a constant message is typically needed on a sign so
that the public can use it to identify and find an intended destination.
Changing messages detract from this way-finding purpose and could adversely
affect driving conduct through last-second lane changes, stops, or turns, which
could result in traffic accidents. Accordingly, dynamic displays generally
should not be allowed to occupy the entire copy and graphic area of a sign.
      (5)   The city finds that dynamic displays should be allowed on signs but
with significant controls to minimize their proliferation and their potential
threats to public safety.
   (B)   Permitted signs. Dynamic displays are not outright permitted within
any zoning district within the City.
   (C)   Conditionally permitted signs. Dynamic displays are conditionally
permitted solely as free- standing ground signs with the issuance of a
conditional use permit from the City Council only in the R-1 Single-Family
Residential District to display non-commercial or public service announcements
when displayed on the site of an approved public or quasi-public land use, the
C Commercial, I Industrial, and R/O Recreation/Open Space Districts. Dynamic
display signs shall comply with the height, size, arrangement, setback,
location, and other applicable provisions of this chapter and the district in
which the sign is located. The conditions with respect to the issuance of any
conditional use permit for a dynamic display sign shall cover at least the
following:
      (1)   Aesthetics of the sign, including, but not limited to, message
color, construction materials, and landscaping;
      (2)   Location of the sign with regard to the surrounding area; and
      (3)   Position/layout of the sign with regard to the surrounding area.
   (D)   Size of display. Dynamic displays may occupy no more than 35% of the
actual copy and graphic area allowed by the zoning district for which it is
located in. The remainder of the sign must not have the capability to have
dynamic displays even if not used. Only one contiguous dynamic display area is
allowed on a sign face. Additionally, the remainder of the sign must not have
the capability to have a readerboard sign as defined herein.
   (E)   Size of copy. Every line of copy and graphics in a dynamic display
must be at least seven inches in height on a road with a speed limit of 25 to
34 mph, nine inches on a road with a speed limit of 35 to 44 hour, 12 inches on
a road with a speed limit of 45 to 54 mph, and 15 inches on a road with a speed
limit of 55 miles per hour or more. If there is insufficient room for copy and
graphics of this size in the area allowed under division (D) above, then no
dynamic display is allowed.
   (F)   Duration of image. The images and messages displayed on a dynamic
display sign must be static. A dynamic display’s image, or any portion thereof,
may not change more often than once every eight seconds in R/O and R-
1 Districts, except one for which changes are necessary to correct hour-and-
minute, date, or temperature information. Due to the increased quantity and
distance between signs, a dynamic display’s image, or any portion thereof, may
not change more often than once every five minutes in C and LI Districts,
except one for which changes are necessary to correct hour-and-minute, date, or
temperature information.
   (G)   Transition. If a dynamic display’s image or any portion thereof
changes, the change sequence must be instantaneous without any special effects.
   (H)   Message. The images and messages displayed must be complete in
themselves, without continuation in content to the next image or message or to
any other sign.
   (I)   Color. The matrix elements of the display shall be monochromatic in
color with a solid black background.
   (J)   Sign construction and maintenance.
      (1)   All permanent free-standing ground signs shall have self-supporting
structures erected on and permanently attached to concrete foundations. The
base of dynamic display signs must maximize the use of natural materials, such
as stone, brick, rock, or similar decorative material, in construction and
should conform to the material design of the principal structure.
      (2)   All signs shall be maintained in a safe, presentable, and good
structural condition at all times, including the replacement of defective
parts, cleaning and other items required for maintenance of the sign.
Vegetation around, in front of, behind, and underneath the base of ground signs
for a distance of at least ten feet shall be neatly trimmed and free of weeds,
and no rubbish or debris that would constitute a fire or health hazard shall be
permitted under or near the sign.
   (K)   Prohibition on video display. No portion of a dynamic display may
change any part of its sign face by a method of display characterized by motion
or pictorial imagery, or depict action or a special effect to imitate movement,
or display pictorials or graphics in a progression of frames that gives the
illusion of motion of any kind.
   (L)   Prohibition on fluctuating or flashing illumination. No portion of a
dynamic display image may fluctuate in light intensity or use intermittent,
strobe or moving light, or light that changes in intensity in sudden transitory
bursts, streams, zooms, twinkles, sparkles, or in any other manner that creates
the illusion of movements.
   (M)   Audio. Dynamic displays shall not be equipped with audio speakers.
   (N)   Malfunctions. Dynamic displays must be designed and equipped to freeze
the sign face in one position if a malfunction occurs. Dynamic displays must
also be equipped with a means to immediately discontinue the display if it
malfunctions, and the sign owner or operator must immediately turn off the
display when notified by the city that it is not complying with the standards
of this chapter.
   (O)   Brightness. All dynamic displays shall meet the following brightness
standards.
      (1)   No dynamic display may exceed a maximum illumination of 4,500 nits
(candelas per square meter) during daylight hours and a maximum illumination of
450 nits (candelas per square meter) between dusk to dawn as measured from the
sign’s face at maximum brightness.
      (2)   All dynamic displays having illumination by means other than
natural light must be equipped with a dimmer control or other mechanism that
automatically controls the sign’s brightness to comply with the requirements of
this section.
      (3)   No dynamic display may be of such intensity or brilliance that it
interferes with the effectiveness of an official traffic sign, device, or
signal.
      (4)   The owner or controller of the dynamic display must adjust the sign
to meet these brightness standards in accordance with the city’s instructions.
The adjustment must be made immediately upon notice of noncompliance from the
city.
      (5)   A written certification from the sign manufacturer that light
intensity has been preset to conform to the brightness levels established by
the city’s code and that the preset level is protected from end user
manipulation by password protected software or other method. This would offer
the advantage of ensuring that electronic signs at a minimum cannot exceed the
standards. The sign manufacturer must submit this certification at the time of
sign permit issuance that the sign has the mechanical capabilities to control
luminance at the levels noted in division (O)(1) above.
   (P)   Nonconforming signs. Dynamic display signs existing on January 1, 2015
must comply with the operational standards listed herein. An existing dynamic
display sign that does not meet the structural requirements as outlined in
divisions (B) and (C) above may continue as a nonconforming development. An
existing dynamic display sign that cannot meet the minimum size requirements in
division (E) above must use the largest size possible for one line of copy to
fit in the available space.
   (Q)   Prohibited signs. Dynamic display signs shall not be used to display a
listing of tenant names, nor can they create distractions which are detrimental
to the public health, welfare, and safety as determined by the City Manager or
designee.

a way which makes the sign less in compliance with this chapter than it was
before the alteration;
      (2)   The sign is relocated to a position making it less in compliance
with this chapter than it was before the relocation;
      (3)   The sign is replaced; or
      (4)   Any new primary sign is constructed or placed in connection with
the enterprise using the legal nonconforming sign.
(Prior Code, § 155.33) (Ord. 08-002, passed 4-22-2008)
§ 157.29 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   If a sign is in violation of this chapter, or is in danger of falling,
or is otherwise a menace to the safety of persons or property, the City Manager
or designee may give to the owner of the property on which the sign is located,
written notice specifying the violation, ordering the cessation to the
violation and requiring either the removal of the sign or remedial work in the
time and manner specified in the notice.
   (B)   In the event of failure to comply with the notice within 30 days, the
City Manager or designee may remove the sign or cause such remedial work to be
done.
   (C)   The cost of the work performed by the city must be paid to the city by
the owner of the property on which the sign is located. If payment is not made
within 30 days after a statement for such costs is sent to the owner, the costs
may be assessed against the property by certifying the costs to the County
Treasurer for collection in the same manner as real estate taxes.
   (D)   If a sign which has been removed is not reclaimed and costs paid
within 30 days after its removal, the sign may be sold or otherwise disposed of
by the city.
   (E)   If a sign is found to be an immediate danger to the public because of
its unsafe condition, it may be removed without notice, and written notice of
removal and reasons for the removal will be given to the property owner of the
property on which the sign is located as soon as possible.
(Prior Code, § 155.34) (Ord. 08-002, passed 4-22-2008)
§ 157.30 TEMPORARY SIGNS.
   (A)   All temporary signs shall require a permit under this section.

signs, except where this section specifically provides otherwise.
   (B)   Temporary sign permits may be issued by the Zoning Administrator for
use only within commercial, light industrial, Planned Unit Development (PUD),
and Recreation/Open Space (R/OS) zones.
   (C)   Temporary signs and sign structures shall be constructed of durable
all-weather materials, such as, but not limited to, steel, coreaplast plastic
foam-core, alumacore, polycarbonate (Lexan), vinyl, and nylon.
   (D)   Every temporary sign permitted under the section shall be placed
entirely on the property of the principal business use which it is identifying.
   (E)   No more than two temporary signs, obtained by a single permit,
advertising the same business or entity shall be upon any single property at
the same time.
   (F)   The surface area of all temporary sign(s) issued under a single permit
shall not exceed 32 square feet of surface area, measuring one side of each
two-sided sign. This area shall be in addition to permanent, window, or other
signage allowed elsewhere in this section.
   (G)   No temporary sign, if freestanding, shall be greater than eight feet
in height, measured from the natural grade at the base of the sign to the top
of any component of the sign or sign structure.
   (H)   During any calendar year, temporary signs may be in place no more than
30 consecutive days, and through the issuance of a maximum of three permits
issued, temporary signs may be displayed for a total not exceeding 90 days per
calendar.
   (I)   Temporary signs shall be set back a minimum often feet from a property
line and in no case shall be placed closer than 15 feet from any roadway.
   (J)   In addition to the permit time allowances in this section, a property
that has a newly established business may display one temporary sign for 30
days leading up to and/or following the opening date. A property that has a
business that is going out of business may display a temporary sign for 30 days
