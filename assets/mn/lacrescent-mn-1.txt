   Example: (M.S. §609.034) (Ord. 10, passed 1-17-80; Am. Ord. 20, passed 1-1-
85)
      (2)   If a statutory cite is set forth as a “statutory reference”
following the text of the section, this indicates that the reader should refer
to that statute for further information.
   Example:
   § 39.01 PUBLIC RECORDS AVAILABLE.

   Statutory reference:
      For provisions concerning the inspection of public records, see M.S.
§§138.163 et seq.
   (C)   If a section of this code is derived from the previous code of
ordinances of the city, as published and subsequently amended, the prior code
section number shall be indicated in the history.
   Example:   (Prior Code, §3.20)
§ 10.98 ADMINISTRATIVE CITATIONS.
   (A)   Purpose. Administrative offense procedures established pursuant to
this section are intended to provide the public and the city with an informal,
cost effective and expeditious alternative to traditional, primarily petty
misdemeanor criminal charges for violations of certain statutes, ordinances and
of other city regulation. The procedures are intended to be voluntary on the
part of those who have been charged with administrative offenses. At any time
prior to the payment of the administrative penalty as provided on the
administrative citation, the person charged may withdraw from participation in
the procedures, in which event the city may bring criminal charges in
accordance with the law consistent with the facts involved underlying the
administrative citation. Likewise, the city may, without issuing an
administrative citation, bring the appropriate criminal charges initially. In
the event a party participates in the administrative offense procedures, but
does not pay the monetary penalty specified on the administrative citation, the
city may recover the costs entailed as part of a criminal disposition should
the party charged be eventually adjudicated guilty.
   (B)   Offenses. An administrative offense is a violation of a provision of
the city code, city ordinance or state law and is subject to the administrative
penalties set forth in the schedule of offenses and penalties and as noted on
the administrative citation, as periodically set by the City Council by
resolution duly enacted. No penalty, as scheduled for administrative offenses,
shall exceed $100 for any offense. An administrative offense, a petty
misdemeanor, is not a crime. When used for traffic offenses, it is the policy
of the Police Department to issue administrative citations for petty
misdemeanors only. Administrative citations shall not be used in cases
involving personal injury, property damage, or where litigation is pending.
   (C)   Procedure. Officers of the Police Department will be issued separate
citation (ticket books) for issuing administrative citations. The citation form
shall include necessary space for all pertinent vehicle information, driver
information, month, date and time of the violation, ordinance or other
regulation number, and the officer's signature and badge number.
   (D)   Issuing administrative citations. At the time of a traffic stop or
during initial contact by an officer, violators may be given the option of
receiving an administrative citation or the citation the officer would
otherwise issue (non-administrative citation) where issuance of administrative
citation is not an option. Violators continue to enjoy the presumption of
innocence, hence may seek judicial determination by not remitting the amount
specified on the face of an administrative citation and as directed thereon. If
the officer ascertains in the initial contact with a violator of the violator's
intention to plead not guilty, the officer would issue a non-administrative
citation. The administrative citation shall disclose on the face thereof the
local ordinance number, statute or other regulation citation violated and the
issuing officer shall prepare and place on file brief incident report for each
administrative citation issued.
   (E)   Payment of administrative citations. When issuing the administrative
citation, the payment due date shall be written on the citation, affording the
violator seven days to pay the specified penalty at the City Clerk's office or
other designated depository. Although payment constitutes admission of the
violation, the violation shall not appear anywhere on the violator's driving or
criminal history record. Failure to pay the administrative penalty on or before
the date specified on the citation will result in it being processed in the
same manner as a non-administrative citation. Upon issuance of the misdemeanor
or petty misdemeanor charge, (non-administrative citation) the administrative
offense procedure shall not be initiated or if it is initiated shall thereupon
terminate. In instances where the administrative citation amount has been paid
and a non-administrative citation issues, the violator may disclose to the
Houston County Court Administrator the fact of the payment evidenced by receipt
thereof. The Prosecuting City Attorney to make the final dispositional decision
in such cases.
   (F)   Processing administrative citations. The City Clerk's office shall
receive a copy of all administrative citations issued, to enable effective
administrative record thereof and to account for payments received for
administrative citations. Receipts will be issued for all payments received.
All proceeds received and data collected pertaining to payment of an
administrative penalty shall be maintained by the City Clerk's office. All
penalties collected pursuant to this section shall be paid to the City of La
Crescent and deposited to the city's general fund. Each administrative citation
will be classified as paid, unpaid or void. If a citation is dismissed or
voided for any reason, it must be marked and filed as such and forwarded to the
Chief of Police. All data collected and generated from the issuance of
administrative citations shall be filed and maintained by the Police
Department.
(Ord. 442, passed 6-9-08)
§ 10.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person, firm, or corporation who violates any provision of this
code for which another penalty is not specifically provided shall, upon
conviction, be subject to a fine of no less than $35, but not to exceed $300/
$1,000, imprisonment for a term not exceeding 90 days, or both. In either case,
the costs of prosecution may be added. A separate offense shall be deemed
committed upon each day during which a violation occurs or continues.
   (B)   When the code makes a violation a petty misdemeanor, the violator
shall be subject to a fine of no less than $15, but not to exceed $300/$1,000.
   (C)   The failure of any officer or employee of the city to perform any
official duty imposed by this code shall not subject the officer or employee to
the penalty imposed for a violation unless a penalty is specifically provided
for such failure.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 50.01 REFUSE COLLECTION LICENSES.
   (A)   Applications. Applications for refuse collection licenses shall be
made on forms prescribed by the City Council, which forms shall set forth
information concerning and evidencing applicant's having required bond and
insurance coverage and suitable and adequate equipment to perform the service
contemplated by licensing, as required by this and other applicable sections of
this code. Such application forms may, in the discretion of the Council
expressed by resolution duly passed, require statement of proposed rate
structure, which, if the applicant is issued a license, shall be the rates
chargeable for garbage collection by such licensee during the duration of such
license.
   (B)   Council review of applications. To enable the City Council opportunity
for review rates and other aspects of license applications, the Council may by
resolution prescribe a period of time from the date application is filed with
the City Administrator to study proposed rate structure and the application
generally with particular regard to the ability to perform services
contemplated by licensing. The Council may, by resolution, order public hearing
to consider rates and other aspects of applications. The Council may, by
resolution, require an applicant to submit customer lists to indicate
justification for issuing additional license or licenses. The Council, in
reviewing licensing applications, shall, among other things, consider the
ability of the applicant to perform the services contemplated by licensing,
taking into account the number of licensees which can effectively, yet
renumeratively, collect refuse in the city and whether or not the rate
structure is adequately compensatory.
   (C)   Fees. All license applicants shall submit with application requisite
fee as established from time to time by the City Council. In the event the
Council orders a public hearing, as authorized in division (B) of this section,
a part of the fee as may be specified from time to time by the City Council
shall be designated to defray the expense thereof including the charges of
publication of notice of public hearing, the remaining basic fee to be regarded
as the annual license fee. In the event no public hearing is ordered, that part
of the basic fee otherwise designated to defray the expense of public hearing
shall be refunded to the applicant licensed. All fees tendered by applicants
not granted licenses shall be refunded to applicants except where rejection of
the application resulted after a public hearing, in which case the part of the
tendered fee allocable to the public hearing expense shall not be refunded. In
all cases where a public hearing is scheduled, there will be one publication as
to the notice thereof in the official newspaper of the city, which publication
shall be made at least ten days before the appointed time for such hearing. The
foregoing provisions notwithstanding, existing licenses may be renewed
automatically by payment of the annual license fee until the Council, by
resolution at least 60 days prior to renewal date, orders a public hearing be
held on such renewal or unless the Council intends not to renew a given license
pursuant to this chapter.
   (D)   Prorating and refunding fees. The Council is hereby authorized to
prorate license fees enabling the licensing of refuse collectors at any time
during the normal license year period, but no part of a license fee once paid
shall be refunded except as may be authorized by Council resolution.
   (E)   Revocation. Any and all licenses are subject to suspension or
revocation at any time for violation of any provisions of this section or
violations of laws of the state, the rules, regulations, provisions, conditions
and restrictions of all public state agencies or any other applicable law.
   (F)   Insurance and bonding. Each applicant shall provide public liability
insurance, holding the city absolutely harmless on account of any claims
whatsoever arising out of refuse collection services in the maximum sum of
$1,000,000 and shall file with the City Administrator a bond in the penal sum
of $5,000 running to the city to assure performance of the services
contemplated by issuance of the license.
   (G)   Liability. All licensees shall be independent contractors and any and
all agents and employees thereof shall be their agents and employees and not
agents or employees of the city.
   (H)   Billing.
      (1)   Licensees shall collect all service charges. In the event refuse is
not collected from any residents or other property in the city for reason of
non-payment of service charges made pursuant to the licensee's Council approved
rates, the licensee shall forthwith notify the City Administrator and, upon
authorization by Council resolution, the refuse shall be picked up by licensee
and the cost thereof paid by the city, which cost shall be certified to the
County Auditor before October 10 of any given year and assessed to the real
estate parcel to which pickup expenses relate, to be collected with the real
estate taxes payable in the next succeeding year pursuant to M.S. §443.29.
      (2)   The rate payable for refuse collection services for purposes of
this section shall be in accordance with the schedule as established from time
to time by the City Council, together with the actual administrative and legal
expenses incurred in certifying the charges for collection pursuant to the
statute.
      (3)   Whether or not the City Council invokes the provisions of this
section in a given case is completely discretionary with the City Council, and
the invoking for the provisions of this section shall not prevent criminal
prosecution for violations of any provisions of this section.
(Prior Code, § 9.04)
Penalty, see § 50.99
§ 50.02 COLLECTION BY CITY OF FEES FOR REFUSE PICKUP.
   Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the City Council from instituting a
program whereby it contracts itself for the pickup of the refuse of its
residents and business firms. This section shall authorize the City Council, by
resolution duly enacted, to engage in the billing and collection for the
rendition of such services, regardless of who renders the service.
(Prior Code, § 9.05)
§ 50.03 HOUSEHOLD SOLID WASTE BAG DISTRIBUTION SITE LICENSING.
   (A)   Required. All locations in the city where garbage bags are distributed
and made available to residents in connection with and a part of the
implementation of the solid waste pickup and disposal program in the city
shall, from and after the effective date of this section and code provisions
embodying the provisions of this section, be required to be licensed by the
city.
   (B)   Licenses issued by City Clerk. Licenses for the distribution of
garbage bags for use in the city shall be obtained at the office of the City
Clerk, City Hall, La Crescent, MN 55947, at which office applicants for
licenses may obtain the necessary application from which shall be completed and
signed by or on behalf of the potential licensee prerequisite to the issuance
of a license.
   (C)   City Council to establish fee schedule. At the outset, no fee shall be
charged for the issuance of licenses for garbage bag distribution sites, but
the City Council may, from time to time, by resolution duly enacted, establish
a fee schedule therefor.
   (D)   Licensees to be bonded. In connection with the issuance of each
license and preliminary to the licensee commencing the condition of services
entailed in the distribution of garbage bags to residents and other sources of
solid waste appropriate for garbage bags under the city solid waste pickup and
disposal program, the licensee shall be bonded in the minimum penal sum of
$5,000 and each license applicant shall provide the necessary information and
execute whatever application forms are necessary in connection with the bonding
process.

Penalty, see § 50.99
§ 50.04 CITY COMPOST SITE REGULATION.

regulations of the city landfill set forth in division (B) of this section is
deemed a trespass and subject to prosecution and penalties consistent with the
laws of the state for misdemeanors.
   (B)   With regard to the control of the “city compost site,” the following
policy and procedure shall apply:
      (1)   The old city compost site is being operated as a site for disposal

Department of Natural Resources and Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, pollute
the surrounding wetlands.

(Prior Code, §11.041)
§ 51.02 SANITARY SEWER AND WATER SERVICE CONNECTION; MANDATORY CONNECTION.
   (A)   Findings. The City Council finds:
      (1)   It is in the best interests of public health, safety, and welfare,
including but not limited to the protection of water quality for the health and
safety of residents within the city, that properties within the city are served
by and connect to city sanitary sewer and water service facilities;
      (2)   It is in the best interests of the city and its inhabitants that
the cost of development and construction of sanitary sewer and water service
facilities should be borne by the owner of the property which is served, and
not the general taxpayers of the city; and
      (3)   It is in the best interests of the city and its inhabitants that
sanitary sewer and water service connection and availability charges vary in
amount depending on the factors set forth in this section.
   (B)   Purpose. The purpose of the connection and availability charges
established herein is as follows:
      (1)   To ensure that the city obtains sufficient funds to pay the cost of
development and construction of sanitary sewer and water service facilities
from the owners of the properties served;
      (2)   To equitably apportion the cost of development and construction of
sanitary sewer and water service facilities among the owners of the properties
served; and
      (3)   To reimburse the city for the cost of making and supervising
connection of properties to sanitary sewer and water service facilities.
   (C)   Connection charges. Pursuant to M.S. § 444.075, connection charges, in
amounts to be established by resolution of the City Council from time to time,
are hereby established to apply to any parcel of land within the city which
hereafter is either connected to city sanitary sewer and/or water service
facilities or required to connect to such facilities pursuant to city
regulation. The City Council may establish by resolution one or more connection
charges to apply equitably to developments, circumstances, and areas of the
city. Connection charge amounts may be based upon any or all of the following
factors and any such other as may be promulgated by city:
      (1)   The cost of making and supervising the connection to the
facilities;
      (2)   The cost of development and construction of new or enlarged
facilities to extend service coverage within the city;
      (3)   The cost of enlarging the capacity of the facilities in
anticipation of future residential or commercial development, which cost may be
included, without limitation, in connection charges applied to new developments
regardless of whether the specific development was planned or under
construction at the time the cost of enlarging the facilities’ capacity was
incurred; and
      (4)   Any other costs associated with providing sanitary sewer and/or
water service facilities to properties within the city and either allowed or
not prohibited by applicable law, including but not limited to costs of
construction, reconstruction, repair, enlargement, and improvement of such
facilities.
   (D)   Mandatory connection: when connection is required. The owners of all
structures discharging wastewater and located within 200 feet of the city
sanitary sewer service facilities shall be required, at each owner’s expense,
to install a suitable connection line to the city sanitary sewer. The deadline
for connection may be determined by resolution of the City Council for a
particular project or area of the city, and may include such conditions as the
City Council deems appropriate. If no deadline has been determined by
resolution, the connection shall be completed either within 90 days after the
city sanitary sewer has become operational in cases where the sanitary sewer
service has been extended to within 200 feet of existing structures, or
immediately in cases where new structures are constructed within 200 feet of
existing sanitary sewer service facilities. In the event that any owner fails
to complete the connection to the city sanitary sewer by the applicable
deadline, the city shall have the right to enter onto the subject property,
complete the connection, and all costs entailed with the connection shall be
added to the connection charge amount for the property.
   (E)   Unpaid charges.
      (1)   Due date; delinquent charges. Connection charges and availability
charges shall be due and payable within 60 days after the date the charge is
billed to the property owner. A charge that is not paid within such period
shall be considered delinquent. On or before October 15 of each year, the City
Clerk shall certify all delinquent charges to the Houston County Auditor.
      (2)   Payment of delinquent connection charges in installments.
         (a)   A property owner whose property is subject to a delinquent
connection charge may petition the City Council to allow certification of the
charge to the County Auditor in annual installments, together with interest at
the annual rate established by the City Council. The City Council shall grant
all such petitions which are filed in writing with the City Clerk within 30
days after the connection charge has become delinquent. The City Council may
grant, but shall not be required to grant, any petition which is filed after
the expiration of such 30-day period. A property owner may also file such
petition with the City Clerk before the connection charge becomes delinquent,
although the petition will not be deemed accepted and the City Council will not
have authority to act on any such petition until the connection charge has
become delinquent. If a petition is filed too late (in the sole judgment of the
City Council) to allow the city to certify the first installment on the
following year’s property taxes, the property owner shall make payment of the
first installment plus interest directly to the city within 30 days after the
City Council has approved the petition, and all subsequent installments and
interest will be certified for payment with property taxes.
         (b)   The City Council shall have the discretion to determine the
number of annual installments allowed for each petition granted based upon all
relevant factors, including but not limited to the amount of the connection
charge and the need for the city to recover construction costs within a
reasonable period of time. The City Council, in its sole discretion, may also
increase the number of annual installments to accommodate the proven financial
hardship of an owner based on income, medical status, disability, and other
relevant factors, provided, however, that any increase in the number of
installments on such basis may be reviewed and the number of installments
modified, in the City Council’s sole discretion, in the event that the hardship
is eliminated or alleviated due to a transfer of full or partial ownership or
possession of the property, a change in financial circumstances of the owner,
or any other circumstances which significantly reduce the hardship.
         (c)   A property owner’s obligation to make approved installment
payments under this section shall be binding on the property owner’s successors
and assigns, and shall also be a lien on the parcel of land to which the
connection charge relates. Evidence of such lien may be filed against such
parcel, of land in the office of the Houston County Recorder; provided,
however, that any failure to file such lien with the Houston County Recorder
shall not eliminate or diminish, in any way, the obligation of the property
owner or the property owner’s successors and assigns to make the approved
installment payments.
         (d)   If the property taxes become delinquent for any parcel of land
which the City Council has approved for certification of the delinquent
connection charges in installments, the City Council may declare the total
connection charge and accrued interest to become immediately due and payable.
Thereafter, the City Council shall certify the total outstanding balance of the
delinquent charges together with interest to the Houston County Auditor for
collection thereafter as other taxes against the subject parcel of land.
         (e)   A listing of the various items and the connection charges with
reference thereto shall be established by resolution of the City Council at any
duly convened meeting thereof.
         (f)   The City Council may, from time to time, modify, amend or
supplement the listing of charges without need to amend the initial enabling
ordinance.

   (L)   Where required by the city, the owner of any property serviced by a
sanitary sewer shall provide protection from an accidental discharge of
prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this subchapter. Where
necessary, facilities to prevent accidental discharges of prohibited materials
shall be provided and maintained at the owner's expense. Detailed plans showing
facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be
submitted to the Superintendent for review and approval prior to construction
of the facility. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures
shall not relieve any user from the responsibility to modify the user's
facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this subchapter. Users shall
notify the Superintendent immediately upon having a slug or accidental
discharge of substances of wastewater in violation of this subchapter to enable
countermeasures to be taken by the Superintendent to minimize damage to the
wastewater treatment works. Such notification will not relieve any user of any
liability for any expense, loss or damage to the wastewater treatment system or
treatment process, or for any fines imposed on the city on account thereof
under any state and federal law. Employees shall insure that all employees who
may cause or discover such a discharge are advised of the emergency
notification procedure.
   (M)   No person having charge of any building or other premises which drains
into the public sewer shall permit any substance or matter which may form a
deposit or obstruction to flow or pass into the public sewer. Within ten days
after receipt of written notice from the city, the owner shall install a
suitable and sufficient catch basin or waste trap or suitable and sufficient
device, or if one already exists, shall clean out, repair or alter the same,
and perform such other work as the Superintendent may deem necessary. Upon the
owner's refusal or neglect to install a catch basin or waste trap or to clean
out, repair or alter the same after the period of ten days, the Superintendent
may cause such work to be completed at the expense of the owner or
representative thereof.
   (N)   Whenever any service connection becomes clogged, obstructed, broken or
out of order, or detrimental to the use of the public sewer, or unfit for the
purpose of drainage, the owner shall repair or cause such work to be done as
the Superintendent may direct. Each day after ten days that a person neglects
or fails to so act shall constitute a separate violation of this section, and
the Superintendent may then cause the work to be done, and recover from such
owner or agent the expense thereof by an action in the name of the city.
   (O)   The owner or operator of any motor vehicle washing or servicing
facility shall provide and maintain in serviceable condition at all times a
catch basin or waste trap in the building drain system to prevent grease, oil,
dirt or any mineral deposit from entering the public sever system.
   (P)   In addition to any penalties that may be imposed for violation of any
provision of this subchapter, the city may assess against any person the cost
of repairing or restoring sewers or associated facilities damaged as a result
of the discharge of prohibited wastes by such person, and may collect such
assessment as an additional charge for the use of the public sewer system or in
any other manner deemed appropriate by the city.
   (Q)   No statement contained in this subchapter shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any
industry whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be
accepted by the city for treatment, subject to payment therefor by the
industrial concern, providing that National Categorical Pretreatment Standards
and the city's NPDES/SDS system permit limitations are not violated.

(Ord. 283, passed 5-6-91)
§ 51.42 ESTABLISHMENT OF SEWER SERVICE CHARGE SYSTEM.
   (A)   The city hereby establishes a Sewer Service Charge System whereby all
revenue collected from users of the wastewater treatment facilities will be
used to affect all expenditures incurred for annual operation, maintenance and
replacement and for debt service on capital expenditure incurred in
constructing the wastewater treatment works.
   (B)   Each user shall pay its proportionate share of operation, maintenance
and replacement costs of the treatment works, based on the users proportionate
contribution to the total wastewater loading from all users.
   (C)   Each user shall pay debt service charges to retire local capital costs
as determined by the City Council.
   (D)   Sewer service rates and charges to users of the wastewater treatment
facility shall be determined and fixed in a “Sewer Service Charge System”
developed according to the provisions of this subchapter. The Sewer Service
Charge System developed by the city shall be adopted by resolution upon
enactment of this subchapter, shall be published in the local newspaper, and
shall be effective upon publication. Subsequent changes in sewer service rates
and charges shall be adopted by Council resolution and shall be published in
the local newspaper.
   (E)   Revenues collected for the sewer service shall be deposited in a
separate fund known as “The Sewer Service Fund”. Income from revenues collected
will be expended to offset the cost of operation, maintenance and equipment
replacement for the facility and to retire the debt for capital expenditure.
   (F)   Sewer Service charges and the Sewer Service Fund will be administrated
in accordance with the provisions of §
51.55.
(Ord. 283, passed 5-6-91)
§ 51.43 DETERMINATION OF SERVICE CHARGES.
   (A)   User classes.
      (1)   Users of the city wastewater treatment works shall be identified as
belonging to one of the following user classes: Residential; Commercial;
Industrial; Institutional; or Governmental.
      (2)   The allocation of users to these categories for the purpose of
assessing user charges and debt service charges shall be the responsibility of
the City Administrator. Allocation of users to user classes shall be based on
the substantive intent of the definitions of these classes contained in this
subchapter.
   (B)   Rates. The user shall pay operation, maintenance and replacement costs
in proportion to the user's proportionate contribution of wastewater flows and
loadings to the treatment plant, with the minimum rate for loadings of BOD and
of TSS being the rate established for concentrations of 285 mg/l BOD and 300
TSS (normal domestic strength wastewater).
   (C)   Unit costs for treatment of flow, BOD and TSS.
      (1)   Unit costs for treatment of flow, BOD and TSS shall be determined
and fixed annually in the Sewer Service Charge System according to the
following procedure:
         (a)   Determine the annual OM&R budget.
         (b)   Allocate total annual OM&R costs to flow, BOD and TSS
proportionally; according to the costs of collections and of the specific
treatment process required to affect or reduce flow, BOD and TSS.
         (c)   Divide the OM&R costs attributable to flow, BOD and TSS
respectively, by the total annual billable volume and loadings of flow, BOD and
TSS, to arrive at unit costs .
      (2)   For purposes of determining user charges, the following definitions
of unit costs shall apply:
         UF   =   Unit cost for treatment of Flow in $/K gal.
         UBOD   =   Unit cost for treatment of BOD in $/lb.
         UTSS   =   Unit cost for treatment of TSS in $/lb.
   (D)   User charges for normal domestic strength users.
      (1)   The billable amount of flow will be calculated from the volume of
metered water usage. For residential users, the per quarter, billable flow
shall be 80% of the metered spring quarter (February, March, April) water
usage. For non-residential users discharging normal domestic strength
wastewater, the per quarter billable flow shall be 100% of the metered spring
quarter (February, March, April) water usage.
      (2)   The billable amounts of BOD and TSS will be calculated from the
volume of metered usage as determined in division (D)(1) of this section, where
the billable quantities will be those attributable to a wastewater
concentration of 285 mg/l/BOD and 300 mg/l/TSS (normal domestic strength
wastewater).
      UC(NDS)   =   (UF x F) + (UBOD x KBOD x F) + (UTSS x KTSS x F)
      Where:      U(NDS)   =   User charge for treatment of normal domestic
strength wastewater
            UC(NDS)   =   User charge, for treatment of normal domestic
strength wastewater
            UF      =   Unit cost for treatment of flow in $/Kgal
            F      =   Billable flow in Kgal
            UBOD    =    Unit cost for treatment of BOD in $/lb
            KBOD    =   Constant used to calculate the quantity of BOD in lbs/
Kgal of normal domestic strength waste (285 mg/l BOD) as follows:
            KBOD      =   0.00834 x 285 mg/l (BOD concentration of normal
domestic strength waste) = 2.38 lb/Kgal
            UTSS       =   Unit cost of treatment of TSS in $/lb
            KTSS       =   Constant used to calculate the quantity of TSS in
lbs/Kgal of NDS waste (300 mg/l TSS) as follows:
            KTSS      =   0.00834 x 300 mg/l (TSS concentration of NDS waste) =
2.50lb/Kgal
   (E)   User charges for users contributing wasted greater than normal
domestic strength.
      (1)   Calculating billable flows and loadings.
         (a)   The billable amount of flow will be calculated from the volume
of metered water usage, or at the discretion of the city, from the measurement
of effluent flow at user's point of discharge. Measurements shall be according
to a regular program prescribed by the city.
         (b)   The billable amounts of BOD and TSS will be calculated by the
measurement of these wastes according to a program prescribed by the city in
keeping with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   Calculating user charges.
         UC(GNDS) = (UF x F) + (UBOD x QBOD) + (UTSS x QTSS)
         Where:      UC(GNDS)   =   User charge for treatment of wastewater
that is greater than normal domestic strength
               UF       =   Unit cost for treatment of flow in $ /Kgal
               F       =   Billable flow in Kgal
               UBOD      =   Unit cost for treatment of BOD in $/lb.
               QBOD    =   Quantity of BOD in lbs.
               UTSS       =   Unit cost for treatment of TSS in $/lb.
               QTSS       =   Quantity of TSS in lbs.
   (F)   The city may, at its discretion, require non-residential users to
install wastewater flow meters or such additional water meters as may be
necessary to determine wastewater volume. The city may require residential
connections to install water meters for the purpose of determining wastewater
volume. When so required, such meters shall be of a type approved by the city
equipped with remote registering records, and located at an accessible site on
the owner's property.
   (G)   Debit service charge.
      (1)   Provision for the recovery of local construction costs shall be
included in the sewer rate ordinance and accompanying Sewer Service Charge
System, in accordance with 40 CFR 35.2104. Federal and state regulations do not
require that local construction costs be recovered proportionately, (as is the
case with operation, maintenance and replacement costs) but only that the
method of recovery be provided for in the sewer rate ordinance. Consequently,
the city may employ a variety or methods to recover such costs.
      (2)   The following alternatives demonstrate provision for such costs in
a sewer rate ordinance, and can be employed to assist in the development of a
suitable ordinance. These alternatives are offered as suggestions; neither the
EPA nor the MPCA endorse a particular approach.
      (3)   The debt service charge for local capital/construction costs will
be recovered through the sewer service charge. The costs are based on the costs
found in Appendix, Table 7 at the end of this chapter, estimated federal/state
grants and local share costs.

administrated according to the following provisions:
   (A)   (1)   The City Administrator shall maintain a proper system of
accounts suitable for determining the operation and maintenance, equipment
replacement and debt retirement costs of the treatment works, and shall furnish
the City Council with a report of such costs annually in January.
      (2)   The City Council shall annually determine whether or not sufficient
revenue is being generated for the effective operation, maintenance,
replacement and management of the treatment works and whether sufficient
revenue is being generated for debt retirement. The Council will also determine
whether the user charges are distributed proportionately to each user in
accordance with §
51.42(B) and § 204(b)(2)(A) of the Act, being 33 USC 1284(b)(2)(A) as amended.
      (3)   The city shall thereafter, but not later than the end of the year,
reassess and as necessary revise the Sewer Service Charge System then in use to
insure the proportionality of the user charges and to insure the sufficiency of
funds to maintain the capacity and performance to which the facilities were
constructed, and to retire the construction debt.
   (B)   In accordance with federal and state requirements, each user will be
notified annually in conjunction with a regular billing of that portion of the
sewer service charge attributable to operation, maintenance and replacement.
   (C)   In accordance with federal and state requirements, the City
Administrator shall be responsible for maintaining all records necessary to
document compliance with the Sewer Service Charge System adopted.
   (D)   Bills for sewer service charges shall be rendered on a quarterly basis
succeeding the period for which the service was rendered and shall be due ten
days from the date of rendering. Any bill not paid in full ten days after the
due date will be considered delinquent. At that time the city shall notify the
delinquent owner or occupant in writing regarding the delinquent bill and
subsequent penalty. The penalty shall be computed as 5% of the original bill
and shall be increased the same 5% for every quarter the bill is outstanding.
   (E)   The owner of the premises shall be liable to pay for the service to
such premises and the service is furnished to the premises by the city only
upon the condition that the owner of the premises is liable therefore to the
city.

at no expense to the city.
(Ord. 283, passed 5-6-91)
§ 51.56 COLLECTION OF CHARGES.
   (A)   Each and every sewer service charge levied by and pursuant to this
subchapter is hereby made a lien upon the lot or premises served, and all such
charges which are on October 1 of each year past due and delinquent shall be
certified to the County Auditor as taxes or assessments on the real estate.
Nothing in this chapter shall be held or construed as in any way stopping or
interfering with the right of the city to levy as taxes or assessments against
any premises affected by delinquent or past due sewer service charges.
   (B)   As an alternative to levying a lien, the city may, at its discretion,
file a suit in a civil action to collect such amounts as are delinquent and due
against the occupant, owner or user of the real estate, and shall collect as

§ 52.05 AVAILABILITY OF MUNICIPAL WATER SERVICE AT ELEVATIONS ABOVE 860 FEET
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to apprise would-be developers
of lands intending to acquire municipal water service at elevations above 860
feet concerning availability of municipal water service.
(Prior Code, § 11.16)
   (B)   Routine service. The city will provide reasonable water pressure to
services connected to its municipal water system to first floor elevations not
exceeding 860 feet.
(Prior Code, § 11.17)
   (C)   Permits required beyond 860 elevation. Any improvements constructed at
elevations above 860 feet or requiring municipal water service above the
elevation shall not be issued a building permit without first having addressed
water supply, fire protection and other hillside development considerations
under this and other applicable municipal regulation and the prior issuance of
indicated variance type authority.
(Prior Code, § 11.18)
   (D)   Procedure. Authorization for the issuance of building permits for
structures above the 860 elevation shall be forthcoming only after receipt of
variance type authorization following public hearing preceded by the same
formality as that which is required with respect to the issuance of variances
under the zoning code provisions of the city.
(Prior Code, § 11.19)
   (E)   Landowner obligation. The provisions of this section shall not be
construed to extend any benefit for the initial availability of municipal water
service beyond that afforded other residents at lower elevations. The
provisions of M.S. Chapter 429, as amended, and any other applicable law, rule
or code provision and the ongoing policy of the city with respect to special
assessments and the availability of public improvements shall not be, in any
way, contravened, superseded or extended hereby.
(Prior Code, § 11.20) (Ord. 305, passed 8-16-93)
§ 52.06 CONNECTION TO MUNICIPAL WATER SERVICE MANDATED.
   (A)   Connection mandated where water service available. In all instances
where municipal water system is accessible, landowners are required at this
expense to install a suitable service connection to the municipal water main in
accordance with all applicable code provisions. All connections shall be made
by a licensed plumber. All properties located within the city, which by reason
of the use thereof require water, except as hereinafter provided, shall be
forthwith connected to the municipal water system, and such connections shall
conform with all applicable code regulations and be made under the direct
supervision and responsibility of a master plumber.
   (B)   (1)   Service charges for non-connected property(s). If a period of
one year elapses following the availability of municipal water and sewer as,
but not limited to, in the case of recently annexed lands and the necessary
indicated connections are not made, there shall, nevertheless, be billings
rendered for the ongoing minimum periodic charges collected in the same manner
as in the case of duly connected and serviced properties. If the non-connected
status exists for a period longer than one year from and after the availability
of such service(s), the minimum charge for the first six months after the
aforestated one year grace period, shall be 150% of said minimum charges and
for the next succeeding six month period thereafter the minimum charge shall be
at 200% of the minimum and at said rate thereafter until connection and
metering have occurred subject to adjustment as the City Council may determine
by resolution duly enacted. Affected property owners shall be billed and the
service charges collectible in the same manner as with ordinary routine
services billings and with all the attending collection procedures thereunto
appertaining.
      (2)   Implied temporary access easement to enable municipal installation
of connections. In exchange for the consideration which the availability of
municipal water and/or sewer to all residents in the city, all resident
property owners are deemed to have given and granted to the city an implied
temporary access easement to enable the city to itself make connections.
Accordingly, in cases where a period of one year has elapsed from and after the
availability of municipal water and sewer is presented as in the case of
recently annexed lands, and the property owner fails to make the necessary
connections, the city may enter, over in and upon an implied temporary access
easement on the property to be connected, this by the most direct route for
purposes of making the connections to available public sewer and water and any
excavations entailed therewith shall be carefully refilled, compacted and
surface restored, said temporary implied easement to thereupon terminate.
      (3)   Municipal connections basis for special assessment. Upon completion
of a connection by the city under division (B)(1), the property owner shall be
billed for the total costs entailed therewith and unless paid within 30 days of
such billing shall be certified to the County Auditor in the manner of special
assessments payable with real property taxes billed to such property the next
succeeding property tax billing year.
   (C)   Recently annexed properties. Properties recently annexed to the city
which by virtue of their use require water, shall have a period of 365 days
from and after the effective date of annexation in which to make connections to
the municipal water system at their expense.
   (D)   Exceptions. Where extraordinary circumstances exist which the City
Council shall, based upon written fact findings, determine to be "non-
accessible," shall be excepted from the mandatory water system hookup
regulations. City Council may, based upon written fact findings, determine that
there exists other cogent reasons for non-connections which as the need for
water for a commercial purpose where chemically treated water is not
satisfactory.
   (E)   Connections made by the city - special assessment. In instances where
365 days have elapsed since the availability of municipal water but the
connection mandated by these regulations have not been made and there has been
no exception determined to be warranted as hereinbefore provided, the city upon
first securing necessary easement from any such property owner using water
service located within the corporate limits of the city shall cause such
connection to be made and the costs thereof together with the hookup fee,
certified to the County Auditor as a special assessment upon each such property
so improved, to be collected with the real property taxes payable on such
property(ies) over a period of not to exceed ten years, in ten equal annual
installments together with interest at the legal rate accruing from the date
the installation was complete.
   (F)   Special assessment deferment policy. In instances where, under the
general policy of the city, a property owner would be eligible for assessment
deferment, the installation and connection shall be made in accordance with the
provisions of the next proceeding subdivision of these regulations and the
total assessment certified to the County Auditor but payment thereof deferred
in accordance with such policy except that interest shall be payable at the
legal rate during the deferment period of referral.
   (G)   Hookup fees. Consistent with ongoing city policy and separate and
distinct from the cost of the construction and installation of connections to
the municipal water system is the obligation to pay a hookup fee. The amount
thereof, subject to amendment, chargeable to any location in the city payable
as the given connection is completed or as may otherwise be directed by the
City Council. The hookup fee may not be deferred.
   (H)   Sealing of private wells mandated. All instances where water was
obtained from a private well prior to the availability of water from the
municipal water system, upon connection thereto as hereinbefore mandated the
theretofore utilized, at the expense of the property owner shall be sealed in
the manner prescribed by the State Health Department and consistent with all
other regulations there unto you and to you appertaining.
   (I)   Violations.  The violation of any provision hereof and of this
subchapter, is a misdemeanor and upon conviction punishable in accordance with
the laws of the state appertaining. Violations may, in the discretion of the

non-commercial washing of vehicles, natural riparian habitat or wet-land flows,
swimming pools (if dechlorinated, typically less than one PPM chlorine), fire
fighting activities, and any other water source not containing pollutants.
      (2)   Discharges specified in writing by the authorized enforcement
agency as being necessary to protect public health and safety.
      (3)   Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a verbal
notification to the authorized enforcement agency prior to the time of the
test.
      (4)   The prohibition shall not apply to any non-storm water discharge
permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the
discharger and administered under the authority of the Federal Environmental
Protection Agency, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all
requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and
regulations, and provided that written approval has been granted for any
discharge to the storm drain system.
   (C)   Prohibition of illicit connections.
      (1)   The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of
illicit connections to the storm drain system is prohibited.
      (2)   This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was

connection.
      (3)   A person is considered to be in violation of this chapter if the
person connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows such a connection
to continue.
(Ord. 479, passed 11-26-12)
§ 53.16 SUSPENSION OF MS4 ACCESS.
   (A)   Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The city
may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when the
suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which
presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or
to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the U.S. If the
violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the
authorized enforcement agency may take such steps as deemed necessary to
prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the U.S., or to minimize
danger to persons.
   (B)   Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have their MS4 access
terminated if the termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The
authorized enforcement agency will notify a violator of the proposed
termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the authorized
enforcement agency for a reconsideration and hearing.
   (C)   A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to
premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the
authorized enforcement agency.
(Ord. 479, passed 11-26-12)
§ 53.17 INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES.
   Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES storm
water discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of the permit. Proof of
compliance with the permit may be required in a form acceptable to the city
prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4.
(Ord. 479, passed 11-26-12)
§ 53.18 MONITORING OF DISCHARGES.
   (A)   Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have storm
water discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction
activity.
   (B)   Access to facilities.
      (1)   The city shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject
to regulation under this chapter as often as may be necessary to determine
compliance with this chapter. If a discharger has security measures in force
which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its
premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access
to representatives of the authorized enforcement agency.
      (2)   Facility operators shall allow the city ready access to all parts
of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and
copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to
discharge storm water, and the performance of any additional duties as defined
by state and federal law.
      (3)   The city shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility
the devices as are necessary in the opinion of the authorized enforcement
agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's storm water
discharge.

monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure
stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
      (5)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the city and shall not be replaced.
The costs of clearing the access shall be borne by the operator.
      (6)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the city access to a permitted
facility is a violation of a storm water discharge permit and of this chapter.
A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge
storm water associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the
person denies the authorized enforcement agency reasonable access to the
permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or
required by this chapter.
      (7)   If the city has been refused access to any part of the premises
from which stormwater is discharged, and he or she is able to demonstrate
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or
that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection
and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any
order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and
welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement agency may seek
issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.

any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution
or contamination of storm water, the storm drain system, or waters of the U.S.
The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall
provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge
of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system
or watercourses through the use of these structural and non-structural BMPs.
Further, any person responsible for a property or premise, which is, or may be,
the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at the
person's expense, additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the
further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system.
Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing
the discharge of storm water associated with industrial activity, to the extent
practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this section.
These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPP) as
necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.
(Ord. 479, passed 11-26-12)
§ 53.20 WATERCOURSE PROTECTION.
   Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or the
person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles
that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so
that the structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical
integrity of the watercourse.
(Ord. 479, passed 11-26-12)
§ 53.21 NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS.
   Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of
materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants
discharging into storm water, the storm drain system, or water of the U.S. the
person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and
cleanup of the release. In the event of a release of hazardous materials the
person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence
via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of non-hazardous
materials, the person shall notify the authorized enforcement agency in person
or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in
person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to
the city within three business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of
prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment,
the owner or operator of the establishment shall also retain an on-site written
record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. These
records shall be retained for at least three years.

space for their resident honey bees in order to control swarming.
      (8)   In any instance in which a colony exhibits unusual aggressive
behavior, it shall be the duty of the beekeeper to promptly implement

nuisance be terminated or abated. The notice may be given in person or by mail.
Failure of any party to receive the mail does not invalidate the service of the
notice. A copy of the notice shall be filed with the City Clerk.
      (2)   The notice of abatement shall state that unless the public nuisance
is abated by the owner or occupant, it will be abated by the city at the
expense of the owner or occupant. The notice shall specify the control measures
to be taken to abate the nuisance, and provide a reasonable amount of time to
abate the nuisance. The notice will also state that the owner or occupant has
the right to appeal the determination that a public nuisance exists by
submitting a request in writing to the City Clerk within seven days after
service of the notice, or before the date by which abatement must be completed,
whichever comes first.
      (3)   If no timely appeal is submitted, and the control measures
prescribed in the notice of abatement are not complied with within the time
provided by the notice or any additional time granted, the tree inspector or
designated person shall have the authority to obtain permission or an
administrative search warrant, enter the property, and carry out abatement in
accordance with the notice of abatement.
   (B)   High-cost abatement. If the tree inspector determines that the cost of
abating a nuisance will exceed $5,000 based on a reasonable, good faith
estimate, the written notice referred to in this section must provide that if
the nuisance is not abated within the reasonable amount of time provided, the
matter will be referred to the City Council for a hearing. The date, time, and
location of the hearing must be provided in the notice.
(Ord. 490, passed 12-8-14)
§ 96.12 APPEAL PROCEDURE.
   If the City Administrator or the City Clerk receive a written request for a
hearing on the question of whether a public nuisance exists, the City Council
shall hold a hearing within seven calendar days following receipt by the Clerk
of the written request. At least three days' notice of the hearing shall be
given to the individual who made the written request for the hearing. The
Council may modify the abatement notice or extend the time by which abatement
must be completed. Each owner, agent of the owner, occupant, and lienholder of
the subject property or properties in attendance, if any, shall be given the
opportunity to present evidence at the hearing. After holding the hearing, the
City Council may issue an order requiring abatement of the nuisance.
(Ord. 490, passed 12-8-14)
§ 96.13 ABATEMENT PROCEDURE IN EVENT OF IMMINENT DANGER.
   (A)   If the tree inspector determines that the danger of infestation to
other shade trees is imminent, and delay in control measures may put public
health, safety, or welfare in immediate danger, the tree inspector may provide
for abatement without following §
96.11. The tree inspector must reasonably attempt to notify the owner or
occupant of the affected property of the intended action and the right to
appeal the abatement and any cost recovery at the next regularly scheduled City
Council meeting.
   (B)   Nothing in this section shall prevent the city, without notice or
other process, from immediately abating any condition that poses an imminent
and serious hazard to human life or safety.
(Ord. 490, passed 12-8-14)
§ 96.14 RECOVERY OF COST OF ABATEMENT.
   (A)   The owner of premises on which a nuisance has been abated by the city
shall be personally liable for the cost to the city of the abatement, including
administrative costs. As soon as the work has been completed and the cost
determined, the City Clerk or other official shall prepare a bill for the cost
and mail it to the owner. Thereupon the amount shall be immediately due and
payable at the office of the City Clerk.
   (B)   After notice and hearing, as provided in M.S. § 429.061 (which may be
amended from time to time), the City Clerk shall, on or before September 1 next
following abatement of the nuisance, list the total unpaid charges as well as
other charges for current services to be assessed under M.S. § 429.101 against
each separate lot or parcel to which the charges are attributable. The City
Council may then certify the charges against the property to the County Auditor
for collection along with current taxes the following year or in annual
installments as the City Council may determine in each case.
(Ord. 490, passed 12-8-14)

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 110.01 ADOPTION OF STATE LAW BY REFERENCE.
   The provisions of M.S. Ch. 340A, as they may be amended from time to time,
with reference to the definition of terms, conditions of operation,
restrictions on consumption, provisions relating to sales, hours of sale, and
all other matters pertaining to the retail sale, distribution, and consumption
of intoxicating liquor and 3.2 percent malt liquor are hereby adopted by
reference and are made a part of this chapter as if set out in full. It is the
intention of the City Council that all future amendments to M.S. Ch. 340A are
hereby adopted by reference or referenced as if they had been in existence at
the time this chapter is adopted.
(Ord. 478, passed 11-26-12; Am. Ord. 532, passed 3-25-19)
§ 110.02 CITY MAY BE MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN STATE LAW.
   The Council is authorized by the provisions of M.S. § 340A.509, as it may be
amended from time to time, to impose, and has imposed in this chapter,
additional restrictions on the sale and possession of alcoholic beverages
within its limits beyond those contained in M.S. Ch. 340A, as it may be amended
from time to time.
(Ord. 478, passed 11-26-12; Am. Ord. 532, passed 3-25-19)
§ 110.03 DEFINITIONS.
   In addition to the definitions contained in M.S. § 340A.101, as it may be
amended from time to time, the following terms are defined for purposes of this
chapter:
   LIQUOR. As used in this chapter, without modification by the words an
"intoxicating" or a "3.2 percent malt" includes both intoxicating liquor and
3.2 percent malt liquor.
   RESTAURANT. An eating facility, other than a hotel, under the control of a
single proprietor or manager, where meals are regularly prepared on the
premises, where full waitress/waiter table service is provided, where a
customer orders food from printed menus and where the main food course is
served and consumed while seated at a single location. To be a restaurant as
defined by this section, an establishment shall have a license from the state
as required by M.S. § 157.16, as it may be amended from time to time, and meet
the definition of either a "small establishment," "medium establishment" or
"large establishment" as defined in M.S. § 157.16, Subdivision 3(d), as it may
be amended from time to time. An establishment which serves prepackaged food

health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the city that nudity is
prohibited as provided in this section on the premises of any establishment
licensed under this chapter. This is to protect and assist the owners,
operators, and employees of the establishment, as well as patrons and the
public in general, from harm stemming from the physical immediacy and
combination of alcohol, nudity, and sex. The Council especially intends to
prevent any subliminal endorsement of sexual harassment or activities likely to
lead to the possibility of various criminal conduct, including prostitution,
sexual assault, and disorderly conduct. The Council also finds that the
prohibition of nudity on the premises of any establishment licensed under this
chapter, as set forth in this section, reflects the prevailing community
standards of the city.
   (B)   It is unlawful for any licensee to permit or allow any person or
persons on the licensed premises when the person does not have his or her
buttocks, anus, breasts, and genitals covered with a non-transparent material.
It is unlawful for any person to be on the licensed premises when the person
does not have his or her buttocks, anus, breasts, and genitals covered with a
non-transparent material.
   (C)   A violation of this section is a misdemeanor punishable as provided by
law and is justification for revocation or suspension of any liquor, wine, or
3.2 percent malt liquor license or any other license issued under this chapter
or the imposition of a civil penalty under the provisions of §
110.99(B).
(Ord. 478, passed 11-26-12; Am. Ord. 532, passed 3-25-19)

responsibility under this section shall conform to M.S. § 340A.409, as it may

§ 110.21 DESCRIPTION OF PREMISES.

§ 110.24 INVESTIGATION.
   (A)   Preliminary background and financial investigation. On an initial
application for a license, on an application for transfer of a license and, in
the sound discretion of the Council that it is in the public interest to do so,
on an application for renewal of a license, the city shall conduct a
preliminary background and financial investigation of the applicant or it may
contract with the Commissioner of Public Safety for the investigation. The
applicant shall pay with the application an investigation fee of $500 which
shall be in addition to any license fee. If the cost of the preliminary
investigation is less than $500, the unused balance shall be returned to the
applicant. The results of the preliminary investigation shall be sent to the
Commissioner of Public Safety if the application is for an on-sale intoxicating
liquor license or an on-sale wine license.
   (B)   Comprehensive background and financial investigation. If the results
of a preliminary investigation warrant, in the sound discretion of the Council,
a comprehensive background and financial investigation, the Council may either
conduct the investigation itself or contract with the Commissioner of Public
Safety for the investigation. The investigation fee for this comprehensive
background and financial investigation to be paid by the applicant shall be
$500, less any amount paid for the initial investigation if the investigation
is to be conducted within the state, and $10,000, less any amount paid for the
initial investigation, if the investigation is required outside the state. The
unused balance of the fee shall be returned to the applicant whether or not the
application is denied. The fee shall be paid in advance of any investigation
and the amount actually expended on the investigation shall not be refundable
in the event the application is denied. The results of the comprehensive
investigation shall be sent to the Commissioner of Public Safety if the
application is for an on-sale intoxicating liquor license or an on-sale wine
license.

investigations. Opportunity shall be given to any person to be heard for or

M.S. §§ 14.57 to 14.70, as it may be amended from time to time. The Council may

from time to time, is not required before the penalty is imposed, but the
Council shall hold a hearing on the proposed violation and the proposed penalty

§ 113.01 PURPOSE. 
   Because the city recognizes that many persons under the age of 18 years
purchase or otherwise obtain, possess, and use tobacco, tobacco products and
tobacco-related devices and such sales, possession and use are in violation of
both state and federal law; and because studies, which the city hereby accepts
and adopts, have shown that most smokers begin smoking before they have reached
the age of 18 years and that those persons who reach the age of 18 years
without having started smoking are significantly less likely to begin smoking;
and because smoking has been shown to be the cause of several serious health
problems which subsequently place a financial burden on all levels of
government, this ordinance is intended to regulate the sale, possession, and
use of tobacco, tobacco products, and tobacco-related devices for the purposes
of enforcing and furthering existing laws, to protect minors against the
serious effects associated with the illegal use of tobacco, tobacco products,
and tobacco related devices, and to further the official public policy of the
state in regard to preventing young people from starting to smoke as stated in

to-business, street-to-street, or any other type of place-to-place, for the
purpose of obtaining or attempting to obtain orders for goods, wares, products,
merchandise, other personal property or services of which he or she may be
carrying or transporting samples, or that may be described in a catalog or by
other means, and for which delivery or performance shall occur at a later time.
The absence of samples or catalogs shall not remove a person from the scope of

attempt to obtain orders as discussed above. The term shall mean the same as
the term "canvasser."
   TRANSIENT MERCHANT.  A person who temporarily sets up business out of a

(Prior Code, §10.30(1) - (3))
Penalty, see § 130.99
§ 130.04 CAMPING ON CITY PROPERTY AND CITY RIGHT-OF-WAY.
   (A)   Statement of purpose and intent.
      (1)   Settlements of unhoused individuals (also known as ENCAMPMENTS) in
public spaces are a growing social, public safety, and environmental concern
faced by cities of all sizes, including La Crescent. The dynamics of
homelessness, both short and longer term, are extremely complex reflecting a
wide range of contributing factors. It is recognized that, like many cities, La
Crescent's housing stock and price dynamics can create an affordability
challenge, causing unstable housing for some.
      (2)   In La Crescent and elsewhere, encampments have attracted and
involved people experiencing significant addiction and mental health
challenges, as well as individuals who seek to take advantage of those staying
in encampments. Among other problems, encampments tend to result in
accumulation of garbage and human waste, which creates a health hazard and can
contaminate the ground and water. Other typical hazards include drug
paraphernalia (i.e., needles) and unchecked fires associated with cooking,
often involving explosive fuels. Encampments are also prone to a heightened
physical safety and property risk for those in the encampments as well as those
who may be present in the same area. Encampments also tend to cause damage or
disruption to the soil and forested areas.
      (3)   Many in the community, including public and private entities, have
responded to the needs of those experiencing housing instability, providing
significant levels of resources and services.
      (4)   The city also has an obligation to make best efforts to provide a
safe and clean environment for other members of the community who want or need
to use public spaces. Access to parks, trails, schools, green spaces, public
transportation, and the protection of public utilities and infrastructure is a
community good for all.
      (5)   While many unhoused individuals are able to exist in a space that
does not cause public disruption, it is also true that encampments do create
significant harms, for both the unhoused individuals as well as members of the
public attempting to use the same spaces. Law enforcement personnel, who have
had primary responsibility for responding to encampment areas, need to be
supported with effective tools to address these complex situations. Encampments
and unsheltered individuals who create the most social harm cannot be ignored
or just moved from one space to the next.
   (B)   Definitions. The following words, terms, and phrases shall have the
meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly
indicates a different meaning.
      CITY. The City of La Crescent, Minnesota.
      CAMP OR CAMPING. To set up, or to remain in or at a campsite, including
the storage of personal belongings or camping materials.
      CAMPSITE. Any place where any tent, lean-to, shack, or other structure,
any vehicle or part thereof, or any bedding, sleeping bag, or other sleeping
matter, or any stove or fire is placed, established, or maintained for the
purpose of establishing or maintaining a temporary place to live.
      CAMPING MATERIALS. Includes, but is not limited to, tents, tarps,
umbrellas, metal sheeting, pallets, canopies, hammock, hunting blind, boxes,
huts, temporary shelters, or vehicles.
   (C)   Prohibition.
      (1)   No person may camp in or upon any city land or right-of-way, unless
otherwise specifically authorized by the La Crescent City Council, subject to
the enforcement requirements in §
130.99(C).
      (2)   Any camping or campsite materials or personal property associated
with a camping area that is in violation of this section may be removed or
cleaned up by the city or its designated contractors.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The legislature of the state has in M.S. Chapter 103F and M.S. §§ 412.191,
462.351 through 462.364 and 471.62 delegated the responsibility to local
government units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses.
Therefore, the city does ordain the following chapter.
(Prior Code, §15.13(1)) (Ord. 282, passed 4-15-91)
§ 151.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation
which results in potential loss of life, loss of property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   This chapter is based upon a reasonable method of analyzing flood
hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the State
Department of Natural Resources.
(Prior Code, § 15.13(2)) (Ord. 282, passed 4-15-91)
§ 151.03 PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize those losses described in §§
151.01 and
151.02.
(Prior Code, § 15.13(3)) (Ord. 282, passed 4-15-91)
§ 151.04 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ACCESSORY USE OR STRUCTURE. A use or structure on the same lot with, and of
a nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal use or
structure.
   BASEMENT. Any area of a structure, including crawl spaces, having its floor
or base subgrade (below ground level) on all four sides, regardless of the
depth of excavation below ground level.
   CONDITIONAL USE. A specific type of structure or land use listed in the
official control that may be allowed but only after an in-depth review
procedure and with appropriate conditions or restrictions as provided in the
official zoning controls or building codes and upon a finding that certain
conditions as detailed in the zoning ordinance exist; and the structure or land
use conforms to the comprehensive land use plan if one exists and are
compatible with the existing neighborhood.
   EQUAL DEGREE OF ENCROACHMENT. A method of determining the location of
floodway boundaries so that flood plain lands on both sides of a stream are
capable of conveying a proportionate share of flood flows.
   FLOOD. A temporary increase in the flow or stage of a stream or in the stage
of a wetland or lake that results in the inundation of normally dry areas.
   FLOOD FREQUENCY. The frequency for which it is expected that a specific
flood stage or discharge may be equaled or exceeded.
   FLOOD FRINGE. The portion of the flood plain outside of the floodway. Flood
fringe is synonymous with the term FLOODWAY FRINGE used in the Flood Insurance
Study for the city.
   FLOOD PLAIN. The beds proper and the areas adjoining a wetland, lake or
watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regional flood.
   FLOODPROOFING. A combination of structural provisions, changes or
adjustments to properties and structures subject to flooding, primarily for the
reduction or elimination of flood damages.
   FLOODWAY. The bed of a wetland or lake and the channel of a watercourse and
those portions of the adjoining flood plain which are reasonably required to
carry or store the regional flood discharge.
   OBSTRUCTION. Any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment,
projection, excavation, channel modification, culvert, building, wire, fence,
stockpile, refuse, fill, structure or matter in, along, across or projecting
into any channel, watercourse or regulatory flood plain which may impede,
retard or change the direction of the flow of water, either in itself or by
catching or collecting debris carried by such water.
   PRINCIPAL USE OR STRUCTURE. All uses or structures that are not accessory
uses or structures.
   REACH. A hydraulic engineering term to describe a longitudinal segment of a
stream or river influenced by a natural or human-made obstruction. In an urban
area, the segment of a stream or river between two consecutive bridge crossings
would most typically constitute a reach.
   REGIONAL FLOOD. A flood which is representative of large floods known to
have occurred generally in the state and reasonably characteristic of what can
be expected to occur on an average frequency in the magnitude of the 100-year
recurrence interval. The term is synonymous with the term “base flood” used in
the Flood Insurance Study.
   REGULATORY FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION. An elevation no lower than one foot
above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation
caused by encroachments on the flood plain that result from designation of a
floodway.
   STRUCTURE. Anything constructed or erected on the ground or attached to the
ground or on side utilities, including but not limited to buildings, factories,
sheds, detached garages, cabins, manufactured homes, travel trailers or
vehicles not meeting the exemption criteria specified in §
151.32 and other similar items.
   VARIANCE. A modification of a specific permitted development standard
required in an official control including this chapter to allow an alternative
development standard not stated as acceptable in the official control, but only
as applied to a particular property for the purpose of alleviating a hardship,
practical difficulty or unique circumstance as defined and elaborated upon in a
community's respective planning and zoning enabling legislation.
(Prior Code, § 15.14(8)) (Ord. 282, passed 4-15-91)
§ 151.05 LANDS TO WHICH CHAPTER APPLIES.
   This chapter shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city
shown on the official zoning map and the attachments thereto as being located
within the boundaries of the Floodway, Flood Fringe or General Flood Plain
Districts.

§ 151.06 ESTABLISHMENT OF OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.
   The official zoning map, together with all materials attached thereto, is
hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. The
attached material shall include the Flood Insurance Study for the City of La
Crescent prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency dated November
2,1982, the Flood Insurance Study for Houston County prepared by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency dated June 6, 2001, the Flood Boundary and Floodway
Map and Flood Insurance Rate Map for the City of La Crescent dated May 2,1983,
and the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map Panel 270190.0005 and Flood Insurance
Rate Map Panel 270190.0005B dated January 6,1982 therein. The official zoning
map shall be on file in the office of the City Clerk-Administrator.
(Prior Code, § 15.14(2)) (Ord. 282, passed 4-15-91; Am. Ord. 389, passed 11-12-
02)
§ 151.07 REGULATORY FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION.
   The regulatory flood protection elevation shall be an elevation no lower
than one foot above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in
flood elevation caused by encroachments on the flood plain that result from
designation of a floodway.
(Prior Code, § 15.14(3)) (Ord. 282, passed 4-15-91)
§ 151.08 INTERPRETATION.
   (A)   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this
chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation
or repeal of any other powers granted by the state statutes.
   (B)   The boundaries of the zoning districts shall be determined by scaling
distances on the Official Zoning Map. Where interpretation is needed as to the
exact location of the boundaries of the district as shown on the Official
Zoning Map, as for example where there appears to be a conflict between a
mapped boundary and actual field conditions and there is a formal appeal of the
decision of the Zoning Administrator, the Board of Appeals and Adjustment shall
make the necessary interpretation. All decisions will be based on elevations on
the regional (100-year) flood profile and other available technical data.
Persons contesting the location of the district boundaries shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to present their case to the Board and to submit
technical evidence.
(Prior Code, § 15.14(4)) (Ord. 282, passed 4-15-91)
§ 151.09 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   It is not intended by this chapter to repeal, abrogate or impair any
existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter
imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail. All
other ordinances inconsistent with this chapter are hereby repealed to the
extent of the inconsistency only.
(Prior Code, § 15.14(5)) (Ord. 282, passed 4-15-91)
§ 151.10 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   This chapter does not imply that areas outside the flood plain districts or
land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or flood
damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city or any
officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on
this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Prior Code, § 15.14(6)) (Ord. 282, passed 4-15-91)

      (8)   Structural works for flood control such as levees, dikes and
floodwalls constructed to any height where the intent is to protect individual
structures and levees or dikes where the intent is to protect agricultural
crops for a frequency flood event equal to or less than the ten-year frequency
flood event.
   (D)   Standards for floodway conditional uses.
      (1)   All uses. No structure (temporary or permanent), fill (including
fill for roads and levees), deposit, obstruction, storage of materials or
equipment, or other uses may be allowed as a conditional use that will cause
any increase in the stage of the 100-year or regional flood or cause an
increase in flood damages in the reach or reaches affected.
      (2)   Procedures and standards. All floodway conditional uses shall be
subject to the procedures and standards contained in § 151.53.
      (3)   Underlying zoning district. The conditional use shall be
permissible in the underlying zoning district if one exists.
      (4)   Fill.
         (a)   Fill, dredge spoil and all other similar materials deposited or

         (b)   Dredge spoil sites, sand and gravel operations shall not be
allowed in the floodway unless a long-term site development plan is submitted
which includes an erosion and sedimentation prevention element to the plan.
         (c)   As an alternative, and consistent with division (D)(4)(b) of
this section, dredge spoil disposal and sand and gravel operations may allow
temporary, on-site storage of fill or other materials which would have caused
an increase to the stage of the 100-year or regional flood but only after the
governing body has received an appropriate plan which assures the removal of
the materials from the floodway based upon the flood warning time available.
The conditional use permit must be title registered with the property in the
office of the County Recorder.
      (5)   Accessory structures.
         (a)   Accessory structures shall not be designed for human habitation.
         (b)   1.   Accessory structures, if permitted, shall be constructed
and placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the
flow of flood waters.
            2.   Whenever possible, structures shall be constructed with the
longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow, and so far as
practicable, structures shall be placed approximately on the same flood flow
lines as those of adjoining structures.
         (c)   Accessory structures shall be elevated on fill or structurally
dry floodproofed in accordance with the FP-1 or FP-2 floodproofing
classifications in the State Building Code. As an alternative, an accessory
structure may be floodproofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 floodproofing classification
in the State Building Code; provided, the accessory structure constitutes a
minimal investment, does not exceed 500 square feet in size, and for a detached
garage, the detached garage must be used solely for parking of vehicles and
limited storage. All floodproofed accessory structures must meet the following
additional standards, as appropriate:
            1.   The structure must be adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure and shall be designed
to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls; and
            2.   Any mechanical and utility equipment in a structure must be
elevated to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or properly
floodproofed.
      (6)   Storage of materials and equipment.
         (a)   The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of
flooding, flammable, explosive or potentially injurious to human, animal or
plant life is prohibited.
         (b)   Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if
readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning
and in accordance with a plan approved by the governing body.
      (7)   Structural works. Structural works for flood control that will
change the course, current or cross-section of protected wetlands or public
waters shall be subject to the provisions of M.S. Chapter 103F. Community-wide
structural works for flood control intended to remove areas from the regulatory
flood plain shall not be allowed in the floodway.
      (8)   Levees, dikes or floodwalls. A levee, dike or floodwall constructed
in the floodway shall not cause an increase to the 100-year or regional flood
and the technical analysis must assume equal conveyance or storage loss on both
sides of a stream.
(Prior Code, § 15.16) (Ord. 282, passed 4-15-91)
Penalty, see § 151.99
§ 151.27 FLOOD FRINGE DISTRICT (FF).
   (A)   Permitted uses. Permitted uses shall be those uses of land or
structures listed as permitted uses in the underlying zoning use district. If
no pre-existing, underlying zoning use district exists, then any residential or
nonresidential structure or use of a structure or land shall be a permitted use
in the flood fringe; provided, such use does not constitute a public nuisance.
All permitted uses shall comply with the standards for flood fringe “permitted
uses” listed in division (B) of this section and the standards for all flood
fringe “permitted and conditional uses” listed in division (E) of this section.
   (B)   Standards for flood fringe permitted uses.
      (1)   All structures, including accessory structures, must be elevated on
fill so that the lowest floor including basement floor is at or above the
regulatory flood protection elevation. The finished fill elevation for
structures shall be no lower than one foot below the regulatory flood
protection elevation and the fill shall extend at such elevation at least 15
feet beyond the outside limits of the structure erected thereon.
      (2)   As an alternative to elevation on fill, accessory structures that
constitute a minimal investment and that do not exceed 500 square feet for the
outside dimension at ground level may be internally floodproofed in accordance
with §
151.26(D)(5)(c).
      (3)   The cumulative placement of fill where at any one time in excess of
1,000 cubic yards of fill is located on the parcel shall be allowable only as a
conditional use, unless the fill is specifically intended to elevate a
structure in accordance with division (B)(1) of this section.
      (4)   The storage of any materials or equipment shall be elevated on fill
to the regulatory flood protection elevation.
      (5)   The provisions of division (E) of this section shall apply.
   (C)   Conditional uses. Any structure that is not elevated on fill or
floodproofed in accordance with division (B)(1) or (2) of this section, or any
use of land that does not comply with the standards in division (B)(3) or (4)
of this section, shall only be allowable as a conditional use. An application
for a conditional use shall be subject to the standards and criteria and
evaluation procedures specified in divisions (D) and (E) of this section and §
151.53.
   (D)   Standards for flood fringe conditional uses.
      (1)   Alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill may be
utilized to elevate a structure's lowest flood above the regulatory flood
protection elevation. These alternative methods may include the use of stilts,
pilings, parallel walls, and the like, or above-grade, enclosed areas such as
crawl spaces or tuck under garages. The base or floor of an enclosed area shall
be considered above-grade and not a structures basement or lowest floor if the
enclosed area is above-grade or at least one side of the structure is designed
to internally flood and is constructed with flood resistant materials and is
used solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage. The noted
alternative elevation methods are subject to the following additional
standards:
         (a)   Design and certification. The structure's design and as-built
condition must be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect
as being in compliance with the general design standards of the State Building
Code and, specifically, that all electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and
air conditioning equipment and other service facilities must be at or above the
regulatory flood protection elevation or be designed to prevent flood water
from entering or accumulating within these components during times of flooding.
         (b)   Specific standards for above-grade, enclosed areas. Above-grade,
fully enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages must be
designed to internally flood and the design plans must stipulate:
            1.   The minimum area of openings in the walls where internal
flooding is to be used as a floodproofing technique. When openings are placed
in a structure's walls to provide for entry of flood waters to equalize
pressures, the bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one-foot above
grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices; provided, that they permit the automatic entry and exit
of flood waters.
            2.   The enclosed area will be designed of flood resistant
materials in accordance with the FP-3 or FP-4 classifications in the State
Building Code and shall be used solely for building access, parking of vehicles
or storage.
      (2)   Basements, as defined by §
151.04, shall be subject to the following:
         (a)   Residential basement construction shall not be allowed below the
regulatory flood protection elevation.
         (b)   Nonresidential basements may be allowed below the regulatory
flood protection elevation; provided, the basement is structurally dry
floodproofed in accordance with division (D)(3) of this section.
      (3)   All areas of nonresidential structures including basements to be
placed below the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be floodproofed in
accordance with the structurally dry floodproofing classifications in the State
Building Code. Structurally dry floodproofing must meet the FP-1 or FP-
2 floodproofing classification in the State Building Code and this shall
require making the structure watertight with the walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of
buoyancy. Structures floodproofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 classification shall not
be permitted.
      (4)   When at any one time more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill or other
similar material is located on a parcel for such activities as on-site storage,
landscaping, sand and gravel operations, landfills, roads, dredge spoil
disposal or construction of flood control works, an erosion and sedimentation
control plan must be submitted unless the community is enforcing a state
approved shoreland management ordinance. In the absence of a state approved
shoreland ordinance, the plan must clearly specify methods to be used to
stabilize the fill on site for a flood event at a minimum of the 100-year or
regional flood event. The plan must be prepared and certified by a registered
professional engineer or other qualified individual acceptable to the City
Council. The plan may incorporate alternative procedures for removal of the
material from the flood plain if adequate flood warning time exists.
      (5)   Storage of materials and equipment.
         (a)   The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of
flooding, flammable, explosive or potentially injurious to human, animal or
plant life is prohibited.
         (b)   Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if
readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning
and in accordance with a plan approved by the City Council.
      (6)   The provisions of division (E) of this section shall also apply.
   (E)   Standards for all flood fringe uses.
      (1)   All new principal structures must have vehicular access at or above
an elevation not more than two feet below the regulatory flood protection
elevation. If a variance to this requirement is granted, the Board of Appeals
and Adjustment must specify limitations on the period of use or occupancy of
the structure for times of flooding and only after determining that adequate
flood warning time and local flood emergency response procedures exist.
      (2)   Commercial uses and accessory land uses, such as yards, railroad
tracks and parking lots, may be at elevations lower than the regulatory flood
protection elevation. However, a permit for such facilities to be used by the
employees or the general public shall not be granted in the absence of a flood
warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area would be
inundated to a depth greater than two feet or be subject to flood velocities
greater than four feet per second upon occurrence of the regional flood.
      (3)   For manufacturing and industrial uses, measures shall be taken to
minimize interference with normal plant operations especially along streams
having protracted flood durations. Certain accessory land uses such as yards
and parking lots may be at lower elevations subject to requirements set out in
division (E)(2) of this section. In considering permit applications, due
consideration shall be given to the needs of an industry whose business
requires that it be located in flood plain areas.
      (4)   Fill shall be properly compacted and the slopes shall be properly
protected by the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable method.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for
removing the special flood hazard area designation for certain structures
properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation. FEMA's
requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection
standards for multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should
be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of
special flood hazard area designation will be requested.
      (5)   Flood plain developments shall not adversely affect the hydraulic
capacity of the channel and adjoining flood plain of any tributary watercourse
or drainage system where a floodway or other encroachment limit has not been
specified on the official zoning map.
      (6)   Standards for travel trailers and travel vehicles are contained in
§
151.32.
      (7)   All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system that resists flotation, collapse and lateral
movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use
of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in
addition to applicable state or local anchoring requirements for resisting wind
forces.

151.26(A) shall be permitted uses.
      (2)   All other uses shall be subject to the floodway/flood fringe
evaluation criteria pursuant to division (B) of this section. The provisions of
§
151.26 shall apply if the proposed use is in the Floodway District and division
(B) of this section shall apply if the proposed use is in the Flood Fringe
District.
   (B)   Procedures for floodway and flood fringe determinations within the
General Flood Plain District.
      (1)   Upon receipt of an application for a conditional use permit for a
use within the General Flood Plain District, the applicant shall be required to
furnish the following information as is deemed necessary by the Zoning
Administrator for the determination of the regulatory flood protection
elevation and whether the proposed use is within the Floodway or Flood Fringe
District.
         (a)   A typical valley cross-section showing the channel of the
stream, elevation of land areas adjoining each side of the channel, cross-
sectional areas to be occupied by the proposed development, and high water
information.
         (b)   Plan (surface view) showing elevations or contours of the
ground; pertinent structure, fill or storage elevations; size, location and
spatial arrangement of all proposed and existing structures on the site;
location and elevations of streets; photographs showing existing land uses and
vegetation upstream and downstream; and soil type.
         (c)   Profile showing the slope of the bottom of the channel or flow
line of the stream for at least 500 feet in either direction from the proposed
development.
      (2)   The applicant shall be responsible to submit one copy of
information listed in division (B)(1) of this section to a designated engineer
or other expert person or agency for technical assistance in determining
whether the proposed use is in the Floodway or Flood Fringe District and to
determine the regulatory flood protection elevation. Procedures consistent with
Minnesota Regulations parts 6120.5000 through 6120.6200 shall be followed in
this expert evaluation. The designated engineer or expert is strongly
encouraged to discuss the proposed technical evaluation methodology with the
respective Department of Natural Resources' Area Hydrologist prior to
commencing the analysis. The designated engineer or expert shall:
         (a)   Estimate the peak discharge of the regional flood.
         (b)   Calculate the water surface profile of the regional flood based
upon a hydraulic analysis of the stream channel and overbank areas.
         (c)   Compute the floodway necessary to convey or store the regional
flood without increasing flood stages more than one-half foot. A lesser stage
increase than one-half foot shall be required if, as a result of the additional
stage increase, increased flood damages would result. An equal degree of
encroachment on both sides of the stream within the reach shall be assumed in
computing floodway boundaries.
      (3)   The Zoning Administrator shall present the technical evaluation and
findings of the designated engineer or expert to the City Council. The City
Council must formally accept the technical evaluation and the recommended
Floodway or Flood Fringe District boundary or deny the permit application. The
City Council, prior to official action, may submit the application and all
supporting data and analyses to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the
Department of Natural Resources or the Planning Commission for review and
comment. Once the floodway and flood fringe boundaries have been determined,
the City Council shall refer the matter back to the Zoning Administrator who
shall process the permit application consistent with the applicable provisions
of §
151.26 and §
151.27.

§ 151.29 SUBDIVISIONS.
   (A)   Review criteria. No land shall be subdivided which is unsuitable for
the reason of flooding, inadequate drainage, water supply or sewage treatment
facilities. All lots within the flood plain districts shall contain a building
site at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation. All subdivisions
shall have water and sewage treatment facilities that comply with the
provisions of this chapter and have road access both to the subdivision and to
the individual building sites no lower than two feet below the regulatory flood
protection elevation. For all subdivisions in the flood plain, the floodway and
flood fringe boundaries, the regulatory flood protection elevation and the
required elevation of all access roads shall be clearly labeled on all required
subdivision drawings and platting documents.
   (B)   Floodway/flood fringe determinations in the General Flood Plain
District. In the General Flood Plain District, applicants shall provide the
information required in §
151.28(B) to determine the 100-year flood elevation, the Floodway and Flood
Fringe District boundaries and the regulatory flood protection elevation for
the subdivision site.
   (C)   Removal of special flood hazard area designation. The Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for removing the
special flood hazard area designation for certain structures properly elevated
on fill above the 100-year flood elevation. FEMA's requirements incorporate
specific fill compaction and side slope protection standards for multi-
structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should be investigated
prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of special flood hazard
area designation will be requested.

electrical, sewer and water supply systems to be located in the flood plain
shall be floodproofed in accordance with the State Building Code or elevated to
above the regulatory flood protection elevation.
   (B)   Public transportation facilities. Railroad tracks, roads and bridges
to be located within the flood plain shall comply with §§
151.26 and
151.27. Elevation to the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be
provided where failure or interruption of these transportation facilities would
result in danger to the public health or safety or where such facilities are
essential to the orderly functioning of the area. Minor or auxiliary roads or
railroads may be constructed at a lower elevation where failure or interruption
of transportation services would not endanger the public health or safety.
   (C)   On-site sewage treatment and water supply systems. Where public
utilities are not provided, on-site water supply systems must be designated to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems; and new or
replacement on-site sewage treatment systems must be designed to minimize or
eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the
systems into flood waters and they shall not be subject to impairment or
contamination during times of flooding. Any sewage treatment system designed in
accordance with the state's current statewide standards for on-site sewage
treatment systems shall be determined to be in compliance with this section.

and when approved by the commissioner.
   SIGNIFICANT HISTORIC SITE. Any archaeological site, standing structure, or
other property that meets the criteria for eligibility to the National Register
of Historic Places or is listed in the State Register of Historic Sites, or is
determined to be an unplatted cemetery that falls under the provisions of M.S.
§ 307.08. A historic site meets these criteria if it is presently listed on
either register or if it is determined to meet the qualifications for listing
after review by the state archaeologist or the director of the Minnesota
Historical Society. All unplatted cemeteries are automatically considered to be
significant historic sites.
   STEEP SLOPE. Land where agricultural activity or development is either not
recommended or described as poorly suited due to slope steepness and the site's

slope exceeding 18%.
   WATER ORIENTED ACCESSORY STRUCTURE OR FACILITY. A small, above-ground
building or other improvement, except stairways, fences, docks, and retaining
walls, which, because of the relationship of its use to a surface water
feature, reasonably needs to be located closer to public waters than the normal
structure setback. Examples of such structures and facilities include
boathouses, gazebos, screen houses, fish houses, pump houses, and detached
decks.
   WETLAND. A surface water feature classified as a wetland in the United

(Ord. 321, passed 10-17-94)
§ 151.41 AUTHORIZATION AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   This shoreland ordinance is adopted pursuant to the authorization and
policies contained in M.S. Chapter 105, Minnesota Regulations, parts 6120.2500
- 6120.3900, and the planning and zoning enabling legislation in M.S. Chapter
462.
   (B)   The uncontrolled use of shoreland in the city affects the public
health, safety, and general welfare not only by contributing to pollution of
public waters, but also by impairing the local tax base. Therefore, it is in
the best interest of the public health, safety, and welfare to provide for the
wise development of the shoreland of public waters. The state legislature has
delegated responsibility to the municipalities of the state to regulate the
subdivision, use, and development of the shoreland of public waters and thus
preserve and enhance the quality of surface waters, preserve the economic and
natural environmental values of shorelands, and provide for the wise
utilization of waters and related land resources. The responsibility is hereby
recognized by the city; all public waters in this municipality have been given
a shoreland management classification.
(Ord. 321, passed 10-17-94)
§ 151.42 SHORELAND CLASSIFICATION AND LAND USE.
   (A)   The shorelands of the city are hereby designated as a shoreland
overlay district.
   (B)   In order to guide the wise development and utilization of shorelands
of protected waters for the preservation of water quality, natural
characteristics, economic values and the general health, safety and welfare,
certain protected waters in the city have been given a shoreland management
classification. These protected waters of the city have been classified by the
Commissioner of Natural Resources as follows:
 
General Development Lakes    Protected Waters Inventory I.D. No.
U.S. Lock and Dam No. 8 Pool 28-0005 00
Blue Lake                    28-0005 03

waters inventory map and list shall be considered tributary.
(Ord. 321, passed 10-17-94)
§ 151.43 APPLICATION OF ZONING STANDARDS.
   (A)   All permitted, conditional and accessory uses shall be regulated by
the applicable zoning districts underlying this shoreland overlay district.
   (B)   The lot area and width standards for residential, commercial and
industrial lots with the shoreland area shall be as found in the applicable
sections of the city zoning code. Only land above the ordinary high water level
of public waters can be used to meet lot area standards.
(Ord. 321, passed 10-17-94)
§ 151.44 PLACEMENT, DESIGN AND HEIGHT OF STRUCTURES.
   (A)   Structure placement. When more than one setback applies to a site,
structures and facilities shall be located to meet all setbacks. Where
structures exist on the adjoining lots on both sides of a proposed building
site, structure setbacks may be altered without a variance to conform to the
adjoining setbacks from the ordinary high water level, provided the proposed
building site is not located in a shore impact zone or in a bluff impact zone.
   (B)   Setbacks. Structure and on-site sewage system setbacks from the
ordinary high water level shall be as follows:
 
                          Structures
Public Water              Unsewered Sewered Sewage Treatment System
General development lakes 75 feet   50 feet 50 feet
Tributary rivers          100 feet  50 feet 75 feet
 
   One water-oriented accessory structure designed in accordance with §
151.45(B) of this ordinance may be set back at a minimum distance of ten feet
from the ordinary high water level.
   (C)   Additional setbacks. The following additional structure setbacks
apply, regardless of the classification of waterbody:
 
Setback from:      Setback (feet)
Top of bluff       30
Unplatted cemetery 50
 
   (D)   Bluff impact zones.  Structures and accessory facilities, except
stairways and landings, are prohibited within bluff impact zones.
   (E)   Building height. Building height shall be regulated in conformance
with the applicable provisions of the city zoning code.
   (F)   Impervious cover. Impervious surface coverage of lots in the
residential zones shall not exceed 30% of the lot area. Impervious surface
coverage in the commercial and industrial zones shall not exceed 30% of the lot
area. In such zones, areas covered by an approved stormwater management plan
shall not have impervious surface coverage that exceeds 75% of the total lot
area.
(Ord. 321, passed 10-17-94)
§ 151.45 DESIGN CRITERIA FOR STRUCTURES.
   (A)   High water elevations. Structures must be placed in accordance with
floodplain regulations applicable to the site.
   (B)   Water-oriented accessory structures. Each lot may have one water-
oriented accessory structure not meeting the normal structure setback if the
water-oriented accessory structure complies with all of the following:
      (1)   The structure or facility may not exceed ten feet in height,
exclusive of safety rails, and cannot occupy an area greater than 250 square
feet. Detached decks may not exceed eight feet above grade at any point.
      (2)   The setback of the structure or facility from the ordinary high
water level must be at least ten feet.
      (3)   The structure or facility must be treated to reduce visibility as
viewed from public waters and adjacent shorelands by vegetation, topography,
increased setbacks or color, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions.
      (4)   The roof may be used as a deck with safety rails, but must not be
enclosed or used as a storage area.
      (5)   The structure or facility must not be designed or used for human
habitation and must not contain water supply or sewage treatment facilities.
      (6)   As an alternative for the Blue Lake and U.S. Lock and Dam No. 8
Pool shoreland areas, water-oriented accessory structures used solely for
watercraft storage, and including storage of related boating and water-oriented
sporting equipment, may occupy an area up to 400 square feet provided the
maximum width of the structure is 20 feet as measured parallel to the
configuration of the shoreline.
   (C)   Use standards. Surface water-oriented commercial uses and industrial,
public or semipublic uses with similar needs to have access to and use of
public waters may be located on parcels or lots with frontage on public waters.
Uses without water-oriented needs must be located on lots or parcels without
public waters frontage, or, if located on lots or parcels with public waters
frontage, must either be set back double the normal ordinary high water level
setback or be substantially screened from view from the water by vegetation or
topography, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions. Those with water-oriented
needs must meet the following standards:
      (1)   Uses must be designed to incorporate topographic and vegetative
screening of parking areas and structures.
      (2)   Uses that require short-term watercraft mooring for patrons must
centralize such facilities and design them to be of minimum size and in such a
manner to avoid obstructions of navigation.
      (3)   Uses that depend on patrons arriving by watercraft may use signs
and lighting to convey needed information providing that no signs are placed in
or upon public waters. Signs may be placed within the shore impact zone if they
are of minimum size and convey the location and name of the establishment and
the general types of goods and services available. Such signs shall comply with
the city sign regulations. Lights shall be shielded or directed to prevent
illumination out across public waters.
   (D)   Stairways, lifts and landings. Stairways and lifts are the preferred
alternative to major topographic alterations for achieving access up and down
bluffs and steep slopes to shore areas. Stairways and lifts on residential lots
shall not exceed four feet in width with landings not exceeding 32 square feet
in area. Wider stairways may be used for commercial properties and public open
space recreational properties. Canopies or roofs are not allowed on stairways,
lifts or landings. Stairways, lifts and landings must be located in the most
visually inconspicuous portion of the lot and shall be built in a manner that
ensures control of soil erosion.
   (E)   Historic sites. No structure may be placed on a significant historic
site in a manner that affects the values of the site unless adequate
information about the site has been removed and documented in a public
depository.
(Ord. 321, passed 10-17-94)
§ 151.46 SHORELAND ALTERATIONS.
   The purpose of this section is to prevent erosion into public waters, fix
nutrients, preserve shoreland aesthetics, preserve historic values, prevent
bank slumping and protect fish and wildlife habitat. Shoreland alterations are
allowed in accordance with the following standards:
   (A)   Permanent vegetation. Shore impact zones shall be maintained in
permanent vegetation or operated under an approved conservation plan consistent
with the field office technical guides of the local soil and water conservation
district.
   (B)   Intensive vegetation clearing. Within shoreland bluff zones and/or
steep slopes, intensive vegetation clearing is not permitted. Intensive
clearing within shoreland areas but outside of bluff zones and steep slope
areas is permitted, subject to city approval of an erosion and sedimentation
control plan consistent with MPCA's best management practices for Minnesota.
   (C)   Limited clearing. Limited clearing of trees and shrubs and the
cutting, pruning and trimming of trees within bluff and shore impact zones or
steep slopes to accommodate picnic areas, trails and water access, and to
provide a view to the water from a principal dwelling site shall be permitted
provided the screening of structures, as viewed from the water, is not
substantially reduced. These provisions do not apply to the removal of tree
limbs or branches that are dead or pose a safety hazard.
   (D)   Grading and/or filling. Any grading or filling on steep slopes or
within shore or bluff impact zones involving the movement of ten or more cubic
yards of material or involving more than 50 cubic yards of material elsewhere
in a shoreland area shall require the submission of a shore impact plan and
issuance of a grading and filling permit. Approval of the plan shall be granted
only if the following conditions are met:
      (1)   Any filling or grading in any Type 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 wetland
shall be in conformance with the Wetland Conservation Act of 1991 and shall
require consideration of how extensively the proposed activity will affect the
following functional qualities of a wetland.
         (a)   Sediment and pollution trapping and retention.
         (b)   Storage of surface runoff to prevent or reduce flood damage.
         (c)   Fish and wildlife habitat and endangered plants and animals.
         (d)   Recreational use.
         (e)   Shoreline or bank stabilization.
         (f)   Historical significance.
      (2)   The smallest amount of bare ground is exposed for the shortest time
possible.
      (3)   Ground cover, such as mulch, is used for temporary bare soil
coverage and permanent ground cover, such as sod, is established.
      (4)   Methods to prevent erosion and trap sediment during construction
are employed.
      (5)   Altered areas are stabilized to accepted erosion control standards.
      (6)   Fill is not placed so as to create unstable slopes.
      (7)   Plans to place fill or excavated material on steep slopes are
certified by qualified professionals as to slope stability.
      (8) Alterations below the OHWL require authorization from the
Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources per M.S. §
103G.245.
      (9)   Placement of natural rock riprap, including associated grading of
the shoreline and placement of a filter blanket, is permitted if the finished
slope does not exceed three feet horizontal to one foot vertical. Permits
granted by the DNR or other agencies with applicable jurisdiction shall control
both the extent and height of rip rap placement.
      (10)   Alterations of topography shall only be permitted if accessory to
a permitted or conditional use.
   (E)   Roads, driveways and parking areas. Roads, driveways and parking areas
should meet structure setbacks. Such facilities shall not be placed within
bluff and shore impact zones when other reasonable and feasible placement
alternatives exist. If no alternatives exist, they may be placed within these
areas and must be designed to minimize adverse impacts.
   (F)   Stormwater management. The following standards shall apply:
      (1)   When possible, existing natural drainageways, wetlands, and
vegetated soil surfaces must be used to convey, store, filter, and retain
stormwater runoff before discharge into public waters.
      (2)   Development must be planned and conducted in a manner that will
minimize the extent of disturbed areas, runoff velocities, erosion potential,
and reduce and delay runoff volumes. Disturbed areas must be stabilized and
protected as soon as possible and facilities or methods used to retain sediment
on the site.
      (3)   When development density, topographic features, soil and/or
vegetation conditions are not sufficient to adequately handle stormwater runoff
using natural features and vegetation, various types of constructed facilities
such as diversions, settling basins, skimming devices, dikes, waterways, and
ponds may be used.
   (G)   Agricultural use standards. The following standards shall apply to

§ 151.49 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD).
   Residential planned unit developments shall be permitted in shoreland areas
subject to the information and procedural requirements of the city zoning code
which is adopted by reference in
Chapter 154 of this code. Densities shall be calculated in accordance with this
section.
   (A)   Minimum size. All residential PUD's shall contain at least five
dwelling units.
   (B)   Establishment of tiers for density calculation. For the purpose of
calculating dwelling unit or site density, the following shoreland tiers are
established by locating one or more lines approximately parallel to a line that
represents the ordinary high water level:
      General Development Lakes - First Tier         200 feet
      General Development Lakes - Second and Third Tier    267 feet
      Tributary Streams                   300 feet
   (C)   Residential PUD density evaluation. The procedures for determining the
“base" density of a PUD and density increase multipliers are as follows.
Allowable densities may be transferred from any tier to any other tier further
from the waterbody, but must not be transferred to any other tier closer. The
suitable area within each tier is divided by the single residential lot size
standard (8,400 sq. ft.). Suitable land shall exclude wetlands, bluffs, and
land lying below the ordinary high water level. Proposed locations and numbers
of dwelling units or sites for the residential planned unit developments are
then compared with the tier, density, and suitability analyses herein and the
design criteria in division (E) of this section.
   (D) Density increase multipliers. The following density increase multipliers
shal1 apply.
      (1)   Increases to the dwelling unit base densities previously determined
are allowable if the dimensional standards in §
151.45 are met or exceeded and the design criteria in division (E) of this
section are satisfied. The allowable density increases in division (D)(2) of
this section will only be allowed if structure setbacks from the ordinary high
water level are increased to at least 50% greater than the minimum setback, or
the impact on the waterbody is reduced an equivalent amount through vegetative
management, topography, or additional means acceptable to the city and the
setback is at least 25% greater than the minimum setback.
      (2)   Allowable dwelling unit increases for residential planned
development areas:
         Density Evaluation Tiers    Maximum density increase
                     within each tier (percent)
            First            50
            Second          100
            Third             200
            Fourth             200
            Fifth             200
   (E)   Design criteria. The following criteria will be applied to planned
unit developments within the shoreland area.
      (1)   At least 50% of the total project area shall be preserved as open
space. The open space computation shall not include road rights-of-way, or land
covered by roads, structures or parking surfaces.
      (2)   Open space shall include areas having physical characteristics
which are unsuitable for development in their natural state and areas
containing significant historic sites or unplatted cemeteries.
      (3)   Open space may contain outdoor recreational facilities for use by
the owners of residential units or the public.
      (4)   The appearance of open space areas, including topography,
vegetation and allowable uses, shall be preserved.
      (5)   Accessory structures and facilities, except water-oriented
accessory structures, must meet the required principal structure setback.
      (6)   Water-oriented accessory structures and facilities may be allowed
if they meet or exceed the provisions identified in §
151.45(B).
      (7)   The shore impact zone, based on normal structure setback, must be
included as open space. At least 50% of the shore impact zone area of existing
developments or at least 70% of the shore impact zone area of new developments
must be preserved in its natural or existing state.
   (F)   Public utilities required. PUD's shall be connected to public water
supply and sanitary sewer systems.
   (G)   Maintenance and administration. Before final approval of a PUD is
granted, the developer/owner shall provide for the preservation and
maintenance, in perpetuity, of open space and the continuation of the
development as a community.

the passage or amendment of this chapter but which is not in conformity with
the provisions of this chapter may be continued subject to the following
conditions:
   (A)   No such use shall be expanded, changed, enlarged or altered in a way
which increases its nonconformity.
   (B)   Any alteration or addition to a nonconforming structure or
nonconforming use which would result in increasing the flood damage potential
of that structure or use shall be protected to the regulatory flood protection
elevation in accordance with any of the elevation on fill or floodproofing
techniques (such as, FP-1 through FP-4 floodproofing classifications) allowable
in the State Building Code, except as further restricted in division (C) of
this section.
   (C)   The cost of any structural alterations or additions to any
nonconforming structure over the life of the structure shall not exceed 50% of

      (2)   When an ordinance violation is either discovered by or brought to
the attention of the Zoning Administrator, the Zoning Administrator shall
immediately investigate the situation and document the nature and extent of the
violation of the official control. As soon as is reasonably possible, this
information will be submitted to the appropriate Department of Natural
Resources and Federal Emergency Management Agency Regional Office along with
the community's plan of action to correct the violation to the degree possible.
      (3)   The Zoning Administrator shall notify the suspected party of the
requirements of this chapter and all other official controls and the nature and
extent of the suspected violation of these controls. If the structure or use is
under construction or development, the Zoning Administrator may order the
construction or development immediately halted until a proper permit or
approval is granted by the community. If the construction or development is
already completed, then the Zoning Administrator may either issue an order
identifying the corrective actions that must be made within a specified time
period to bring the use or structure into compliance with the official controls
or notify the responsible party to apply for an after-the-fact permit or
development approval within a specified period of time not to exceed 30 days.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.01 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to protect and promote the public
health, safety, and welfare within the city by the establishment of
comprehensive standards, regulations and procedures governing the erection, use
or display of devises serving as visual communications media. Furthermore,
enactment of the chapter will serve to preserve the residential character of
residential neighborhoods, to preserve order and cleanliness, to avoid the
appearance of clutter, to provide for necessary visual communication, to
preserve and promote a pleasant physical environment, to ensure that the
constitutionally guaranteed right of free speech is protected, to protect
public and private property, and to encourage safety upon the streets and
highways within the City of La Crescent by preserving the sight lines and
reducing distractions to motorists. Finally, these rules and regulations are
intended to support local businesses and to enhance the appeal of this area to
residents and visitors.
   (B)   The city is located at the center of three national scenic by-ways,
between bluffs, valleys and protected wetlands. These regulations are designed
to balance the need for signage with the impact of such signage on the
environment by establishing standards regarding the type, number, structure,
size, location, height, lighting and maintenance of all permitted outdoor signs
and sign structures.

   (A)   Signs that do not conform to the sign chapter, and which lack a
regular or conditional sign permit, may be ordered to be removed. Any sign in
the city which must be removed pursuant to any of the foregoing provisions,
shall be taken down and removed by the owner, agent or person having the
beneficial use of the building, structure or lot upon which such sign is
located. Such removal shall be effected within 30 days after written

sign is attached. The total expenses thereof, if not paid upon due demand,
shall be certified by the City Clerk to the Houston County Auditor for payment
as a special assessment against the land whereon such sign or structure was
located. The owner of the property from which the sign is removed shall be
presumed to be the owner of all signs thereon for purpose of implementation of
the foregoing assessment procedure.
   (B)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the earlier or
immediate removal, under the same provisions, of nonconforming signs which by
reason of their lack of appropriate maintenance, hazardous location or some
other reason are deemed by the Building Official of the city to be dilapidated,
dangerous or in violation of the herein incorporated rules and regulations of
some other authority having appropriate jurisdiction other than the city.
(Ord. 497, passed 8-10-15; Am. Ord. 531, passed 3-25-19)
§ 152.41 PERMIT PROCESS.
   If a sign requiring a sign permit under this chapter is to be placed,

modification of such sign. The process is outlined as follows.
   (A)   Permit application and fee. Permits shall be applied for on forms
approved by the City Council, obtainable at the office of the city Building
Official. Each application for a permit shall be accompanied by the required
sign permit fee and must provide the following information:
      (1)   Name, address, telephone number and status of the applicant. The
applicant must be the owner or agent of the building, structure or land to
which or upon which the sign is to be placed or installed.
      (2)   Location of building, structure or lot to which or upon which the
sign or other advertising structure is to be attached or erected.
      (3)   Dimensions of the proposed signage: area, height, and clearance
over sidewalks. Dimensions of the building to which the sign will be attached,
if applicable.
      (4)   Information relative to illumination of signage.

into place within six months of the issuance of the permit, the permit shall
lapse and be of no further effect.
(Ord. 497, passed 8-10-15; Am. Ord. 531, passed 3-25-19)
§ 152.42 VARIANCES.
   A variance is a modification or relaxation of the provisions of this chapter
and may be granted in instances where it is determined that by reason of
special and unusual circumstances unique to the individual property under
consideration, strict enforcement of this chapter would cause undue hardship,
or that strict conformity with the provisions of this chapter would be
unreasonable and granting a variance would be in keeping with the spirit and
intent of the chapter. "Undue hardship" in connection with the granting of a
variance means that the property in question cannot be reasonably used unless
regulations otherwise applicable are modified and that the hardship is due to
circumstances unique to the property and not created by the landowner. The
variance, if granted, shall not alter the essential character of the locality,
nor shall it be materially detrimental to the property owners in the vicinity.
Economic considerations alone shall not constitute an undue hardship if
reasonable use for the property exists. Applications for variances under the
chapter shall be made in a manner consistent with the rules for applying for
variances under the Zoning Ordinances.
(Ord. 497, passed 8-10-15; Am. Ord. 531, passed 3-25-19)
§ 152.43 ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Violations of the provisions of this chapter are misdemeanors and upon
conviction thereof are punishable in accordance with the laws of the State of
Minnesota. The city may, at its discretion, charge violations of this chapter
as petty misdemeanors in which case punishment upon conviction shall be in
accordance with the laws of the State of Minnesota for petty misdemeanors. The
city may institute actions in equity or at law to enjoin or abate violations
and each day a violation exists constitutes a separate offense. All violations
of this chapter are nuisances and prosecutable as such and/or subject to
injunction or abatement in an appropriate civil action.
   (B)   The Building Official or any such other official as may be designated
by City Council resolution is vested with the authority to enforce the
provisions of this chapter. Institution of enforcement as misdemeanor or petty
misdemeanor shall not preclude subsequent actions at law or in equity.

regulations hereinbefore contained, are hereby, to that extent, repealed. In
the event other regulations are consistent herewith, but one or the other more
restrictive, the more restrictive shall control. In the event any provision
hereof is declared invalid by a Court of competent jurisdiction, all other
provisions of this chapter shall remain in full force and effect.

§ 156.01 PURPOSE.
   For the purpose of this chapter, NATURAL RESOURCE EXTRACTION is the removal
and any related on site processing of sand, fill dirt, clay, or topsoil (but
not including sod production and/or removal) in quantities greater than 500
cubic yards. Such removal may be permitted by interim use permit provided the
removal is pursuant to a development agreement, an approved planned unit
development or other end use preparation for residential or commercial
development. This regulation is not intended to apply to excavations for
basements or footings nor where the Subdivision and Stormwater Pollution and
Erosion Control ordinances are sufficient in the opinion of the City Engineer.
(Ord. 508, passed 9-12-16)
§ 156.02 CONSIDERATIONS FOR INTERIM USE PERMITS.
   (A)   The Planning Commission may examine the following factors in addition
to general considerations for interim use permits prior to recommending to the
City Council the granting of an interim use permit:
   (B)   The relationship of extraction and associated activities with existing
land use(s) already taking place on the property:
      (1)   The use must be reasonably related to existing or future land use
plans; and
      (2)   A natural resources protection map and approved sketch plan may be
required in advance of granting a permit and shall be considered in both the
removal and reclamation plans.
   (C)   The impact on existing land uses in the vicinity of the property:
      (1)   The use must not create an excessive burden on existing parks,
schools, streets and other public facilities and utilities that serve or are
proposed to serve the area; and
      (2)   Existing land uses nearby must not be adversely affected
unreasonably by intrusion of noise, vibrations, glare or general unsightliness.
   (D)   Adverse impact on the properties in the vicinity of the property and
along the proposed hauling route serving the property (based on credible
evidence):
      (1)   The use must be sufficiently compatible or separated by distance or
screening from adjacent agricultural or residentially zoned or used land so
that existing homes will not be depreciated in value and there will be no
deterrence to development of vacant land; and
      (2)   The structure and site must have an appearance that will not
unreasonably create an adverse effect upon adjacent residential properties.
   (E)   The impact on pedestrian and traffic safety in the vicinity of the
property and along the proposed hauling route serving the property:
      (1)   The use must not cause traffic hazard or congestion;
      (2)   The location and number of vehicle access points; and
      (3)   The natural resource extraction site shall have direct access to
designated truck routes. The city shall set minimum roadway improvements and
maintenance obligations as a condition of the permit.
   (F)   Considerations will include, but not be limited to, topography,
safety, traffic, number of vehicle trips per hour and day and existing land
use. Trips, quantity and methods for obtaining and delivering backfill material
(if any) shall also be considered and regulated as appropriate.
   (G)   The impact on other identifiable health, safety, and welfare interests
in the city are described in further detail in §§
156.03 through
156.12.
(Ord. 508, passed 9-12-16)
§ 156.03 HOURS OF OPERATION.
   (A)   Hours of operation. Natural resource extraction shall occur only
between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 5:30 p.m., Monday through Friday. No weekend
or holiday operations will be allowed. Holidays are New Year's Day, Memorial
Day, July 4, Labor Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas. When New Year's Day, July
4, Easter or Christmas fall on a Sunday, the following Monday shall be
considered the holiday. When New Year's Day, July 4 or Christmas fall on a
Saturday the previous Friday shall be considered the holiday.
   (B)   Operators are allowed extensions to the hours of operation for
emergencies only. Operators must notify the city Building Official and receive
approval in advance of the proposed exception.
   (C)   The City Council must approve other exceptions to the hours of
operation, such as weekend operation and other evening work.
(Ord. 508, passed 9-12-16)
§ 156.04 WATER QUALITY/STORMWATER DRAINAGE.
   (A)   The use must not cause significant adverse impact to surface or ground
water resources.
   (B)   Dewatering to obtain materials intersecting the groundwater shall not
be allowed. The use of equipment such as draglines, trackhoes and backhoes to
obtain materials intersecting groundwater shall not be allowed.
   (C)   Increased stormwater run-off must be retained on-site with retention
or detention ponds.
   (D)   All activities on the subject property with the potential to impact
water quality will be conducted in a manner consistent with required permits
issued by state and federal agencies. The Planning Commission may require other
standards it deems reasonably necessary.
(Ord. 508, passed 9-12-16)
§ 156.05 AIR QUALITY/DUST CONTROL.
   (A)   Owner/operators will be responsible for dust control on all gravel
roads utilized by trucks hauling to or from the permitted mineral extraction
facility. Dust control will be required when conditions warrant it and the
number of one-way truck trips from the natural resource extraction site exceed
three per hour. The city reserves the right to require dust control on any haul
route within the city or those bordering the city.
   (B)   An owner/operator shall sufficiently prevent or clean up carryout and
trackout on paved public roads or the paved shoulders of a paved public road.
The use of blower devices, or dry rotary brushes or brooms for removal of
carryout and trackout on public roads is expressly prohibited. Flushing with
water may be utilized if curbs or gutters are not present and where the use of
water will not result as a source of trackout material or result in adverse
impacts on storm water drainage systems or violate any National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System permit program. Trackout-control devices are
highly encouraged and may be required as a condition of receiving a permit.
   (C)   The city shall require dust control on the extraction site when it is
determined that airborne dust from extraction areas, stockpiles or internal
roadways creates a public nuisance or otherwise adversely impacts surrounding
lands. Remedies to dust control may include watering, berming, landscaping and
enclosures for processing equipment, and any other means deemed necessary by
the city.
   (D)   All activities on the subject property with the potential to impact
air quality will be conducted in a manner consistent with operating permits
issued by state and federal agencies. The Planning Commission may require other
standards it deems reasonably necessary.
(Ord. 508, passed 9-12-16)
§ 156.06 SITE SECURITY.
   Regular fencing or a gate in good repair may be required around the entire
permitted area of operation.
(Ord. 508, passed 9-12-16)
§ 156.07 NOISE LEVELS.
   (A)   A 24-hour baseline audiogram collected at the property line may be
required in areas adjacent to a residential zone or within 2,500 feet of a
residence.
   (B)   Permissible maximum noise levels at the property line will be
consistent with, and at no time exceed, the most current occupational noise
exposure standards established by the Occupation Safety Hazard and Health
Administration (OSHA).
(Ord. 508, passed 9-12-16)
§ 156.08 SETBACKS.
   (A)   No extraction activity may occur within 1,000 feet of any dwelling and
within 50 feet of any adjacent property line, road right-of-way or public
utility except by adoption of specific conditions (see division (B)). Screeners
or other processing equipment must be specified in the application and must be
specifically approved. If approved, such equipment may not be located closer
than 1,000 feet from a dwelling nor closer than 100 feet from any adjacent
property line, road right-of-way or public utility. Setbacks from existing
dwellings shall take precedence over setbacks for road right-of-way, adjacent
property line and public utility. If the processing equipment is placed within
an enclosed structure, the Planning Commission may consider shorter setback
distances. Grading plans affecting pipelines or power line corridors will be
evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The city may waive setback requirements when
the common boundary is not within 1,000 feet of a residence, and both property
owners have agreed to a common reclamation plan and have a written agreement
with the city establishing responsibility for reclamation.
   (B)   Notwithstanding the setback requirements set forth above, at the time
of permit review and issuance, the city may impose lesser setback requirements
if the Planning Commission finds the following:
      (1)   Practical difficulties exist in complying with the setback
requirements set forth above; and
      (2)   The protections afforded surrounding lands are not significantly
lessened by the reduced setbacks when taking into account the following:
         (a)   The scope and size of the natural resource extraction;
         (b)   The time of day and duration that the extraction will occur in
proximity to surrounding lands;
         (c)   Reduced operating hours, limitations on consecutive days, or
restricted seasons of operation or additional berming, screening, special
fencing, type of equipment used, or other measures can be imposed to ameliorate
the impact of mining in closer proximity to the surrounding lands than would be
allowed by the setbacks stated above;
         (d)   The lesser setbacks are reasonable in light of all
circumstances; and
         (e)   There is a substantial volume of minerals or the nature of the
materials varies in the more restrictive setback areas and it is reasonable to
extract the substantial volume of natural resource in the more restrictive
setback areas in light of the relatively small volume of natural resource that
can be extracted on the remainder of the subject property.
   (C)   If the city receives a request for lessened setbacks, then
consideration of such request shall be referred to the Planning Commission for
a recommendation unless such consideration was approved as part of the initial
review.

§ 156.10 RECLAMATION PLAN.
   (A)   A reclamation plan must include the grading plans, on-site topsoil
replacement, seeding, mulching, erosion control and sedimentation control
specifications for each phase and the final site restoration. The operator and
owner must follow the reclamation plan approved in the interim use permit. The
following minimum standards and conditions apply:
      (1)   The peaks and depressions of the area shall be reduced to a surface
which will result in a gently rolling topography in substantial conformity with
an accepted end land use plan or to the land area immediately surrounding, and
which will minimize erosion due to rainfall. No graded slope shall exceed a 4:
1 ratio (25%). The final grade slope shall commence at the property boundary.
Berms will be removed to the original elevation of the land, unless the
Planning Commission has approved a different elevation as part of the end use
plan.
      (2)   Excavations made to a water producing depth must meet the following
requirements:
         (a)   The depth of the excavation for lake end-use must not be less
than ten feet nor more than 30 feet below the natural low water mark, as
determined by the Planning Commission after consultation by the City Engineer
and/or the Department of Natural Resources.
         (b)   The depth of the excavation for a wetland end-use shall be from
one foot above the natural low water mark to a depth not to exceed one foot
below the natural low water mark, as determined by the Planning Commission
after consultation by the City Engineer and/or the Department of Natural
Resources.
         (c)   A combination of the requirements of divisions (1) and (2) as
approved by the city.
         (d)   All banks shall be sloped to the water line at a slope that
shall not be steeper than ten feet horizontal to one foot vertical (10:1) for a
lake end-use, and ten feet horizontal to one foot vertical (10:1) for a wetland
end-use.
         (e)   All banks shall be sodded or surfaced with soil of a quality at
least equal to the topsoil of land areas immediately surrounding and to a depth
of at least six inches.
         (f)   Such topsoil as required by the preceding division shall be
planted with trees, shrubs, legumes or grasses.
         (g)   All materials used for back-filling in any area of the
reclamation shall be tested and be free of all contaminants, and shall be non-
noxious, non-flammable and non-combustible.
      (3)   Excavating not made to a water producing depth, but which must be
graded or back-filled, shall meet the following requirements:
         (a)   All materials used for back-filling in any area of the
reclamation shall be tested and be free of all contaminants, and shall be non-
noxious, non-flammable and non-combustible.
         (b)   The graded or back-filled area shall not collect or permit
stagnant water to remain therein.
         (c)   Such graded or back-filled area shall be sodded or surfaced with
soil of a quality at least equal to the topsoil of land areas immediately
surrounding, and to a depth of at least six inches.
         (d)   Such topsoil as required by the preceding division shall be
planted with trees, shrubs, legumes or grasses.
      (4)   Seeding and mulching shall be consistent with Minnesota Department
of Transportation specifications for rights-of-way. Exceptions to seeding and
mulching include areas returned to agricultural production.
      (5)   Soil restoration including any necessary soil compaction, seeding
and mulching must occur within each phase as soon as final grades, or interim
grades identified in the phasing plans, have been reached. Exceptions to
seeding and mulching include the processing, storage and staging areas within
each phase.
      (6)   Unless otherwise amended or approved by the city, all final grades
and site restoration efforts shall be consistent with the reclamation plan.
      (7)   When the end-use is some form of open space, the type of vegetative
re-growth must provide appropriate habitat for wildlife consistent with the
form of end-use.
      (8)   The end-use plan shall consider the safe use of the property. The
end-use plan shall be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and Zoning
Ordinance.
      (9)   Within nine months after the completion of natural resource
extraction or after termination of the interim use permit, or any other
required permit, all equipment, vehicles, machinery, materials, stock piles of
extracted materials, and debris shall be removed from the subject property.
      (10)   For any phase of a phased removal plan, within three months after
completion of natural resource extraction for that phase, reclamation must be
completed. If the permit is terminated earlier, reclamation must be completed
within three months after termination. If reclamation is not completed within
three months, the city shall have the right to obtain a court order permitting
the completion and shall have with court permission the right to enter the
property and cause the reclamation plan to be completed and place any and all
reasonable costs onto the tax role for such property.
(Ord. 508, passed 9-12-16)
§ 156.11 PUBLIC INTEREST.
   The overall public interest in the extraction of the specific natural
resources on the property shall be considered. Compliance with the city's
Comprehensive Plan and general community benefit are material considerations.
(Ord. 508, passed 9-12-16)
§ 156.12 COMPLIANCE.
   The applicant shall demonstrate compliance with applicable sections of §
155.01, which adopts by reference Storm Water and Erosion Control regulations.
The purpose of the regulations are to use the fullest current understanding of
good design, architecture, landscape architecture and civil engineering to
control or eliminate storm water pollution along with soil erosion and
sedimentation within the city. They establish standards and specifications for
conservation practices, planning activities, and construction activities which
minimize storm water pollution, soil erosion, and sedimentation. They protect
public health and property while encouraging retention of natural topographic
features and existing vegetation and encouraging alternative approaches to
conventional flatland development practices on steep slopes, including
imaginative and innovative techniques suited to the natural surroundings to
enhance the existing and future appearances of hillsides.
