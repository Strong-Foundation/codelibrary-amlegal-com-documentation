   (A)   Every ordinance shall be presented in writing and shall receive two
readings by the City Manager-Clerk before the Council previous to its passage,
but shall not be read twice at the same meeting unless the rules are suspended
for that purpose. Every ordinance introduced or considered shall be recorded in
the minutes by title.
   (B)   (1)   This first reading of an ordinance shall be by title only and
unless the rules are suspended, each member of the Council shall be furnished a
copy of the ordinance before the next Council meeting. No vote on the first
reading will be required except where a public hearing is required before
passage of an ordinance.
      (2)   In cases where a public hearing is required, the first reading must
pass by a majority vote of the Council members then and there present before a
public hearing will be called, and if the ordinance shall fail to receive a
majority vote to pass in the first reading, no public hearing will be called
and the ordinance shall be deemed to have been defeated. A vote in favor of the
passage of the first reading of the ordinance shall not be deemed a vote in
favor of the ordinance on the second reading, nor shall a Council member voting
for an approval of the first reading be required to vote in favor of the
ordinance on the second reading. Nothing in this section shall be construed to
deny the right to a public hearing where a citizen has a right to a hearing
under law. The first reading of an ordinance shall be informational in nature
only and unless the rules are suspended shall not be subject to debate at the
first reading.
   (C)   The second reading of an ordinance shall be by section headings only,
at which time amendments, if any, may be offered; but the reading of any
sections shall not prevent a Council member from offering amendments to a
previous section. If no amendments are made, the presiding officer shall submit
the ordinance to a vote; but if amendments are made, the presiding officer
shall so report and each section shall be read as amended before a vote upon
the ordinance is taken.
   (D)   All motions shall be recorded in the minutes and stated in full before
the presiding officer submits them to a vote. All petitions and other
communications addressed to the Council shall be in writing and shall be read
in full upon presentation of the same to the Council. They shall then be filed
in the office of the City Manager-Clerk.
   (E)   Every ordinance and resolution by the Council shall be signed by the
Mayor, attested by the City Manager-Clerk, and filed by him or her in the
Ordinance or Resolution Book. Proof of publication of every ordinance shall be
attached to and filed with the ordinance.
   (F)   Every ordinance or resolution repealing a previous ordinance or
resolution or a section or division thereof shall give the number, if any, and
the title of the ordinance or resolution to be repealed in whole or in part. No
ordinance or resolution or division thereof shall be amended by reference to
the title alone, but the amending ordinance or resolution shall set forth in
full each section or division to be amended.

preceding Council meeting.

on any regional or state conference for emergency management. The Director
shall develop proposed mutual aid agreements with other political subdivisions
of the state for reciprocal emergency management aid and assistance in an
emergency too great to be dealt with unassisted, and shall present these
agreements to the Council for its action. These arrangements shall be
consistent with the State Emergency Plan.
   (B)   The Director shall make studies and surveys of the human resources,
industries, resources, and facilities of the city as deemed necessary to
determine their adequacy for emergency management and to plan for their most
efficient use in time of an emergency or disaster. The Director shall establish
the economic stabilization systems and measures, service staffs, boards, and
sub-boards required, in accordance with state and federal plans and directions,
subject to the approval of the Mayor.
   (C)   The Director shall prepare a comprehensive emergency plan for the
emergency preparedness of the city and shall present the plan to the Council
for its approval. When the Council has approved the plan, it shall be the duty
of all city agencies and all emergency preparedness forces of the city to
perform the duties and functions assigned by the plan as approved. The plan may
be modified in like manner from time to time. The Director shall coordinate the
emergency management activities of the city to the end that they shall be
consistent and fully integrated with the emergency plans of the federal
government and the state and correlated with emergency plans of the county and
other political subdivisions within the state.
   (D)   In accordance with the State and City Emergency Plan, the Director
shall institute training programs and public information programs and conduct
practice warning alerts and emergency exercises as may be necessary to assure
prompt and effective operation of the City Emergency Plan when a disaster
occurs.
   (E)   The Director shall utilize the personnel, services, equipment,
supplies, and facilities of existing departments and agencies of the city to
the maximum extent practicable. The officers and personnel of all city
departments and agencies shall, to the maximum extent practicable, cooperate
with and extend services and facilities to the city’s emergency management
organization and to the Governor upon request. The head of each department in
cooperation with the Director shall be responsible for the planning and
programming of those emergency activities as will involve the utilization of
the facilities of the department.
   (F)   The Director shall, in cooperation with those city departments
affected, assist in the organizing, recruiting, and training of emergency
management personnel, which may be required on a volunteer basis to carry out
the emergency plans of the city and state. To the extent that emergency
personnel are recruited to augment a regular city department for emergencies,
they shall be assigned to the departments or agencies and shall be under the
administration and control of the department.
   (G)   Consistent with the state emergency services law, the Director shall
coordinate the activity of municipal emergency management organizations within
the city and assist in establishing and conducting training programs as
required to assure emergency operational capability in the several services as
provided by M.S. § 12.25, as it may be amended from time to time.

preparedness activities when requested by the Mayor.

   (A)   A local emergency may be declared only by the Mayor or his or her
legal successor. It shall not be continued for a period in excess of three days
except by or with the consent of the Council. Any order or proclamation
declaring, continuing, or terminating a local emergency shall be given prompt
and general publicity and shall be filed in the office of the City Manager-
Clerk.
   (B)   A declaration of a local emergency shall invoke necessary portions of
the response and recovery aspects of applicable local or inter-jurisdictional
disaster plans, and may authorize aid and assistance thereunder.
   (C)   No jurisdictional agency or official may declare a local emergency
unless expressly authorized by the agreement under which the agency functions.
However, an inter-jurisdictional disaster agency shall provide aid and services
in accordance with the agreement under which it functions.
Penalty, see § 32.99
§ 32.06 EMERGENCY REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Whenever necessary, to meet a declared emergency or to prepare for an
emergency for which adequate regulations have not been adopted by the Governor
or the Council, the Council may by resolution promulgate regulations,
consistent with applicable federal or state law or regulation, respecting: the
conduct of persons and the use of property during emergencies; the repair,
maintenance, and safeguarding of essential public services; emergency health,
fire, and safety regulations; drills or practice periods required for
preliminary training; and all other matters which are required to protect
public safety, health, and welfare in declared emergencies.
   (B)   Every resolution of emergency regulations shall be in writing; shall
be dated; shall refer to the particular emergency to which it pertains, if so
limited; and shall be filed in the office of the City Manager-Clerk. A copy
shall be kept posted and available for public inspection during business hours.
Notice of the existence of these regulations and their availability for
inspection at the City Manager-Clerk’s office shall be conspicuously posted at
the front of the City Hall or other headquarters of the city, or at other
places in the affected area as the City Council shall designate in the
resolution. By resolution, the Council may modify or rescind a regulation.
   (C)   The Council may rescind any regulation by resolution at any time. If
not sooner rescinded, every regulation shall expire at the end of 30 days after
its effective date or at the end of the emergency to which it relates,
whichever comes first. Any resolution, rule, or regulation inconsistent with an
emergency regulation promulgated by the Council shall be suspended during the
period of time and to the extent conflict exists.
   (D)   During a declared emergency, the city is, under the provisions of M.S.
§ 12.31, as it may be amended from time to time and notwithstanding any
statutory or Charter provision to the contrary, empowered, through its Council,
acting within or without the corporate limits of the city, to enter into
contracts and incur obligations necessary to combat the disaster by protecting
the health and safety of persons and property and providing emergency
assistance to the victims of a disaster. The city may exercise these powers in
the light of the exigencies of the disaster without compliance with the time-
consuming procedures and formalities prescribed by law pertaining to the
performance of public work, entering rental equipment agreements, purchase of
supplies and materials, limitations upon tax levies, and the appropriation and
expenditure of public funds, including, but not limited to, publication of
resolutions, publication of calls for bids, provisions of personnel laws and
rules, provisions relating to low bids, and requirement for bids.
Penalty, see § 32.99

§ 35.01 PURPOSE.
   Administrative offense procedures established pursuant to this chapter are
intended to provide the public and the city with an informal, cost-effective
and expeditious alternative to traditional criminal charges for issuance of
worthless checks. The procedures are intended to be voluntary on the part of
those who have been charged with administrative offenses. At any time prior to
the payment of the administrative penalty as is provided for hereafter, the
individual may withdraw from participation in the procedures, in which event
the city may bring criminal charges in accordance with the law. Likewise, the
city, in its discretion, may choose not to initiate an administrative offense
and may bring criminal charges in the first instance. In the event a party
participates in the administrative offense procedures, but does not pay the
monetary penalty which may be imposed, the city will seek to collect costs of
the administrative offense procedures as part of a subsequent criminal sentence
in the event the party is charged and is adjudicated guilty of the criminal
violations.
(Ord. 362, passed 2-16-06)
§ 35.02 ADMINISTRATIVE OFFENSE DEFINED.

code, shall, upon determining that there has been a violation, notify the
violator. The notice shall set forth the nature, date and time of the
violation, the name of the official issuing the notice and the amount of the
scheduled penalty.
(Ord. 362, passed 2-16-06)
§ 35.04 PAYMENT.
   Once the notice is given, the alleged violator may, within ten business days
of the time of issuance of the notice, pay the amount set forth on the schedule
of penalties for the violation or notify the city in writing that they contest
the violation. The penalty may be paid in person or by mail, and payment shall
be deemed to be an admission of the violation.
(Ord. 362, passed 2-16-06)
§ 35.05 CONTESTED CASE.
   Any person contesting an administrative offense shall have the
administrative penalty vacated and criminal charges may be filed in accordance
with the law allowing them the opportunity to contest the violation in the
court system.
(Ord. 362, passed 2-16-06)
§ 35.06 FAILURE TO PAY.
   In the event a party charged with an administrative offense fails to pay the
penalty and does not notify the city that they are contesting the violation, a
misdemeanor or petty misdemeanor charge may be brought against the alleged
violator in accordance with applicable statutes or ordinances. If the penalty
is paid or if an individual is found to not have committed the administrative
offense by the courts, no such charge may be brought by the city for the same
violation.
(Ord. 362, passed 2-16-06)
§ 35.07 DISPOSITION OF PENALTIES.
   All penalties collected pursuant to this chapter shall be paid to the city's
Finance Director and may be deposited in the city's general fund.
(Ord. 362, passed 2-16-06)
§ 35.08 ESTABLISHMENT OF OFFENSES AND PENALTIES.

for such offenses may be established by resolution of the City Council from
time to time. Copies of such resolutions shall be maintained in the office of
the City Clerk.

(Ord. 303, passed 4-21-88)
§ 53.072 DEDUCT METERS.
   If a person feels that a significant amount of metered water does not reach
the sanitary sewer, he or she can at his or her own expense, with approval of
the approving authority, install additional meters or metered services as are
necessary to calculate the volume of water not discharged to the sanitary
sewer. Metered water not discharged to the sanitary sewers shall not be subject
to sewer service charges. Requests to install additional meters must be made in
writing to the approving authority.
(Ord. 303, passed 4-21-88)

§ 53.074 DOMESTIC STRENGTH DISCHARGE; SERVICE CHARGE FORMULA.
   (A)   The sewer service charge for normal domestic strength discharges shall
be computed in accordance with the formula presented below:
      T = FC + (V x COV) + (V x CDV) + SCi
   (B)   For the above formula:
      (1)   T = total sewer service charge;
      (2)   FC + (V x COV) = user charge;
      (3)   (V x CDV) = debt service charge;
      (4)   FC = fixed charge;
      (5)   COV = charge per 1,000 gallons for OM&R costs, less revenues
generated through surcharges;
      (6)   CDV = charge per 1,000 gallons for debt service costs;
      (7)   V = billable wastewater volume in 1,000 gallons; and
      (8)   SCi = surcharge, as described in § 53.078, for users with higher
than normal domestic strength waste.
   (C)   (1)   The value of COV is determined by dividing the yearly estimated
operation, maintenance, and replacement costs, less fixed administrative costs,
by the annual billable wastewater flow;
      (2)   The value of CDV is determined by dividing the yearly debt service
charge for the bond by the annual billable wastewater flow; and
      (3)   The value of FC is determined by dividing the yearly fixed
administrative costs of operation and maintenance by the total number of
billings.
(Ord. 303, passed 4-21-88)
§ 53.075 USER CATEGORY REASSIGNMENT.
   The approving authority will reassign sewer users into appropriate sewer
service charge categories if wastewater flow monitoring and sampling programs
or other related information indicate a change of categories is necessary.
(Ord. 303, passed 4-21-88)
§ 53.076 OPERATION, MAINTENANCE, REPLACEMENT, AND DEBT SERVICE FUNDS.
   (A)   All revenues collected for the replacement fund, operation and
maintenance and debt service, of the sanitary and storm water sewer service
must be used solely for the replacement fund, operation and maintenance and
debt service of the sanitary and storm water sewer service.
   (B)   All revenues collected for the replacement fund, operation and
maintenance and debt service, of the wastewater collection and treatment
facilities must be used solely for the replacement fund, operation and
maintenance and debt service of the wastewater collection and treatment
facilities.
(Ord. 303, passed 4-21-88; Am. Ord. 462, passed 6-18-20)
§ 53.077 TOXIC POLLUTANTS; SURCHARGE.
   Any person discharging toxic pollutants which cause an increase in the cost
of managing the effluent or sludge from the municipality’s wastewater treatment
facility shall pay for those increased costs, as may be determined by the
approving authority.
(Ord. 303, passed 4-21-88)
§ 53.078 WASTES OF GREATER THAN NORMAL DOMESTIC STRENGTH.
   (A)   The sewer service charges established in this chapter shall not
prevent the assessment of additional charges, or surcharges, to users who
discharge wastes with concentrations greater than normal domestic strength or
wastes of unusual character, or contractual agreements with these users, as
long as the following conditions are met:
      (1)   The user pays operation, maintenance and replacement costs in
proportion to the user’s proportionate contribution of wastewater flows and
loadings to the treatment plant, and no user is charged at a rate less than
that of normal domestic strength wastewater.
      (2)   The measurements of these wastes are conducted according to the
latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater
in a manner acceptable to the city as provided for in §
53.057.
   (B)   Surcharges shall be computed in the following manner:
      SCi = (ICi - NCi) x Q x 8.34 x CPi
   (C)   For the formula above:
      (1)   SCi = surcharge for BOD, TSS, or other constituent as determined by
the city;
      (2)   ICi = average concentration of BOD, TSS, or other constituent, in
the user’s wastewater discharge;
      (3)   NCi = normal domestic strength concentration of BOD, TSS, or other
constituent;
      (4)   Q = billable wastewater volume, in million gallons;
      (5)   CPi = charge per pound of BOD, TSS or other constituent; and
      (6)   The value of CPi is determined by dividing the yearly estimated
operation, maintenance, and replacement costs attributable to BOD, TSS, or
other significant waste constituent as determined by the city, by the total
annual load of that constituent to the wastewater treatment facilities, in
pounds.
(Ord. 303, passed 4-21-88)

   (A)   Penalties. Sewer service charges levied by the city against the sewer
users in accordance with this chapter shall be a debt due to the city and shall
be a lien upon the property. If this debt is not paid within ten days after the
fifteenth day of the month in which the bill is issued, it shall be deemed
delinquent and may be placed on the next year’s tax roll and be collected as
other taxes are collected. Change of ownership or occupancy of premises found
delinquent shall not be cause for reducing or eliminating these penalties.
   (B)   Civil action. Any charges levied pursuant to this chapter and which
have been properly sent to the occupant or owner and not paid, may be recovered
in a civil action by the city in any court of competent jurisdiction.
(Ord. 303, passed 4-21-88)
§ 53.081 CITY REVIEW; AUDIT; RATE NOTIFICATION; RECORDS.
   (A)   Annual audit. The municipality shall annually review the wastewater
contribution of its sewer users, the operation, maintenance, and replacement
expenses of the wastewater collection and treatment facilities, and the sewer
service charge system in accordance with those procedures established by the

91.21; and
      (3)   State that failure of the owner or lienholders to exercise their

91.23.
   (B)   Notice by mail or publication. The notice shall be sent by mail to the

Registrar of Motor Vehicles which shall be sufficient title to dispose of the
vehicle. The receipt shall also entitle the purchaser to register the vehicle
and receive a certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and claims of
ownership. Before a vehicle is issued a new certificate of title, it must
receive a motor vehicle safety check.
   (B)   Unsold vehicles. Abandoned or junk vehicles not sold by the city or
public impound lots pursuant to division (A) of this section shall be disposed
of in accordance with §

agency.
§ 91.24 DISPOSAL AUTHORITY.
   The city may contract with others or may utilize its own equipment and
personnel for the inventory of impounded motor vehicles and abandoned scrap
metal and may utilize its own equipment and personnel for the collection,
storage and transportation of these vehicles and abandoned scrap metal. The
city may utilize its own equipment and personnel only for the collection and
storage of not more than five abandoned or unauthorized vehicles without
advertising for or receiving bids in any 120-day period.
§ 91.25 CONTRACTS; REIMBURSEMENT BY MPCA.
   (A)   MPCA review and approval. If the city proposes to enter into a
contract with a person licensed by the MPCA pursuant to this section or a
contract pursuant to §
91.24, the MPCA may review the proposed contract before it is entered into by
the city, to determine whether it conforms to the MPCA's plan for solid waste
management and is in compliance with MPCA rules. A contract that does so
conform may be approved by the MPCA and entered into by the city. Where a
contract has been approved, the MPCA may reimburse the city for the costs
incurred under the contract that have not been reimbursed under §
91.23. Except as otherwise provided in §
91.24, the MPCA shall not approve any contract that has been entered into
without prior notice to and request for bids from all persons duly licensed by
the MPCA to be a party to a disposal contract pursuant to M.S. § 116.07, as it
may be amended from time to time; does not provide for a full performance bond;
or does not provide for total collection and transportation of abandoned motor
vehicles, except that the MPCA may approve a contract covering solely
collection or transportation of abandoned motor vehicles where the MPCA
determines total collection and transportation to be impracticable and where
all other requirements herein have been met and the unit of government, after
proper notice and request for bids, has not received any bid for total
collection and transportation of abandoned motor vehicles.
   (B)    The city may perform work. If the city utilizes its own equipment and
personnel pursuant to its authority under §
91.24, and the use of the equipment and personnel conforms to the MPCA's plan
for solid waste management and is in compliance with MPCA rules, the city may
be reimbursed by the MPCA for reasonable costs incurred which are not
reimbursed under §
91.23.
   (C)   The city required to contract work. The MPCA may demand that the city
contract for the disposal of abandoned motor vehicles and other scrap metal
pursuant to the MPCA's plan for solid waste disposal. If the city fails to
contract within 180 days of the demand, the MPCA, through the Department of
Administration and on behalf of the city, may contract with any person duly
licensed by the MPCA for the disposal.

completed within the dates specified in the permit, increased by as many days
as work could not be done because of circumstances beyond the control of the
permittee or when work was prohibited as unseasonal or unreasonable under this
subchapter.
   (B)   Patch and restoration. The permittee shall patch its own work. The
city may choose either to have the permittee restore the right-of-way or to
restore the right-of-way itself.
      (1)   City restoration. If the city restores the right-of-way, the
permittee shall pay the costs thereof within 30 days of billing. If following
the restoration, the pavement settles due to the permittee's improper
backfilling, the permittee shall pay to the city, within 30 days of billing,
all costs associated with having to correct the defective work.

permittee upon notification from the Manager-Clerk, Utilities Superintendent or
other person designated by the Council, shall correct all restoration work to
the extent necessary, using the method required by the Manager-Clerk, Utilities
Superintendent or other person designated by the Council. The work shall be
completed within five calendar days of the receipt of the notice from the

Council, not including days during which work cannot be done because of
circumstances constituting force majeure or days when work is prohibited as
unseasonal or unreasonable under this subchapter.
   (E)   Failure to restore. If the permittee fails to restore the right-of-way
in the manner and to the condition required by the Manager-Clerk, Utilities
Superintendent or other person designated by the Council, or fails to
satisfactorily and timely complete all restoration required by the Manager-
Clerk, Utilities Superintendent or other person designated by the Council, the
Manager-Clerk, Utilities Superintendent or other person designated by the
Council at his or her option may do the work. In that event the permittee shall

way. If the permittee fails to pay as required, the city may exercise its
rights under the construction performance bond.
   (F)   Degradation fee in lieu of restoration. In lieu of right-of-way
restoration, a right-of-way user may elect to pay a degradation fee as

responsibilities.

permit must be obstructed or excavated must before working in that greater area
make application for a permit extension and pay any additional fees required
thereby, and be granted a new permit or permit extension.
   (B)   Limitation on dates. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the dates
specified in the permit. No permittee may begin its work before the permit
start date or, except as provided herein, continue working after the end date.
If a permittee does not finish the work by the permit end date, it must apply
for a new permit for the additional time it needs, and receive the new permit
or an extension of the old permit before working after the end date of the
previous permit. This supplementary application must be submitted before the
permit end date.
§ 92.09 DENIAL OF PERMIT.

designated by the Council may issue an order to the permittee for any work
which does not conform to the terms of the permit or other applicable
standards, conditions, or codes. The order shall state that failure to correct
the violation will be cause for revocation of the permit. Within ten days after
issuance of the order, the permittee shall present proof to the Clerk,
Utilities Superintendent or other person designated by the Council that the
violation has been corrected. If proof has not been presented within the
required time, the Manager-Clerk, Utilities Superintendent or other person
designated by the Council may revoke the permit pursuant to §
92.14.
§ 92.12 WORK DONE WITHOUT A PERMIT.
   (A)   Emergency situations.

are necessary to respond to the emergency. Within two business days after the
occurrence of the emergency, the owner shall apply for the necessary permits,
pay the fees associated therewith and fulfill the rest of the requirements
necessary to bring itself into compliance with this chapter for the actions it
took in response to the emergency.
      (2)   If the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding facilities, the
city will attempt to contact the local representative of each facility owner
affected, or potentially affected, by the emergency. In any event, the city may
take whatever action it deems necessary to respond to the emergency, the cost
of which shall be borne by the person whose facilities occasioned the
emergency.
   (B)   Non-emergency situations. Except in an emergency, any person who,
without first having obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or excavates a
right-of-way must subsequently obtain a permit, and as a penalty pay double the
normal fee for the permit, pay double all the other fees required by this code,
deposit with the city the fees necessary to correct any damage to the right-of-
way and comply with all of the requirements of this chapter.
§ 92.13 SUPPLEMENTARY NOTIFICATION.

§ 92.14 REVOCATION OF PERMITS.
   (A)   Substantial breach. The city reserves its right, as provided herein,
to revoke any right-of-way permit, without a fee refund if there is a
substantial breach of the terms and conditions of any statute, ordinance, rule
or regulation, or any material condition of the permit. A substantial breach by
the permittee shall include, but shall not be limited, to the following:
      (1)   The violation of any material provision of the right-of-way permit;
      (2)   An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the right-
of-way permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit
upon the city or its citizens;
      (3)   Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a
right-of-way permit;
      (4)   The failure to complete the work in a timely manner; unless a
permit extension is obtained or unless the failure to complete work is due to
reasons beyond the permittee's control; or
      (5)   The failure to correct, in a timely manner, work that does not
conform to a condition indicated on an order issued pursuant to § 92.11.
   (B)   Written notice of breach. If the city determines that the permittee
has committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any statute,
ordinance, rule, regulation or any condition of the permit the city shall make
a written demand upon the permittee to remedy that violation. The demand shall
state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. A
substantial breach, as stated above, will allow the city, at its discretion, to
place additional or revised conditions on the permit to mitigate and remedy the
breach.
   (C)   Response to notice of breach.  Within 24 hours of receiving
notification of the breach, the permittee shall provide the city with a plan,
acceptable to the city, that will cure the breach. The permittee's failure to
so contact the city, or the permittee's failure to submit an acceptable plan,
or the permittee's failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be
cause for immediate revocation of the permit.

way, or any particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of
facility that is or, pursuant to current technology, the city expects will
someday be located within the right-of-way. All excavation, obstruction, or
other permits issued by the city involving the installation or replacement of
facilities shall designate the proper corridor for the facilities at issue.

when necessary to protect the right-of-way and its current use, the Manager-
Clerk, Utilities Superintendent or other person designated by the Council shall
have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional
facilities within the right-of-way. In making those decisions, the Manager-
Clerk, Utilities Superintendent or other person designated by the Council shall
strive to the extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users
of the right-of-way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the
public interest, the public's needs for the particular utility service, the
condition of the right-of-way, the time of year with respect to essential

required. The costs associated therewith will be billed to that registrant and
must be paid within 30 days from the date of billing. Each facility owner shall
be responsible for the cost of repairing any facilities in the right-of-way
which it or its facilities damages. Each facility owner shall be responsible
for the cost of repairing any damage to the facilities of another registrant
caused during the city's response to an emergency occasioned by that owner’s
facilities.
§ 92.18 RIGHT-OF-WAY VACATION.
   If the city vacates a right-of-way which contains the facilities of a
registrant, the registrant’s rights in the vacated right-of-way are governed by

   Any person who has abandoned facilities in any right-of-way shall remove
them from that right-of-way if required in conjunction with other right-of-way
repair, excavation, or construction, unless this requirement is waived by the
Manager-Clerk, Utilities Superintendent or other person designated by the
Council.
§ 92.21 APPEAL.
   A right-of-way user that has been denied registration; has been denied a
permit; has had permit revoked; or believes that the fees imposed are invalid,

Department, shall enforce the provisions relating to nuisances. Any peace
officer shall have the power to inspect private premises and take all
reasonable precautions to prevent the commission and maintenance of public
nuisances.
§ 94.20 ABATEMENT.
   (A)   Notice. Written notice of violation; notice of the time, date, place,
and subject of any hearing before the City Council; notice of City Council
order; and notice of motion for summary enforcement hearing shall be given as
set forth in this section.
      (1)   Notice of violation. Written notice of violation shall be served by
a peace officer on the owner of record or occupant of the premises either in
person or by certified or registered mail. If the premises are not occupied,
the owner of record is unknown, or the owner of record or occupant refuses to
accept notice of violation, notice of violation shall be served by posting it
on the premises.
      (2)   Notice of City Council hearing. Written notice of any City Council
hearing to determine or abate a nuisance shall be served on the owner of record
and occupant of the premises either in person or by certified or registered
mail. If the premises are not occupied, the owner of record is unknown, or the

hearing, notice of City Council hearing shall be served by posting it on the
premises.
      (3)   Notice of City Council order. Except for those cases determined by
the city to require summary enforcement, written notice of any City Council
order shall be made as provided in M.S. § 463.17 (Hazardous and Substandard

is being maintained or exists on the premises in the city, the officer shall
notify in writing the owner of record or occupant of the premises of that fact
and order that the nuisance be terminated or abated. The notice of violation
shall specify the steps to be taken to abate the nuisance and the time within
which the nuisance is to be abated. If the notice of violation is not complied
with within the time specified, the officer shall report that fact forthwith to
the City Council. Thereafter, the City Council may, after notice to the owner
or occupant and an opportunity to be heard, determine that the condition
identified in the notice of violation is a nuisance and further order that if
the nuisance is not abated within the time prescribed by the City Council, the
city may seek injunctive relief by serving a copy of the City Council order and
notice of motion for summary enforcement.
   (C)   Emergency procedure; summary enforcement. In cases of emergency, where
delay in abatement required to complete the notice and procedure requirements
set forth in divisions (A) and (B) of this section will permit a continuing
nuisance to unreasonably endanger public health, safety, or welfare, the City
Council may order summary enforcement and abate the nuisance. To proceed with
summary enforcement, the officer shall determine that a public nuisance exists
or is being maintained on premises in the city and that delay in abatement of
the nuisance will unreasonably endanger public health, safety, or welfare. The
officer shall notify in writing the occupant or owner of the premises of the
nature of the nuisance and of the city’s intention to seek summary enforcement
and the time and place of the City Council meeting to consider the question of
summary enforcement. The City Council shall determine whether or not the
condition identified in the notice to the owner or occupant is a nuisance,
whether public health, safety, or welfare will be unreasonably endangered by
delay in abatement required to complete the procedure set forth in division (A)
of this section, and may order that the nuisance be immediately terminated or
abated. If the nuisance is not immediately terminated or abated, the City
Council may order summary enforcement and abate the nuisance.
   (D)   Immediate abatement. Nothing in this section shall prevent the city,
without notice or other process, from immediately abating any condition which
poses an imminent and serious hazard to human life or safety.

§ 94.21 RECOVERY OF COST.
   (A)   Personal liability. The owner of premises on which a nuisance has been
abated by the city shall be personally liable for the cost to the city of the
abatement, including administrative costs. As soon as the work has been

shall prepare a bill for the cost and mail it to the owner. Thereupon the
amount shall be immediately due and payable at the office of the City Manager-
Clerk.
   (B)   Assessment. If the nuisance is a public health or safety hazard on
private property, the accumulation of snow and ice on public sidewalks, the
growth of weeds on private property or outside the traveled portion of streets,

September 1 next following abatement of the nuisance, list the total unpaid
charges along with all other the charges as well as other charges for current

Auditor and collection along with current taxes the following year or in annual
installments, not exceeding ten, as the City Council may determine in each
case.

dog tag is lost or destroyed, the City Manager-Clerk shall issue a duplicate. A
charge shall be made for each duplicate tag in an amount established in
Chapter 34 of this code, as it may be amended from time to time. Dog tags shall
not be transferable from one dog to another and no refunds shall be made on any
dog license fee or tag because of death of a dog or the owner’s leaving the
city before the expiration of the license period.
      (4)   The licensing provisions of this division (B) shall not apply to
dogs whose owners are non- residents temporarily within the city, nor to dogs
brought into the city for the purpose of participating in any dog show, nor

declared a public nuisance. Any Animal Control Officer or police officer may
impound any dog or other animal found unlicensed or any animal found running at
large and shall give notice of the impounding to the owner of the dog or other
animal, if known. In case the owner is unknown, the officer shall post notice
at the city office that if the dog or other animal is not claimed within the
time specified in division (C) below, it will be sold or otherwise disposed of.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, it shall be unlawful to kill,
destroy, or otherwise cause injury to any animal, including dogs and cats
running at large.
   (B)   Biting animals. Any animal that has not been inoculated by a live
modified rabies vaccine and which has bitten any person, wherein the skin has
been punctured or the services of a doctor are required, shall be confined in
the city pound for a period of not less than ten days, at the expense of the
owner. The animal may be released at the end of the time if healthy and free
from symptoms of rabies, and by the payment of all costs by the owner. However,
if the owner of the animal shall elect immediately upon receipt of notice of
need for the confinement by the officer to voluntarily and immediately confine
the animal for the required period of time in a veterinary hospital of the
owner’s choosing, not outside of the county in which this city is located, and
provide immediate proof of confinement in the manner as may be required, the
owner may do so. If, however, the animal has been inoculated with a live
modified rabies vaccine and the owner has proof of the vaccination by a
certificate from a licensed veterinarian, the owner may confine the dog or
other animal to the owner’s property.
   (C)   Reclaiming. All animals conveyed to the pound shall be kept, with
humane treatment and sufficient food and water for their comfort, at least five
regular business days, unless the animal is a dangerous animal as defined under
§
95.11 in which case it shall be kept for seven regular business days or the
times specified in §
95.11, and except if the animal is a cruelly-treated animal in which case it
shall be kept for ten regular business days, unless sooner reclaimed by their
owners or keepers as provided by this section. In case the owner or keeper
shall desire to reclaim the animal from the pound, the following shall be
required, unless otherwise provided for in this code or established from time
to time by resolution of the City Council:
      (1)   Payment of the release fee and receipt of a release permit as
established by
Chapter 34 of this code, as it may be amended from time to time;
      (2)    Payment of maintenance costs, as provided by the pound, per day or

certificate of vaccination for rabies and distemper shots is required.
   (D)   Unclaimed animals. At the expiration of the times established in
division (C) above, if the animal has not been reclaimed in accordance with the
provisions of this section, the officer appointed to enforce this section may
let any person claim the animal by complying with all provisions in this
section, or the officer may sell the animal to the University of Minnesota, or
cause the animal to be destroyed in a proper and humane manner and shall
properly dispose of the remains thereof. Any money collected under this section
shall be payable to the City Manager-Clerk.

meaning.
      KENNEL. The keeping of four or more dogs or no more than four domestic
animals on the same premises, whether owned by the same person or not and for
whatever purpose kept, shall constitute a KENNEL; except that a fresh litter
may be kept for a period of three months before that keeping shall be deemed to
be a KENNEL.

or more domestic animals on the same premises is subject to great abuse,
causing discomfort to persons in the area by way of smell, noise, hazard, and
general aesthetic depreciation, the keeping of four or more dogs or four or
more domestic animals on the premises is hereby declared to be a nuisance and
no person shall keep or maintain a kennel within the city.

      PROPER ENCLOSURE. Securely confined indoors or in a securely locked pen
or structure suitable to prevent the animal from escaping and to provide
protection for the animal from the elements. A PROPER ENCLOSURE does not
include a porch, patio, or any part of a house, garage, or other structure that
would allow the animal to exit of its own volition, or any house or structure
in which windows are open or in which door or window screens are the only

      (2)   The owner of the animal has demonstrated an inability or
unwillingness to control the animal in order to prevent injury to persons or
other animals.
   (G)   Procedure. The Animal Control Officer, after having determined that an
animal is dangerous, may proceed in the following manner:
      (1)   The Animal Control Officer shall cause one owner of the animal to

proper. The Hearing Officer may order the Animal Control Officer to take the
animal into custody for destruction, if the animal is not currently in custody.
If the animal is ordered into custody for destruction, the owner shall
immediately make the animal available to the Animal Control Officer. The
Hearing Officer shall issue a decision on the matter within ten days after the
hearing. The decision must be delivered to the dog's owner by hand delivery or
registered mail as soon as practical and a copy must be provided to the Animal
Control Authority. In the event that the Animal Control Officer's declaration
is upheld by the Hearing Officer, actual expenses of the hearing, up to a
maximum of $1,000, will be the responsibility of the dog's owner.
      (4)   No person shall harbor an animal after it has been found to be
dangerous and ordered into custody for destruction.
   (H)   Stopping an attack. If any police officer or Animal Control Officer is
witness to an attack by an animal upon a person or another animal, the officer
may take whatever means the officer deems appropriate to bring the attack to an
end and prevent further injury to the victim.
   (I)   Notification of new address. The owner of an animal which has been

a license if it believes an investigation is necessary. If the Council
determines that a further comprehensive investigation is required, it shall
conduct or have conducted that investigation. No license shall be issued,
renewed, or transferred, as the case may be, until the Council is satisfied
through the investigation that the granting of the license will not adversely
affect the health, safety, and welfare of the general public. An investigation
fee, not to exceed $500 for all applicants, may be charged to the applicant and
deposited in the city’s General Fund. The fee shall be non-refundable even if

   (B)   Public hearing. Prior to granting a license under this subchapter, the
Council shall hold a public hearing at which time all persons shall be given
the opportunity to be heard speaking for or against the granting of the
license.
   (C)   Issuance. After conducting the investigation and holding the public
hearing, the Council, in its discretion, may either grant or deny the requested
license. Any license requiring the approval of Commissioner of Public Safety
shall not be valid until his or her approval has been granted.
   (D)   Term. Unless otherwise specified on the license, and except for
temporary on-sale licenses that shall only be valid for the duration of the
event for which the license was issued as specified on the license, all
licenses issued under this subchapter shall be valid for one year and shall
expire on December 31 of each year.
   (E)   Transfer. Each license issued under this subchapter shall be valid
only for the premises stated in the license and only for the applicant. No
license shall be transferred to another location or to another person without
the approval of the Council. A transfer of 10% or more of stock shall
constitute a transfer when the license is a corporation.
   (F)   Renewal. Prior to the expiration of any license issued under this
subchapter, the licensee shall submit an application for the renewal of the
license along with the appropriate fee as set by the Council. Failure to apply
for a renewal prior to the last day of validity of a license shall cause the
license to expire, and the licensee shall have to subsequently apply as if
seeking a new license.

are accessible to minors, and located near residential property or related
residential uses such as schools, day care centers, libraries or parks.
   Furthermore, the concentration of adult uses has an adverse and chilling
effect upon the use and enjoyment of adjacent area. The nature of adult uses
requires that they not be allowed within certain zoning districts, or within
minimum distances from each other or residential uses. Special regulation of
adult uses is necessary to ensure that the adverse secondary effects not
contribute to or enhance criminal activity in the area of such uses or
contribute the blighting or downgrading of the surrounding property and
lessening of its value.

shall include a statement advising the applicant or licensee of the right to
appeal such decision to a court of competent jurisdiction.
      (2)   If the City Council finds that no grounds exist for denial,
suspension, or revocation of a license, then within five days after the

the license, and shall so notify the respondent in writing by certified mail of
such action and shall contemporaneously issue the license.

appealable order and the applicant or licensee ("aggrieved party") may seek
prompt judicial review of such administrative action in any court of competent
jurisdiction.
   (D)   Stay of decision. The filing of an appeal stays the action and
decision of the City Council requiring, denying, suspending or revoking a
license until 60 days after a final decision by the City Council, to provide
the aggrieved party sufficient time to appeal the City Council's decision to a
court of competent jurisdiction. If the aggrieved party appeals the City
Council's decision within the 60 days provided, the stay shall be extended
until a final judicial decision is rendered in the matter.
   (E)   Provisional license. Upon the filing of any court action to appeal,
challenge, restrain, or otherwise enjoin the city's enforcement of the denial,
suspension, revocation, or licensure requirement, the city shall immediately
issue the aggrieved party a Provisional License. The Provisional License shall
allow the aggrieved party to continue operation of the adult use business or to
continue employment as an adult use employee, as the case may be, and will
expire upon the court's entry of a judgment on the aggrieved party's action to
appeal, challenge, restrain, or otherwise enjoin the city's enforcement.
   (F)   Additional requirements. The City Council may condition denial,
suspension, revocation, or non-renewal of a license upon appropriate terms and

§ 118.01 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The City Council finds that use of services provided by pawnbrokers
provides an opportunity for the commission of crimes and their concealment
because pawn businesses have the ability to receive and transfer property
stolen by others easily and quickly. The City Council also finds that consumer
protection regulation is warranted in transactions involving pawnbrokers. The
City Council further finds that the pawn industry has outgrown the city's
current ability to effectively or efficiently identify criminal activity
related to pawn shops.
   (B)   The purpose of this chapter is to prevent pawn businesses from being
used as facilities for the commission of crimes, and to assure that such
businesses comply with basic consumer protection standards, thereby protecting
the public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the city; and
   (C)   To help the Police Department better regulate current and future pawn
businesses, decrease and stabilize costs associated with the regulation of the
pawn industry, and increase identification of criminal activities in the pawn
industry through the timely collection and sharing of pawn transaction
information, this chapter also implements and establishes the required use of
the automated pawn system (APS).
(Ord. 396, passed 12-20-12)
§ 118.02 DEFINITIONS.

principal, or agent or employee thereof, who loans money on deposit or pledge

of personal property, or other valuable thing on condition of selling the same
back again at a stipulated price, or who loans money secured by chattel
mortgage on personal property, taking possession of the property or any part

merchandise is received through a pawn, purchase, consignment or trade, or in

is reportable except:
      (1)   The bulk purchase or consignment of new or used merchandise from a
merchant, manufacturer or wholesaler having an established permanent place of

pawn or purchase, and for which all applicable hold and/or redemption periods

rental property within the city is properly maintained.

§ 120.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The purpose of this chapter is to regulate the sale of legalized adult use
of any product that contains tetrahydrocannabinol and that meets the
requirements to be sold for human or animal consumption under M.S. § 151.72 for
the following reasons:
   (A)   By enacting 2022 Session Law Ch. 98, Article 13, the state legislature
amended M.S. § 151.72 to allow the sale of certain products containing
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).
   (B)   The new law does not prohibit municipalities from adopting and
enforcing local ordinances to regulate THC product businesses including, but
not limited to, local zoning and land use requirements and business license
requirements.
   (C)   The National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine note that
the growing acceptance, accessibility, and use of THC products, including for
medical purposes, have raised important public health concerns, while the lack
of aggregated knowledge of cannabis-related health effects has led to
uncertainty about the impact of its use.
   (D)   The city recognizes the danger THC use presents to the health,
welfare, and safety of youth in the city.
   (E)   The state legislature recognizes the danger of THC product use among
the public at large by setting potency and serving size requirements.
   (F)   The state legislature recognizes the danger of THC product use among
youth by prohibiting the sale of any product containing THC to those under the
age of 21, requiring that edible THC products be packaged without appeal to
children and in child-resistant packaging or containers.
   (G)   State law authorizes the Board of Pharmacy to adopt product and
testing standards in part to curb the illegal sale and distribution of THC
products and ensure the safety and compliance of commercially available THC
products in the state.
   (H)   The city has the opportunity to be proactive and make decisions that
will mitigate this threat and reduce exposure of young people to the products
or to the marketing of these products and improve compliance among THC product
retailers with laws prohibiting the sale or marketing of THC products to youth.
   (I)   A local regulatory system for THC product retailers is appropriate to
ensure that retailers comply with THC product laws and business standards of
the city to protect the health, safety, and welfare of our youth and most
vulnerable residents.
   (J)   A requirement for a THC product retailer license will not unduly
burden legitimate business activities of retailers who sell or distribute THC
products to adults but will allow the city to regulate the operation of lawful
businesses to discourage violations of state and local THC product- related
laws.
   (K)   In making these findings and enacting this chapter, it is the intent
of the City Council to ensure responsible THC product retailing, allowing legal
sale and access without promoting increases in use, and to discourage
violations of THC product-related laws, especially those which prohibit or
discourage the marketing, sale or distribution of THC products to youth under
21 years of age.
(Ord. 497, passed 9-15-22)
§ 120.02 DEFINITIONS.
   Except as may otherwise be provided or clearly implied by context, all terms
shall be given their commonly accepted definitions. The following words, terms,
and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to
them in this chapter, except where the context clearly indicates a different
meaning:
   COMPLIANCE CHECKS. The system the city uses to investigate and ensure that
those authorized to sell licensed products are following and complying with the
requirements of this chapter. Compliance checks involve the use of persons
under 21 who purchase or attempt to purchase licensed products. Compliance
checks may also be conducted by the city or other units of government for
educational, research, and training purposes, or for investigating or enforcing
federal, state, or local laws and regulations relating to licensed products.
   EXCLUSIVE LIQUOR STORE. An establishment that meets the definition of
exclusive liquor store in M.S. § 340A.101, subd. 10.
   LICENSED PRODUCT OR THC PRODUCT. Any product that contains more than trace
amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol and that meets the requirements to be sold for
human or animal consumption under M.S. § 151.72, as may be amended from time to
time. Licensed product does not include medical cannabis as defined in M.S. §
152.22, subd. 6, as may be amended from time to time.
   MOVEABLE PLACE OF BUSINESS. Any form of business operated out of a kiosk,
truck, van, automobile, or other type of vehicle or transportable shelter and
not a fixed address storefront or other permanent type of structure authorized
for sales transactions.
   RETAIL ESTABLISHMENT. Any place of business where licensed products are
available for sale to the general public, including, but not limited to,
grocery stores, tobacco products shops, CBD stores, convenience stores,
gasoline service stations, bars, and restaurants.
   SALE. Any transfer of goods for money, trade, barter, or other
consideration.
   SELF-SERVICE MERCHANDISING. Open displays of licensed products in any manner
where any person has access to the licensed products without the assistance or
intervention of the licensee or the licensee's employee. Assistance or
intervention means the actual physical exchange of the licensed product between
the customer and the licensee or employee.
   VENDING MACHINE. Any mechanical, electric, or electronic, or other type of
device that dispenses licensed products upon the insertion of money, tokens, or
other form of payment directly into the machine by the person seeking to
purchase the licensed product.
(Ord. 497, passed 9-15-22)
§ 120.03 LICENSE.
   (A)   License required. No person shall sell or offer to sell any licensed
product within the city without first having obtained a license to do so from
the city.
   (B)   Application. An application for a license to sell licensed products
shall be made on a form provided by the city. The application shall contain the
full name of the applicant, the applicant's residential and business addresses
and telephone numbers, the name of the business for which the license is
sought, and any additional information the city deems necessary. Upon receipt
of a completed application, the City Manager shall forward the application to
the City Council for action at its next regularly scheduled City Council
meeting. If the City Manager determines that an application is incomplete, they
shall return the application to the applicant with notice of the information
necessary to make the application complete. The city shall conduct a background
investigation on all new applications and applications to transfer a license.
The investigation shall consider all facts and information bearing upon the
question of the applicant’s fitness to receive the license and to perform the
duties imposed by this chapter. The city may conduct a background and financial
check on an application for a renewal of a license if it is in the public
interest to do so. If a license is mistakenly issued or renewed to a person, it
shall be revoked upon the discovery that the person was ineligible for the
license under this chapter and the city shall provide the person with a notice
of revocation, along with information on the right to appeal. A business
applicant, at the time of application, shall furnish the city with a list of
all persons that have an interest of 5% or more in the business. The list shall
name all owners and show the interest held by each, either individually or
beneficially for others. It is the duty of each business licensee to notify the
City Manager in writing of any change in ownership of the business. Any change
in the ownership or control of the business shall be deemed equivalent to a
transfer of the license, and any such license shall be revoked 30 days after
any such change in ownership or control unless the licensee has notified the
Council of the change in ownership by submitting a new license application for
the new owners, and the Council has approved the transfer of the license by
appropriate action. Any time an additional investigation is required because of
a change in ownership or control of a business, the licensee shall pay an
additional investigation fee to be determined by the city. The city may at any
reasonable time examine the transfer records and minute books of any business
licensee to verify and identify the owners, and the city may examine the
business records of any other licensee to the extent necessary to disclose the
interest which persons other than the licensee have in the licensed business.
The Council may revoke any license issued upon its determination that a change
of ownership of a licensee has actually resulted in the change of control of
the licensed business so as materially to affect the integrity and character of
its management and its operation, but no such action shall be taken until after
a hearing by the Council on notice to the licensee.
   (C)   Action. The City Council may either approve or deny the application
for a license, or it may delay action for a reasonable period of time as
necessary to complete any investigation of the application or the applicant it
deems necessary. If the City Council approves the license, the City Manager
shall issue the license to the applicant. If the City Council denies the
license, notice of the denial shall be given to the applicant along with notice
of the applicant’s right to appeal the City Council's decision. If a license
application is denied, the earliest an applicant may reapply is 12 months from
the date the license is denied.
   (D)   Term. All licenses issued under this chapter shall be valid for one
calendar year from the date of issue.
   (E)   Revocation or suspension. Any license issued under this chapter may be
revoked or suspended as provided herein.
   (F)   Transfers. All licenses issued under this chapter shall be valid only
on the premises for which the license was issued and only for the person or
business to whom the license was issued. The transfer of any license to another
location, business, or person is prohibited.
   (G)   Display. All licenses shall be posted and displayed in plain view of
the general public on the licensed premises.
   (H)   Renewals. The renewal of a license issued under this chapter shall be
handled in the same manner as the original application. The request for a
renewal shall be made at least 30 days but no more than 60 days before the
expiration of the current license.
   (I)   Issuance as privilege and not a right. The issuance of a license
issued under this chapter is a privilege and does not entitle the license
holder to automatic renewal of the license.
(Ord. 497, passed 9-15-22)
§ 120.04 FEES.
   No license shall be issued under this chapter until the appropriate license
fee shall be paid in full. The fee for a license under this chapter shall be
established by the City Council and adopted in the city fee schedule, and may
be amended from time to time. Fees paid after January 1 of a given year shall
be prorated to the end of that year.
(Ord. 497, passed 9-15-22)
§ 120.05 INELIGIBILITY AND BASIS FOR DENIAL OF LICENSE.
   (A)   Ineligibility.
      (1)   Moveable place of business. No license shall be issued to a
moveable place of business. Only fixed location businesses shall be eligible to
be licensed under this chapter.
      (2)   Exclusive liquor store. No license shall be issued to an exclusive
liquor store as defined in M.S. § 340A.101, subd. 10.
      (3)   Public schools. No license shall be issued if the business is
within 500 feet of the public school.
   (B)   Grounds for denial. Grounds for denying the issuance or renewal of a
license under this chapter include, but are not limited to, the following:
      (1)   The applicant is under the age of 21 years.
      (2)   The applicant is prohibited by federal, state, or other local law,
ordinance, or other regulation from holding a license.
      (3)   The applicant has been convicted within the past five years for any
violation of a federal, state, or local law, other ordinance, provision, or
other regulation relating to the licensed products.
      (4)   The applicant has had a license to sell licensed products suspended
or revoked during the 12 months preceding the date of application, or the
applicant has or had an interest in another premises authorized to sell
licensed products, whether in the city or in another jurisdiction, that has had
a license to sell licensed products suspended or revoked during the same time
period, provided the applicant had an interest in the premises at the time of
the revocation or suspension, or at the time of the violation that led to the
revocation or suspension.
      (5)   The applicant is a business that does not have an operating officer
or manager who is eligible pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.
      (6)   The applicant is the spouse of a person ineligible for a license
pursuant to the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) of this section or who,
in the judgement of the Council, is not the real party in interest or
beneficial owner of the business to be operated, under the license.
      (7)   The applicant fails to provide any information required on the
application or provides false or misleading information. Any false statement on
an application, or any willful omission of any information called for on such
application form, shall cause an automatic refusal of license, or if already
issued, shall render any license issued pursuant thereto void and of no effect
to protect the applicant from prosecution for violation of this chapter, or any
part thereof.
   (C)   No license shall be granted or renewed for operation on any premises
on which real estate taxes, assessments, or other financial claims of the city
or of the state are due, delinquent, or unpaid. If an action has been commenced
pursuant to the provisions of M.S. Chapter 278, questioning the amount or
validity of taxes, the Council may, on application by the licensee, waive
strict compliance with this provision; no waiver may be granted, however, for
taxes, or any portion thereof, which remain unpaid for a period exceeding one
year after becoming due unless such one-year period is extended through no
fault of the licensee.

any civil penalties that the city deems to be appropriate under this chapter,
state or federal law, or other applicable law or regulation.
(Ord. 497, passed 9-15-22)
§ 120.09 COMPLIANCE CHECKS AND INSPECTIONS.

   The Municipal Joint Airport Zoning Board, created and established by joint
action of the City Council and the Board of County Commissioners pursuant to
the provisions and authority of M.S. § 360.063, as amended from time to time,
hereby finds and declares as follows:
   (A)   An airport hazard endangers the lives and property of users of the
Municipal Airport, and property or occupants of land in its vicinity, and also
if of the obstructive type, in effect reduces the size of the area available
for the landing, takeoff, and maneuvering of aircraft, thus tending to destroy
or impair the utility of the Municipal Airport and the public investment
therein.
   (B)   The creation or establishment of an airport hazard is a public
nuisance, and an injury to the region served by the Municipal Airport.
   (C)   For the protection of the public health, safety, order, convenience,
prosperity, and general welfare, and for the promotion of the most appropriate
use of land, it is necessary to prevent the creation or establishment of
airport hazards.
   (D)   The prevention of these airport hazards should be accomplished, to the
extent legally possible, by the exercise of the police power without
compensation.
   (E)   The prevention of the creation or establishment of airport hazards and
the elimination, removal, alteration, mitigation, or marking and lighting of
existing airport hazards are public purposes for which political subdivisions
may raise and expend public funds.

tangent to those arcs. The radius of each arc is 6,000 feet for the NW-SE
runway;
      (3)   Conical zone. All that land which lies directly under an imaginary
conical surface extending upward and outward from the periphery of the
horizontal surface at a slope of 20:1 for a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet
as measured radially outward from the periphery of the horizontal surface;
      (4)   Approach zone. All that land which lies directly under an imaginary
approach surface longitudinally centered on the extended center line at each
end of a runway. The inner edge of the approach surface is at the same width
and elevation as, and coincides with, the end of the primary surface. The
approach surface inclines upward and outward at a slope of 40:1 for the NW-SE
runway. The approach surface expands uniformly to a width of 2,500 feet for the
NW-SE runway at a distance of 10,000 feet, then continues at the same rate of
divergence to the periphery of the conical surface; and
      (5)   Transitional zone. All that land which lies directly under an
imaginary surface extending upward and outward at right angles to the runway
center line and the runway center line extended at a slope of 7:1 from the
sides of the primary surfaces and from the sides of the approach surfaces until
they intersect the horizontal surface or the conical surface.

§ 152.21 HEIGHT RESTRICTIONS.
   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, and except as necessary and
incidental to airport operations, no structures or tree shall be constructed,
altered, maintained, or allowed to grow in any airspace zone created in §
152.20 so as to project above any of the imaginary airspace surfaces described
in §
152.20. Where an area is covered by more than one height limitation, the more
restrictive limitations shall prevail.

Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 152.22 SAFETY ZONE BOUNDARIES ESTABLISHED.
   In order to carry out the purpose of this chapter, there are hereby created
and established the following land use safety zone boundaries:
   (A)   Safety zone A. All land in that portion of the approach zones of a
runway, as defined in §
152.20, which extends outward from the end of the primary surface a distance
equal to two-thirds of the planned length of the runway, which distance shall
be 2,000 feet for the NW-SE runway;
   (B)   Safety zone B. All land in that portion of the approach zones of a
runway, as defined in §
152.20, which extends outward from safety zone A for a distance equal to one-
third of the planned length of the runway, which distance shall be 1,000 feet
for the NW-SE runway; and
   (C)   Safety zone C. All that land which is enclosed within the perimeter of
the horizontal zone, as defined in §
152.20, and which is not included in safety zone A or safety zone B.

together an assembly of persons thereon. Permitted uses may include
agriculture, light outdoor recreation (non-spectator), cemeteries, and auto
parking.
   (C)   Zone B. Subject at all times to the height restrictions set forth in §
152.21, and to the general restrictions contained in division (A) above, areas
designated as zone B shall be restricted in use as follows.
      (1)   Each use shall be on a site whose area shall not be less than three
acres.
      (2)   Each use shall not create, attract, or bring together a site
population that would exceed 15 times that of the site acreage.
      (3)   Each site shall have no more than one building plot upon which any
number of structures may be erected.
      (4)   A building plot shall be a single, uniform, and non-contrived area,

PERMITS; NONCONFORMING USES AND VARIANCES
§ 152.35 NONCONFORMING USES; EXISTING.
   (A)   Regulations not retroactive. The regulations prescribed by this
chapter shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other
changes or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the
regulations as of the effective date of this chapter, or to otherwise interfere
with the continuance of any nonconforming use. Nothing herein contained shall
require any change in the construction, alteration, or intended use of any
structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the
effective date of this chapter, and which is diligently prosecuted and
completed within two years thereof.
   (B)   Existing nonconforming uses. Hydropillar (elevated water tower), with
location as shown on zoning maps in the north half of Section 25, Township 38
North, Range 26 West; its elevation exceeds limits in the horizontal zone.
(Ord. passed 8-6-75)
§ 152.36 FUTURE USES; PERMIT REQUIRED.
   (A)   Except as specifically provided in division (B) below, no material
change shall be made in the use of land and no structure or tree shall be
erected, altered, planted, or otherwise established in any zone hereby created
unless a permit therefor shall have been applied for and granted by the Zoning
Administrator, hereinafter provided for. Each application for a permit shall
indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient
particularity to permit it to conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If
the determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted.
   (B)   (1)   However, a permit for a tree or structure of less than 75 feet
of vertical height above the ground shall not be required in the horizontal and
conical zones or in any approach and transitional zones beyond a horizontal
distance of 4,200 feet from each end of the runway except when that tree or
structure, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, would
extend above the height limit prescribed for the respective zone.
      (2)   Nothing contained in this foregoing exception shall be construed as
permitting or intending to permit any construction, alteration, or growth of
any structure or tree in excess of any of the height limitations established by
this chapter as set forth in §§
152.20 and
152.21.
(Ord. passed 8-6-75)
Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 152.37 EXISTING USES; PERMITS FOR ALTERATION.
   Before any existing use or structure may be replaced, substantially altered
or repaired, or rebuilt within any zone established herein, a permit must be
secured authorizing this replacement, change, or repair. No permit shall be
granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or
permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to become a greater hazard to
air navigation than it was on the effective date of this chapter or any
amendments thereto, or than it is when the application for a permit is made.
Except as indicated, all applications for this type of permit shall be granted.
(Ord. passed 8-6-75)
§ 152.38 NONCONFORMING USES ABANDONED OR DESTROYED.
   (A)   Whenever the Zoning Administrator determines that a nonconforming
structure or tree has been abandoned or more than 80% torn down, physically
deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow this
structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate
from the zoning regulations.
   (B)   Whether application is made for a permit under this subchapter or not,
the Zoning Administrator may order the owner of the abandoned or partially
destroyed nonconforming structure at his or her own expense, to lower, remove,
reconstruct, or equip the same in the manner necessary to conform to the
provisions of this chapter. In the event the owner of the nonconforming
structure shall neglect or refuse to comply with this order for 10 days after
receipt of written notice of the order, the Zoning Administrator may, by
appropriate legal action, proceed to have the abandoned or partially destroyed
nonconforming structure lowered, removed, reconstructed, or equipped and assess
the cost and expense thereof against the land on which the structure is or was
located. Unless this assessment is paid within 90 days from the service of
notice thereof on the owner of the land, the sum shall bear interest at the
rate of 8% per annum from the date the cost and expense is incurred until paid,
and shall be collected in the same manner as are general taxes.
(Ord. passed 8-6-75)
§ 152.39 VARIANCES.
   Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or
permit the growth of any tree, or use his or her property, not in accordance
with the regulations prescribed in this chapter, may apply to the Board of
Adjustments and Appeals, hereinafter provided for, for a variance from these
regulations. Variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal
application or enforcement of the regulations would result in practical
difficulty or unnecessary hardship and relief granted would not be contrary to
the public interest but do substantial justice and be in accordance with the
spirit of this chapter; provided any variance so allowed may be subject to any
reasonable conditions that the Board of Adjustments and Appeals may deem
necessary to effectuate the purposes of this chapter.
(Ord. passed 8-6-75)
§ 152.40 NONCONFORMING USES; HAZARD MARKING AND LIGHTING.
   The owner of any nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to
permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of those markers
and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the Zoning Administrator to indicate
to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence of
these airport hazards. The markers and lights shall be installed, operated, and
maintained at the expense of the city.
(Ord. passed 8-6-75)
§ 152.41 PERMITS AND VARIANCES; HAZARD MARKING AND LIGHTING.
   Any permit or variance granted by the Zoning Administrator or Board of
Adjustments and Appeals, as the case may be, may, if such an action is deemed
advisable to effectuate the purpose of this chapter and be reasonable in the
circumstances, so condition the permit or variance as to require the owner of
the structure or tree in question at his or her own expense, to install,
operate, and maintain thereon any markers and lights as may be necessary to
indicate to pilots the presence of an airport hazard.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 153.001 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The legislature of the State of Minnesota has, in M.S. Chapter 103F and M.S.
Chapter 462 delegated the responsibility to local government units to adopt
regulations designed to minimize flood losses.
(Ord. 397, passed 1-17-13)
§ 153.002 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   Hazard area. The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to
periodic inundation which results in potential loss of life, loss of property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures or flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   Methods used to analyze flood hazards. This chapter is based upon a
reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which is consistent with the
standards established by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.
   (C)   National flood insurance program compliance. This chapter is adopted
to comply with the rules and regulations of the National Flood Insurance
Program codified as 44 C.F.R. Parts 59 -78, as amended, so as to maintain the
community's eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program.
(Ord. 397, passed 1-17-13)
§ 153.003 PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize those losses described in §
153.002(A) by provisions contained herein.
(Ord. 397, passed 1-17-13)
§ 153.004 LANDS TO WHICH CHAPTER APPLIES.
   This chapter shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city
shown on the official zoning map and/or the attachments thereto as being
located within the boundaries of the Floodway, Flood Fringe, or General Flood
Plain Districts.
(Ord. 397, passed 1-17-13)
§ 153.005 ESTABLISHMENT OF OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.
   The official zoning map together with all materials attached thereto is
hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. The
attached material shall include the Flood Insurance Study Mille Lacs County,
Minnesota And Incorporated Areas and Flood Insurance Rate Maps Mille Lacs
County, Minnesota And Incorporated Areas with map numbers 27095C0343C,
27095C0344C, 27095C0406C, and 27095C0407C; all of the aforementioned documents
being dated March 4, 2013, and prepared by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency. The official zoning map shall be on file in the office of the City
Manager and the Zoning Administrator.
(Ord. 397, passed 1-17-13)
§ 153.006 REGULATORY FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION.
   The regulatory flood protection elevation shall be an elevation no lower
than one foot above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in
flood elevation caused by encroachments on the flood plain that result from
designation of a floodway.
(Ord. 397, passed 1-17-13)
§ 153.007 INTERPRETATION.
   (A)   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this
chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation
or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes.
   (B)   The boundaries of the zoning districts shall be determined by scaling
distances on the official zoning map. Where interpretation is needed as to the
exact location of the boundaries of the district as shown on the official
zoning map, as for example where there appears to be a conflict between a
mapped boundary and actual field conditions and there is a formal appeal of the
decision of the Zoning Administrator, the Board of Adjustment shall make the
necessary interpretation. All decisions will be based on elevations on the
regional (100-year) flood profile, the ground elevations that existed on the
site at the time the community adopted its initial flood plain ordinance or on
the date of the first National Flood Insurance Program map showing the area
within the 100-year flood plain if earlier, and other available technical data.
Persons contesting the location of the district boundaries shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to present their case to the Board of Adjustment and to
submit technical evidence.
(Ord. 397, passed 1-17-13)
§ 153.008 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   It is not intended by this chapter to repeal, abrogate, or impair any
existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this
chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall
prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with this chapter are hereby
repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
(Ord. 397, passed 1-17-13)
§ 153.009 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   This chapter does not imply that areas outside the flood plain districts or
land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or flood
damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city or any
officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on
this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 397, passed 1-17-13)
§ 153.010 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ACCESSORY USE OR STRUCTURE. A use or structure on the same lot with, and of
a nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal use or
structure.
   BASEMENT. Any area of a structure, including crawl spaces, having its floor
or base subgrade (below ground level) on all four sides, regardless of the
depth of excavation below ground level.
   CONDITIONAL USE. A specific type of structure or land use listed in the
official control that may be allowed but only after an in-depth review
procedure and with appropriate conditions or restrictions as provided in the
official zoning controls or building codes and upon a finding that:
      (1)   Certain conditions as detailed in the zoning ordinance exist.
      (2)   The structure and/or land use conform to the comprehensive land use
plan if one exists and are compatible with the existing neighborhood.
   EQUAL DEGREE OF ENCROACHMENT. A method of determining the location of
floodway boundaries so that flood plain lands on both sides of a stream are
capable of conveying a proportionate share of flood flows.
   FLOOD. A temporary increase in the flow or stage of a stream or in the stage
of a wetland or lake that results in the inundation of normally dry areas.
   FLOOD FREQUENCY. The frequency for which it is expected that a specific
flood stage or discharge may be equaled or exceeded.
   FLOOD FRINGE. That portion of the flood plain outside of the floodway. Flood
fringe is synonymous with the term "floodway fringe" used in the Flood
Insurance Study Mille Lacs County, Minnesota And Incorporated Areas.
   FLOOD PLAIN. The beds proper and the areas adjoining a wetland, lake or
watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regional flood.
   FLOOD PROOFING. A combination of structural provisions, changes, or
adjustments to properties and structures subject to flooding, primarily for the
reduction or elimination of flood damages.
   FLOODWAY. The bed of a wetland or lake and the channel of a watercourse and
those portions of the adjoining flood plain which are reasonably required to
carry or store the regional flood discharge.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking
of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a basement area,
is not considered a building's lowest floor.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include the term RECREATIONAL VEHICLE.
   OBSTRUCTION. Any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment,
projection, excavation, channel modification, culvert, building, wire, fence,
stockpile, refuse, fill, structure, or matter in, along, across, or projecting
into any channel, watercourse, or regulatory flood plain which may impede,
retard, or change the direction of the flow of water, either in itself or by
catching or collecting debris carried by such water.
   PRINCIPAL USE OR STRUCTURE. Means all uses or structures that are not
accessory uses or structures.
   REACH. A hydraulic engineering term to describe a longitudinal segment of a
stream or river influenced by a natural or man-made obstruction. In an urban
area, the segment of a stream or river between two consecutive bridge crossings
would most typically constitute a reach.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle that is built on a single chassis, is 400
square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, is
designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and
is designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary
living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. For the
purposes of this chapter, the term RECREATIONAL VEHICLE shall be synonymous
with the term TRAVEL TRAILER/TRAVEL VEHICLE.
   REGIONAL FLOOD. A flood which is representative of large floods known to
have occurred generally in Minnesota and reasonably characteristic of what can
be expected to occur on an average frequency in the magnitude of the 100-year
recurrence interval. Regional flood is synonymous with the term "base flood"
used in a flood insurance study.
   REGULATORY FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION. The regulatory flood protection
elevation shall be an elevation no lower than one foot above the elevation of
the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation caused by
encroachments on the flood plain that result from designation of a flood way.
   STRUCTURE. Anything constructed or erected on the ground or attached to the
ground or on-site utilities, including, but not limited to, buildings,
factories, sheds, detached garages, cabins, manufactured homes, recreational
vehicles not meeting the exemption criteria specified in §
153.117(A) of this chapter and other similar items.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure where the
cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or
exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Within any consecutive 365-day period, any
reconstruction, rehabilitation (including normal maintenance and repair),
repair after damage, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of
which equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the
"start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures that
have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include either:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
      (2)   Any alteration of an "historic structure," provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an
"historic structure." For the purpose of this chapter, HISTORIC STRUCTURE shall
be as defined in 44 C.F.R. Part 59.1.
   VARIANCE. A modification of a specific permitted development standard
required in an official control including this chapter to allow an alternative
development standard not stated as acceptable in the official control, but only
as applied to a particular property for the purpose of alleviating a hardship,
practical difficulty or unique circumstance as defined and elaborated upon in a
community's respective planning and zoning enabling legislation.
(Ord. 397, passed 1-17-13)
§ 153.011 ANNEXATIONS.
   The Flood Insurance Rate Map panels adopted by reference into §
153.005 may include flood plain areas that lie outside of the corporate
boundaries of the city at the time of adoption of this chapter. If any of these
flood plain land areas are annexed into the city after the date of adoption of
this chapter, the newly annexed flood plain lands shall be subject to the

(Ord. 397, passed 1-17-13)
§ 153.043 STANDARDS FOR FLOODWAY CONDITIONAL USES.
   (A)   All uses. No structure (temporary or permanent), fill (including fill
for roads and levees), deposit, obstruction, storage of materials or equipment,
or other uses may be allowed as a conditional use that will cause any increase
in the stage of the 100-year or regional flood or cause an increase in flood
damages in the reach or reaches affected.
   (B)   All floodway conditional uses shall be subject to the procedures and
standards contained in §
153.133.
   (C)   The conditional use shall be permissible in the underlying zoning
district if one exists.
   (D)   Fill.
      (1)   Fill, dredge spoil, and all other similar materials deposited or
stored in the flood plain shall be protected from erosion by vegetative cover,
mulching, riprap or other acceptable method.
      (2)   Dredge spoil sites and sand and gravel operations shall not be
allowed in the floodway unless a long-term site development plan is submitted
which includes an erosion/sedimentation prevention element to the plan.
      (3)   As an alternative, and consistent with division (2) immediately
above, dredge spoil disposal and sand and gravel operations may allow
temporary, on-site storage of fill or other materials which would have caused
an increase to the stage of the 100-year or regional flood but only after the
governing body has received an appropriate plan which assures the removal of
the materials from the floodway based upon the flood warning time available.
The conditional use permit must be title registered with the property in the
Office of the County Recorder.
   (E)   Accessory structures.
      (1)   Accessory structures shall not be designed for human habitation.
      (2)   Accessory structures, if permitted, shall be constructed and placed
on the building site so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of
flood waters:
         (a)   Whenever possible, structures shall be constructed with the
longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow; and
         (b)   So far as practicable, structures shall be placed approximately
on the same flood flow lines as those of adjoining structures.
      (3)   Accessory structures shall be elevated on fill or structurally dry
flood proofed in accordance with the FP-1 or FP-2 flood proofing
classifications in the State Building Code. As an alternative, an accessory
structure may be flood proofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 flood proofing
classification in the State Building Code provided the accessory structure
constitutes a minimal investment, does not exceed 500 square feet in size at
its largest projection, and for a detached garage, the detached garage must be
used solely for parking of vehicles and limited storage. All flood proofed
accessory structures must meet the following additional standards:
         (a)   The structure must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse or lateral movement of the structure and shall be designed to equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls;
         (b)   Any mechanical and utility equipment in a structure must be
elevated to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or properly
flood proofed; and
         (c)   To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there
must be a minimum of two "automatic" openings in the outside walls of the
structure having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every
square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. There must be openings on at
least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings must be no
higher than one foot above the lowest adjacent grade to the structure. Using
human intervention to open a garage door prior to flooding will not satisfy
this requirement for automatic openings.
   (F)   Storage of materials and equipment.
      (1)   The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of
flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or
plant life is prohibited.
      (2)   Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if readily
removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning and in
accordance with a plan approved by the governing body.
   (G)   Structural works for flood control that will change the course,
current or cross section of protected wetlands or public waters shall be
subject to the provisions of M.S. Chapter 103G. Community-wide structural works
for flood control intended to remove areas from the regulatory flood plain
shall not be allowed in the floodway.
   (H)   A levee, dike or floodwall constructed in the floodway shall not cause
an increase to the 100-year or regional flood and the technical analysis must
assume equal conveyance or storage loss on both sides of a stream.

FLOOD FRINGE DISTRICT (FF)
§ 153.055 PERMITTED USES.
   Permitted uses shall be those uses of land or structures listed as permitted
uses in the underlying zoning use district(s). If no pre-existing, underlying
zoning use districts exist, then any residential or non-residential structure
or use of a structure or land shall be a permitted use in the Flood Fringe
District provided such use does not constitute a public nuisance. All permitted
uses shall comply with the standards for Flood Fringe District permitted uses
listed in §
153.056 and the standards for all Flood Fringe uses listed in §
153.059.
(Ord. 397, passed 1-17-13)
§ 153.056 STANDARDS FOR FLOOD FRINGE PERMITTED USES.
   (A)   All structures, including accessory structures, must be elevated on
fill so that the lowest floor including basement floor is at or above the
regulatory flood protection elevation. The finished fill elevation for
structures shall be no lower than one foot below the regulatory flood
protection elevation and the fill shall extend at such elevation at least 15
feet beyond the outside limits of the structure erected thereon.
   (B)   As an alternative to elevation on fill, accessory structures that
constitute a minimal investment and that do not exceed 500 square feet at its
largest projection may be internally flood proofed in accordance with §
153.043(E)(3).
   (C)   The cumulative placement of fill where at any one time in excess of
1,000 cubic yards of fill is located on the parcel shall be allowable only as a
conditional use, unless said fill is specifically intended to elevate a
structure in accordance with division (A) above.
   (D)   The storage of any materials or equipment shall be elevated on fill to
the regulatory flood protection elevation.
   (E)   The provisions of §
153.059 shall apply.
(Ord. 397, passed 1-17-13)
§ 153.057 CONDITIONAL USES.
   Any structure that is not elevated on fill or flood proofed in accordance
with §
153.056(A) and §
153.056(B) and or any use of land that does not comply with the standards in §
153.056(C) and §
153.056(D) shall only be allowable as a conditional use. An application for a
conditional use shall be subject to the standards and criteria and evaluation
procedures specified in §
153.058, §
153.059, and §
153.133.
(Ord. 397, passed 1-17-13)
§ 153.058 STANDARDS FOR FLOOD FRINGE CONDITIONAL USES.
   (A)   (1)   Alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill may be
utilized to elevate a structure's lowest floor above the regulatory flood
protection elevation. These alternative methods may include the use of stilts,
pilings, parallel walls, etc., or above-grade, enclosed areas such as crawl
spaces or tuck under garages. The base or floor of an enclosed area shall be
considered above-grade and not a structure's basement or lowest floor if:
         (a)   The enclosed area is above-grade on at least one side of the
structure;
         (b)   It is designed to internally flood and is constructed with flood
resistant materials; and
         (c)   It is used solely for parking of vehicles, building access or
storage.
      (2)   The above-noted alternative elevation methods are subject to the
following additional standards:
         (a)   Design and certification. The structure's design and as-built
condition must be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect
as being in compliance with the general design standards of the State Building
Code and, specifically, that all electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and
air conditioning equipment and other service facilities must be at or above the
regulatory flood protection elevation or be designed to prevent flood water
from entering or accumulating within these components during times of flooding.
         (b)   Specific standards for above-grade, enclosed areas. Above-grade,
fully enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages must be
designed to internally flood and the design plans must stipulate:
            1.   A minimum area of openings in the walls where internal
flooding is to be used as a flood proofing technique. There shall be a minimum
of two openings on at least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all
openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. The automatic openings
shall have a minimum net area of not less than one square inch for every square
foot of enclosed area subject to flooding unless a registered professional
engineer or architect certifies that a smaller net area would suffice. The
automatic openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
flood waters without any form of human intervention; and
            2.   That the enclosed area will be designed of flood resistant
materials in accordance with the FP-3 or FP-4 classifications in the State
Building Code and shall be used solely for building access, parking of vehicles
or storage.
   (B)   Basements, as defined in §
153.010, shall be subject to the following:
      (1)   Residential basement construction shall not be allowed below the
regulatory flood protection elevation.
      (2)   Non-residential basements may be allowed below the regulatory flood
protection elevation provided the basement is structurally dry flood proofed in
accordance with division (C) below.
   (C)   All areas of non-residential structures including basements to be
placed below the regulatory flood protection elevation and shall be flood
proofed in accordance with the structurally dry flood proofing classifications
in the State Building Code. Structurally dry flood proofing must meet the FP-
1 or FP-2 flood proofing classification in the State Building Code and this
shall require making the structure watertight with the walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of
buoyancy. Structures flood proofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 classification shall not
be permitted.
   (D)   When at any one time more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill or other
similar material is located on a parcel for such activities as on-site storage,
landscaping, sand and gravel operations, landfills, roads, dredge spoil
disposal or construction of flood control works, an erosion/sedimentation
control plan must be submitted unless the community is enforcing a state-
approved shoreland management ordinance. In the absence of a state- approved
shoreland ordinance, the plan must clearly specify methods to be used to
stabilize the fill on site for a flood event at a minimum of the 100-year or
regional flood event. The plan must be prepared and certified by a registered
professional engineer or other qualified individual acceptable to the governing
body. The plan may incorporate alternative procedures for removal of the
material from the flood plain if adequate flood warning time exists.
   (E)   Storage of materials and equipment.
      (1)   The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of
flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or
plant life is prohibited.
      (2)   Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if readily
removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning and in
accordance with a plan approved by the governing body.
   (F)   The provisions of §
153.059 shall also apply.
(Ord. 397, passed 1-17-13)
§ 153.059 STANDARDS FOR ALL FLOOD FRINGE USES.
   (A)   All new principal structures must have vehicular access at or above an
elevation not more than two feet below the regulatory flood protection
elevation. If a variance to this requirement is granted, the Board of
Adjustment must specify limitations on the period of use or occupancy of the
structure for times of flooding and only after determining that adequate flood
warning time and local flood emergency response procedures exist.
   (B)   Commercial uses. Accessory land uses, such as yards, railroad tracks,
and parking lots may be at elevations lower than the regulatory flood
protection elevation. However, a permit for such facilities to be used by the
employees or the general public shall not be granted in the absence of a flood
warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area would be
inundated to a depth and velocity such that when multiplying the depth (in
feet) times velocity (in feet per second) the product number exceeds four upon
occurrence of the regional flood.
   (C)   Manufacturing and industrial uses. Measures shall be taken to minimize
interference with normal plant operations especially along streams having
protracted flood durations. Certain accessory land uses such as yards and
parking lots may be at lower elevations subject to requirements set out in
division (B) above. In considering permit applications, due consideration shall
be given to needs of an industry whose business requires that it be located in
flood plain areas.
   (D)   Fill shall be properly compacted and the slopes shall be properly
protected by the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable method.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for
removing the special flood hazard area designation for certain structures
properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation. FEMA's
requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection
standards for multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should
be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of
special flood hazard area designation will be requested.
   (E)   Flood plain developments shall not adversely affect the hydraulic
capacity of the channel and adjoining flood plain of any tributary watercourse
or drainage system where a floodway or other encroachment limit has not been
specified on the official zoning map.
   (F)   Standards for recreational vehicles are contained in §
153.117.
   (G)   All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system that resists flotation, collapse and lateral
movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use
of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in
addition to applicable state or local anchoring requirements for resisting wind
forces.

(Ord. 397, passed 1-17-13)
§ 153.071 PROCEDURES FOR FLOODWAY AND FLOOD FRINGE DETERMINATIONS WITHIN THE
GENERAL FLOOD PLAIN DISTRICT.
   (A)   Upon receipt of an application for a permit or other approval within
the General Flood Plain District, the applicant shall be required to furnish
such of the following information as is deemed necessary by the Zoning
Administrator for the determination of the regulatory flood protection
elevation and whether the proposed use is within the Floodway or Flood Fringe
District.
      (1)   A typical valley cross-section(s) showing the channel of the
stream, elevation of land areas adjoining each side of the channel, cross-
sectional areas to be occupied by the proposed development, and high water
information.
      (2)   Plan (surface view) showing elevations or contours of the ground,
pertinent structure, fill, or storage elevations, the size, location, and
spatial arrangement of all proposed and existing structures on the site, and
the location and elevations of streets.
      (3)   Photographs showing existing land uses, vegetation upstream and
downstream, and soil types.
      (4)   Profile showing the slope of the bottom of the channel or flow line
of the stream for at least 500 feet in either direction from the proposed
development.
   (B)   The applicant shall be responsible to submit one copy of the above
information to a designated engineer or other expert person or agency for
technical assistance in determining whether the proposed use is in the Floodway
or Flood Fringe District and to determine the regulatory flood protection
elevation. Procedures consistent with Minn. Rules, parts 6120.5000 through
6120.6200, and 44 C.F.R. Part 65 shall be followed in this expert evaluation.
The designated engineer or expert is strongly encouraged to discuss the
proposed technical evaluation methodology with the respective Department of
Natural Resources' Area Hydrologist prior to commencing the analysis. The
designated engineer or expert shall:
      (1)   Estimate the peak discharge of the regional flood.
      (2)   Calculate the water surface profile of the regional flood based
upon a hydraulic analysis of the stream channel and overbank areas.
      (3)   Compute the floodway necessary to convey or store the regional
flood without increasing flood stages more than one-half foot. A lesser stage
increase than one-half foot shall be required if, as a result of the additional
stage increase, increased flood damages would result. An equal degree of
encroachment on both sides of the stream within the reach shall be assumed in
computing floodway boundaries.
   (C)   The Zoning Administrator shall present the technical evaluation and
findings of the designated engineer or expert to the governing body. The
governing body must formally accept the technical evaluation and the
recommended Floodway and/or Flood Fringe District boundary or deny the permit
application. The governing body, prior to official action, may submit the
application and all supporting data and analyses to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, the Department of Natural Resources or the Planning
Commission for review and comment. Once the Floodway and Flood Fringe District
Boundaries have been determined, the governing body shall refer the matter back
to the Zoning Administrator who shall process the permit application consistent
with the applicable provisions of §§
153.040 et seq. and §§
153.055 et seq.

§ 153.131 PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Permit required. A permit issued by the Zoning Administrator in
conformity with the provisions of this chapter shall be secured prior to the
erection, addition, modification, rehabilitation (including normal maintenance
and repair), or alteration of any building, structure, or portion thereof;
prior to the use or change of use of a building, structure, or land; prior to
the construction of a dam, fence, or on-site septic system; prior to the change
or extension of a nonconforming use; prior to the repair of a structure that
has been damaged by flood, fire, tornado, or any other source; and prior to the
placement of fill, excavation of materials, or the storage of materials or
equipment within the flood plain.
   (B)   Application for permit. Application for a permit shall be made in
duplicate to the Zoning Administrator on forms furnished by the Zoning
Administrator and shall include the following where applicable: plans in
duplicate drawn to scale, showing the nature, location, dimensions, and
elevations of the lot; existing or proposed structures, fill, or storage of
materials; and the location of the foregoing in relation to the stream channel.
   (C)   State and federal permits. Prior to granting a permit or processing an
application for a conditional use permit or variance, the Zoning Administrator
shall determine that the applicant has obtained all necessary state and federal

business and may exercise all of the powers conferred on such boards by state
law.
   (B)   Administrative review. The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide
appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision,
or determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement or
administration of this chapter.
   (C)   Variances. The Board of Adjustment may authorize upon appeal in
specific cases such relief or variance from the terms of this chapter as will
not be contrary to the public interest and only for those circumstances such as
hardship, practical difficulties or circumstances unique to the property under
consideration, as provided for in the respective enabling legislation for
planning and zoning for cities or counties as appropriate. In the granting of
such variance, the Board of Adjustment shall clearly identify in writing the
specific conditions that existed consistent with the criteria specified in this
chapter, any other zoning regulations in the community, and in the respective
enabling legislation that justified the granting of the variance. No variance
shall have the effect of allowing in any district uses prohibited in that
district, and permit a lower degree of flood protection than the regulatory
flood protection elevation for the particular area, or permit standards lower
than those required by state law. The following additional variance criteria of
the Federal Emergency Management Agency must be satisfied:
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued by a community within any designated
regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood
discharge would result.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued by a community upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
   (D)   Hearings. Upon filing with the Board of Adjustment of an appeal from a
decision of the Zoning Administrator, or an application for a variance, the
Board of Adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for a hearing and give due
notice to the parties in interest as specified by law. The Board of Adjustment
shall submit by mail to the Commissioner of Natural Resources a copy of the
application for proposed variances sufficiently in advance so that the
Commissioner will receive at least ten days notice of the hearing.
   (E)   Decisions. The Board of Adjustment shall arrive at a decision on such
appeal or variance within 60 days. In passing upon an appeal, the Board of
Adjustment may, so long as such action is in conformity with the provisions of
this chapter, reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or modify the order,
requirement, decision or determination of the Zoning Administrator or other
public official. It shall make its decision in writing setting forth the
findings of fact and the reasons for its decisions. In granting a variance the
Board of Adjustment may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards such as
those specified in §
153.133(G), which are in conformity with the purposes of this chapter.
Violations of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms
under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this
chapter punishable under §
153.999. A copy of all decisions granting variances shall be forwarded by mail
to the Commissioner of Natural Resources within ten days of such action.
   (F)   Appeals. Appeals from any decision of the Board of Adjustment may be
made, and as specified in this community's official controls and also by
Minnesota Statutes.
   (G)   (1)   Flood insurance notice and record keeping. The Zoning
Administrator shall notify the applicant for a variance that:
         (a)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the
base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and
         (b)   Such construction below the 100-year or regional flood level
increases risks to life and property.
      (2)   Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance
actions. A community shall maintain a record of all variance actions, including
justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its
annual or biennial report submitted to the Administrator of the National Flood
Insurance Program.

established in connection with grants of variances or conditional uses) shall
constitute a misdemeanor and shall be punishable as defined by law.
   (B)   Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city from taking such other
lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. Such actions
may include but are not limited to:
      (1)   In responding to a suspected chapter violation, the Zoning
Administrator and local government may utilize the full array of enforcement
actions available to it including but not limited to prosecution and fines,
injunctions, after-the-fact permits, orders for corrective measures or a
request to the National Flood Insurance Program for denial of flood insurance
availability to the guilty party. The community must act in good faith to
enforce these official controls and to correct chapter violations to the extent
possible so as not to jeopardize its eligibility in the National Flood
Insurance Program.
      (2)   When a chapter violation is either discovered by or brought to the
attention of the Zoning Administrator, the Zoning Administrator shall
immediately investigate the situation and document the nature and extent of the
violation of the official control. As soon as is reasonably possible, this
information will be submitted to the appropriate Department of Natural
Resources and Federal Emergency Management Agency Regional Office along with
the community's plan of action to correct the violation to the degree possible.
      (3)   (a)   The Zoning Administrator shall notify the suspected party of
the requirements of this chapter and all other official controls and the nature
and extent of the suspected violation of these controls.
         (b)   If the structure and/or use is under construction or
development, the Zoning Administrator may order the construction or development
immediately halted until a proper permit or approval is granted by the
community. If the construction or development is already completed, then the
Zoning Administrator may either:
            1.   Issue an order identifying the corrective actions that must be
made within a specified time period to bring the use or structure into
compliance with the official controls; or
            2.   Notify the responsible party to apply for an after-the-fact
permit/development approval within a specified period of time not to exceed 30
days.
      (4)   If the responsible party does not appropriately respond to the
Zoning Administrator within the specified period of time, each additional day
that lapses shall constitute an additional violation of this chapter and shall
be prosecuted accordingly. The Zoning Administrator shall also upon the lapse
of the specified response period notify the landowner to restore the land to
the condition which existed prior to the violation of this chapter.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 155.001 TITLE.
   This Chapter 155 shall be known and referred to hereafter as the
“Subdivision Code of the city.”
(Ord. 179, passed 2-16-78)
§ 155.002 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of dividing open land into home sites, or separate parcels
for other uses, is one of the most important factors in the growth of any
community. Few activities have a more lasting effect upon its appearance and
environment. Once the land has been subdivided into urban lots and the streets,
homes, and other structures have been constructed, the basic character of this
permanent addition to the community has become firmly established. It is then
virtually impossible to alter its basic character without substantial expense.
In most subdivisions, roads and streets must be maintained and various public
services must be provided. The welfare of the entire community is thereby
affected in many important respects. It is, therefore, to the interest of the
general public, the developer, and the future owners that subdivisions be
conceived, designed, and developed in accordance with sound rules and proper
standards.
   (B)   All subdivision of land hereafter submitted for approval shall fully
comply in all respects with the regulations set forth herein. It is the purpose
of these regulations:
      (1)   To provide for the orderly, economic, and safe development of land
and urban services and facilities;
      (2)   To promote the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare
of residents of the city;
      (3)   To assure equitable handling of all subdivision plats by providing
uniform procedures; and
      (4)   To place the cost of improvements against those benefitting from
their construction.
(Ord. 179, passed 2-16-78)
§ 155.003 SCOPE.
   The rules and regulations governing plats and subdivision of land contained
herein shall apply within and without, as hereinafter set forth, the city and
other land as permitted by state statutes. In the event of overlapping
jurisdiction within the prescribed area, the extent of jurisdiction shall be
determined and agreed upon between this community and the other governmental
units concerned. Except in the case of resubdivision, this code shall not apply
to any lot or lots forming a part of a subdivision recorded in the office of
the County Recorder prior to the effective date of this code, nor is it
intended by this code to repeal, annul, or in any way impair or interfere with
existing provisions of other laws and ordinances, or with private restrictions
placed upon property by deed, covenant, or other private agreement, or with
restrictive covenants governing the land.
(Ord. 179, passed 2-16-78)
§ 155.004 JURISDICTION.
   These regulations governing plats and the subdivision of land shall apply to
the area within the corporate limits of the city, and the unincorporated area
within two miles of its corporate limits.
(Ord. 179, passed 2-16-78)
§ 155.005 COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.
   (A)   After the adoption of this code, no lot, tract, or parcel of land
shall be divided or subdivided or sold, no permit shall be issued to alter or
erect any buildings upon land in a subdivision, and no building shall be
erected in a subdivision unless a subdivision plat has been approved and been
recorded and until the improvements required by the City Council relative to
the subdivision have been constructed or guaranteed as provided herein.
   (B)   The division of land into tracts, parcels, or lots larger than five
acres in area and 300 feet in width shall be exempt from the requirements of
this chapter, provided the division and conveyance does not result in the
division of the parcel into two or more lots or parcels, any one of which is
less than five acres in area or 300 feet in width.
(Ord. 179, passed 2-16-78)
Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 155.006 PLAT APPROVAL REQUIRED.
   Before any plat shall have any validity, it shall have been approved by the
city Planning Commission and the City Council and recorded in the office of the
County Recorder.
(Ord. 179, passed 2-16-78)
§ 155.007 CONFLICTS; STRICTER PROVISIONS APPLY.
   It is not intended by this chapter to annul or interfere with any other
official regulations or ordinances of the city; provided, however, that where
there is a difference between minimum standards or dimensions herein and those
contained in other official regulations or ordinances of the city, the highest
standards shall apply.
(Ord. 179, passed 2-16-78)
§ 155.008 RULES.
   (A)   Words used in the present tense include the past and future tense.
   (B)   The singular number includes the plural and the plural includes the
singular.
   (C)   In the event of conflicting provisions in the text of this regulation,
the more restrictive shall apply.

PLATTING PROCEDURE
§ 155.020 PRELIMINARY PLAT; PREPARING AND FILING.
   (A)   Prior to the preparation of the preliminary plat, the subdivider shall
prepare a subdivision sketch plan for review by the Planning Commission. The
sketch plan will be submitted as a basis for informal discussion between the
subdivider and the Planning Commission and shall not constitute formal filing
of the plat with the city. The Planning Commission shall provide advice and
assistance to the subdivider but will take no action on the sketch plan. The
sketch plan should, as a minimum, show the site’s location in the community,
the type of development proposed, and preliminary lot and road layout including
proposed minimum lot size. The subdivider shall pay the expense (if any)
incurred by the city for the services to the city and/or Planning Commission of
the Engineer and Attorney in the review of the sketch plan.
   (B)   When the subdivider feels he or she is ready to prepare the
preliminary plat, he or she shall have his or her surveyor and/or planner draw
one which is in conformity with the requirements of this chapter, as described
in §§
155.080 et seq.
   (C)   The subdivider shall fill out an application for consideration of
planning request, or other application blanks as may be required. At the time
of filing, the subdivider shall pay appropriate fees as set forth in
Chapter 34.
   (D)   The subdivider shall furnish the City Manager-Clerk with 12 copies of
the preliminary plat at least 15 days prior to the Planning Commission meeting
at which it is to be considered.
(Ord. 179, passed 2-16-78)
§ 155.021 REVIEW OF PRELIMINARY PLAT.
   (A)   The City Manager-Clerk shall, upon receipt of the preliminary plat and
application, refer three copies of the plat and application to the City
Council, two copies of the plat to the Planning Commission, one copy of the
plat to the school district if applicable, one copy to the County Planning
Commission, and one copy to the Town Board if applicable.
   (B)   If the proposed subdivision abuts any state trunk highway, the City
Manager-Clerk shall also refer one copy to the state District Highway
Headquarters for review as required by state law; if it adjoins a public body
of water one copy shall be referred to the state Commission of Natural
Resources for review, and one copy to the Watershed District Board if
applicable. Within five days after receiving the preliminary plat that includes
or borders on an existing or proposed county road, the City Manager shall
submit it to the County Engineer for review.
   (C)   The Engineer, Fire Chief, and Utilities Superintendent, and if
appropriate, the School Board, County Planning Commission, Town Board, and the
District Highway Engineer, shall within 30 days submit reports to the Planning
Commission expressing recommendations for approval, disapproval, or revisions
of the preliminary plat.
   (D)   Within 45 days after the plat is filed, the Planning Commission shall
hold a public hearing on the plat. One notice of the purpose, time, and place
of this public hearing shall be published in the official newspaper at least
ten days prior to the day of the hearing. The subdivider shall furnish the City
Manager-Clerk with the names and mailing addresses of owners of all lands
within 300 feet of the boundaries of the preliminary plat and the City Manager-
Clerk shall give mailed notice of the hearing to these owners at least ten days
prior to the day of the hearing, although failure of any property owner to
receive notification shall not invalidate the proceedings.
   (E)   The subdivider or his or her representatives shall appear before the
Planning Commission at the public hearing, in order to answer questions
concerning the preliminary plat.
   (F)   The report of the Planning Commission shall be submitted to the City
Council not later than 30 days after the public hearing on the plat. If the
Planning Commission fails to make a report, the City Council shall proceed
without the report. Failure to receive a report from the Planning Commission as
herein provided shall not invalidate the proceedings or actions of the City
Council.
   (G)   The City Council shall either approve or disapprove of a proposed plat
within 120 days after a preliminary plat which contains all of the data
required by §
155.041 and which conforms to the minimum design standards required by §§
155.055 et seq. is submitted to the city unless the subdivider agrees to an
extension of this time. The City Council may hold a public hearing on the plat

subdivision, and to adjacent unsubdivided parcels unless the topography clearly
indicates that connection is not feasible. Reserve strips and land-locked areas
shall not be created.
   (D)   The arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall make provision
for the appropriate continuation of the existing streets in adjoining areas.
   (E)   Where adjoining areas are not subdivided, but may be subdivided, the
arrangement of streets in a new subdivision shall make provision for the proper
projection of streets into adjoining areas by carrying the new streets to the

   (M)   All remnants of lots below minimum size left over after subdividing a
larger tract must be added to adjacent lots, or a plan shown as to future use,
rather than allowed to remain as unusable parcels.
   (N)   In the case where a proposed plat is adjacent to a limited access
highway, other major highway, or thoroughfare, there shall be no direct
vehicular access from individual lots to this type of street and road. In the
platting of small tracts of land fronting on limited access highways or
thoroughfares where there is no other alternative, a temporary entrance may be
granted; as neighboring land becomes subdivided and more preferable access
arrangements become possible, these temporary access permits shall void.
Traffic controls may be required at the intersections of any street,
thoroughfare, and/or highway when, in the opinion of the City Engineer,
existing and/or future traffic and/or pedestrian volume may reasonably warrant.
The city may, but need not, reasonably participate in the cost thereof when
unusual circumstances, present and/or future, justify.
   (O)   In any area where lots are platted in excess of 24,000 square feet or
160 feet in width at the building setback line, a preliminary resubdivision
plan may be required showing a potential and feasible way in which the lot or
lots may be resubdivided in future years for more intensive use of the land.
The placement of buildings or structures upon these lots shall allow for
potential resubdivision.

large trees, watercourses, scenic points, historical spots, and similar
community assets which, if preserved, will add attractiveness and stability to
the proposed development of the property.
(Ord. 179, passed 2-16-78)
§ 155.069 PUBLIC SITES AND OPEN SPACE DEDICATION.
   (A)   The subdivider shall consult with the Planning Commission, at the time

as to the location of any property that should be dedicated to the public, such
as parks, playgrounds, or other public property. The plat shall show the
location and dimensions of all areas to be dedicated in this manner.
   (B)   Where a proposed drainage way, park, playground, school site, or other
public site, as shown on the Comprehensive Plan, is embraced in part or in
whole by the boundary of a proposed subdivision and the public sites are not
dedicated, these sites shall be reserved and no action taken towards approval
of a final plat for a period not to exceed 90 days, to allow the proper
governmental agency the opportunity to consider and take action towards
acquisition of this public ground or park by purchase or other methods.
   (C)   In all new residential subdivisions, including planned unit
developments and mobile home parks, a park dedication fee shall be paid to the
city. Such fee shall be paid at the time the final plat is approved. Such money
as may be collected shall be used for parkland acquisition and park and trail
development. In lieu of the fee, and if agreed to by the City Council, a
minimum of 5% of the gross area subdivided shall be dedicated for public
recreation space or other public use. The dedicated percent of the gross area
subdivided shall be in addition to property dedicated for streets, alleys,
easements, or other public ways. No areas may be dedicated for public use until
such areas have been approved by the governing body as suitable and necessary
for the public health, safety, convenience, and general welfare. Lots created
in any manner that are larger than five acres may be subject to the above
requirements if, in the opinion of the City Council, the lots will not be
resubdivided.
   (D)   Where a subdivision includes any portion of a lakeshore or the
shoreline of a meandered stream, no less than 10% of the portion of the
shoreline lying within a subdivision shall be dedicated for use by the public
along with sufficient land to allow access to a publicly dedicated street. This
land may be a part of, or equal to, the percent of land for dedication as
public land under this section.

to reimburse itself out of the deposit for any cost and expense incurred by the
city for completion of the work in case of default of the subdivider under the
contract, and for any damages sustained on account of any breach thereof. Upon
completion of the work and termination of any liability, the balance remaining
in the deposit shall be refunded to the subdivider.
   (C)   In lieu of making the escrow deposit, the subdivider may furnish a
performance bond with corporate surety, in a penal sum equal to 125% of the

of those improvements as may be determined to be necessary. In the event of
small subdivisions or in subdivisions in which development may proceed slowly,
or in other events in which the construction of gravel streets, utility lines,
or other improvements is clearly not feasible immediately following the
approval of the plat, the City Council may elect to commence assessment
proceedings, utilize funds or a cash escrow agreement, or otherwise move to
finance and install improvements when the subdivision is developed to the point
of warranting the improvements.
      (3)   The improvements are required in order to provide greater assurance
of public health, assure reliability of water supply, provide for economy of
installation, provide more effective fire fighting through hydrants, and
otherwise protect the public health, safety, convenience, and general welfare.

      (9)   Veterinary clinics;
      (10)   Any use requiring outdoor storage or sales space;
      (11)   Public garage;
      (12)   The unenclosed parking of trucks as an accessory use, when used in
the conduct of a permitted business;
      (13)   Commercial uses determined by the City Council to be of the same
general character as identified permitted and conditional uses and found not to
be detrimental to the general public health and welfare. Uses grandfathered in
when this chapter was adopted may reasonably expand by changing or adding
products if approved by the City Council; and
      (14)   Planned unit developments and condominiums.
   (G)   Minimum standards for exterior architecture.
      (1)   Purpose. The purpose of this division is to establish minimum
standards for exterior architecture of commercial, residential, office and
industrial buildings, to ensure high quality of development, redevelopment and
compatibility with evolving architectural or planning themes that contribute to
a community image of quality, visual aesthetics, permanence and stability that
are in the best interest of the citizens of the city.
         (a)   These standards are intended to prevent use of materials that
are unsightly, rapidly deteriorate, contribute to depreciation of area property
values, or cause urban blight.
         (b)   These structural standards are further intended to ensure
coordinated design of building exteriors, additions and accessory structure
exteriors, in order to prevent visual disharmony; minimize adverse impacts on
adjacent properties from buildings that are or may become unsightly, and
buildings that detract from the character and appearance of the area.
         (c)   It is not the intent of this division to unduly restrict design
freedom, when reviewing and approving project architecture in relationship to
the proposed land use, site characteristics, and interior building layout.
      (2)   Applicability. The design standards in this division shall apply to
the following:
         (a)   All facades of new principle buildings.
         (b)   All facades of new accessory buildings.
         (c)   Remodeling of existing buildings that result in "refacing" more
than one side of the existing building, or refacing the wall oriented toward
the nearest public road.
         (d)   Additions to buildings that increase the gross floor area by
more than 15% for commercial or retail buildings. Additions not exceeding these
thresholds may be constructed using exterior materials that match or are
compatible with the existing building materials and colors.
         (e)   All subsequent additions and alterations constructed after the
erection of an original building or buildings shall be of the same materials as
those used in the original building, and shall be designed in a manner
conforming to the original architectural concept and general appearance. These
provisions shall not prevent the city from requiring upgrading of the quality
of materials used in a remodeling or expansion program.
      (3)   Building design and construction standards.  
         (a)   Required materials. In the B-1 zoned district, on all the walls
that face a public street, at least 50% of the entire exterior wall surface
shall be constructed on one of the following materials:
            1.   Face brick;
            2.   Rock face block;
            3.   Cementitious siding;
            4.   Natural stone or stone veneers;
            5.   Glass;
            6.   Masonry stucco;
            7.   Synthetic stucco;
            8.   Exterior Insulation and Finish Systems (EIFS);
            9.   Concrete block.
         (b)   Prohibited materials. Under no circumstances shall sheet
plywood, sheet metal, corrugated metal, galvanized metal, unfinished metal,
asbestos, iron, or plain concrete block (whether painted or color-integrated or
not) be deemed acceptable as exterior wall materials on buildings.

§ 156.043 PUD, PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of the planned unit development district (PUD) is
to permit great flexibility in the use and design of structures and land in
situations where modification of specific provisions of this chapter will not
be contrary to its intent and purpose or significantly inconsistent with the
planning on which it is based, and will not be harmful to the neighborhood in
which the districts occur.
   (B)   Permitted, accessory, and conditional uses. The following are
permitted, accessory, and conditional uses within the PUD district:
      (1)   Permitted, accessory, and conditional uses allowed within the
zoning district where the proposed PUD is to be located; and
      (2)   Other uses provided that these uses shall not occupy more than 10%
of the gross land area.
   (C)   Lot area regulations. The provisions of this section shall be applied
to land of one or more acres in size. The total land area may not be less than
that required under the other district provisions for the equivalent use and
number of structures or units.
   (D)   Procedural requirements.
      (1)   Preliminary development plan.
         (a)   The applicant requesting a planned unit development shall first
submit a preliminary development plan in accordance with the procedures for
amendments set forth and regulated by this chapter.
         (b)   The preliminary development plan shall consist of location and
preliminary site maps including maps and/or statements describing proposals
suggested for land use, parking, drainage, utilities, and other additional data
required by the Planning Commission or City Council.
      (2)   Final development plan.
         (a)   Within one year from date of City Council approval of the
preliminary development plan, the applicant shall submit a final development
plan to the Planning Commission.
         (b)   The final development plan shall include:
            1.   Complete site development plans;
            2.   Complete landscaping plans (where necessary);
            3.   Complete parking and circulation plans;
            4.   Complete drainage and other utility system plans;
            5.   Preliminary architectural floor plans; and
            6.   Additional data as required by the Planning Commission.
         (c)   The Planning Commission shall review the final development plan
to assure consistency with the approved preliminary development plan. The
Planning Commission shall recommend for approval or disapproval with conditions
and reasons thereof to the City Council. In case the plan is disapproved, the
applicant shall be notified in writing of the reason for disapproval and what
requirements are necessary to meet the approval of the Commission.
         (d)   The final development plan, together with the recommendations of
the Planning Commission, shall be submitted to the City Council at its next
regularly scheduled meeting. If accepted, the final development plan shall be
approved by resolution, including acceptance of all agreements for basic
improvements, public dedications, and other requirements as indicated by the
City Council. If denied, the reasons for refusal shall be set forth in the
proceedings of the Council and reported to the applicant.
      (3)   Approved plans. Requests for variances may be approved when
consistent with the purpose of this section. All approved final development
plans which include the platting or replatting of property within the PUD shall
be filed and recorded with the County Recorder’s office. Failure to do so
within one year of Council’s final approval shall result in the requiring of a
new preliminary development plan according with the procedures set forth in
this section to ensure compliance with any new requirements.
      (4)   Recording on Zoning Map. Upon approval of the first PUD, the Zoning
Administrator shall record the PUD district onto the Zoning Map and designate
the district as PUD-1. Thereafter, future approved PUD districts shall be
designated in sequential order, i.e., PUD-2, PUD-3, PUD-4, and so on.
(Ord. 134/94, passed 3-24-94)
GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
§ 156.055 LOT AREA REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Lot area requirements shall be specified under each zoning district.
   (B)   In addition, the following regulations shall be complied with:
      (1)   No use shall be established or hereinafter maintained on a lot
recorded after the effective date of this chapter which is less in area or
width than prescribed hereinafter for that use in the zoning district in which
it is to be located.
      (2)   In the appropriate residential districts on a lot of record on the
effective date of this chapter, a single family dwelling may be established
provided the lot is at least 75% of the required size. Requests for building on
conforming lots shall be accompanied by a site plan showing the adjacent lot
lines and water and sewer systems in relationship to the proposed water-sewer
systems. Development should only be allowed when it can be demonstrated that no
pollution or health hazards will result.
      (3)   No building shall be converted so as to conflict with, or further
conflict with, the lot size requirements of the district in which the building
is located.
      (4)   In areas not served by public water and sewer disposal systems,
soil tests may be required to insure the sanitary function of private on-site
systems. If tests indicate that the soils are not adequate, the size of the lot
area will be increased in lot area until the size is deemed adequate.
      (5)   Except in the case of planned unit developments as provided for
herein, not more than one principal building shall be located on a lot.
      (6)   Single family homes may be excluded from lot area and setback
requirements provided a conditional use permit is issued under the terms of the
planned unit development provisions of this chapter. Density zoning shall be
interpreted to mean the permission of reduced lot area standards under
conditions whereby the number of structures or units permitted is not greater
than permitted by the application of the regular provisions of the district,
but with all land excluded from the lot area requirements added onto public
open space (park, playground, school site, walkway, or other approved open
green space).
      (7)   Public rights-of-way are not a part of the buildable lot area and,
therefore, shall not be included as part of the minimum lot area required.
Required yards in the districts specified shall be subject to the additional
requirements as given in §
156.056.
(Ord. 134/94, passed 3-24-94)
§ 156.056 YARD REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Yard requirements shall be set forth under each zoning district.
Front, side, and rear yards shall be provided in accordance with the
regulations hereafter indicated and shall be unobstructed from the ground level
to the sky.
   (B)   No required yard or other open space allocated to a building or
dwelling group shall be used to satisfy yard, other open space, or minimum lot
area requirements for any other building.
   (C)   On a corner lot, nothing shall be placed or allowed to grow in a
manner so as materially to impede vision between a height of 2 1/2-feet and 10
feet above street level for a distance of 30 feet from intersecting streets.
   (D)   Through lots in any district shall have a required front yard on any
street.
   (E)   In any district, where existing structures within a block have front
yard setbacks different than those required, the front yard minimum shall be
the average of the adjacent structures.

proposed amendment or conditional use. Its judgment shall be based upon, but
not limited to, the following factors:
      (1)   Relationship to the city’s growth management system/Comprehensive
Plan;
      (2)   The geographical area involved;
      (3)   Whether the use will tend to or actually depreciate the area in
which it is proposed;
      (4)   The character of the surrounding area; and
      (5)   The demonstrated need for the use.
   (E)   The Planning Commission, City Council, and city staff shall have the
authority to request additional information from the applicant concerning
operational factors, this information to be declared necessary to establish
performance conditions in relation to all pertinent sections of this chapter.
   (F)   The Planning Commission shall make a finding of fact and recommend
actions or conditions, including explanations of any negative votes, relating
to the request to the City Council.

the use or activity shall be the minimum established for the district.
      (2)   Where applicable, all city, state, and federal laws, regulations,
and ordinances shall be complied with and all necessary permits secured.
      (3)   Adequate off-street parking and loading shall be provided in
accordance with §§
156.075 et seq. This parking and loading shall be screened and landscaped from
abutting residential uses in compliance with this subchapter.
      (4)   The proposed water, sewer, and other utilities shall be capable of
accommodating the proposed use.
      (5)   The street serving the proposed use or activity shall be of

or districts.
      (8)   All lighting shall be designed as to have no direct source of light

      (9)   The use or activity shall be properly drained to control surface
water runoff.
      (10)   The architectural appearance and functional plan of the building
and site shall not be so dissimilar to the existing buildings or area as to
cause impairment in property values or constitute a blighting influence.
      (11)   Where structures combine residential and non-residential uses,
these uses shall be separated and provided with individual outside access, and
the uses shall not conflict in any manner.
   (H)   Upon receiving the report and recommendation of the Planning
Commission, the City Council shall place the application and/or report and
recommendation on the agenda for the next regular meeting. The reports and
recommendations shall be entered in and made part of the permanent written

complete the work has been granted by the City Council. The extension shall be
requested in writing and filed with the Zoning Administrator or City Manager-
Clerk at least 30 days before the expiration of the original conditional use
permit. There shall be no charge for the filing of this petition. The request

work permitted in the conditional use permit. The petition shall be presented
to the Planning Commission for a recommendation and to the City Council for a
decision and shall be requested only one time on a singular action.

improvements or development. The security shall guarantee conformance and
compliance with the conditions of the conditional use permit and the ordinances
of the city.

VARIANCES AND APPEALS
§ 156.165 BOARD OF ADJUSTMENTS AND APPEALS; AUTHORITY AND DUTIES.
   The City Council shall act as the Board of Adjustments and Appeals and shall
have the following powers:
   (A)   To hear appeals where it is alleged that there is an error in any
order, requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative
official in the enforcement of this chapter; and
   (B)   To hear requests for variances from the literal provisions of this
chapter in instances where their strict enforcement would cause undue hardship,
as defined in §
156.006, because of circumstances unique to the individual property under
consideration.
(Ord. 134/94, passed 3-24-94)
§ 156.166 FINDING OF FACT.
   In considering all requests for a variance or appeal, the Board of
Adjustments and Appeals shall make a finding of fact as appropriate that the
proposed action will not:
   (A)   Impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property;
   (B)   Unreasonably increase the congestion in the public right-of-way;
   (C)   Increase the danger of fire or endanger the public safety;
   (D)   Unreasonably diminish or impair established property values within the
neighborhood;
   (E)   Cause an unreasonable strain upon existing municipal facilities and
services;
   (F)   Be contrary in any way to the provisions and intent of the city’s
growth management system/Comprehensive Plan; or
   (G)   Have a negative direct and indirect fiscal impact upon the city,
county, or school district, unless the proposed use is determined to be in the
public interest.
(Ord. 134/94, passed 3-24-94)
§ 156.167 CONDITIONS FOR GRANTING VARIANCES.
   (A)   (1)   The City Council, after receiving recommendations from the
Planning Commission, may not permit as a variance any use that is not permitted
under this chapter for property in the zone where the affected person’s land is
located.
      (2)   A variance may be granted when it is demonstrated that this action
will be in keeping with the spirit and intent of this chapter and when the
property in question cannot be put to a reasonable use if used under conditions
allowed by the official controls, the plight of the landowner is due to
circumstances unique to his or her property and not created by the landowner,
and the variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the
locality.
   (B)   Economic considerations alone shall not constitute an undue hardship
if reasonable use for the property exists under the terms of the chapter. Undue
hardship also includes, but is not limited to, inadequate access to direct
sunlight for solar energy systems. A non-economic hardship shall exist by
reason of one or more of the following:
      (1)   Narrowness, shallowness, or shape of a specific parcel of property
or a lot existing and of record upon the effective date of this chapter;
      (2)   Exceptional topographic or water conditions of a specific parcel of
land or lot; or
      (3)   Inadequate access to direct sunlight for solar energy systems.
   (C)   A variance may be granted for the above reasons when the strict
application of the provisions of this chapter would result in exceptional
difficulties in developing the property in a legally permissible manner. The
City Council may impose conditions in granting the variance to insure
compliance and to protect adjacent properties.
   (D)   A variance shall not allow any use which is not a permitted principal
use, a permitted accessory use, or a permitted use requiring a conditional use
permit. The only lawful variance is one which is usually called a “non-use
variance,” and the use of the variance procedure does not authorize any kind of
unlawful “spot zoning.”
(Ord. 134/94, passed 3-24-94)
§ 156.168 APPLICATION PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Requests for variances or appeals shall be filed with the Zoning
Administrator, on an official application form. The application shall be
accompanied by a fee as outlined in §
156.182. This fee shall not be refunded. The application shall also be
accompanied by copies of detailed written or graphic materials fully explaining

and report at least 15 days before the next regular meeting.
   (B)   The Planning Commission shall consider the request at its next regular

meeting following the next regular meeting. The applicant or a representative
thereof shall appear before the Planning Commission in order to answer
questions concerning the requested variance.
   (C)   The Planning Commission, City Council, and city staff shall have the

actions or conditions relating to the request to the City Council.

Commission, the City Council shall place the application and/or report and
recommendation on the agenda for the next regular meeting. These reports,
recommendations, and findings shall be entered in and made part of the written
record of the Council meeting.
   (F)   Upon reviewing the application and/or receiving the report and
recommendation of the Planning Commission, the City Council shall take one of
the following actions within the time frame established by M.S. § 15.99, as it
may be amended from time to time:
      (1)   Approve or disapprove the request as recommended by the Planning
Commission;
      (2)   Approve or disapprove the recommendation of the Planning Commission
with modifications, alterations, or differing conditions. These modifications,
alterations, or differing conditions shall be in writing and made part of the
Council’s records; or
      (3)   Refer the recommendation back to the Planning Commission for
further consideration. This procedure shall be followed only one time on a
singular action.
   (G)   Decisions on requests for variances shall be by a majority of those
voting on the question. The Zoning Administrator shall notify the applicant of
the Council’s action.
   (H)   The decisions of the Planning Commission shall be advisory to the City
Council. The decisions of the City Council shall be final subject to judicial
review.

§ 156.169 EXPIRATION AND EXTENSION.
   Whenever within one year after granting a variance or appeal the terms as
permitted by the variance or appeal shall not have been completed, then that
variance or appeal shall become null and void unless a petition for extension
of time in which to complete the work has been granted by the City Council. The
extension shall be requested in writing and filed with the Zoning Administrator
at least 30 days before the expiration of the original variance or appeal.
There shall be no charge for the filing of the petition. The request for
extension shall state facts showing a good faith attempt to complete the work
permitted in the variance or appeal. The petition shall be presented to the
Planning Commission for a recommendation and to the City Council for a
decision, and shall be requested only one time on a singular action.
(Ord. 134/94, passed 3-24-94)
§ 156.170 PERFORMANCE BOND.
   (A)   The City Council shall have the authority to require a performance
bond or other securities when it is deemed necessary and appropriate.

approval of a variance or appeal the city may be provided with a surety bond,
cash escrow, certificate of deposit, securities, or cash deposit prior to the
issuing of building permits or initiation of work on the proposed improvements
or development. The security shall guarantee conformance and compliance with
the conditions of the variance or appeal and the ordinances of the city.
   (C)   The security may be in the amount of the City Council’s estimated
costs of labor and materials for the proposed improvements or development.
   (D)   The city may hold the security until completion of the proposed
improvements or development and a certificate of occupancy indicating
compliance with the variance or appeal and ordinances of the city has been
issued by the city Zoning Administrator.
   (E)   Failure to comply with the conditions of the variance or appeal and/or
ordinances of the city may result in forfeiture of the security.
