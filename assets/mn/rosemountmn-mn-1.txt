ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT
SECTION:
1-10-1: Purpose
1-10-2: General Provisions And Definitions
1-10-3: Administrative Citation Procedures
1-10-4: Additional Criminal Penalties
1-10-1: PURPOSE:
It is the purpose of this program to execute a new alternative method in
enforcing code compliance. While criminal fines and penalties have been the
most frequent enforcement mechanism, there are certain negative consequences
for both the City and the violator. The penalties associated with the criminal
court system are not always effective solutions to address Code violations.
Accordingly, the City finds that the use of administrative citations and the
imposition of civil penalties is a legitimate and necessary alternative method
of enforcement and will serve to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the
residents of the City. This method of enforcement shall be in addition to any
other legal remedy which may be pursued for code violations. The City is
enacting this administrative citation process pursuant to its authority under
Minn. Stat. §§ 412.221 and 412.231, as well as legal precedent that cities have
the power to direct the mode and manner of enforcing city ordinances. (Ord.
2024-03, 4-16-2024)
1-10-2: GENERAL PROVISIONS AND DEFINITIONS:
Any person in violation of this Code shall be subject to an administrative
notice, citation and penalty process outlined in this chapter.
   A.   Administrative Offense: An administrative offense is a violation of any
of the following provisions of this code and is subject to an administrative
citation and civil penalties. Each day a violation exists constitutes a
separate offense.
   B.   Civil Penalty: A civil penalty imposed under this chapter will not
exceed the maximum fine for a misdemeanor under state law.
   C.   Schedule Of Civil Penalties And Fees: The City Council will adopt a fee
schedule of administrative civil penalties for various types of administrative
offenses.
   D.   Abatement Procedures: An administrative offense may be subject to an
abatement order whereby the City or City's agent corrects or removes the
violation.
   E.   Exemption: Alcohol and tobacco license violations are not subject to
administrative citations under this chapter. Traffic and criminal offenses are
not subject to administrative citations under this chapter.
   F.   Confidentiality: Code violation data maintained by the City are
governed by Minnesota Statutes Chapter 13 and are generally considered public
data. The identity of individuals who register complaints with the City
concerning real property is classified as confidential data pursuant to Minn.
Stat. § 13.44. (Ord. 2024-03, 4-16-2024)
1-10-3: ADMINISTRATIVE CITATION PROCEDURES:
   A.   Authority: Any Rosemount peace officer or community service officer,
code enforcement official, building official, or any other person with
authority to enforce the City Code is authorized to issue administrative
notices and citations pursuant to this chapter.
   B.   Administrative Notice: Any person authorized under
1-10-3(A), shall, upon determining there has been a violation, notify the
violator as follows.
      1.   In the case of a vehicular violation, a notice will be attached to
the vehicle in violation.
      2.   The City will deliver the administrative notice to the violator in
person or by regular mail within ten (10) days of the offense. The notice shall
set forth the nature, date, and time of the violation, a description of the
property on which the violation occurred, the name of the official issuing the
notice, the amount of the scheduled penalty should it lead to a citation, and
abatement procedures, if applicable.
      3.   Unless subject to more immediate abatement by the City, pursuant to
City Code section
9-4-11, the violator will have fourteen (14) calendar days to correct the
violation after issuance of the administrative notice. If the violator is
making a good faith attempt to remedy the violation, the City may grant an
extension, the length of which must be agreed upon in writing between the City
and violator.
   C.   Administrative Citation:
      1.   Upon the failure to correct the violation specified in the
administrative notice within the time specified in the notice, the City may
issue an administrative citation.
      2.   The City will deliver the administrative citation in person or by
regular mail, which will contain the following information:
         a.   A description or address of the property on which the code
violation has occurred;
         b.   Reference to the Code that is alleged to be violated;
         c.   The amount of the civil penalty which will be due and payable to
the City within thirty (30) days of the date the citation is mailed or
personally served;
         d.   A statement that the violation must be corrected and the time
frame for compliance;
         e.   A statement that the violation and the amount of the civil
penalty may be contested by notifying the City Clerk in writing within fourteen
(14) calendar days after the citation was mailed or personally delivered; and
         f.   A statement that failure to pay the civil penalty may constitute
a lien upon the property where the violation occurred or a personal obligation
of the violator.
   D.   Contesting Administrative Citation Or Civil Penalty: Any person may
contest an administrative citation or civil penalty by requesting a hearing.
Such request must be in writing and delivered or mailed to the City Clerk
within fourteen (14) calendar days of the issuance of the administrative
citation.
   E.   Administrative Hearing Procedures:
      1.   Hearing Officers: The City will establish a procedure for evaluating
the competency of appointed hearing officers. The City will select a hearing
officer to hear and determine a matter for which a hearing is requested. The
hearing officer will be an impartial citizen with the authority to sustain,
reduce, or dismiss a citation. The hearing officer will be a public officer as
defined by Minn. Stat. § 609.415.
      2.   Notice Of Hearing: Within thirty (30) days of receiving a hearing
request, the City will notify the violator of the date, time, and location of
hearing and the citation or penalty that is being contested.
      3.   File Transmittal: Upon receiving a hearing request, the City will
prepare a file for the case to be delivered or transmitted to the hearing
officer. The case file will contain:
         a.   A copy of the administrative notice to the property owner, if
applicable;
         b.   A copy of the administrative citation;
         c.   Any case history in the applicable City department's files;
         d.   Photographs and/or videotape of the property or the code
violation if available; and
         e.   Any supplemental reports or documents supporting the City's
findings of a violation.
      4.   Violator Evidence: No later than forty-eight (48) hours (two (2)
business days) before the administrative hearing, the violator may provide the
City with a case file that may contain the following information: their summary
of the violation, a personal statement, or any other supporting documentation
or materials (e.g., photographs, audio/visual materials) they wish to use as
evidence. The City will not accept any hearing materials after the 48-hour time
window has passed.
      5.   Presentation Of Case: At the hearing, the parties will have the
opportunity to present testimony and question any witnesses, but strict rules
of evidence will not apply. The hearing officer must tape record the hearing
and may receive testimony and exhibits. The hearing officer must receive and
give weight to evidence, including hearsay evidence, that possesses probative
value commonly accepted by reasonable and prudent people in the conduct of
their affairs.
      6.   Decision: The hearing officer's decision and supporting reasons must
be in writing. The decision will be mailed to the parties within ten business
(10) days after the hearing. The hearing officer has the authority to determine
that a violation occurred, to dismiss a citation, to impose the scheduled
penalty, or to reduce, stay, or waive a scheduled penalty either
unconditionally or upon compliance with appropriate conditions. The hearing
officer may consider any or all of the following factors when imposing a
penalty:
         a.   The duration of the violation;
         b.   The frequency or reoccurrence of the violation;
         c.   The seriousness of the violation;
         d.   The violator's conduct after issuance of the administrative
notice or citation, or notice of hearing;
         e.   The good faith effort by the violator to comply;
         f.   The impact of the violation upon the community; and
         g.   Any other factors appropriate to a just result.
      The hearing officer may not impose a penalty greater than the established
penalty, except that the hearing officer may impose a penalty for each week
that the violation continues if the violation caused a serious threat of harm
to the public health, safety, or welfare as determined by the hearing officer,
or if the violator intentionally and unreasonably refused to comply with the
code requirement. If the hearing officer sustains the citation, the violator
will be given a specified timeframe to remedy the violation. If the violation
is not remedied within the timeframe, the City will issue a second separate
citation to the property owner.
      7.   Failure To Appear: Failure to attend the hearing constitutes an
admission of the violation. A hearing officer may waive this result upon good
cause shown. Examples of "good cause" are death, incapacitating illness or
disability of the accused, or lack of proper service of the citation or notice
of the hearing. "Good cause" does not include forgetfulness and intentional
delay.
      8.   Owner Found In Violation: If the violation is upheld, then the
violator must pay a fee toward the cost of the hearing per the City's fee
schedule.
      9.   Withdrawal Of Hearing Request: At any time prior to the hearing, a
violator may withdraw the hearing request and pay the civil penalty.
   F.   Civil Penalty: The person responsible for the violation who has been
issued a citation and chooses not to appeal for a hearing must pay the
scheduled penalty. Payment of the penalty constitutes admission of the
violation.
      1.   A late payment fee of six percent (6%) of the scheduled penalty must
be assessed quarterly, or part thereof, that the penalty remains unpaid after
the due date.
      2.   A subsequent violation within a 12-month period for the same or
substantially similar offense, the penalty increases to the amount set forth in
the City's fee schedule.
      3.   The City may issue a second citation or take other legal action to
achieve code compliance including, but not limited to, abatement actions
correcting or removing the violation.
   G.   Recovery Of Civil Penalties:
      1.   If a civil penalty is not paid within the time specified, it shall
constitute:
         a.   A personal obligation of the violator; or
         b.   A lien against the real property upon which the violation
occurred if the property or improvements on the property was the subject of the
violation.
      2.   A lien may be assessed against the property and collected in the
same manner as taxes.
      3.   A personal obligation may be collected by appropriate legal means.
      4.   Failure to pay a civil penalty is grounds for suspending or revoking
a permit associated with the violation.
      5.   During the time a civil penalty remains unpaid, no city approval
will be granted for a license, permit, or other city approval sought by the
violator or for property under the violator's ownership or control.
   H.   Abatement Procedure: Nothing in this chapter is intended to limit the
City's authority in Section
9-4-11 of this Code. (Ord. 2024-03, 4-16-2024)
1-10-4: ADDITIONAL CRIMINAL PENALTIES:

establishment licensed under this chapter. This is to protect and assist the
owners, operators, and employees of the establishment, as well as patrons and
the public in general, from harm stemming from the physical immediacy and
combination of alcohol, nudity, and sex. The council especially intends to
prevent any subliminal endorsement of sexual harassment or activities likely to

and b) businesses and organizations that, though their activities be lawful or
even commendable, use such illegitimate practices in solicitation; and c)
individual natural persons who, though they represent lawful businesses and
organizations, use such illegitimate solicitation practices; and d) the
operation of open sales lots in the city to ensure that they are safely
operated in a manner that will not impede public rights of way or the safety of
pedestrians or vehicles passing or participating in activities at outdoor sales
lots. (Ord. XVI.55, 6-7-2005)

prevent pawnbroking businesses from being used as facilities for commission of
crimes and to assure that such businesses comply with basic consumer protection
standards, thereby protecting the public health, safety, and general welfare of

3-8-1: FINDINGS AND PURPOSE:
Studies conducted by the American Planning Association, the Minnesota attorney
general's office and the governments of St. Paul, Minneapolis, and Ramsey,
Minnesota; St. Croix County, Wisconsin; Denver and Adams Counties, Colorado;
Chicago, Illinois; Phoenix, Arizona; Los Angeles, California; Rochester -
Olmsted County, Minnesota; Indianapolis, Indiana; Seattle, Washington; and the
Texas City Attorneys' Association have investigated the impacts that adult
establishments have in their communities. These studies have concluded that
adult establishments have negative secondary impacts on surrounding
neighborhoods. Those impacts included increased crime rates, lower property
values, increased transiency, neighborhood blight and potential health risks.
The Rosemount city council is relying on the studies, many of which were
conducted in larger cities, recognizing that the same or similar adverse
impacts could occur in a smaller city. Based on these studies and findings, the
city council concludes:
   A.   Minnesota statutes, section 462.357, allows the city to adopt
regulations to promote the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare.
   B.   The public health, safety, morals and general welfare will be promoted
by the city adopting regulations governing adult establishments.
   C.   Adult establishments have adverse secondary impacts of the type found
in the studies referenced in this section.
   D.   The adverse impacts caused by adult establishments tend to diminish if
adult establishments are governed by location requirements, licensing
requirements and health requirements.
   E.   It is not the intent to prohibit adult establishments from having a
reasonable opportunity to locate in the city.
   F.   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place
the burden of reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the
adult establishment. A licensing procedure will place an incentive on the
operators to see that the adult establishment is run in a manner consistent
with the health, safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as
the citizens of the city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances
that the licensee is the actual operator of the adult establishment fully in
possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein.
   G.   The fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted
of a certain crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may
engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter.
   H.   Smaller cities experience many of the same adverse impacts of adult
establishments present in larger communities. (Ord. 2013-03, 5-21-2013)

3-9-1: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
Because the city recognizes that many persons under the age of twenty-one (21)
years purchase or otherwise obtain, possess and use tobacco, tobacco products,
tobacco related devices, nicotine or lobelia delivery device, or electronic
delivery devices, and the sales, possession, and use are violations of both
state and federal laws; and because studies, which the city hereby accepts and
adopts, have shown that most smokers begin smoking before they have reached the
age of twenty-one (21) years and that those persons who reach the age of
twenty-one (21) years without having started smoking are significantly less
likely to begin smoking; and because smoking has been shown to be the cause of
several serious health problems which subsequently place a financial burden on
all levels of government; this chapter shall be intended to regulate the sale,
possession and use of tobacco, tobacco products, tobacco related devices,
nicotine or lobelia delivery device, or electronic delivery devices for the
purpose of enforcing and furthering existing laws, to protect underage persons
against the serious effects associated with the illegal use of tobacco, tobacco
products, tobacco related devices, nicotine or lobelia delivery device, or
electronic delivery devices, and to further the official public policy of the
state in regard to preventing young people from starting to smoke as stated in
Minnesota statutes section 144.391, as it may be amended from time to time.

shall be made on a form provided by the city. The application shall contain the
full name of the applicant, the applicant's residential and business addresses
and telephone numbers, the name of the business for which the license is
sought, and any additional information the city deems necessary. Upon receipt
of a completed application, the city council shall take action on the license
application at a regularly scheduled city council meeting. If the city clerk
shall determine that an application is incomplete, he or she shall return the
application to the applicant with notice of the information necessary to make
the application complete.
   C.   Investigation: For all new and renewal applicants, a background
investigation may be conducted on any business owner, manager, and other
individual or enterprise listed on the application. For applicants who are
applying for a license for more than one location, only one background
investigation and background investigation fee shall be required.
   D.   Action: The city council may either approve or deny the license, or it
may delay action for a reasonable period of time as necessary to complete any
investigation of the application or the applicant it deems necessary. If the
city council shall approve the license, the city clerk shall issue the license

the general public on the licensed premises.
   J.   Renewals: The renewal of a license issued under this chapter shall be
handled in the same manner as the original application. The request for a
renewal shall be made at least thirty (30) days but no more than sixty (60)
days before the expiration of the current license.
   K.   Issuance As Privilege And Not A Right: The issuance of a license issued

within the indoor area of any establishment with a retail tobacco license.
Smoking for the purposes of sampling tobacco or tobacco related products is

pertaining to licensed products at the business premises for which the license
was issued. The instructional program shall include, but is not limited to,
reviewing the law on the sale of licensed products and requiring employees to
request identification from every customer who is under thirty (30) years of
age. The training shall include information that the sale of licensed products
to underage persons is illegal, explanation of what proof of age is legally
acceptable, and that a sale to an underage person can subject the applicant or
license holder and their employees to criminal and/or civil liability.
   N.   The maximum number of licenses issued by the City at any one time to a
retail establishment qualifying as a tobacco products shop is limited to two
(2). If the maximum number of licenses has already been issued, a licensee that
allows its license to expire or has its license revoked shall not be eligible
for a new license. Persons desiring to apply for a license may be placed on a
waiting list and be eligible to apply on a first-come, first-serve basis once
the number of issued licenses falls below the maximum number allowed.
Notwithstanding the maximum number of allowed licenses, an applicable who
purchases a tobacco product shop holding a current license shall be allowed to
apply for and obtain, if eligible, a new license for the business location
provided it is obtained within the same license year as the current license.

any particular ground for denial does not mean that the city must deny the
license.
   C.   If a license is mistakenly issued or renewed to a person, it may be
revoked upon the discovery that the person was ineligible for the license under
this chapter. (Ord. 2015-08, 11-2-2015, eff. 1-1-2016; amd. Ord. 2025-05, 7-1-

pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 342 by a business with an appropriate
state- issued license.
      6.   By any other means, to any other person, or in any other manner or
form prohibited by federal, state or other local law, ordinance provision, or
other regulation.
   B.   Exception: A license holder who operates a tobacco products shop that
sells only tobacco related products is exempt from the self-service
merchandising provision if the license holder prohibits anyone under twenty-one
(21) years of age from entering the establishment at all times, and the license
holder conspicuously displays a notice prohibiting persons under twenty-one
(21) years of age from entering the establishment. (Ord. 2015-08, 11-2-2015,

All licensees under this chapter shall be responsible for the actions of their
employees in regard to the sale of licensed products on the licensed premises,

city from also subjecting the employee to whatever penalties are appropriate
under this chapter, state or federal law, or other applicable law or
regulation. (Ord. 2015-08, 11-2-2015, eff. 1-1-2016; amd. Ord. 2025-05, 7-1-

for the purpose of compliance checks shall be supervised by city designated law
enforcement officers or other designated city personnel. Underaged persons used
for compliance checks shall not be guilty of unlawful possession of licensed
products when those items are obtained as a part of the compliance check. No
underage person used in compliance checks shall attempt to use a false
identification misrepresenting the underage person’s age, and all underage
persons lawfully engaged in a compliance check shall answer all questions about
the underage person’s age asked by the licensee or his or her employee and
shall produce any identification, if any exists, for which he or she is asked.
Nothing in this section shall prohibit compliance checks authorized by state or
federal laws for educational, research, or training purposes, or required for
the enforcement of a particular state or federal law. (Ord. 2015-08, 11-2-2015,

for any underage person to attempt to disguise his or her true age by the use

in a conspicuous location in the licensed establishment and shall be readily
visible to any person who is purchasing or attempting to purchase these
products. The sign shall provide notice that all persons responsible for
selling these products must verify, by means of photographic identification
containing the bearer’s date of birth, the age of any person under thirty (30)

   A.   Misdemeanor Prosecution: Nothing in this section shall prohibit the
city from seeking prosecution as a misdemeanor for any alleged violation of
this chapter. It is not necessary that criminal charges be brought in order to
support a determination of a license violation nor does the dismissal or
acquittal of such a criminal charge operate as a bar to adverse license actions
under this section.
   B.   Violations:

person delivery or mail as soon as practicable. Likewise, if the hearing
officer finds that no violation occurred or finds grounds for not imposing any
penalty, those findings shall be recorded and a copy provided to the city and
the acquitted accused violator by in person delivery or mail as soon as
practicable.
         b.   Costs: If the citation is upheld by the hearing officer, the
city's actual expenses in holding the hearing up to a maximum of one thousand

ARTICLE C. INDUSTRIAL WASTE CHARGE
SECTION:
4-1C-1: Charge Established
4-1C-2: Strength Charge Formula
4-1C-3: Strength Charge Payment
4-1C-4: Tax Lien For Nonpayment
4-1C-1: CHARGE ESTABLISHED:
   A.   State Law Applied: The Metropolitan Waste Control Commission, a
metropolitan commission organized and existing under the laws of the State of
Minnesota (the "Commission"), in order to receive and retain grants in
compliance with the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 and
regulations thereunder (the "Act"), has determined to impose an industrial user
sewer strength charge upon users of the Metropolitan Disposal System (as
defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 473.121, subsection 24) to recover
operation and maintenance costs of treatment works attributable to the strength
of the discharge of industrial waste, such sewer strength charge being in
addition to the charge based upon the volume of discharge. In order for the
City to pay such costs based upon strength of industrial discharge and
allocated to it each year by the Commission, it is hereby found, determined and
declared to be necessary to establish sewer strength charges and a formula for
the computation thereof for all industrial users receiving waste treatment
services within or served by the City. Furthermore, Minnesota Statutes, section
444.075, subsection 3, empowers the City to make such sewer charge a charge
against the owner, lessee, occupant or all of them and certify unpaid charges
to the County Auditor as a tax lien against the property served.
   B.   Strength Charge Established: For the purpose of paying the costs
allocated to the City each year by the Commission that are based upon the
strength of discharge of all industrial users receiving waste treatment
services within or served by the City, there is hereby approved, adopted and
established, in addition to the sewer charge based upon the volume of
discharge, a sewer charge upon each person receiving waste treatment services
within or served by the City, based upon strength of industrial waste
discharged into the sewer system of the City (the "Strength Charge").
4-1C-2: STRENGTH CHARGE FORMULA:
For the purpose of computation of the strength charge established by subsection
4-1C-1B hereof, there is hereby established, approved and adopted in compliance
with the Act the same strength charge formula designated herein by the
governing body of the Commission on June 15, 1976, such formula being based
upon pollution qualities and difficulty of disposal of the sewage produced
through an evaluation of pollution qualities and quantities in excess of an
annual average base and the proportionate costs of operation and maintenance of
waste treatment services provided by the Commission: (Ord. XI.9, 4-18-78)
   A.   The Metropolitan Waste Control Commission strength charge system as
recommended by the Hearing Officer and determined annually by application of
(a) plant unit process evaluations, (b) current quality control data, and (c)
current budgeted operation and maintenance costs for the treatment facilities.
   B.   The basic strength charge system formula is as follows:
      1.   Strength Charge Formula:
SCF = SR [Rss (SS-SSo) + Rcod (COD-CODo)]
         SSo         CODo
Where:
SCF   =   Strength Charge Factor
SR   =   Strength Phase Ratio (strength costs to system costs for
administrative and O & M of treatment works)
Rss   =   Suspended Solids Cost Ratio
Rcod   =   Chemical Oxygen Demand Cost Ratio
SS   =   Suspended Solids Concentration of Discharge (SS>SSo)
SSo   =   Suspended Solids Concentration of Base
COD   =   Chemical Oxygen Demand Concentration of Discharge (COD>CODo)
CODo   =   Chemical Oxygen Demand Concentration of Base
      2.   Strength Charge:
SC = (SCF)(V)(TW)
Where:
SC   =   Strength Charge
SCF   =   Strength Charge Factor
V   =   Volume of Discharge
TW   =   Treatment Works Unit Cost
(Res. 76-172, 6-15-76)
4-1C-3: STRENGTH CHARGE PAYMENT:
It is hereby approved, adopted and established that the strength charge
established by subsection
4-1C-1B hereof shall be paid by each industrial user receiving waste treatment
services and subject thereto before the twentieth day next succeeding the date
of billing thereof to such user by or on behalf of the City, and such payment
thereof shall be deemed to be delinquent if not so paid to the billing entity
before such date. Furthermore, it is hereby established, approved and adopted
that if such payment is not paid before such date, an industrial user shall pay
interest compounded monthly at the rate of two-thirds of one percent (2/3%) per
month on the unpaid balance due.
4-1C-4: TAX LIEN FOR NONPAYMENT:
As provided by Minnesota Statutes, section 444.075, subsection 3, it is hereby
approved, adopted and established that if payment of the strength charge
established by subsection
4-1C-1B hereof is not paid before the sixtieth day next succeeding the date of
billing thereof to the industrial user by or on behalf of the City, said
delinquent sewer strength charge, plus accrued interest established pursuant to
Section
4-1C-3 hereof, shall be deemed to be a charge against the owner, lessee and
occupant of the property served, and the City or its agent shall certify such
unpaid delinquent balance to the County Auditor with taxes against the property
served for collection as other taxes are collected; provided, however, that
such certification shall not preclude the City or its agents from recovery of
such delinquent sewer strength charge and interest thereon under any other
available remedy. (Ord. XI.9, 4-18-78)

Director of any event regarding its facilities that it considers to be an
emergency. The registrant must take whatever actions are necessary to respond
to the emergency. Excavators' notification to Gopher State One Call regarding
an emergency situation does not fulfill this requirement. Within two (2)
business days after the occurrence of the emergency, the registrant shall apply
for the necessary permits, pay the fees associated therewith, and fulfill the
rest of the requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with this
chapter for the actions it took in response to the emergency. The permittee
requirements shall not apply if the repair is caused by another permittee's
work in the right-of-way.
If the City becomes aware of an emergency regarding a registrant's facilities,
the City will attempt to contact the local representative of each registrant
affected, or potentially affected, by the emergency. In any event, the City may
take whatever action it deems necessary to respond to the emergency, the cost
of which shall be borne by the registrant whose facilities occasioned the
emergency.
   B.   Nonemergency Situations: Except in an emergency, any person who,
without first having obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or excavates a
right-of-way must subsequently obtain a permit and, as a penalty, pay double
the normal fee for said permit, pay double all the other fees required by this
Code, deposit with the City the fees necessary to correct any damage to the
right-of-way, and comply with all of the requirements of this chapter. (Ord.

revoke any right-of-way permit without a fee refund, if there is a substantial
breach of the terms and conditions of any statute, ordinance, rule or
regulation, or any material condition of the permit. A substantial breach by
permittee shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following:
      1.   The violation of any material provision of the right-of-way permit;
      2.   An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the right-
of-way permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit
upon the City or its citizens;
      3.   Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a
right-of-way permit;
      4.   The failure to complete the work in a timely manner, unless a permit
extension is obtained or unless the failure to complete work is due to reasons
beyond the permittee's control; or
      5.   The failure to correct, in a timely manner, work that does not
conform to a condition indicated on an order issued pursuant to section
4-2-18 of this chapter.
   B.   Written Notice Of Breach: If the City determines that the permittee has
committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any statute,
ordinance, rule, regulation or any condition of the permit, the City shall make
a written demand upon the permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall
state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. A
substantial breach, as stated above, will allow the City, at its discretion, to
place additional or revised conditions on the permit to mitigate and remedy the
breach.
   C.   Response To Notice Of Breach: Within five (5) working days of receiving
notification of the breach, permittee shall provide the City with a plan,
acceptable to the City, that will cure the breach. Permittee's failure to so
contact the City, or permittee's failure to timely submit an acceptable plan,
or permittee's failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be
cause for immediate revocation of the permit.
   D.   Reimbursement Of City Costs: If a permit is revoked, the permittee
shall also reimburse the City for the City's reasonable costs, including
restoration costs and the costs of collection and reasonable attorney fees and
other consultant fees incurred in connection with such revocation. (Ord. 2017-

4-2-22: MAPPING DATA:
   A.   Information Required: Each registrant and permittee shall provide
mapping information required by the City in accordance with Minnesota Rules

work pursuant to a permit, the permittee shall provide the Director accurate
maps or drawings certifying the "as built" location of all equipment installed,
owned and maintained by the permittee in both digital and hard copy. As built
drawings shall be submitted in the following forms:
      1.   Digital: CAD or GIS (dwg or shp).
      2.   Digital: Image file (pdf, jpg, etc.).
      3.   Hard copy.
Such maps or drawings shall include the horizontal and vertical location of all
facilities and equipment and shall be provided consistent with the City's
electronic mapping system, when practical or as a condition imposed by the
Director. Failure to provide maps or drawings pursuant to this subsection shall
be grounds for revoking the permit holder's registration.
   B.   Service Laterals: All permits issued for the installation or repair of
service laterals, other than minor repairs as defined in Minnesota Rules
7560.0150, subpart 2, shall require the permittee's use of appropriate means of
establishing the horizontal locations of installed service laterals, and the
service lateral vertical locations in those cases where the Director reasonably
requires it. Permittees or their subcontractors shall submit to the Director
evidence satisfactory to the Director of the installed service lateral
locations. Compliance with this subsection and with applicable Gopher State One
Call Law and Minnesota Rules governing service laterals installed after
December 31, 2005, shall be a condition of any City approval necessary for: 1)
payments to contractors working on a public improvement project including those
under Minnesota Statutes, chapter 429, and 2) City approval of performance
under development agreements, or other subdivision or site plan approval under
Minnesota Statutes, chapter 462. The Director shall reasonably determine the
appropriate method of providing such information to the City. Failure to
provide prompt and accurate information on the service laterals installed may
result in the revocation of the permit issued for the work or for future
permits to the offending permittee or its subcontractors.
   C.   As Builts: As builts will be required in hard copy and electronically
if the project permitted deviates two feet (2') or more from the original plans
submitted to the City. Failure to submit an as built will be a certification by
the permittee that the project as constructed does not deviate two feet (2') or
more from the original plan submitted. (Ord. 2017-05, 11-21-2017)
4-2-23: LOCATION AND RELOCATION OF FACILITIES:

comply with the Act, with other applicable law, and with Minnesota Rules
7819.3100, 7819.5000 and 7819.5100, to the extent the rules do not limit
authority otherwise available to cities.
   B.   Corridors: The City may assign a specific area within the right-of-way,
or any particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of
facility that is or, pursuant to current technology, the City expects will
someday be located within the right-of-way. All excavation, obstruction, or
other permits issued by the City involving the installation or replacement of
facilities shall designate the proper corridor for the facilities at issue.
Any registrant who has facilities in the right-of-way in a position at variance
with the corridors established by the City shall, no later than at the time of
the next reconstruction or excavation of the area where the facilities are
located, move the facilities to the assigned position within the right-of-way,
unless this requirement is waived in writing by the City for good cause shown,
upon consideration of such factors as the remaining economic life of the
facilities, public safety, customer service needs and hardship to the
registrant.
   C.   Nuisance: One year after the passage of this chapter, any unregistered
facilities that are found in the right-of-way and that are required by this
chapter to be registered shall be deemed to be a nuisance. The City may
exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not
limited to, abating the nuisance or taking possession of the facilities and
restoring the right-of-way to a usable condition.
   D.   Limitation Of Space: To protect health, safety, and welfare, or when
necessary to protect the right-of-way and its current use, the City shall have
the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional facilities
within the right-of- way. In making such decisions, the City shall strive to
the extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the
right-of-way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the public
interest, the public's needs for the particular utility service, the condition
of the right-of-way, the time of year with respect to essential utilities, the
protection of existing facilities in the right-of-way, and future City plans
for public improvements and development projects that have been determined to
be in the public interest. (Ord. 2017-05, 11-21-2017)

provision includes costs for damages to boulevard amenities, such as trees,
landscaping, irrigation systems and invisible fences, placed by property
owners. It is the registrant's responsibility to provide immediate notice of
such damages to the affected property owners. Each registrant shall be
responsible for the cost of repairing any damage to the facilities of another

registrant's facilities. (Ord. 2017-05, 11-21-2017)
4-2-26: VACATION:

affirming the denial, revocation, or fee imposition will be in writing and
supported by written findings establishing the reasonableness of the decision.

within the city and impairs the safety, good order, general welfare and
convenience of the public. In addition to and in accordance with Minnesota
statutes, sections 89.001, and 89.51 through 89.64, the provisions of this
section are adopted to attempt to control and prevent the spread of shade tree
pests and shade tree disease within a designated control area.

and other plantings located on public property within the city limits, and
shall have the power to plant, care for, maintain, remove, and replace such
trees, shrubs and other plantings.

certain developments or homeowners' associations have accepted this
responsibility, the city of Rosemount shall be responsible for the treatment or
removal of a nuisance, diseased, or hazardous tree from the boulevard.
   D.   Tree Inspector: It is the power and duty of the tree inspector to enter
upon public or private property at any reasonable time for the purpose of
inspecting and diagnosing and, if necessary, abating shade tree diseases or
shade tree pests. In the case of suspected shade tree diseases or pests, and in
performance of his or her duties, the tree inspector may remove such specimen
or samples as may be necessary or desirable for diagnosis. The tree inspector
shall have the authority to conduct the following:
      1.   Coordinate the activities of the city relating to the control and
prevention of damage by shade tree pests and diseases and employ any control
measures he or she deems appropriate.
      2.   Recommend to the council the details of any program for the
declaration, control and prevention of shade tree pests and diseases and
enforce or cause to be enforced the duties incident to such a program adopted
by the council.

city upon which it is suspected a shade tree pest or disease exists and
investigate all reported incidents of shade tree pests and diseases.

recognized symptoms or by tests as may be recommended by the commissioner of
the Minnesota department of agriculture or department of natural resources; or
other reliable means.
      5.   Take all reasonable precautions to prevent the maintenance of public
nuisances and enforce the provisions relating to abatement in this chapter,
including hiring private contractors to implement such measures.
   E.   Abatement Of Shade Tree Nuisances: In abating a "shade tree pest" or
disease tree nuisance as defined in this chapter, the following procedures
shall be followed in addition to the procedures in section
5-2-4 of this chapter:
      1.   The shade tree pest or diseased tree shall be removed or effectively
treated so as to destroy and prevent as fully as possible the spread of the
pest or disease. Such abatement procedures shall be carried out in accordance
with current technical and expert methods and plans as may be designated by the
commissioner of agriculture, and with the "control measures" as defined in this
chapter, and within the control areas prescribed by the city council.
      2.   If a notice of abatement for a shade tree pest or disease issued
under section
5-2-4 of this chapter and its prescribed control measures are not complied with
within the time provided by the notice or any additional time granted, the tree
inspector or designated person shall have the authority to enter the property
and carry out abatement in accordance with the council's declared control
measures and the notice of abatement.
   F.   Abatement Procedure In The Event Of Imminent Danger; Summary
Enforcement: If the tree inspector determines that the danger of infestation to
other shade trees is imminent and delay in control measures may put public
health, safety, or welfare in immediate danger, the tree inspector may proceed
as follows:
      1.   Determination; Notice: The tree inspector shall determine all trees
to be affected by any appropriate control measures and notify any reasonably
knowable owner and occupant of property or properties on whose land every such
tree is located.
      2.   Contents Of Notice: The notice shall state that a public nuisance
exists or is being maintained on premises in the city and that a delay in
abatement of the nuisance will unreasonably endanger public health, safety or
welfare. The notice shall state the nuisance found, the control measure
required, provide the nuisance must be abated within a specified time, and the
time and place of the city council meeting to consider the question of summary
enforcement. The notice and proposed action shall be reported in writing to the
council.
      3.   Abatement: The city council shall determine whether or not the
condition identified in the notice to the owner or occupant is a nuisance,
whether public health, safety or welfare will be unreasonably endangered by
delay in abatement, and may order that the nuisance be immediately terminated
or abated. If the nuisance is not immediately terminated or abated, the city
council may order abatement of the nuisance. After the expiration of the time
provided on the original mailing, the nuisance may be abated.
      4.   Immediate Abatement: Nothing in this section shall prevent the city,
without notice or other process, from immediately abating any condition which
poses an imminent and serious hazard to human life or safety. (Ord. 2012-03, 4-
3-2012)

7-9-1: PURPOSE AND FINDINGS:
The city council intends to discourage underage possession and consumption of
alcohol, even if done within the confines of a private residence, and intends
to hold persons criminally responsible who host events or gatherings where
persons under twenty one (21) years of age possess or consume alcohol
regardless of whether the person hosting the event or gathering supplied the
alcohol. The city council finds:
   A.   Events and gatherings held on private or public property where alcohol
is possessed or consumed by persons under the age of twenty one (21) are
harmful to those persons and constitute a potential threat to public health
requiring prevention or abatement.
   B.   Prohibiting underage consumption acts to protect underage persons, as
well as the general public, from injuries related to alcohol consumption, such
as alcohol overdose or alcohol related traffic collisions.
   C.   Often, events or gatherings involving underage possession and
consumption occur outside the presence of parents. However, there are times
when the parents are present and condone the activity, and in some
circumstances provide the alcohol.
   D.   Even though giving or furnishing alcohol to an underage person is a
crime, it is difficult to prove, and an ordinance is necessary to help further
combat underage consumption.
   E.   A deterrent effect will be created by holding a person criminally
responsible for hosting an event or gathering where underage possession or
consumption occurs. (Ord. XVI.60, 12-2-2008)

8-5-6: Disciplinary Action
8-5-7: Penalty
8-5-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose for using the Emergency Vehicle Preemption System (EVPS) in
Rosemount is to allow emergency vehicles to perform emergency services in a
safer and more timely manner by temporarily controlling motorized vehicle
traffic flow at signalized intersection. The Council deems it advisable to
formulate policies and procedures for the use of the EVPS emitters so that both
pedestrians and drivers of motorized vehicles have adequate warning that
emergency vehicles are changing normal traffic control timing at signalized
intersections. (Ord. XII.15, 11-7-1995)
8-5-2: DEFINITIONS:
EMERGENCY VEHICLE: A vehicle equipped and identified according to law and
operated by the Police Department and/or Fire Department or any other vehicle
so recognized by State statute.
EMERGENCY VEHICLE PREEMPTION SYSTEM: A traffic control system designed for use
by emergency vehicles to improve traffic movement by temporarily controlling
signalized intersections. The EVPS is comprised of four (4) separate
components: an emitter, a detector, an indicator, and a phase selector. The
emitter (a high intensity light source) is attached to the emergency vehicle
and functions in excess of ten (10) "beats" per second. As an emergency vehicle
approaches the intersection, this pulsating light is received by a detector
that is located at or near the traffic signal. The detector relays the coded
message to the phase selector, located in the traffic light control box, which
then either holds the existing green light in favor of the approaching
emergency vehicle or accelerates the normal cycle of a signal change to provide
green by the time the vehicle reaches the intersection. The indicator is a
light source located near the detector which is directed toward the oncoming
emergency vehicle to indicate to the driver whether or not the traffic light
has been preempted in their favor. (Ord. XII.15, 11-7-1995)
8-5-3: CONDITIONS FOR USING THE EVPS:
   A.   Fire Department: City owned Fire Department vehicles shall use the EVPS
while on emergency responses only. Unless otherwise provided for herein, all
other use by the Department is prohibited. Conditions for the use of EVPS
hereby become a part of the Fire Department Standard Operating Procedures.
   B.   Police Department: City owned Police Department vehicles shall use the
EVPS while on emergency responses only. Unless otherwise provided for herein,
all other use by the Department is prohibited. Conditions for the use of the
EVPS hereby become a part of the Police Department Standard Operating
Procedures.
   C.   City, County Or State Maintenance Personnel: County, State or City
maintenance personnel, or their contractors under written agreement, may
activate the EVPS only when testing or repairing the system. Sirens and
flashing red lights need not be used except when the test vehicle must exceed
the posted speed limits. In such instances, said test must be preapproved and
coordinated with the Police Chief or his designee.
   D.   Emergency Vehicles Not Owned By The City: The use of the EVPS within
the City by non-City emergency vehicles is allowed if said emergency vehicle is
one which is recognized by the City in which it is based. The participating
organization or unit of government shall be trained and shall follow all
procedures prescribed by the City in utilizing the EVPS.
   E.   Unlawful Activation: Unless specifically approved herein, it shall be
unlawful for any person to activate the EVPS in Rosemount by any means
whatsoever. This clause specifically prohibits the installation of EVPS
emitters on any vehicle not identified in subsections A through D of this
Section. (Ord. XII.15, 11-7-1995)
8-5-4: EVPS MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES:
   A.   It shall be the City's policy to routinely test the EVPS to ensure
proper functioning of the system. During such tests, each intersection which is
EVPS equipped shall be checked from all approaches. Test results will be
recorded on a standardized form indicating the intersection tested, date of
test, person conducting test, and evaluation result. This test is to be
completed jointly by the Police, Fire and Public Works Departments, and a copy
of the completed test form shall be sent to the respective department heads.
   B.   When a traffic signal is found to malfunction during a test, the person
conducting the test shall immediately notify the Police Department of the
defect and the location of the defective signal and promptly provide separate
written notice to the Police Chief. (Ord. XII.15, 11-7-1995)
8-5-5: EVPS TRAINING:
An explanation of the policies and procedures governing the use of the EVPS in
Rosemount shall be included in the basic and in- service training courses for
both the Police and Fire Departments. Appropriate training shall also be
mandated for those non-City entities authorized to utilize the EVPS within the
City. (Ord. XII.15, 11-7-1995)
8-5-6: DISCIPLINARY ACTION:
Violation of the policies and procedures set forth above by any authorized
person shall be cause for disciplinary action in accordance with adopted City
and Department policies. (Ord. XII.15, 11-7-1995)
8-5-7: PENALTY:
Any person violating any provision of this Chapter is guilty as provided by
State law. (Ord. XII.15, 11-7-1995)

the following is guilty of violating this Chapter:
   A.   Maintains or permits an unfavorable building or structure appearance or
level of maintenance:
      1.   Adverse Impact: Buildings, structures, fences and retaining walls
which have been so poorly maintained that their physical condition and
appearance detract from the surrounding neighborhood are declared to be public
nuisances because they: a) decrease adjoining landowners' and occupants'
enjoyment of their property and neighborhood; and b) may adversely affect
property values and neighborhood patterns.
      2.   Standards:
         a.   Any building, structure, fence or retaining wall is a public
nuisance if it does not comply with the following requirements:
            (1)   No part of any exterior surface shall have deterioration,
holes, breaks, gaps, loose or rotting boards or timber.
            (2)   Every exterior surface which has had a surface finish such as
paint applied shall be maintained to avoid noticeable deterioration of the
finish. No wall or other exterior surface shall have peeling, cracked, chipped,
or otherwise deteriorated surface finish on more than twenty percent (20%) of:
               (A)   Any one wall or other flat surface;
               (B)   All door and window moldings, eaves, gutters, and similar
projections on any one side or surface.
            (3)   No glass, including windows and exterior light fixtures,
shall be broken or cracked and no seams shall be torn or separated from
moldings.
            (4)   All exterior doors and shutters shall be hung properly and
have an operable mechanism to keep them securely shut or in place.
            (5)   All cornices, moldings, lintels, sills, bay or dormer
windows, and similar projections shall be kept in good repair and free from
cracks and defects which make them hazardous or unsightly.
            (6)   Roof structures shall be tight and have no defects which
admit water. All roof drainage systems shall be secured and hung properly.
            (7)   Chimney, antennas, air vents, and other similar projections

   B.   Maintains or permits buildings or structures which endanger public
safety, health or property within the City:
      1.   Any building, structure, fence or retaining wall in the City which
is found by the City Building Inspectors or Fire Marshall, or their designee,
to be dangerous to public safety, health or property by reason of:
         a.   Damage by fire;
         b.   Defective chimneys or stovepipes;

the property which shall: a) be in writing, b) include a description of the
property sufficient for identification, c) include a statement of a reason or
reasons why it is being issued, d) include a description of the repairs and
improvements required to bring the dwelling into compliance with the provisions
of this Chapter, and e) include a statement of time allowed to correct the
violations.
   C.   Maintains or permits garbage or refuse to be placed or stored in yards:
      1.   To enhance the safety of residents, no garbage, junk or debris shall
be placed in yards or properties in the City. The City Zoning Ordinance states
that except as specifically authorized by the Zoning Ordinance, all equipment,
merchandise, materials, supplies, unlicensed vehicles, junk vehicles, trash and
junk, and finished and semi-finished products shall be stored within
"structures" as defined in the Zoning Ordinance. Violation of such provisions
of the City Zoning Ordinance is a violation of this Chapter.
   D.   Special provision; lawn maintenance:
      1.   Preamble: There are a variety of landscapes in the City which
diversify and add a richness to the quality of life. Certain areas in the City
have been left, or allowed to go, unmaintained. They have been accepted by the
vast majority of the City residents as appropriate and as part of the unique
quality of life in this community. There are community expectations, however,
that once an area has been disturbed, landscaped, or otherwise maintained, that
area will continue to be maintained in a consistent manner. When vegetation in
that area is not continually maintained, it becomes aesthetically unpleasing
and violates community standards. Property which appears neglected may decrease
the value of adjacent properties. In addition, if vegetation is not properly
maintained, there may be the following adverse impacts on public health,
safety, and welfare:
         a.   Undesirable vegetation such as common buckthorn, quack grass, and
other weeds may invade and threaten to supplant other more desirable
vegetation.
         b.   Vegetation which causes allergic reactions, such as ragweed, may
develop.
         c.   Tall vegetation along driveways and public roads may impair
visibility when entering or exiting public roads.
      2.   Definitions: For the purpose of this Section the following words
shall have the meanings specified below:
    MEADOW VEGETATION: Grasses and flowering and broad leaf plants which are
native to, or adopted to, the State, which are commonly found in meadow and
prairie plant communities, except weeds.
   NOXIOUS WEEDS: Those plants which are determined from time to time to be
noxious weeds pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, section 18.77, subdivision 8.
   REGULARLY CUT: Mowing or otherwise cutting the vegetation so that it does
not exceed eight inches (8").
   TURF GRASSES: Grasses commonly used in regularly cut lawn areas, such as
bluegrass, fescue, and rye grass blends, and nonwoody vegetation interspersed
with them.
   WEEDS: Include all noxious weeds buffalobur, common cocklebur, crabgrass,
dandelions, jimsonweed, quack grass, common and giant ragweed, field sandbur,
velvetleaf, and wild sunflower. Weeds also include anything that is
horticulturally out of place. For example, a tree seedling is a weed in a
vegetable garden. A property owner may establish that a plant or plants are not
horticulturally out of place by providing a written landscape plan for the area
in question, complete with a listing and locations of plant species. The plants
specifically listed above may not be included within the landscape plan.
Vegetation which does not comply with this plan are weeds.
      3.   Maintenance Standard: The minimum standard in this Section applies
to property which has been developed with a "building" as defined in the
Building Code, including vacant property combined with developed property for
this purpose, and a parcel of property which has been completely or partially
disturbed by demolition, grading or other means in preparation for development
or redevelopment.
         a.   All turf grasses and weeds must not exceed a height of eight
inches (8"), measured from the base at ground level to the tip of each stalk,
stem blade, or leaf.
         b.   This requirement does not apply to the following:
            (1)   A wetland or flood plain designated on the Official Zoning
Map or any other available wetland inventory maps on file with the City.
            (2)   A drainage pond or ditch which stores or conveys storm water.
            (3)   A pasture which is: a) currently being used for the exercise
or feeding of domestic hoofed animals, b) physically surrounded by a permanent
fence which separates the pasture from property used for other purposes, c) at
least one-half (1/2) acre in size, and d) undeveloped with any habitable
buildings.
            (4)   An area in which the land and vegetation appear not to have
been graded, landscaped, mowed, or otherwise disturbed by human or mechanical
means at any time. Determination of what constitutes this type of area will be
based on a reasonable judgment of the present appearance of the area. The
recent history of the area may be relevant to this determination.
            (5)   An area established with meadow vegetation if:
               (A)   The prior vegetation is eliminated and the meadow
vegetation is planted through transplants or seed by human or mechanical means.
               (B)   The area is cut at least once per year to a height of
eight inches (8"), if weeds cover more than twenty five percent (25%) of the
area.
               (C)   A sign is posted on the property in a location likely to
be seen by the public, advising that a meadow or prairie is being established.
The sign is required only if the vegetation is in an area likely to be seen by
the public. This sign shall be in addition to any sign permitted by the sign
ordinance but shall be no smaller than ten inches (10") square, no larger than
one square foot, and no higher than three feet (3') tall. The sign is no longer
required when weeds cover twenty five percent (25%) or less of the area.
         c.   See section
5-2-2 of this code for noxious weed control requirements.
   E.   Special Provision; Parking Maintenance:
      1.   It shall be the joint responsibility of the operator and owner of
any principal use to maintain, in a neat and aesthetic manner, the parking
space, accessway, driveway, landscaping, required fences or walls and retaining
walls. Violation of section
5-2-2 of this code is a violation of this chapter. (Ord. XVIII.10, 9-2-1997)
9-4-8: MANUFACTURED HOME PARK MAINTENANCE STANDARDS:
   A.   Maintenance Standards: All streets, roadways and sidewalks shall be
maintained to a level sufficient to allow free vehicular passage for the
residents, their guests, and emergency service responders under all reasonably
anticipated conditions. The existence of a sufficient level of maintenance
shall be determined as follows:
      1.   Street Surface Condition: The hard surface of the streets shall not
be covered by dirt, sand, gravel or other materials to the extent that traction
between the street surface and vehicle tires is substantially diminished. The
street shall be maintained in a manner that horizontal or vertical separations
or cracks of the traveled surface are not of a magnitude which will jar a
passing motor vehicle operating within the speed limit. Street repair and
patching shall also occur whenever a pothole with exposed base material exists,
when a separation of crack results in crumbling pavement, or when any dip or
settlement is pronounced enough to cause storm water to collect and not drain
away.
      2.   Snow Removal And Ice Control: Snow removal operations shall occur as
necessary to provide safe and unimpeded vehicular passage of the streets, and
shall provide for curb to curb snow removal. At a minimum, snow removal
operations shall be completed within twelve (12) hours after the end of a
snowfall event which deposits more than two inches (2") of snow upon the street
surface. Snow removal operations shall be conducted in a manner to achieve as

manufactured home units must be placed behind the front entry stoop and be
provided with additional screening if necessary so as not to be visible from
the street, except that on the day of collection the containers may be placed
at curbside along the private manufactured home park street. If contract trash
removal is provided through the park owner with a master contract rather than
contracted by individual manufactured home unit owners, the master contract
must provide recycling opportunities for each manufactured home owner.
   C.   Accessory Structure Removal: Upon the removal of any manufactured home
from a manufactured home park, it shall be the responsibility of the park owner
to see that all freestanding or attached accessory structures, fences and
debris left on the mobile home lot are removed within forty eight (48) hours
after the removal of the unit. The city zoning administrator may approve the
retention of all or part of the accessory structures, if the park owner
requests same in writing, can demonstrate that they will meet the required
setbacks from any replacement manufactured home unit to be placed on the lot,
and if they are shown to be in sound condition. The park owner must also
provide a written commitment to remove or relocate the accessory structure(s)
permitted to remain if the required setbacks fail to be verified after the
replacement manufactured home is placed. (Ord. XXI.15, 12-5-2006)

   A.   Any person violating any provision of this chapter shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor.
   B.   For the purpose of safeguarding the health and safety of the general
public and of the occupants of dwellings, it is the duty of the appropriate
city official, or his or her designee, to enforce this chapter, and, this
official is hereby authorized and directed to conduct inspections to determine
the condition of dwellings, residences, and premises located within the city.
For the purpose of making such inspections, the appropriate city official is
hereby authorized to enter, examine and survey, between the hours of seven
thirty o'clock (7:30) A.M. and four o'clock (4:00) P.M., all dwellings,
residences, and premises. The appropriate city official, prior to making such
inspection, shall inform the occupant of the dwelling by letter postmarked not
less than seventy two (72) hours prior to the time such inspection is made.
After such written notice is given, the owner or occupant of such dwelling
shall allow entry, during such time, for the purpose of such inspection,
examination or survey; provided that such inspection, examination or survey
shall not have for its purpose the harassment of such owner or occupant and
that such inspection, examination, or survey shall be made so as to cause the
least amount of inconvenience to the owner or occupant, consistent with an
efficient performance of the duties of the appropriate city official; provided
that the purpose of such inspection, examination, or survey shall not be for
the procurement of evidence to be used in any criminal proceeding; provided
that nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the entry of the
appropriate city official. The required notice is waived when:
      1.   At any time when in the opinion of the appropriate city official an
actual emergency tending to create an immediate danger to public health and
safety exists; or
      2.   At any time when such inspection, examination, or survey may be
requested by the owner or tenant. (Ord. XVIII.10, 9-2-1997; amd. Ord. XXI.15,
12-5-2006)

prevent the commission and maintenance of public nuisances. (Ord. XVIII.10, 9-
2-1997; amd. Ord. XXI.15, 12-5-2006)
9-4-11: ABATEMENT PROCEDURE:
   A.   Abatement:
      1.   Notice: Whenever the officer charged with enforcement determines
that a public nuisance is being maintained or exists on property within the
city, the officer shall notify the property owner and occupant or other
responsible party in writing of that fact and order the nuisance terminated and
abated. Notice shall be served in person or by certified mail. Notice to the
owner shall be satisfied by return receipt from the person listed as the
taxpayer on the county's tax record. If the property is not occupied, the owner
is unknown, or no other responsible party can be reasonably identified, notice
may be served by posting said notice on the property. The posted notice shall
specify the steps to be taken to abate the nuisance and the maximum time period
allowed for compliance. The posted notice shall also state that the city may,
after notice to the owner and occupant or other responsible party, provide for
abating the nuisance by the city. Three (3) separate notices shall be written
and delivered or posted as outlined above. The first notice shall specify
compliance within twenty (20) days. The second consecutive notice shall
reference the first notice and specify an additional ten (10) days for
compliance. The third consecutive notice shall reference the first two (2)
notices, specify that it is the last notice prior to the city council's hearing
for abating the matter by the city, and allow for an additional five (5) days
for final compliance with the written order(s). In cases where any or all of
the notices are posted, at least forty five (45) days shall elapse between the
day of the first posting and the council hearing.
      2.   Summary Abatement: The enforcement officer, or his or her designee,
may provide for abating a public nuisance without following the procedures
required in subsection A1 of this section when:
         a.   There is an immediate threat to the public health or safety.
         b.   There is an immediate threat of serious property damage.
         c.   A public nuisance has been caused by private parties on public
property.
If the enforcement officer abates the nuisance pursuant to this section, the
officer must reasonably attempt to notify the owner, occupant, or other
responsible party of the intended action and the right to appeal the abatement
and any cost recovery at the next regularly scheduled city council meeting.
      3.   Hazardous And Substandard Buildings Or Structures: In appropriate
cases the city may elect to enforce the provisions of this chapter pursuant to
Minnesota statutes, sections 463.15 through 463.26.
      4.   Cost Recovery: The owner of property on which a nuisance has been
abated by the city, or a person who has caused a public nuisance on property
not owned by that person, shall be personally responsible to the city for the
cost of abatement, including administrative costs and any other expenses
incurred by the city while performing the work. As soon as the work has been
completed and the cost determined, the city clerk or other official designated
by the council shall prepare a bill for the cost and mail it to the owner or
other responsible party. Thereupon, the amount shall be immediately due and
payable at the office of the city clerk.
      5.   Assessment: If the cost, or any portion of it, has not been paid
under subsection A4 of this section within thirty (30) days after the date of
the bill, the unpaid cost may be certified against the property to which the
cost is attributable in accordance with Minnesota statutes, chapter 429. Before
the unpaid costs are certified against the property, the property owner must be
given notice and hearing as required by Minnesota statutes, 429.061. (Ord.
XVIII.10, 9-2-1997; amd. Ord. XXI.15, 12-5-2006)
      6.   Penalty: Any person in violation of any of the provisions in this
chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and punished as described in title 1,
chapter 4 of this code. Each day on which such violation continues shall
constitute a separate offense. (Ord. XII.21, 6-15-2004; amd. Ord. XXI.15, 12-5-
2006)
      7.   Hindrance: Any person hindering the efforts of city officials to
investigate possible violations of this chapter shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor.
      8.   Conflict Of Chapter: In any case where a provision of this chapter
is found to be in conflict with a provision of any zoning, building, fire,
safety, or health ordinance or code in this city, the provision which
establishes the higher standard for the promotion and protection of the health
and safety of the people shall prevail. In any case where a provision of this
chapter is found to be in conflict with a provision of any other ordinance or
code of the city existing on the effective date of this chapter which
established a lower standard for the promotion and protection of the health and
safety of the people, the provision of this chapter shall be deemed to prevail.
The determination of the applicability of this chapter in light of the above
rules of interpretation shall be made by the city and its determination shall
be final. (Ord. XVIII.10, 9-2-1997; amd. Ord. XXI.15, 12-5-2006)

   A.   Standards Adopted By Reference: Minnesota statutes section 115.55 and
Minnesota rules chapters 7080, 7081, 7082, 7083 and all other reference laws
and rules, as may be amended, are adopted by reference and made a part of this
chapter.
   B.   Amendments To The Adopted Standards:
      1.   Determination Of Hydraulic Loading Rate And SSTS Sizing: Table IX
from Minnesota rules part 7080.2150, subpart 3 entitled loading rates for
determining bottom absorption area for trenches and seepage beds for effluent
treatment level C and absorption ratios for determining mound absorption areas
using detail soil descriptions and table IXa from Minnesota rules part
7080.2150, subpart 3(E) entitled loading rates for determining bottom
absorption area for trenches and seepage beds for effluent treatment level C
and absorption ratios for determining mound absorption areas using percolation
tests and herein adopted by reference shall both be used to size SSTS
infiltration areas using the larger sizing factor of the two for SSTS design.
      2.   Holding Tanks: A holding tank may be used for the following
application only after it can be shown conclusively by the property owner or
property owner’s agent that an SSTS permitted under this chapter cannot be
feasibly installed:
         a.   As a replacement for an existing failing SSTS;
         b.   For an SSTS that poses an imminent threat to public health or
safety; or
         c.   For use with buildings with limited water use.
      3.   Compliance Inspections: Compliance inspections shall be required
when any of the following conditions occur:
         a.   Anytime there is an expansion of use of the building being served
by an existing SSTS that may impact the performance of the system.
         b.   As required in subsection
4-1B-10 B.
   C.   Compliance Criteria For Existing SSTS:
      1.   SSTS built before April 1, 1996, outside of areas designated as
shoreland areas, wellhead protection areas, or SSTS providing sewage treatment
for food, beverage, or lodging establishments must have at least two feet (2')
of ertical separation between the bottom of the dispersal system and seasonal
saturation or bedrock. The vertical separation measurement shall be made
outside the area of system influence in an area of similar soil.
      2.   SSTS built after March 31, 1996, or SSTS located in a shoreland
area, wellhead protection area, or serving a food, beverage, or lodging
establishment as defined under Minnesota rules part 7080.110, subpart 84 must
have a three foot (3') vertical separation between the bottom soil infiltrative
surface and the periodically saturated soil and/or bedrock. Unless otherwise
determined by the department, existing systems that have no more than a fifteen
percent (15%) reduction to the minimum required thirty six inch (36")
separation distance are considered compliant (i.e., a separation distance no
less than 30.6 inches). This reduction is to account for settling of sand or
soil, normal variation of separation distance measurements and interpretation
of limiting layer characteristics. The vertical separation measurement shall be
made outside the area of system influence in an area of similar soil.
   D.   Highest Standards Prevail: Where the conditions imposed by a provision
of this chapter are either more restrictive or less restrictive than comparable
conditions imposed by a provision of this chapter or any other applicable law,
ordinance, rule, or regulation, the provision that establishes the higher
standard for the promotion and protection of the public health, safety, and

poorly sited development or incompatible activities: by regulating land
disturbing or development activities that would have an adverse and potentially
irreversible impact on water quality and unique and fragile environmentally
sensitive land; by minimizing conflicts and encouraging compatibility between
land disturbing and development activities and water quality and
environmentally sensitive lands; and by requiring detailed review standards and
procedures for land disturbing or development activities proposed for such
areas, thereby achieving a balance between urban growth and development and
protection of water quality and natural areas. (Ord. 2015-01, 2-17-2015)

criteria outlined in this document. Stabilization adequate to prevent erosion
located at the outlets of all pipes and paved channels is required.
      10.   Site Dewatering: Site dewatering shall be conducted pursuant to the
city's general specifications document. Water pumped from the site shall be
treated by temporary sediment basins, grit chambers, sand filters, or other
controls as appropriate to ensure adequate treatment is obtained and that
nuisance conditions will not result from the discharge. Discharges from the
site shall not be released in a manner that causes erosion, scour,
sedimentation or flooding of the site, receiving channels or wetlands.
      11.   Waste And Material Disposal: All waste and unused building
materials (including garbage, debris, cleaning wastes, wastewater, toxic
materials or hazardous materials) shall be properly disposed of off site and
not allowed to be carried by runoff into a receiving water or storm sewer
system.
         a.   Solid Waste: All unused building materials and waste (including,

properly and in compliance with applicable MPCA regulations.
      12.   Drain Inlet Protection: All storm drain inlets shall be protected
during construction until permanent cover in the contributing drainage is
established.
      13.   Energy Dissipation: Pipe outlets must have temporary or permanent
energy dissipation within twenty-four (24) hours of connection to a surface
water.
      14.   Tracking: Vehicle tracking BMPs (including, but not limited to:
rock pads, mud mats, slash mulch, concrete or steel wash racks, or similar
systems) must be installed to minimize track out of sediment from the
construction site. If vehicle tracking BMPs are not actively preventing
sediment from being tracked into the street, the applicant must utilize street
sweeping to contain sediment.
      15.   Final Stabilization: Final stabilization is not complete until the
following criteria are met:
         a.   All land disturbing activities must be finished and all soils
shall be stabilized by a uniform perennial vegetative cover with a density of
seventy percent (70%) or greater of its expected final growth density over the

            (6)   Documentation of any changes made to the erosion and sediment
control plan.
   D.   Site And BMP Maintenance:
      1.   Responsibilities: Prior to any land disturbing activity, the
permittee or developer shall provide the city engineer with a schedule for
erosion and sediment control inspection and maintenance, including schedules
for street cleaning, and street sweeping. All site and BMP maintenance
activities must comply with the requirements of NPDES permits. The project
shall investigate and comply with the following BMP maintenance requirements:
         a.   Perimeter Controls: All perimeter controls must be repaired,
replaced or supplemented when they become nonfunctional or the sediment reaches
one- half (½) of the height of the BMP. Repairs shall be made by the end of the
next business day after discovery or as soon as field conditions allow access.
         b.   Temporary Sediment Basins: Temporary sedimentation basins must be
drained and the sediment must be removed when the depth of the sediment
collected in the basin reaches one-half (½) the storage volume. Drainage and
removal must be completed within seventy-two (72) hours of discovery or as soon
as field conditions allow access.
         c.   Surface Waters And Conveyance Systems: Surface waters, including
drainage ditches and conveyance systems, must be inspected for visible signs of
sediment being deposited by erosion. The applicant must remove all sediment
deposited in surface waters, including drainageways, catch basins, and other
drainage systems and must restabilize the areas of exposed soil as a result of
sediment removal. The removal and stabilization must take place within seven
(7) days of discovery unless legal, regulatory or physical access constraints
prevent remediation. In the event of an access constraint, the applicant shall
use all reasonable efforts to obtain access. If access is precluded, removal
and stabilization must take place within seven (7) calendar days of obtaining
access. The applicant is responsible for contacting all local, regional, state
and federal authorities and obtaining any required permits prior to conducting
any work.
         d.   Streets And Paved Surfaces: Where vehicle traffic leaves any part
of the site with exposed soils, the exit locations must be inspected for
visible signs of off site sediment tracking onto paved surfaces. Tracked
sediment must be removed from all paved surfaces within and adjacent to the
site as soon as possible or within twenty- four (24) hours of discovery.
         e.   General Maintenance: The applicant shall be responsible for the
operation and maintenance of temporary and permanent water quality management
BMPs, as well as erosion prevention, sediment control, and waste control BMPs
for the duration of the construction work on the site. The applicant remains
responsible until another party has assumed control over all areas of the site
that have not established final stabilization and a notice of termination (NOT)
has been submitted to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.
         f.   Off Site Deposition: If sediment escapes the construction site,
off site accumulations of sediment must be removed in a manner and at a
frequency sufficient to minimize off site impacts.
         g.   Infiltration Areas: All infiltration areas must be inspected to
ensure that no sediment or turbid runoff from ongoing construction activities
is reaching the infiltration area and these areas are protected from compaction
caused by construction equipment driving across the infiltration area.
         h.   Conformance with NPDES Permits: Inspection and maintenance
schedules and thresholds must conform with NPDES Permit standards and
requirements.
      2.   Lapse: If the permittee repeatedly fails to meet or maintain
sediment and erosion control measures per the approved grading, sediment and
erosion control plan, the city may, in its discretion, perform the work or
contract to have the work completed and drawn down on the escrow deposit,
letter of credit or bond to pay any costs.
         a.   The city will attempt to notify the developer in advance of any
proposed action, but failure of the city to do so will not affect the
developer’s and city’s rights or obligations hereunder.
         b.   If the developer does not reimburse the city for any cost the
city incurred beyond that covered by the deposit, for such work within ten (10)
days from the date notice of the amount owed to the city is mailed, the city
may draw on the security to reimburse city for such costs. (Ord. 2015-01, 2-17-
2015; amd. Ord. 2015-05, 7-7-2015; Ord.2023-05, 10-3-2023)
10-1-13: STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FOR PERMANENT FACILITIES:
   A.   Specifications: All postconstruction stormwater management plans must
be submitted to the city engineer prior to the start of construction activity.
At a minimum, applicants shall meet the specifications set forth below and
observe the standards established in NPDES permit requirements, the city’s
surface water management plan, the city’s specs, and the city’s engineering
guidelines.
   B.   Design Criteria:
      1.   Volume Control: Volume control measures are required on projects to
meet the water quality criteria of the city’s surface water management plan and
state administered NPDES Permits.
      2.   Rate Control:
         a.   For newly developing areas, no discharge or infiltration can be
assumed for purposes of establishing the 100-year, 24-hour storm event high
water elevation. For events with longer duration, a maximum peak stormwater
discharge rate will be limited to 0.05 cfs per acre. Redeveloping areas will be
required to meet these standards to the maximum reasonable extent practical.
         b.   In the event that the city will not be providing a regional
system, storage of the runoff from the 100-year, 24-hour storm event is
required on site.
         c.   Landlocked depressions that presently do not have a defined
outlet and do not typically overflow may be allowed a positive overflow to
prevent damage to adjacent properties. Any overflows from landlocked
depressions will comply with the city’s rate control, runoff volume control,
and low floor requirements including storing runoff from the 100-year, 24-hour
storm event for new development and restricting discharge to 0.05 cfs per acre
for longer duration storm events.
         d.   New storm sewer systems shall be designed to accommodate
discharge rates from a 10-year storm event.
      3.   Flood Control: The city requires that for any new or redevelopment,
at least three feet (3') of freeboard between the anticipated critical 100-year
high water elevation and the minimum building opening be maintained. Any
deviation from the three feet (3') freeboard requirement is subject to the
following conditions and may be approved by the city engineer if the following
can be demonstrated:
         a.   That within the two foot (2') freeboard area, stormwater storage
is available which is equal to or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the stormwater
storage currently available in the basin below the 100-year high water
elevation.
         b.   That a twenty five percent (25%) obstruction of the basin outlet
over a twenty-four (24) hour period would not result in more than one foot (1')
of additional bounce in the basin.
         c.   An adequate overflow route from the basin is available that will
provide assurance that one foot (1') of freeboard will be maintained for the
proposed low building opening.
      4.   Design Criteria Of Permanent Facilities: All permanent stormwater
facilities must meet the design criteria as provided in the city’s surface
water management plan.
   C.   Limitations And Restrictions:
      1.   Infiltration BMPs shall be prohibited or otherwise restricted in
those same areas and situations where prohibited or otherwise restricted in
applicable state administered NPDES Permits or regulations.
      2.   For areas where infiltration is prohibited the applicant shall
consider alternative volume reduction BMPs and the water quality volume must be
treated by a wet sedimentation basin, filtration system, regional ponding or
similar method prior to the release of stormwater to surface water.
      3.   For linear projects with lack of right of way, easements or other
permissions from property owners to install treatments systems that are capable
of treating the total water quality volume on site, the project must maximize
treatment through other methods or combination of methods before runoff is
released to nearby surface waters. Alternative treatment options include:
grassed swales, filtration systems, smaller ponds, or grit chambers. In all
circumstances, a reasonable attempt must be made to obtain right of way during
the project planning and all attempts of infeasibility must be recorded.
   D.   Exceptions: The city may authorize lesser volume control for the
following situations:
      1.   If the project meets one of the limitations outlined above; and
      2.   If the owner/operator implements to the maximum extent possible
other volume reduction practices, besides infiltration, on the site but may not
meet the requirements for postconstruction stormwater management.
   E.   Mitigation Provisions:
      1.   Under certain circumstances some construction projects cannot meet
the total suspended solids (TSS) and/or total phosphorus (TP) reduction
requirements for new or redevelopment projects on the site of the original
construction. When this occurs, the owner/operator will be required to identify
alternative locations where TSS and TP treatment standards can be achieved.
Mitigation project locations are chosen in the following order of preference:
         a.   Locations that yield benefits to the same receiving water that
receives runoff from the original construction activity.
         b.   Locations within the same department of natural resource (DNR)
catchment area as the original construction activity.
         c.   Locations in the next adjacent DNR catchment area upstream.
         d.   Locations anywhere within the city of Rosemount.
      2.   Mitigation projects shall also meet the following criteria:
         a.   Mitigation projects shall involve the establishment of new
structural stormwater BMPs or the retrofit of existing structural stormwater
BMPs, or the use of a properly designed regional structural stormwater BMP.
         b.   Previously required routine maintenance of structural stormwater
BMPs cannot be considered mitigation.
         c.   Mitigation projects must be finished within twenty-four (24)
months after the original construction activity begins.
         d.   Monies received for mitigation purposes in lieu of meeting
conditions for postconstruction stormwater management shall be applied to a
public stormwater project and shall comply with this subsection.
         e.   A maintenance agreement specifying the responsible party for
long-term maintenance shall be identified.
   F.   Maintenance Agreement: The applicant shall enter into a maintenance
agreement with the city that documents all responsibilities for operation and
maintenance of private long term stormwater treatment BMPs. Such responsibility
shall be documented in a maintenance plan and executed through a maintenance
agreement. All maintenance agreements must be approved by the city and recorded
at the Dakota County recorder’s office prior to final plan approval. At a
minimum, the maintenance agreement shall describe the inspection and
maintenance obligations:
      1.   The responsible party who is permanently responsible for maintenance
of the structural and nonstructural measures.
      2.   Pass responsibilities for such maintenance to successors in title.
      3.   Allow the city and its representatives the right of entry for the
purposes of inspecting all permanent stormwater management systems.
      4.   Allow the city the right to repair and maintain the facility, and
recoup costs for maintenance, if necessary maintenance is not performed after
proper and reasonable notice to the responsible party of the permanent
stormwater management system.
      5.   Include a maintenance plan that contains, but is not limited to, the
following:
         a.   Identification of all structural permanent stormwater management
systems.
         b.   A schedule for regular inspections, monitoring, and maintenance
for each practice. Monitoring shall verify whether the practice is functioning
as designed and may include, but is not limited to, quality, temperature, and
quantity of runoff.
         c.   Identification of the responsible party for conducting the
inspection, monitoring and maintenance for each practice.
         d.   Include a schedule and format for reporting compliance with the
maintenance agreement to the city.
      6.   The issuance of a permit constitutes a right of entry for the city,
its contractors, and agents to enter upon the construction site. The applicant
shall allow the city, its contractors, agents and any authorized
representatives, upon presentation of credentials, to:
         a.   Enter upon the permitted site for the purpose of obtaining
information, examination of records, conducting investigations or surveys.
         b.   Bring such equipment upon the permitted development as is
necessary to conduct such surveys and investigations.
         c.   Examine and copy any books, papers, records, or memoranda
pertaining to activities or records required to be kept under the terms and
conditions of the permit.

compliance by any person will ensure that there will be no contamination,
pollution, or unauthorized discharge of pollutants. (Ord. XVI.61, 5-19-2009,
eff. 5-19-2009)
10-2-6: DISCHARGE PROHIBITIONS:
   A.   Prohibition of Illegal Discharges: No person shall discharge or cause
to be discharged into the municipal storm drain system or surface waters any
materials, including, but not limited to, pollutants or waters containing
pollutants, other than stormwater. The commencement, conduct, or continuance of
any illegal discharge to the storm drain system is prohibited. The following
discharges are allowed:
      1.   Water line flushing or other potable water sources, landscape
irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream flows, rising groundwater,
groundwater infiltration to storm drains, uncontaminated pumped groundwater,
foundation or footing drains (not including active groundwater dewatering
systems), crawl space pumps, air conditioning condensation, springs,
noncommercial washing of vehicles, natural riparian habitat or wetland flows,
swimming pools (if dechlorinated to less than 0.1 ppm chlorine), firefighting
activities, and any other water source not containing pollutants.
      2.   Discharges specified in writing by the city as being necessary to
protect public health and safety.
      3.   Dye testing provided a verbal notification has been given to the
City prior to the time of the test.
      4.   Any non-stormwater discharge permitted under an NPDES permit,
waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the discharger and administered
under the authority of the federal environmental protection agency, provided
that the discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit,
waiver, or order and other applicable laws and regulations, and provided that
written approval has been granted for any discharge to the storm drain system.
      5.   The use of fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides for agricultural
or landscaping purposes when applied for their intended purpose in accordance
with label directions and with all applicable local, state and federal
ordinances, laws and regulations. Spillage or overspray beyond the intended
treatment area of fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides is not an intended
use.
   B.   Prohibition of Illicit Connections:
      1.   The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit
connections to the storm drain system is prohibited.
      2.   This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of the
connection.
      3.   A person is considered to be in violation of this chapter if the
person connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows such a connection
to continue.
   C.   Proper Storage of Materials: Materials, including pollutants and
hazardous materials, must be stored in a manner such that the potential to
erode, dissolve, infiltrate, or otherwise cause an illicit discharge or
pollution to surface waters and groundwaters is limited. Proper storage
measures shall include the following:
      1.   Easily dissolvable materials, such as salts used for deicing, shall
be covered or stored indoors to prevent contact with precipitation or runoff.
Said storage must be located on impervious surfaces to prevent dissolved
materials from infiltrating into the ground when exposed to water.
      2.   Easily erodible materials, such as soils, shall be stored within
contained areas to reduce the potential for migration of stored substances off
site, into the stormwater system, or into surface waters.
      3.   Hazardous materials must be stored in compliance with State and
Federal Regulations, stored in sealed containers, and secondary containment
must be provided when stored outside.
      4.   Stored materials must be located outside of surfaces waters,
waterways, and areas needed to store, carry, or discharge floodwaters.
   D.   Protective Measures and Best Practices During Materials Transfer: Best
practices must be implemented to reduce risks of illicit discharges, spills,
pollution to surface waters, and pollution to groundwater when transferring
materials to or from storage areas, whether those storage areas be indoors,
outdoors, temporary, or permanent. (Ord. XVI.61, 5-19-2009, eff. 5-19-2009;
amd. Ord. 2023-05, 10-3-2023)
10-2-7: SUSPENSION OF MS4 ACCESS:
   A.   Suspension Due To Illicit Discharges In Emergency Situations: The city
council may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person
when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge
that presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the
environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of
the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order
issued in an emergency, the city may take such steps as it deems necessary to
prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United States, or to
minimize danger to persons.
   B.   Suspension Due To The Detection Of Illicit Discharge: Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have their MS4 access
terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The
city will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The
violator may petition the city for reconsideration and a hearing. A person
commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated
pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the city. (Ord. XVI.61,
5-19-2009, eff. 5-19-2009; amd. Ord. 2023-05, 10-3-2023)
10-2-8: INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES:
Any person subject to an industrial or construction stormwater NPDES permit
shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance with said
permit may be required in a form acceptable to the city council prior to the
allowing of discharges to the MS4. (Ord. XVI.61, 5-19-2009, eff. 5-19-2009)
10-2-9: MONITORING OF DISCHARGES:
   A.   Applicability: This section applies to all facilities that have
stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity, including
construction activity.
   B.   Access To Facilities:
      1.   The city shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject
to regulation under this chapter as often as may be necessary to determine
compliance with this chapter. If a discharger has security measures in force
that require proper identification and clearance before entry into its
premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access
to representatives of the city.
      2.   Facility operators shall allow the city ready access to all parts of
the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying
of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to
discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as defined
by state and federal law.
      3.   The city shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility
such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the city to conduct monitoring
and/or sampling of the facility’s stormwater discharge.
      4.   The city has the right to require the discharger to install
monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility’s sampling and monitoring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure
stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
      5.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the city and shall not be replaced.
The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
      6.   Unreasonable delays in allowing the city or other government
agencies with regulatory authority access to a permitted facility is a
violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this chapter. A person who is
the operator of the facility with a NPDES permit to discharge stormwater
associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies the
city or other government agencies with regulatory authority reasonable access
to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized
or required by this chapter.
      7.   If the city has been refused access to any part of the premises from
which stormwater is discharged, and the city is able to demonstrate probable
cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there
is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling
program designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any order issued
hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the
community, then the city may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court
of competent jurisdiction. (Ord. XVI.61, 5-19-2009, eff. 5-19-2009; amd. Ord.
2023-05, 10-3-2023)
10-2-10: POLLUTANTS:
The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall
provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge
of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system
or surface waters through the use of structural and nonstructural BMPs.
Further, any person responsible for a property or premises that is, or may be,
the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said
person’s expense, additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the
further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system.
Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing
the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent
practicable, shall be deemed compliant with the provisions of this section.
These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as
necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit. (Ord. XVI.61,
5-19-2009, eff. 5-19-2009; amd. Ord. 2023-05, 10-3-2023)
10-2-11: WATERCOURSE PROTECTION:
Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles
that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so
that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical
integrity of the watercourse. (Ord. XVI.61, 5-19-2009, eff. 5-19-2009)
10-2-12: NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS:
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of
materials that are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants
discharging into stormwater, the storm drain system, or waters of the U.S.,
said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery,
containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of
hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response
agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a
release of nonhazardous materials, said person shall notify the city in person
or by phone or email no later than the next business day. Notifications in
person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice or email addressed and
sent to the city within three (3) business days of the phone or in person
notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or
industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall
also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to
prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three (3)
years. (Ord. XVI.61, 5-19-2009, eff. 5-19-2009; amd. Ord. 2023-05, 10-3-2023)
10-2-13: ENFORCEMENT:
   A.   Notice Of Violation: Whenever the city finds that a person has violated
a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this chapter, the city may
order compliance by written notice of violation to the responsible person. Such
notice may require, without limitation, the following: the performance of
monitoring, analysis, and reporting; the elimination of illicit connections or
discharges; that violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and
desist; the abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or contamination
hazards and the restoration of any affected property; and the implementation of
source control or treatment BMPs.
      1.   If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property
is required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such
remediation or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall further advise
that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore within the established
deadline, the work will be done by the city or a contractor and the expense
thereof shall be charged to the violator.
      2.   The notice shall state that the determination of violation may be
appealed to the city administrator by filing with the city clerk a written
notice of appeal within seven (7) calendar days of service of the notice of
violation. (Ord. XVI.61, 5-19-2009, eff. 5-19-2009; amd. Ord. 2023-05, 10-3-
2023)
10-2-14: APPEAL OF NOTICE OF VIOLATION:

No structure, or part thereof, shall be erected, converted, enlarged,
reconstructed, altered or moved and no structure or land shall be used for any

title. (Ord. 2024-04, 6-4-2024)
11-1-8: NONCONFORMING USES, STRUCTURES, AND LOTS:
   A.   Purpose:
      1.   This section is established in recognition of the existence of uses,
structures, site improvements, and lots which were lawfully established but
which do not currently comply with the provisions of this title or subsequent
amendments. It is further established to specify the requirements,
circumstances, and conditions under which nonconforming uses, structures, site
improvements, and lots will be operated and maintained and to encourage actions
that bring non- conformities into conformity with this title.
   B.   Continuance Of Nonconforming Uses And Structures:
      1.   Any nonconformity, including the lawful use or occupation of land or
structures existing at the time of the adoption hereof, may be continued
through repair, replacement, restoration, maintenance, or improvement but not
through expansion, unless:
         a.   The nonconformity or occupancy is discontinued for a period of
more than one (1) year; or
         b.   Any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by fire or other
peril to the extent of greater than fifty percent (50%) of its market value and
no building permit has been applied for within one hundred eighty (180) days of
when the property is damaged. In this case, the city may impose reasonable
conditions upon a building permit to mitigate any newly created impact on
adjacent property.
      2.   Any subsequent use or occupancy of the land or structures shall be a
conforming use or occupancy.
   C.   Expansion Of Nonconforming Uses And Structures:
      1.   No nonconformity may be added to or enlarged in any manner unless
such additions or enlargements are made so as to bring said use or structure
into conformity with the regulations of the zoning ordinance.

         b.   Are contiguous; and
         c.   Do not meet the area or dimensional standards for the applicable
zoning district.
      2.   No portion of such single parcels may be used, sold, or subdivided
in a manner that lessens compliance with applicable area or dimensional
standards. (Ord. 2024-04, 6-4-2024)
11-1-9: OFFICIAL MAPS:
   A.   Purpose: Land that is needed for future street purposes and as sites
for other necessary public facilities and services is frequently diverted to
nonpublic uses which could have been located on other lands without hardship or
inconvenience to the owners. When this happens, public uses of land may be
denied or may be obtained only at prohibitive cost or at the expense of
dislocating the owners and occupants of the land. Identification of an official
map of land needed for future public uses permits both the public and private
property owners to adjust their building plans equitably and conveniently
before investments are made which will make such adjustments difficult to
accomplish. It is the purpose of this chapter to provide a uniform procedure
for the proper use of official maps as authorized by the Minnesota municipal
planning act, Minn. Stat. chapter 462.
   B.   Official Map Defined: "Official map" as used in this chapter means a
map adopted in accordance with this chapter showing existing streets, proposed
future streets, and the area needed for widening of existing streets of the
city. An official map may also show the location of existing and future land
and facilities within the city. An official map may cover the entire city or
any portion of the city.
   C.   Initiation Of Proceedings: Proceedings for adoption, amendment, or
repeal of an official map or any part thereof may be initiated by:
      1.   The city's planning department;
      2.   A recommendation of the planning commission; or
      3.   Action by the city council.
   D.   Sketch Maps And Reports: Every proposal or request for an official map
or its amendment or repeal, however initiated, shall be accompanied by a sketch
map or plat showing the lands proposed to be included and the public purpose to
be served.
   E.   Reference To Planning Commission: Except when proceedings have been
initiated by recommendation of the planning commission, every proposed official
map or change in a map shall be referred to the planning commission for advice
and recommendation thereon, and such recommendation shall be submitted to the
city council within forty-five (45) days after reference to the planning
commission along with the report of the commission on the effect of the
proposal on the comprehensive plan of the city. If no recommendation is
received by the council from the planning commission within forty-five (45)
days after reference of the proposal to the commission by the council, the
council may take such action as it may deem proper upon the proposal without
further action by the planning commission.
   F.   Notice And Hearing:
      1.   Notice: Upon receiving the recommendation of the planning commission
or after forty-five (45) days from the submission of the proposal to the
planning commission without a recommendation from the commission, the council
may call a public hearing on the proposal. A notice of the time, place, and
purpose of the hearing and a description of property to be included in the
mapped streets and public grounds shall be published in the official newspaper
at least ten (10) days prior to the date of the hearing. At least ten (10) days
prior to the hearing, the clerk shall also mail a copy of the notice to each
owner of land situated within or abutting any street or other public ground
shown on the official map. For purposes of this notice, the owners shall be
determined by the records of the county auditor and the notice shall be
addressed to the last known address as shown by the auditor's records. Failure
to serve any such notice shall not invalidate the proceedings.
      2.   Hearing: At the time and place specified in the notice, the council
shall hear evidence and arguments concerning the proposal. The hearing may be
continued from time to time without further notice. The council may direct the
planning commission to conduct a hearing and following the hearing to report
its recommendation to the council.
   G.   Preparation And Filing of Maps: The official map or maps shall be
prepared in sufficient detail to permit the establishment of future acquisition
lines on the ground. In unplatted areas, a minimum of a centerline survey shall
be made prior to the preparation of the final draft of the official map. The
accuracy of the future acquisition lines shown on the official map shall be
attested to by a licensed land surveyor. After enactment of any ordinance
adopting an official map or amending or repealing a previous official map
ordinance, a certified copy of the official map or section to which the
ordinance relates, together with an attached copy of the ordinance, shall be
filed with the county recorder.
   H.   Effect: After an official map has been adopted and filed, the issuance
of building permits by the city shall be subject to the provisions of this
chapter. The city shall deny every application for a permit to construct a new
building or structure or expand an existing building or structure within any
area designated on the official map for street or public purposes, or outside
of any building line that may have been established upon the existing street.
Whenever any street or highway is widened or improved or any new street is
opened, or any interest in lands for other public purposes is acquired by the
city, the city is not required in such proceedings to pay for any building or
structure placed without a permit or in violation of conditions of a permit
within the limits of the mapped street or outside of any building line that may
have been established upon the existing street or within any area thus
identified for public purposes. The adoption of an official map does not give
the city any right, title, or interest in areas identified for public purposes
thereon, but the adoption of the map does authorize the city to acquire such
interest without paying compensation for buildings or structures erected in
such areas without a permit or in violation of the conditions of a permit.
   I.   Appeals: Whenever a building permit is denied pursuant to this chapter,
the board of appeals and adjustments shall, upon appeal filed with it by the
owner of the land, grant a permit for building in an area designated on the
official map for a street or other public purpose in any case in which the
board finds, upon the evidence and the arguments presented to it: a) that the
entire property of the appellant of which the area designated for public
purposes forms a part cannot yield a reasonable return to the owner unless such
a permit is granted, or b) that balancing the interest of the city in
preserving the integrity of the official map and of the comprehensive city plan
and the interest of the property owner in the use of his property and in the
benefits of ownership, the grant of such permit is required by considerations
of justice and equity. The board of appeals and adjustments shall hold a public
hearing upon the appeal after notice of the hearing has been published in the
official newspaper once at least ten (10) days before the hearing. If the board
authorizes the issuance of a permit, it shall specify the exact location,
ground area, height, and other details as to the extent and character of the
building for which the permit is granted. If the board authorizes issuance of a
permit, the council or other authority, board or commission having jurisdiction
shall have six (6) months from the date of the decision of the board to
institute proceedings to acquire such land or interest therein, and if no such
proceedings are started within that time, the city shall issue the permit if
the application otherwise conforms to local ordinances.
   J.   Adoption Of Maps: Language for adoption of official maps shall be as
follows:
      1.   ADOPTION OF MAP [fill in description]: The map entitled "Official
Map of                             ", a copy of which is attached to Ordinance
No.       and incorporated herein by reference, is hereby adopted and
designated as the Official Map of                             . (Ord. 2024-04,

11-3-2: USES:
   A.   Tables 3.1 and 3.2 list land uses and indicates whether they are
permitted, permitted with standards, conditional, interim, or prohibited. The
tables also include references to whether additional use-specific standards are
applicable to each use.
   B.   The following definitions shall be referenced when using Tables 3.1 and
3.2:
      1.   Permitted Use: A "P" indicates that a use is allowed by right,
subject to compliance with all other applicable provisions of this code.
      2.   Permitted With Standards Use: A "PS" indicates that a use is allowed
when standards identified in chapter 6 "Use-Specific Standards" are met. Uses
permitted with standards are also subject to all other applicable requirements
of this chapter. Any request to vary from the standards set forth for a
permitted with standards use shall be processed as a variance.
      3.   Conditional Use: A "C" indicates that a use is allowed only if a
conditional use permit is issued by the city after compliance with the
procedure and requirements set forth in section 11-9-3 "Conditional Use
Permit."
      4.   Interim Use: An "I" indicates that a use may be allowed for a
limited period of time if an interim use permit is issued by the city after
compliance with the procedure and requirements set forth in section 11-9-
4 "Interim Use Permit."
      5.   Prohibited Use: A blank cell in the use table indicates that the
land use is prohibited in that zoning district.
   C.   In the event a proposed use is not listed in the use table, the Zoning
Administrator is authorized to classify the proposed use into an existing use
type as set forth in Tables 3.1 and 3.2 that the Zoning Administrator
determines most closely fits the proposed use.
      1.   If found to be consistent with a listed use, the proposed use shall
be treated the same as the listed use.
      2.   If no similar use determination is made by the Zoning Administrator,
the proposed use is prohibited. In such case, the City Council on its own
initiative may amend this chapter to allow the proposed use or an interested
party may request an amendment to this chapter in accordance with the procedure
and requirement set forth in section
11-9-2 "Zoning Code Amendment.

NON-RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS
SECTION:
11-4-1: Purpose Statements
11-4-2: Uses
11-4-3: Lot Dimensions
11-4-4: Site Dimensions
11-4-5: District Standards
11-4-1: PURPOSE STATEMENTS:
The following statements specify the purposes of the zoning districts
established to regulate the areas of the City considered appropriate for non-
residential uses:
   A.   MX-1 Downtown Mixed Use District: The purpose of the Downtown Mixed Use
District is to provide for the establishment of a diversified commercial,
civic, and lifestyle center. This district should contain a mix of cultural,
civic, entertainment, residential, retail, service, office, and public uses.
Consideration for pedestrian and bicycle users related to access, landscaping,
amenities, and architectural design shall be integrated.
   B.   MX-2 Highway Mixed Use District: The purpose of the Highway Mixed Use
District is to allow for a horizontal or vertical mix of residential and
commercial uses at specific nodes along County Road 42 in conformance with the
Highway 42 Commercial Site Concepts developed in 2021. High volumes of traffic
and access to CR 42 are important for the uses in this district.
   C.   B-1 General Business District: The purpose of the General Business
District is to accommodate a broad range of commercial and retail uses and
services which serve the local community. This district is intended to be
located at important neighborhood intersections or along major community
roadways.
   D.   B-2 Employment District: The purpose of the Employment District is to
provide a suitable environment for employment centers, business headquarters,
offices and professional uses, warehousing, light industrial uses, and
associated complementary uses with a focus on quality site design. Uses are
primarily confined within buildings with limited outdoor usage or storage.
   E.   I-1 General Industrial District: The purpose of the General Industrial
District is to provide for the establishment of both light and medium
industrial uses, including manufacturing, warehousing, and repair uses. General
industrial uses are conducted primarily within buildings, but may include
limited exterior operation and storage.
   F.   I-2 Heavy Industrial District: The purpose of the Heavy Industrial
District is to provide for the establishment of heavy industrial uses which may
include significant exterior operation or storage of equipment and materials.
As a result of operation, heavy industrial uses may generate byproducts such as
noise, odors, smoke, and vibration, which may have nuisance impacts on
surrounding properties. As a result, these uses require larger land areas and
are not compatible with residential uses or high concentrations of people.
   G.   PI Public and Institutional District: The purpose of the Public and
Institutional District is to accommodate major public and institutional uses of
a governmental, educational, assembly, and recreational nature that serve the
entire community. (Ord. 2024-04, 6-4-2024)
11-4-2: USES:
   A.   Tables 4.1 and 4.2 list land uses and indicates whether they are
permitted, permitted with standards, conditional, interim, or prohibited. The
tables also include references to whether additional use-specific standards are
applicable to each use.
   B.   The following definitions shall be referenced when using Tables 4.1 and
4.2:
      1.   Permitted Use: A "P" indicates that a use is allowed by right,
subject to compliance with all other applicable provisions of this code.
      2.   Permitted With Standards Use: A "PS" indicates that a use is allowed
when standards identified in chapter 6 "Use-Specific Standards" are met. Uses
permitted with standards are also subject to all other applicable requirements
of this chapter. Any request to vary from the standards set forth for a
permitted with standards use shall be processed as a variance.
      3.   Conditional Use: A "C" indicates that a use is allowed only if a
conditional use permit is issued by the city after compliance with the
procedure and requirements set forth in section
11-9-3 "Conditional Use Permit."
      4.   Interim Use: An "I" indicates that a use may be allowed for a
limited period of time if an interim use permit is issued by the city after
compliance with the procedure and requirements set forth in section
11-9-4 "Interim Use Permit."
      5.   Prohibited Use: A blank cell in the use table indicates that the
land use is prohibited in that zoning district.
   C.   In the event a proposed use is not listed in the use table, the Zoning
Administrator is authorized to classify the proposed use into an existing use
type as set forth in Tables 4.1 and 4.2 that the Zoning Administrator
determines most closely fits the proposed use.
      1.   If found to be consistent with a listed use, the proposed use shall
be treated the same as the listed use.
      2.   If no similar use determination is made by the Zoning Administrator,
the proposed use is prohibited. In such case, the City Council on its own
initiative may amend this chapter to allow the proposed use or an interested
party may request an amendment to this chapter in accordance with the procedure
and requirement set forth in section 11-9-2 "Zoning Code Amendment."

SPECIAL/OVERLAY DISTRICTS
SECTION:
11-5-1: Floodplain Overlay District
11-5-2: Shoreland Overlay District
11-5-3: Wetland Overlay District
11-5-4: Mississippi River Corridor Critical Area Overlay District
11-5-5: Planned Unit Development (PUD) District
11-5-1: FLOODPLAIN OVERLAY DISTRICT:
   A.   Statutory Authorization And Purpose:
      1.   Statutory Authorization: This floodplain ordinance is adopted
pursuant to the authorization and policies contained in Minnesota Statutes,
Chapter 103F; Minnesota Rules, parts 6120.5000 - 6120.6200; the rules and
regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) in 44 CFR § 59 to
80; and the planning and zoning enabling legislation in Minnesota Statutes,
Chapter 462.
      2.   Purpose:
         a.   This section regulates development in the flood hazard areas of
the City of Rosemount. These flood hazard areas are subject to periodic
inundation, which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare by minimizing these losses and disruptions.
         b.   This chapter is adopted in the public interest to promote sound
land use practices, and floodplains are a land resource to be developed in a
manner which will result in minimum loss of life and threat to health, and
reduction of private and public economic loss caused by flooding.
         c.   This chapter is adopted to maintain eligibility in the National
Flood Insurance Program.
         d.   This chapter is also intended to preserve the natural
characteristics and functions of watercourses and floodplains in order to
moderate flood and stormwater impacts, improve water quality, reduce soil
erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitat, provide recreational
opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits and enhance community and economic
development.
      3.   Abrogation And Greater Restrictions: It is not intended by this
chapter to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or
private agreements. The standards in this chapter take precedence over any less
restrictive, conflicting local laws, ordinances, or codes. All other ordinances
inconsistent with this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the
inconsistency only.
      4.   Warning And Disclaimer Of Liability: This chapter does not imply
that areas outside the floodplain districts or land uses permitted within such
districts will be free from flooding or flood damages. Not all flood risk is
mapped. Larger floods do occur and the flood height may be increased by man-
made or natural causes, such as ice jams or bridge openings restricted by
debris. This chapter does not create liability on the part of the City of
Rosemount or its officers or employees for any flood damages that result from
reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made
hereunder.
      5.   Severability: If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this
chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of law, the
remainder of this chapter shall not be affected and shall remain in full force.
      6.   Definitions: Unless specifically defined in section
11-10-6 Floodplain Definitions, words or phrases used in this chapter must be
interpreted according to common usage and so as to give this chapter its most
reasonable application.
   B.   Jurisdictions And Districts:
      1.   Lands To Which Chapter Applies: This chapter applies to all lands
under the jurisdiction of the City of Rosemount within the Floodplain, shown as
Zone AE on the Flood Insurance Rate Map panels referenced in subsection B.2
below.
         a.   The standards imposed in this overlay district are in addition to
any other requirements. In case of a conflict, the more restrictive standards
will apply.
         b.   Where a conflict exists between the floodplain limits illustrated
on the official floodplain maps and actual field conditions (as illustrated in
Figure 5.1), the Base Flood Elevation (BFE) shall be the governing factor in
locating the outer boundaries of the one-percent annual chance floodplain.

      3.   Annexations: The Flood Insurance Rate Map panels referenced in
subsection B.2 above may include floodplain areas that lie outside of the
corporate boundaries of the City of Rosemount at the time of adoption of this
chapter. If any of these floodplain land areas are annexed into the City of
Rosemount after the date of adoption of this chapter, the newly annexed
floodplain lands will be subject to the provisions of this chapter immediately
upon the date of annexation. Annexations into panels not referenced in
subsection B.2 require ordinance amendment in accordance with subsection G
below.
      4.   Municipal Boundary Adjustments And Townships: The Flood Insurance
Rate Map panels referenced in subsection B.2 apply countywide. If at any point
any lands come under the jurisdiction of another local government, the
following shall apply:
         a.   City adjustments of corporate boundaries, including but not
limited to annexations and detachments, shall shift floodplain administrative
authority of all affected lands immediately upon the date of the boundary
adjustment occurring. Cities retain jurisdiction for all incorporated lands,
and the County retains jurisdiction under this chapter on all unincorporated
lands, except as provided under subsection B.4.b below or through some form of
administrative agreement.
         b.   Townships wishing to adopt official controls under Minn. Stat. §
394.33 may only obtain zoning authority for floodplain controls when they have
adopted an ordinance that is approved by the Department of Natural Resources
and has formally enrolled in the NFIP. Until this occurs, the county shall
retain jurisdiction under this chapter on all unincorporated lands. In the
event that a township returns zoning authority, the county shall resume that
authority.
   C.   Permitted Activities And Standards In The Floodplain District:
      1.   Permitted Activities: A permit must be obtained from the Zoning
Administrator to verify compliance with all applicable standards outlined in
this chapter prior to the following uses or activities:
         a.   Any addition, modification, rehabilitation, repair, or alteration
to a nonconforming structure as specified in subsection D below. Normal
maintenance and repair also requires a permit if such work, separately or in
conjunction with other planned work, constitutes a substantial improvement as
defined in section
11-10-6 of this title.
         b.   Any use that requires fill, excavation, storage of materials, or
placement of anything that may cause a potential obstruction, as well as any
other form of development as defined in section
11-10-6 of this title.
      2.   Activities Not Requiring A Permit: Certain uses or activities may be
exempt from obtaining a permit, such as planting a garden, farming, or other
obviously insignificant activities such as putting up a mailbox or flagpole.
Farm fences, as defined in section
11-10-6 of this title, are not considered to be an obstruction, and as such, do
not require a permit. A local permit is not required if a public waters work
permit has been obtained from the Department of Natural Resources, unless a
significant area above the ordinary high water level is also to be disturbed.
The continuation of existing uses, when the associated activities do not
encroach further on the regulatory floodplain or trigger associated standards
in this title, do not require a permit.
      3.   Minimum Development Standards:
         a.   All development must:
         (1)   Be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement resulting from hydrodynamic and
hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy;
         (2)   Be constructed with materials and equipment resistant to flood
damage;
         (3)   Be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood
damage;
         (4)   Be reasonably safe from flooding and consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage;
         (5)   Be assured to provide adequate drainage to reduce exposure to
flood hazards;
         (6)   Not be detrimental to uses in adjoining areas; and
         (7)   Not adversely affect the efficiency or restrict the flood
carrying capacity of the channel and adjoining floodplain of any tributary
watercourse or drainage system.
         b.   Buildings And Structures: No new structures, such as buildings or
accessory structures may be permitted in the regulatory floodplain.
Modifications and alterations of nonconforming structures is subject to the
standards in subsection D below.
         c.   Subdivisions: All new lots must be able to accommodate for a
building site with a natural grade outside of the floodplain. All subdivisions
must have vehicular access both to the subdivision and to the individual
building sites no lower than two feet (2') below the Regulatory Flood
Protection Elevation (RFPE).
         d.   Encroachment Analysis: Development in the following areas
requires hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed by a professional
engineer, or using other standard engineering practices (e.g. projects that
restore the site to the previous cross-sectional area).
         (1)   In a floodway, development may not result in any of the
following during the one-percent (1%) annual chance flood: cause a stage
increase of 0.00 feet or greater, obstruct flood flows, or increase velocities.
         (2)   In areas where a floodway has not been delineated, development
may not allow stage increases more than one-half (0.5) foot at any point during
the one-percent (1%) chance flood. This evaluation must include the cumulative
effects of previous encroachments. A lesser water surface elevation increase
than one-half (0.5) foot is required if, due to the water surface level
increase, increased flood damages would potentially result.
         e.   Fences not meeting the definition of farm fences are not
permitted.
         f.   Transportation Facilities: Railroad tracks, roads, and bridges
must be elevated to the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation (RFPE) where such
facilities are essential to the orderly functioning of the area, or where
failure or interruption would result in danger to public health or safety.
Minor or auxiliary roads or railroads may be constructed at a lower elevation
where failure or interruption of transportation services would not endanger the
public health or safety. All public transportation facilities should be
designed to minimize increases in flood elevations.
         g.   Public Utilities: All utilities such as gas, electrical, sewer,
and water supply systems to be located in the floodplain must be elevated and/
or floodproofed to the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation (RFPE), be located
and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage, and be designed to
eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the
systems into flood waters. All public utilities should be designed to minimize
increases in flood elevations. New solid waste management facilities, as
defined in Minnesota Rules, part 7035.0300, are prohibited. Water supply
systems are subject to the provisions in Minnesota Rules, part 4725.4350.
         h.   Potential Pollutants: Materials that, in time of flooding, are
buoyant, flammable, explosive, or could be injurious to human, animal, or plant
life, as well as those likely to cause pollution of the waters, such as sewage;
sand; rock; wrecked and discarded equipment; dredged spoil; municipal,
agricultural or industrial waste; and other wastes as further defined in Minn.
Stat. § 115.01, are prohibited.
         i.   Land Alterations: In areas within twenty-five feet (25') of the
ordinary high water level, land alterations shall be restricted to:
         (1)   The minimum required to accommodate beach and access areas, not
to exceed a volume greater than ten (10) cubic yards; and
         (2)   The minimum required to accommodate for public utilities, roads,
railroad tracks, bridges, and shoreline stabilization projects to correct an
identified erosion problem, as verified by a qualified resource agency or the
zoning administrator.
         j.   Recreational vehicles must be travel ready, meeting the following
criteria:
         (1)   The vehicle must be fully licensed.
         (2)   The vehicle must be ready for highway use, meaning on wheels or
the internal jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type
utilities.
         (3)   No permanent structural type additions may be attached to the
vehicle.
         k.   Private On-site Water Supply, Individual Sewage Treatment
Systems, and other Service Facilities shall be subject to applicable provisions
detailed in subsection C.3.g above. Replacement of on-site sewage treatment
systems are to be constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from
them during times of flooding, shall not be located in a designated floodway,
and are subject to the provisions in Minnesota Rules, parts 7080.2270. No new
private service facilities may be permitted in the regulatory floodplain.
   D.   Nonconformities:
      1.   Continuance Of Nonconformities: A use, structure, or occupancy of
land which was lawful before the passage or amendment of this title, but which
is not in conformity with the provisions of this title, may be continued
subject to the following conditions:
         a.   Within the floodway, or where the floodway has not been
delineated, any expansion or enlargement of uses or structures is prohibited.
         b.   Any addition, modification, rehabilitation, repair, or alteration
shall be in conformance with the provisions of this title, shall not increase
the flood damage potential or increase the degree of obstruction to flood
flows, and where applicable, must be protected to the Regulatory Flood
Protection Elevation (RFPE).
         c.   If any nonconforming structure is determined to be substantially
damaged or substantially improved based on the procedures in subsection D.3
below, it may not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of
this section.
         d.   If any nonconforming use, or any use of a nonconforming
structure, is discontinued for more than one (1) year, any future use of the
premises must conform to this section.
      2.   Standards For Modifications And Alterations Of Nonconforming
Structures: In addition to the standards identified in C.3, the following
standards and procedures apply to additions, modifications, rehabilitations,
repairs, alterations, or maintenance of nonconforming structures:
         a.   All structures, including manufactured homes, must be elevated on
fill so that the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement)
is at or above the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation (RFPE). The finished
fill elevation shall be at or above the elevation associated with the base
flood plus any stage increases that result from designation of a floodway. Fill
must extend at the same elevation at least fifteen feet (15') beyond the
outside limits of the structure. Elevations must be certified by a registered
professional engineer, land surveyor or other qualified person designated by
the Zoning Administrator.
         b.   Electrical, heating, ventilation, ductwork, plumbing, and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities are designed and/or located
so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components
during conditions of flooding.
      3.   Substantial Improvement And Substantial Damage Determinations: Prior
to issuing any permits for additions, modifications, rehabilitations, repairs,
alterations, or maintenance to nonconforming structures, the Zoning
Administrator is required to determine if such work constitutes substantial
improvement or repair of a substantially damaged structure. A determination
must be made in accordance with the following procedures:
         a.   Estimate the market value of the structure. In the case of
repairs, the market value of the structure shall be the market value before the
damage occurred and before any restoration or repairs are made.
         b.   Estimate the cost of the project. The property owner shall
accommodate for inspection, and furnish other documentation needed by the
zoning administrator to evaluate costs.
         (1)   Improvement costs shall be comprised of the market rate of all
materials and labor, as well as the costs of all ordinary maintenance and
upkeep carried out over the past one (1) year.
         (2)   Costs to repair damages shall be comprised of the market rate of
all materials and labor required to restore a building to its pre-damaged
condition regardless of the work proposed, as well as associated improvement
costs if structure is being restored beyond its pre-damaged condition.
         c.   Compare the cost of the improvement, repairs, or combination
thereof to the estimated market value of the structure, and determine whether
the proposed work constitutes substantial improvement or repair of a
substantially damaged structure, as defined in section
11-10-6 of this title.
         d.   Based on this determination, the Zoning Administrator shall
prepare a determination letter and notify the property owner accordingly.
Structures determined to be substantially damaged or substantially improved may
not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this section.
   E.   Administration:
      1.   Duties: A Zoning Administrator or other official must administer and
enforce this section.
         a.   Permit Application Requirements: Permit applications must be
submitted to the Zoning Administrator. The permit application must include the
following, as applicable:
         (1)   A site plan showing all existing or proposed buildings,
structures, service facilities, potential obstructions, and pertinent design
features having an influence on the permit.
         (2)   Location and detail of grading, fill, or storage of materials.
         (3)   Copies of any required local, state or federal permits or
approvals.
         (4)   Other relevant information requested by the Zoning Administrator
as necessary to properly evaluate the permit application.
         b.   Recordkeeping: The Zoning Administrator must maintain applicable
records in perpetuity documenting:
         (1)   Encroachment analysis, as detailed in section C.3.d above.
         (2)   Final elevations, as applicable, detailing the elevation to
which structures and improvements to structures are constructed or
floodproofed. Elevations shall be determined by an engineer, architect,
surveyor or other qualified individual, as approved by the Zoning
Administrator.
         (3)   Substantial damage and substantial improvement determinations,
as detailed in section D.3, including the cost of improvements, repairs, and
market value.
         (4)   All variance actions, including justification for their
issuance, and must report such variances as requested by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
      2.   Variances:
         a.   An application for a variance to the provisions of this section
will be processed and reviewed in accordance with Minn. Stat. § 462.357, Subd.
6(2) and this title.
         b.   Variances must not be issued within any designated regulatory
floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
         c.   Variances from the provisions in this section may only be issued
by a community upon:
         (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
         d.   Variances from the provisions in this ordinance may only be
issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         e.   Variances must be consistent with the general purpose of these
standards and the intent of applicable provisions in state and federal law.
         f.   Though variances may be used to modify permissible methods of
flood protection, no variance shall permit a lesser degree of flood protection
than the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation (RFPE).
         g.   The Zoning Administrator must notify the applicant for a variance
that:
         (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the
base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars
($100.00) of insurance coverage; and
         (2)   Such construction below the base or regional flood level
increases risks to life and property. Such notification must be maintained with
a record of all variance actions.
      3.   Notifications For Watercourse Alterations: Before authorizing any
alteration or relocation of a river or stream, the Zoning Administrator must
notify adjacent communities. If the applicant has applied for a permit to work
in public waters pursuant to Minn, Stat. § 103G.245, this will suffice as
adequate notice. A copy of the notification must also be submitted to FEMA.
      4.   Notification to FEMA When Physical Changes Increase Or Decrease Base
Flood Elevations: Where physical changes affecting flooding conditions may
increase or decrease the water surface elevation of the base flood, the City of
Rosemount must notify FEMA of the changes in order to obtain a Letter of Map
Revision (LOMR), by submitting a copy of the relevant technical or scientific
data as soon as practicable, but no later than six (6) months after the date
such supporting information becomes available. Within areas where the floodway
has not been delineated, a map revision is only required if development results
in stage increases greater than 0.5 feet.
      5.   Notifications To The Department Of Natural Resources:
         a.   All notices of public hearings to consider variances or
conditional uses under this section must be sent via electronic mail to the
Department of Natural Resources respective area hydrologist at least ten (10)
days before the hearings. Notices of hearings to consider subdivisions/plats
must include copies of the subdivision/plat.
         b.   A copy of all decisions granting variances and conditional uses
under this section must be sent via electronic mail to the Department of
Natural Resources respective area hydrologist within ten (10) days of final
action.
   F.   Penalties And Enforcement:
      1.   Uses In Violation Of The Section: Every structure, fill, deposit, or
other use placed or maintained in the floodplain in violation of this section
shall be considered a public nuisance.
      2.   Civil Remedies: The creation of a public nuisance may be enjoined
and the maintenance of a public nuisance under this section may be abated by an
action brought by the City of Rosemount or the Department of Natural Resources.
      3.   Enforcement: Violations of the provisions of this section
constitutes a misdemeanor and is punishable as defined by law. The Zoning
Administrator may utilize the full array of enforcement actions available to it
including but not limited to prosecution and fines, injunctions, after-the-fact
permits, orders for corrective measures or a request to the National Flood
Insurance Program for denial of flood insurance. The City of Rosemount must act
in good faith to enforce these official controls and to correct ordinance
violations to the extent possible so as not to jeopardize its eligibility in
the National Flood Insurance Program.
   G.   Amendments:
      1.   Ordinance Amendments: Any revisions to the floodplain maps by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or annexations of new map panels require an
ordinance amendment to update the map references in subsection B.2 above.
      2.   Required Approval: All amendments to this section must be submitted
to the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) for review and approval prior to
adoption, for compliance with state and federal rules and requirements. The
floodplain ordinance shall not be considered valid until approved. (Ord. 2024-

pursuant to the authorization and policies contained in Minnesota Statutes,
Chapter 103F, Minnesota Rules, Parts 6120.2500 - 6120.3900, and the planning
and zoning enabling legislation in Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 462.
      2.   Policy: The Legislature of Minnesota has delegated responsibility to
local governments of the state to regulate the subdivision, use and development
of the shorelands of public waters and thus preserve and enhance the quality of
surface waters, conserve the economic and natural environmental values of
shorelands, and provide for the wise use of waters and related land resources.
This responsibility is hereby recognized by the City of Rosemount.
   B.   General Provisions And Definitions:
      1.   Jurisdiction: The provisions of this section apply to the shorelands
of the public water bodies as classified in subsection D.1 below, and to the
shorelands of public water bodies greater than ten (10) acres in unincorporated
areas in which the city has, by ordinance, extended the application of its
zoning regulations as provided by Minnesota Statute, Chapter 462.357 Subd 1.
Pursuant to Minnesota Rules, Parts 6120.2500 - 6120.3900, no lake, pond, or
flowage less than ten (10) acres in size in municipalities or twenty-five (25)
acres in size in unincorporated areas need be regulated in a local government's
shoreland regulations. A body of water created by a private user where there
was no previous shoreland may, at the discretion of the governing body, be
exempt from this section.
      2.   Enforcement: The Zoning Administrator is responsible for the
administration and enforcement of this section. Any violation of the provisions
of this section or failure to comply with any of its requirements (including
violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants
of variances or conditional uses constitutes a misdemeanor and is punishable as
defined by law. Violations of this section can occur regardless of whether or
not a permit is required for a regulated activity listed in subsection C.2
below.
      3.   Severability: If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this
section is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the remainder of this section shall not be affected thereby.
      4.   Abrogation And Greater Restrictions: It is not intended by this
section to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or
deed restrictions. However, where this section imposes greater restrictions,
the provisions of this section shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent
with this osection are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
      5.   Definitions: Unless specifically defined in section
11-10-5 Shoreland Definitions, words or phrases used in this section shall be
interpreted to give them the same meaning they have in common usage and to give
this section its most reasonable application. For the purpose of this section,
the words "must" and "shall" are mandatory and not permissive. All distances,
unless otherwise specified, are measured horizontally.
   C.   Administration:
      1.   Purpose: The purpose of this Section is to identify administrative
provisions to ensure the ordinance is administered consistent with its purpose.
      2.   Permits:
         a.   A permit is required for the construction of buildings or
building additions (including construction of decks and signs), the
installation and/or alteration of sewage treatment systems, and those grading
and filling activities not exempted by subsection H.3 below.
         b.   A certificate of compliance, consistent with Minnesota Rules
Chapter 7082.0700 Subp. 3, is required whenever a permit or variance of any
type is required for any improvement on or use of the property. A sewage
treatment system shall be considered compliant if the only deficiency is the
system's improper setback from the ordinary high water level.
      3.   Application Materials: Application for permits and other zoning
applications such as variances shall be made to the Zoning Administrator on the
forms provided. The application shall include the necessary information so that
the Zoning Administrator can evaluate how the application complies with the
provisions of this section.
      4.   Certificate Of Zoning Compliance: The Zoning Administrator shall
issue a certificate of zoning compliance for each activity requiring a permit
as specified in subsection C.2 above. This certificate will specify that the
use of land conforms to the requirements of this section. Any use, arrangement,
or construction at variance with that authorized by permit shall be deemed a
violation of this section and shall be punishable as provided in subsection
B.2.
      5.   Variances: Variances may only be granted in accordance with §
462.357 and are subject to the following:
         a.   A variance may not circumvent the general purposes and intent of
this section; and
         b.   For properties with existing sewage treatment systems, a
certificate of compliance, consistent with Minnesota Rules Chapter 7082.0700
Subp. 3, is required for variance approval. A sewage treatment system shall be
considered compliant if the only deficiency is the system's improper setback
from the ordinary high water level.
      6.   Conditional Uses: All conditional uses in the shoreland area are
subject to a thorough evaluation of the waterbody and the topographic,
vegetation, and soil conditions to ensure:
         a.   The prevention of soil erosion or other possible pollution of
public waters, both during and after construction;
         b.   The visibility of structures and other facilities as viewed from
public waters is limited;
         c.   There is adequate water supply and on-site sewage treatment; and
         d.   The types, uses, and numbers of watercraft that the project will
generate are compatible in relation to the suitability of public waters to
safely accommodate these watercrafts.
      7.   Mitigation:
         a.   In evaluating all variances, conditional uses, zoning and
building permit applications, the zoning authority shall require the property
owner to address the following conditions, when related to and proportional to
the impact, to meet the purpose of this section, to protect adjacent
properties, and the public interest:
         (1)   Advanced storm water runoff management treatment;
         (2)   Reducing impervious surfaces;
         (3)   Increasing setbacks from the ordinary high water level;
         (4)   Restoration of wetlands;

restoration;
         (6)   Provisions for the location, design, and use of structures,
sewage treatment systems, water supply systems, watercraft launching and
docking areas, and parking areas; and
         (7)   Other conditions the zoning authority deems necessary.
         b.   In evaluating plans to construct sewage treatment systems, roads,
driveways, structures, or other improvements on steep slopes, conditions to
prevent erosion and to preserve existing vegetation screening of structures,
vehicles, and other facilities as viewed from the surface of public waters
assuming summer, leaf-on vegetation shall be attached to permits.
      8.   Nonconformities:
         a.   All legally established nonconformities as of the date of this
section may continue, but will be managed according to § 462.357 Subd. 1e and
other regulations of this community for alterations and additions; repair after
damage; discontinuance of use; and intensification of use.
         b.   All additions or expansions to the outside dimensions of an
existing nonconforming structure must meet the setback, height, lowest floor
elevations, and other requirements of subsections E to H. Any deviation from
these requirements must be authorized by a variance.
      9.   Notifications To The Department Of Natural Resources:
         a.   All amendments to this shoreland section must be submitted to the
Department of Natural Resources for review and approval for compliance with the
statewide shoreland management rules.
         b.   All notices of public hearings to consider variances, ordinance
amendments, or conditional uses under shoreland management controls must be
sent to the commissioner or the commissioner's designated representative at
least ten (10) days before the hearings. Notices of hearings to consider
proposed subdivisions/plats must include copies of the subdivision/plat.
         c.   All approved ordinance amendments and subdivisions/plats, and
final decisions approving variances or conditional uses under local shoreland
management controls must be sent to the commissioner or the commissioner's
designated representative and postmarked within ten (10) days of final action.
When a variance is approved after the Department of Natural Resources has
formally recommended denial in the hearing record, the notification of the
approved variance shall also include the summary of the public record/testimony
and the findings of facts and conclusions which supported the issuance of the
variance.
         d.   Any request to change the shoreland management classification of
public waters within the City of Rosemount must be sent to the commissioner or
the commissioner's designated representative for approval, and must include a
resolution and supporting data as required by Minnesota Rules, part 6120.3000,
subp.4.
         e.   Any request to reduce the boundaries of shorelands of public
waters within the City of Rosemount must be sent to the commissioner or the
commissioner's designated representative for approval and must include a
resolution and supporting data. The boundaries of shorelands may be reduced
when the shoreland of water bodies with different classifications overlap. In
these cases, the topographic divide between the water bodies shall be used for
adjusting the boundaries.
      10.   Mandatory EAW: An Environmental Assessment Worksheet consistent
with Minnesota Rules, Chapter 4410 must be prepared for projects meeting the
thresholds of Minnesota Rules, part 4410.4300, Subparts 19a, 20a, 25, 27, 28,

         (2)   The use is designed to incorporate topographic and vegetative
screening of parking areas and structures;
         (3)   Uses that require short-term watercraft mooring for patrons must
centralize these facilities and design them to avoid obstructions of navigation
and to be the minimum size necessary to meet the need; and
         (4)   Uses that depend on patrons arriving by watercraft may use signs
and lighting, provided that:
            (a)   Signs placed in or on public waters must only convey
directional information or safety messages and may only be placed by a public
authority or under a permit issued by the county sheriff; and
            (b)   Signs placed within the shore impact zone are:
               (i)   No higher than ten feet (10') above the ground, and no

               (ii)   If illuminated by artificial lights, the lights must be
shielded or directed to prevent illumination across public waters; and
            (c)   Other lighting may be located within the shore impact zone or
over public waters if it is used to illuminate potential safety hazards and is
shielded or otherwise directed to prevent direct illumination across public
waters. This does not preclude use of navigational lights.
         b.   Commercial, industrial, public, and semi-public uses that are not
water-dependent must be located on lots or parcels without public waters
frontage, or, if located on lots or parcels with public waters frontage, must
either be set back double the ordinary high water level setback or be
substantially screened from view from the water by vegetation or topography,
assuming summer, leaf-on conditions.
      2.   Agriculture Use Standards:
         a.   Buffers:
         (1)   The shore impact zone for parcels with permitted agricultural
land uses is equal to a line parallel to and fifty feet (50') from the ordinary
high water level.
         (2)   General cultivation farming, grazing, nurseries, horticulture,
truck farming, sod farming, and wild crop harvesting are permitted uses if
steep slopes and shore and bluff impact zones are maintained in perennial
vegetation or operated under an approved conservation plan with the field
office technical guides of the local soil and water conservation district or
the Natural Resource Conservation Service, and as approved by the local soil
and water conservation district.
         b.   New animal feedlots are not allowed in shoreland. Modifications
or expansions to existing feedlots or resumption of old feedlots are
conditional uses and must meet the following standards:
         (1)   Feedlots must be designed consistent with Minnesota Rules,
Chapter 7020;
         (2)   Feedlots must not further encroach into the existing ordinary
high water level setback or the bluff impact zone and must not expand to a
capacity of one thousand (1,000) animal units or more; and
         (3)   Old feedlots not currently in operation may resume operation
consistent with Minn. Stat. § 116.0711.
      3.   Forest Management Standards:

minimum lot size standards of subsection F.2 above is allowed if the standards
in this Section are met.
      3.   Processing of PUDs: Planned unit developments must be processed as a
conditional use. An expansion to an existing commercial PUD involving six (6)
or less new dwelling units or sites since the date this article was adopted is
permissible as a permitted use provided the total project density does not
exceed the allowable densities calculated in the project density evaluation
procedures in subsection J.5 below. Approval cannot occur until all applicable
environmental reviews are complete.
      4.   Application For A PUD: The applicant for a PUD must submit the
following documents prior to final action on the application request:
         a.   Site plan and/or plat showing:

designed and will function.
      5.   Density Determination: Proposed new or expansions to existing
planned unit developments must be evaluated using the following procedures.
         a.   Step 1. Identify Density Analysis Tiers: Divide the project
parcel into tiers by drawing one (1) or more lines parallel to the ordinary
high water level at the following intervals, proceeding landward:
 
Waterbody Classification                    No Sewer (ft) Sewer (ft)
General Development Lakes - 1st tier        200           200
General Development Lakes - all other tiers 267           200
Recreational Development Lakes              267           267
Natural Environment Lakes                   400           320
All Rivers                                  300           300
 
         b.   Step 2. Calculate Suitable Area For Development: Calculate the
suitable area within each tier by excluding all wetlands, bluffs, or land below
the ordinary high water level of public waters.
         c.   Step 3. Determine Base Density:
         (1)   For residential PUDs, divide the suitable area within each tier
by the minimum single residential lot area for lakes to determine the allowable
number of dwelling units, or base density, for each tier. For rivers, if a
minimum lot area is not specified, divide the tier width or river frontage by
the minimum single residential lot width.
         (2)   For commercial PUDs:
            (a)   Determine the average area for each dwelling unit or dwelling
site within each tier. Include both existing and proposed dwelling units and
sites in the calculation.
               (i)   For dwelling units, determine the average inside living
floor area of dwelling units in each tier. Do not include decks, patios,
garages, or porches and basements, unless they are habitable space.
               (ii)   For dwelling sites (campgrounds), determine the area of
each dwelling site as follows:
               For manufactured homes, use the area of the manufactured home,
if known, otherwise use one thousand (1,000) sf. For recreational vehicles,
campers or tents, use four hundred (400) sf.
            (b)   Select the appropriate floor area/dwelling site area ratio
from the following table for the floor area or dwelling site area determined in
subsection J.5.c.(2)(a) below.

tier calculated in subsection J.5.c.(2)(c) by the average inside living floor
area for dwelling units or dwelling site area determined in J.5.c.(2)(a) This
yields the allowable number of dwelling units or dwelling sites, or base
density, for each tier.
         (3)   Allowable densities may be transferred from any tier to any
other tier further from the waterbody, but must not be transferred to any tier
closer to the waterbody.
         (4)   All PUDs with densities at or below the base density must meet
the design standards in subsection J.6
         d.   Step 4. Determine If The Site Can Accommodate Increased Density:

   D.   MRCCA Districts:
      1.   Purpose: The purpose of this subsection is to establish districts
under which building height and structure placement are regulated to protect
and enhance the Mississippi River's resources and features consistent with the
natural and built character of each district.
      2.   District Description And Management Purpose: The MRCCA within the
city is divided into the following MRCCA Districts:
         a.   Rural And Open Space (ROS):
         (1)   Description: The ROS District is characterized by rural and low-
density development patterns and land uses, and includes land that is riparian
or visible from the river, as well as large, undeveloped tracts of high
ecological and scenic value, floodplain, and undeveloped islands. Many primary
conservation areas exist in the district.
         (2)   Management Purpose: The ROS District must be managed to sustain
and restore the rural and natural character of the corridor and to protect and
enhance habitat, parks and open space, public river corridor views, and scenic,
natural, and historic areas.
         b.   Separated From River (SR):
         (1)   Description: The SR District is characterized by its physical
and visual distance from the Mississippi River. The district includes land
separated from the river by distance, topography, development, or a
transportation corridor. The land in this district is not readily visible from
the Mississippi River.
         (2)   Management Purpose: The SR district provides flexibility in
managing development without negatively affecting the key resources and
features of the river corridor. Minimizing negative impacts to primary
conservation areas and minimizing erosion and flow of untreated storm water
into the Mississippi River are priorities in the district.
         c.   Urban Mixed (UM):
         (1)   Description: The UM District includes large areas of highly
urbanized mixed use that are a part of the urban fabric of the river corridor,
including institutional, commercial, industrial, and residential areas and
parks and open space.
         (2)   Management Purpose: The UM District must be managed in a manner
that allows for future growth and potential transition of intensely developed
areas that does not negatively affect public river corridor views and that
protects bluffs and floodplains. Restoring and enhancing bluff and shoreline
habitat, minimizing erosion and flow of untreated storm water into the river,
and providing public access to and public views of the river are priorities in
the district.
      3.   MRCCA District Map: The locations and boundaries of the MRCCA
districts established by this section are shown on the official zoning map
which is incorporated herein by reference. The district boundary lines are
intended to follow the centerlines of rivers and streams, highways, streets,
lot lines, and municipal boundaries, unless a boundary line is otherwise
indicated on the map. Where district boundaries cross unsubdivided property,
the district boundary line is determined by use of dimensions or the scale
appearing on the map.
   E.   Special Land Use Provisions:
      1.   Purpose: To identify development standards and considerations for
land uses that have potential to negatively impact primary conservation areas
and public river corridor views.
      2.   Underlying Zoning: Uses within the MRCCA are generally determined by

      1.   Purpose: To establish design standards for public facilities that
are consistent with best management practices and that minimize impacts to
primary conservation areas, public river corridor views and other resources
identified in the MRCCA plan. Public facilities serve the public interest by
providing public access to the Mississippi River corridor or require locations
in or adjacent to the river corridor and therefore require some degree of
flexibility.
      2.   General Design Standards: All public facilities must be designed and
constructed to:
         a.   Minimize visibility of the facility from the river to the extent
consistent with the purpose of the facility;

subsection J below and the land alteration and storm water management standards
in subsection K below, including use of practices identified in Best Practices
for Meeting DNR General Public Waters Work Permit GP 2004-0001, where
applicable;
         d.   Avoid primary conservation areas, unless no alternative exists.
If no alternative exists, then disturbance to primary conservation areas must
be avoided to the greatest extent practicable, and design and construction must
minimize impacts; and
         e.   Minimize disturbance of spawning and nesting times by scheduling
construction at times when local fish and wildlife are not spawning or nesting.
      3.   Right-of-way Maintenance Standards: Right-of-way maintenance must
comply with the following standards:
         a.   Vegetation currently in a natural state must be maintained to the
extent feasible;
         b.   Where vegetation in a natural state has been removed, native
plants must be planted and maintained on the right-of-way; and
         c.   Chemical control of vegetation must be avoided when practicable,
but when chemical control is necessary, chemicals used must be in accordance
with the regulations and other requirements of all state and federal agencies
with authority over the chemical's use.
      4.   Crossings Of Public Water Or Public Land. Crossings of public waters
or land controlled by the commissioner are subject to approval by the
commissioner according to Minn. Stat. §§ 84.415 and 103G.245.
      5.   Public Utilities: Public utilities must comply with the following
standards:
         a.   High-voltage transmission lines, wind energy conversion systems
greater than five (5) megawatts, and pipelines are regulated according to Minn.
Stat. Chapter 216E, 216F, and 216G respectively; and
         b.   If overhead placement is necessary, utility facility crossings
must minimize visibility of the facility from the river as much as practicable.
         c.   The appearance of structures must be as compatible as practicable
with the surrounding area in a natural state with regard to height and width,
materials used, and color.
         d.   Wireless communication facilities, according to subsection F.2.f
above.
      6.   Public Transportation Facilities: Public transportation facilities
shall comply with structure placement and height standards in subsection G
above. Where such facilities intersect or abut two (2) or more MRCCA districts,
the least restrictive standards apply. Public transportation facilities must be
designed and constructed to give priority to:
         a.   Providing scenic overlooks for motorists, bicyclists, and
pedestrians;
         b.   Providing safe pedestrian crossings and facilities along the
river corridor;
         c.   Providing access to the riverfront in public ownership; and
         d.   Allowing for use of the land between the river and the
transportation facility.
      7.   Public Recreational Facilities: Public recreational facilities must
comply with the following standards:
         a.   Buildings and parking associated with pubic recreational
facilities must comply with the structure placement and height standards in
subsection G above except as provided in subsection M below;
         b.   Roads and driveways associated with public recreational
facilities must not be placed in the bluff or shore impact zones unless no
other placement alternative exists. If no alternative exists, then design and
construction must minimize impacts to shoreline vegetation, erodible soils and
slopes, and other sensitive resources.

   K.   Subdivision And Land Development Standards:
      1.   Purpose:
         a.   To protect and enhance the natural and scenic values of the MRCCA
during development or redevelopment of the remaining large sites;
         b.   To establish standards for protecting and restoring biological
and ecological functions of primary conservation areas on large sites; and
         c.   To encourage restoration of natural vegetation during development
or redevelopment of large sites where restoration opportunities have been
identified in MRCCA Plans.
      2.   Applicability:
         a.   The design standards in this section apply to subdivisions,
planned unit developments and master- planned development and redevelopment of
land involving ten or more acres for contiguous parcels that abut the
Mississippi River and twenty (20) or more acres for all other parcels,
including smaller individual sites within the following developments that are
part of a common plan of development that may be constructed at different
times:
         (1)   Subdivisions;
         (2)   Planned unit developments; and
         (3)   Master-planned development and redevelopment of land.
         b.   The following activities are exempt from the requirements of this
section:
         (1)   Minor subdivisions consisting of three or fewer lots;
         (2)   Minor boundary line corrections;
         (3)   Resolutions of encroachments;
         (4)   Additions to existing lots of record;
         (5)   Placement of essential services; and
         (6)   Activities involving river-dependent commercial and industrial
uses.
      3.   Application Materials: Project information listed in subsection D.6
above must be submitted for all proposed developments.
      4.   Design Standards:
         a.   Primary conservation areas, where they exist, must be set aside
and designated as protected open space in quantities meeting the following as a
percentage of total parcel area:
         (1)   CA-ROS District: Fifty percent (50%);
         (2)   CA-UM District: Ten percent (10%); and
         (3)   CA-SR District: Ten percent (10%) if the parcel includes native
plant communities or provides feasible connections to a regional park or trail
system, otherwise no requirement.
         b.   If the primary conservation areas exceed the amounts specified in
subsection L.4.a above, then protection of native plant communities and natural
vegetation in riparian areas shall be prioritized.
         c.   If primary conservation areas exist but do not have natural
vegetation (identified as restoration priorities in the MRCCA Plan), then a
vegetation assessment must be completed to evaluate the unvegetated primary
conservation areas and determine whether vegetation restoration is needed. If
restoration is needed, vegetation must be restored according to subsection
J.6.b above.
         d.   If primary conservation areas do not exist on the parcel and
portions of the parcel have been identified in the MRCCA plan as a restoration
area, vegetation must be restored in the identified areas according to
subsection J.6.b above and the area must be set aside and designated as
protected open space.
         e.   Storm water treatment areas or other green infrastructure may be
used to meet the protected open space requirements if the vegetation provides
biological and ecological functions.
         f.   Land dedicated under section 12-2-6, Park Dedication, for public
river access, parks, or other open space or public facilities may be counted
toward the protected open space requirement.
         g.   Protected open space areas must connect open space, natural
areas, and recreational areas, where present on adjacent parcels, as much as
possible to form an interconnected network.
      5.   Alternative Design Standards:

Planned Unit Development (PUD). With using a PUD, the city will consider
deviation from minimum lot sizes and lot dimension standards. Use of a PUD
within the MRCCA boundary shall include the following:
         (1)   A demonstrated protection and restoration of continuous
vegetation - preventing the fragmentation of vegetation and habitat by
individual lots, especially along the river and natural drainage areas and
protecting it as common open space.
         (2)   Protection of open space, particularly primary conservation
areas, beyond the minimum identified in 4.a.
      6.   Permanent Protection Of Designated Open Space:
         a.   Designated open space areas must be protected through one or more
of the following methods:

chapter 84C;
         (3)   A deed restriction; and
         (4)   Other arrangements that achieve an equivalent degree of
protection.
         b.   Permanent protection methods must ensure the long-term management
of vegetation to meet its biological and ecological functions, prohibit
structures, and prohibit land alteration, except as needed to provide public
recreational facilities and access to the river.
   L.   Exemptions:
      1.   Purpose: To provide exemptions to structure placement, height and
other standards for specific river or water access dependent facilities as
provided in Minn. Stat. § 116G.15 Subd. 4.

11-5-5: PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD) DISTRICT:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of the planned unit development (PUD) district is
to provide a district that will encourage the following:
      1.   Flexibility in land development and redevelopment in order to
utilize new techniques of building design and construction, and site design
including clustering of buildings and land uses.
      2.   Provision of life cycle housing to all income and age groups.
      3.   Energy conservation through the use of more efficient building
design and siting and the clustering of buildings and land uses.
      4.   Preservation of desirable site characteristics and open space and
protection of sensitive environmental features, including, but not limited to,
steep slopes, trees and poor soils.
      5.   More efficient and effective use of land, open space and public
facilities through mixing of land uses and assembly and development of land
into larger parcels.
      6.   High quality of design and design compatible with surrounding land
uses, including both existing and planned.
      7.   Sensitive development in transitional areas located between
different land uses and along significant transportation or scenic corridors
within the city.
      8.   Development that is consistent with the comprehensive plan.
   B.   Development Standards: Within the PUD district, all development shall
be in compliance with the following:
      1.   Area: Each PUD shall have a minimum area of two (2) acres, excluding
wetlands, land lying below the ordinary high water level of any lake, land
within a floodway, and existing rights-of-way, unless the applicant can
demonstrate the existence of one of the following:
         a.   Unusual physical features of the property itself or of the
surrounding neighborhood such that development as a PUD will conserve a
physical or topographic feature of importance to the neighborhood or community.
         b.   The property is directly adjacent to or across the right-of- way
from property which has been developed previously as a PUD and will appear as
and will function as an extension of that previously approved development.
         c.   The property is located in a transitional area between different
land use categories or on a collector or arterial (minor or principal) street,
as defined in the comprehensive plan.
      2.   Uses: For a given PUD, all uses shall be consistent with the
comprehensive plan and the master development plan as approved.
         a.   Area Used For Land Uses: The city may permit up to ten percent
(10%) of the gross floor area of all buildings in a PUD to be used for land
uses for which the site is not designated in the comprehensive plan if the city
council finds that such use is in the best interests of the city and is
consistent with the requirements of this chapter. If non-designated uses are to
be incorporated into a PUD, the city may forward a copy of the request to the
metropolitan council for review.
         b.   Designated For Multiple Land Uses: Where the site of a proposed
PUD is designated for more than one land use in the comprehensive plan, the
city may require that the PUD include all the proposed land uses.
         c.   Single Land Use Or Housing Type: Any PUD which involves a single
land use type or housing type may be permitted; provided, that it is otherwise
consistent with the objectives of this title and the comprehensive plan.
      3.   Density:
         a.   Each residential PUD or the residential portion of each mixed-use
PUD shall have a density within the range specified in the comprehensive plan
for the PUD site.
         b.   The density of individual buildings or lots within a PUD may
exceed these standards, provided the density for the entire PUD does not exceed
the permitted standards.
         c.   If the site is not designated in the comprehensive plan for
residential use, the appropriate density shall be determined by the city based
upon the city council's finding that such density is consistent with the intent
of the PUD and of the comprehensive plan.
      4.   Application Of Title Provisions: The requirements contained in this
title shall apply to a PUD as deemed appropriate by the city. The regulations
of the most closely related base zoning district shall be considered
presumptively appropriate, but may be departed from in order to accomplish the
purposes of this section.
         a.   Buildings Per Lot: The city may permit more than one building to
be placed on one platted or recorded lot in a PUD as long as the buildings are
separated by at least twelve (12) feet.
         b.   Setbacks, Buffers, And Greenspace: Setback, buffers, and
greenspace within a PUD shall be consistent with applicable sections of this
title and title 12 "Subdivision Regulations" of this code unless the developer
can demonstrate to the city's satisfaction that a lesser standard should be
permitted with the addition of a screening treatment or other mitigative
measures.
         c.   Private Recreational Uses: Each residential PUD comprised of
units other than single-unit detached housing or within a mixed-use PUD shall
provide an area dedicated for private recreational uses for project residents.
Such areas will be for active or passive recreational uses suited for the needs
of the residents of the project, including, but not limited to, swimming pools,
trails, nature areas, picnic areas, tot lots and saunas.
         d.   Streets, Utilities, Public Facilities And Subdivisions: The city
ordinances governing the specifications and standards for streets, utilities,
public facilities and subdivisions may be modified based upon the unique
characteristics of the PUD. The city council may therefore approve streets,
utilities, public facilities, and land subdivisions that are not in compliance
with usual specifications or ordinance requirements if it finds that strict
adherence to such standards or requirements is not required to meet the intent
of this chapter or to protect the health, safety, or welfare of the residents
of the PUD, the surrounding area, or the city as a whole.
         e.   Parking: Parking provided for uses within a PUD shall be
consistent with the parking requirements contained in section
11-7-3 "Off-street Parking and Loading Standards" of this title, unless the
developer can demonstrate to the city's satisfaction that a lesser standard
should be permitted on the grounds of complementary peak parking demands by the
uses within the PUD. The city may require execution of a restrictive covenant
limiting future use of the property to those uses that will continue the
complementary peak parking demands or a proof of parking agreement.
         f.   Architectural And Landscape Design: The applicant shall
demonstrate that the architectural and landscape design proposed for all
residential PUDs or the residential portion of a mixed-use PUD will provide
privacy for both internal and exterior living areas. This provision shall
include, but not be limited to, landscape and fence screens, location of HVAC
equipment, and location of structures relative to adjacent homes. Deviations
from approved plans must be approved by both the City Council.
         g.   Signs: Signs shall be restricted to those permitted under chapter
8, "Signage", of this title or in a sign plan approved by the city regulated by
permanent covenants.
      5.   Covenants: All applicants for a PUD shall establish an association
or similar framework approved by the city to oversee the maintenance of
commonly held properties and review of architectural modifications to the
approved plans.
      6.   Unified Ownership Or Control: All property to be included within a
PUD shall be under unified ownership or control or subject to such legal
restrictions or covenants as may be necessary to ensure compliance with the
approved master development plan and final site and building plan. (Ord. 2024-

      20.   Accessory Structures: One freestanding accessory structure or
storage shed per manufactured home may be permitted in addition to above
mentioned carports or garages. All accessory structures shall conform to
applicable building codes. Said structures shall be limited to one hundred
twenty (120) square feet in size.
      21.   Manufactured Home Park Closings:
         a.   Purpose And Intent: In view of the peculiar nature and problems
associated with the closure or conversion of manufactured home parks, the city
council finds that the public health, safety and general welfare will be
promoted by requiring compensation to displaced homeowners and tenants of such
parks. The purpose of this section is to define by whom and in what amount
compensation for the park relocation or displacement of a manufactured home is
paid. This section is adopted pursuant to the authority granted under Minn.
Stat. § 327C.095. The relocation costs stated in this section are intended to
be considered along with all other compensation eligible to the displaced
residents. If the park closing falls under the federal uniform relocation act,
the park owner will not be required to reimburse residents' expenses reimbursed
under that act.
         b.   Notice Of Closing: If the manufactured home park is to be sold
with the intent to convert in whole or in part to another use or the owner of
the park requests and receives rezoning of the property from the city, the park
owner shall, at least nine (9) months prior to conversion to another use or
sale to someone with the intent to convert to another use, provide a copy of a
closure statement to a resident or each manufactured home and to the city
community development department.
         c.   Notice Of Public Hearing: The community development department
shall schedule a public hearing with the city council. The community
development department shall mail a notice at least ten (10) days prior to the
public hearing to a resident of each manufactured home in the park stating the
time, place and purpose of the hearing. The park owner shall provide the city
with a list of the names and addresses of at least one resident of each
manufactured home in the park at the time the closure statement is submitted to
the community development department.
         d.   Public Hearing: A public hearing shall be held before the city
council for the purpose of reviewing the closure statement and evaluating what
impact the park closing may have on displaced residents and the park owner. At
the public hearing, the city council will take testimony regarding the
reasonableness of the maximum relocation costs to be paid by the park owner and
the actual costs to relocate park residents. Based on the testimony, the city
council, at its discretion, may adopt an ordinance increasing or decreasing the

         e.   Conditions Of Closing:
         (1)   As a condition of the closing of the manufactured home park, the
park owner shall pay the relocation costs to the contractors providing the
relocation services and/or to displaced residents. If the park owner determines
within four (4) months prior to the date of closure of the park that the park
will not be closed, the park owner may rescind the notice of closure and shall
pay any actual relocation costs incurred by any of the park's manufactured home
owners. If the park owner determines at least four (4) months prior to the date
of closure of the park that the park will not be closed, the park owner may
rescind the notice of closure, and not be liable for any relocation costs.
         (2)   Each displaced resident is eligible for an equal share of the
maximum total compensation as described in provision (1) within this
subsection. If a displaced resident's relocation cost is less than their equal
share, then the difference between the equal share and the actual relocation
costs of that household is equally distributed to the displaced residents who
have relocation costs in excess of their equal share.
         (3)   The city shall not issue a building permit in conjunction with
the reuse of the manufactured home park property unless the park owner has paid
the relocation costs and/or the park purchaser has compensated displaced
residents in accordance with the requirements of this section. Approval of any
application for rezoning, platting, conditional use permit, planned unit
development or variance in conjunction with a park closing or conversion shall
be conditional on compliance with the requirements of this section.
         f.   Displaced Resident Statement: Within ninety (90) days of receipt
of a closure notice, the displaced resident shall provide the park owner with a
written statement of relocation costs, or in the alternative, a written
statement that the resident cannot relocate his or her manufactured home to
another manufactured home park within a twenty-five (25)-mile radius. If a
resident determines not to relocate as defined within this section, the
resident must state whether he or she elects to receive relocation costs under
provisions g and j of this subsection.
         g.   Election To Relocate:
         (1)   If a manufactured home can be relocated to another manufactured
home park within a twenty-five (25)-mile radius, the park owner shall pay
displaced residents' "relocation costs" as defined herein.
         (2)   The park owner shall make relocation payments directly to
contractors providing the relocation service, or the displaced resident may
choose to be reimbursed by the park owner after the resident submits to the
park owner proof of payment of relocation costs. The park owner shall be
entitled to receive adequate documentation of relocation costs, including costs
of proposals, invoices, estimates and contacts for relocation services.
         (3)   If a displaced resident cannot relocate the manufactured home
within a twenty-five (25)-mile radius of the park which is being closed or some
other agreed upon distance, and the resident elects not to tender title to the
manufactured home, the resident is entitled to relocation costs based upon an
average of relocation costs awarded to other residents in the park.
         (4)   A displaced resident compensated under this section shall retain
title to the manufactured home and shall be responsible for its prompt removal
from the manufactured home park. All rent due and owing to the park owner, and
all property taxes for the current and prior years shall be paid by the
displaced resident prior to removing the manufactured home from the park.
         h.   Election To Receive Compensation: If a resident cannot relocate
his or her manufactured home to another manufactured home park within a twenty-
five (25)-mile radius or some other agreed upon distance and tenders title to
the manufactured home, the resident is entitled to compensation to be paid by
the purchaser of the park in order to mitigate the adverse financial impact of
the park closing. In such instance, the compensation shall be an amount equal
to the estimated market value of the manufactured home as determined by an
independent appraiser experienced in manufactured home appraisal, or the tax
assessed value of the manufactured home for the year in which the park is
scheduled to close, whichever is greater. The appraisal shall be conducted only
after it is determined that the manufactured home cannot be relocated to
another park within twenty-five (25) miles. The purchaser shall pay the cost of
the appraisal. The resident shall transfer title of the manufactured home to
the park purchaser free and clear of all liens and encumbrances. All rent due
the property owner and all property taxes for the current and prior years shall
be paid by displaced residents prior to the removal of the manufactured home
from the park by the park purchaser.
         i.   Limitation Of Relocation Costs And Compensation: Subject to
provision d of this subsection, the total amount of compensation paid to
displaced owners of manufactured homes shall not exceed the greater of twenty-
five percent (25%) of the county assessor's estimated market value of the
manufactured home park, as determined by the county assessor for the year in
which the park is scheduled to close, or twenty-five (25%) of the purchase
price of the park. At the public hearing of the park closure, the city council
will take testimony regarding the reasonableness of the maximum relocation
costs to be paid by the park owner and the actual costs to relocate park
residents. Based on the testimony, the city council, at its discretion, may
adopt an ordinance increasing or decreasing the maximum total relocation costs.

this ultimate use and allow for orderly development, the permittee shall
provide an end use grading plan that can reasonably accommodate urban
development. For mining operations that are expected to require more than
twenty (20) years to complete, the city council may approve an end use grading
plan for the area that is expected to be completed within twenty (20) years.
The city council shall not approve an annual operating permit for an area
without an approved end use grading plan.
         g.   Removal Of Buildings, Structures, And Vehicles: Within eighteen
(18) months of the reclamation of each phase, all buildings, structures and
plants incidental to that phase of operation shall be dismantled and removed by
and at the expense of the sand and gravel producer last operating the building,
structure or plant, or the owner of the property, unless the structure or use
is compatible with the anticipated ultimate use of the property. All buildings,
structures or plants not removed as required by this section may be removed by
the city with the costs for the removal charged to the permittee or the owner
of the property.

operation may extend for years or decades to complete. The purpose of the
operating permit is to provide an opportunity for the city council to review
the operation of the mine, gather public comment on the operation, modify any
permit conditions as necessary to address adverse impacts that arise from the
operation, and revise the phases and/or subphases of the mine. The large-scale
mineral extraction interim use permit provides a zoning basis for the mine
provided the city issues an operating permit.
         b.   Application, Public Hearing, Notice And Procedure: The
application, public hearing, public notice and procedure requirements for
operating permit shall be the same as those for amendments as provided in
section
11-9-2 Zoning Code Amendment of this title, except that the permit may be
issued only on the affirmative vote of a majority of the entire city council.

permit shall run for two (2) years from January 1 through December 31 of the
next year or for a lesser period of time as the city council may specify at the
time of issuance of the extraction permit. If the extraction permit is to run
for less than two (2) full years, the fee shall be prorated as determined by
the city council. An administrative review of the permit will be completed mid-
way through the two (2)-year period.
         e.   Operating Permit Fee: The fee for large scale mineral extraction
permit shall be as established from time to time by resolution of the city
council.

where a large-scale mineral extraction permit has been issued. The operator or
owner of any large-scale mineral extraction operation found in violation of the
requirements of this title or its extraction permit shall remedy such
violations within the time specified by written notice from the city.
         g.   Financial Surety: The city council shall require the applicant or
owner of the premises on which the excavation operation is located to post a
surety with a surety acceptable to the city, cash escrow, performance bond or
letter of credit ("security") in an amount and source determined by the city
council, in favor of the city, conditioned to pay the city the costs and
expense of repairing any streets where such repair work is made necessary by
the special burden resulting from hauling and travel, and removing material
from any pit or excavation, and conducting required rehabilitation and
conditioned further to comply with all the requirements of this section and the
particular extraction permit, and to pay any expense the city may incur by
reason of doing anything required to be done by any applicant to whom a permit
is issued. The security shall remain in full force and effect for a minimum
period of one (1) year after expiration of the extraction permit to guarantee
the required rehabilitation as well as the other requirements herein provided.
The surety bond will be based on the number of acres requested within the
annual renewal extraction permit, the amount of acres that have not been
reclaimed to the end use grading plan elevations, and an amount that can be
immediately withdrawn for the special burden of street repair or to replace
insufficient landscaping. Surety for unfulfilled rehabilitation measures will
be determined and a security will be required as long as the rehabilitation
measures are not completed.
         h.   Insurance: The permittee shall maintain general liability
insurance and provide the city annually a certificate of general liability
insurance issued by insurers duly licensed within the state of Minnesota. The
city council shall determine the appropriate amount of liability insurance
every two (2) years during its review of the permit renewal.

constructed initially if it is demonstrated by the owner to be in excess of the
real parking demand. Future parking sufficient in quantity to meet the
ordinance requirement shall be shown on the official site plan for which a
building permit request is made and said parking shall be constructed at the
discretion of the city if it proves to be needed later.
         (3)   Central Business District: Uses constructed in the MX-1 District

operating hours do not overlap, the board of appeals and adjustments may grant
an exception to allow the total parking required to be reduced below the sum
total of the individual uses provided a copy of an agreement between joint
users is filed with the application.

         c.   Heritage tree removal may occur only when there is not a
practical alternative, such as the alignment of a collector or arterial street
or the installation of a trunk utility corridor. There is a zero percent (0%)
removal threshold on heritage trees, meaning every caliper inch of heritage
tree removed will require replacement in accordance with the standards of
subsection I below.
      2.   Significant Tree Removal For Developments:
         a.   Applicant shall retain the maximum amount of significant trees

one-half (0.5) caliper inch per one caliper inch removed.
         b.   For each heritage tree removed by the developer, all heritage
trees shall be replaced at the ratio of one caliper inch per one caliper inch
removed.
      2.   Size, Types, And Diversification Of Replacement Trees: Replacement
trees shall be of a similar species to those that are removed, but also shall
be a minimum of twenty-five percent (25%) conifers and twenty-five percent
(25%) deciduous hardwoods. Required heritage tree replacement must be of the
same species as the heritage tree removed. Replacement trees must be no less
than the following sizes:

      4.   Other Replacement Tree Requirements: Choice of replacement trees
species and location of the trees should also be contingent on the following
information:
         a.   Soil Composition: Comparisons should be made between soil
conditions and the ecology of the proposed species to make sure they are
compatible.
         b.   Spatial Requirements: The potential height and crown spread of
the proposed replacement trees should be known. Usually, half of the adult tree
crown diameter is the amount of distance a tree should be planted from any
aboveground objects.
         c.   Diseases And Insect Problems: Appropriate replacement choices
shall also consider insect and disease problems that may be common with
particular species in the part of the state in which the City of Rosemount is
located.
      5.   Fee In Lieu Of Tree Replacement Or Replacement Trees Planted In
Public Areas: The city recognizes that there may be instances where the total
amount of tree replacement required cannot occur on site or that there are some
land uses (such as refining) that are not compatible with trees. In those
instances, the city may, at its option, accept a fee in lieu of tree placement
or allow the planting of replacement trees in public areas. Tree replacement is
encouraged to happen on site as much as possible and fee in lieu of tree
replacement should be used only when replacement cannot occur on site. The fee
in lieu of tree replacement will be determined annually by the City Council
through the City fee schedule. (Ord. 2024-04, 6-4-2024)

use or zone, dynamic signs shall be oriented so that no portion of the sign
face is visible from the residential use or zoning district.
      4.   Mode: Dynamic signs shall only be allowed to operate in a static
mode. Animation, motion or video displays are prohibited. Any change from one
static display to another must be instantaneous and shall not include any
distracting effects, such as dissolving, spinning or fading. The images and
messages displayed must be complete in themselves, without continuation in
content to the next image or message or to any other sign.
      5.   Size Of Dynamic Display:
         a.   The dynamic display portion of any sign shall not exceed thirty

conform to the luminance levels noted above and these settings are protected
from end users' manipulation by password protected software.
      8.   Color: The use of color shall not create distraction or a hazard to
the public health, safety or welfare.
      9.   Operation: Dynamic signs shall be equipped with a means to
immediately discontinue the display if it malfunctions. The owner of a dynamic
sign must immediately cease operation of their sign when notified by the city
that it fails to comply with the standards of this chapter. The dynamic sign

that the device is in satisfactory working condition and conforms to the
standards of this chapter. Appeals of the city's direction regarding the
operation of a dynamic sign shall follow the appeals process outlined in
section 11-9-7, "Appeals", of this title.
   B.   Application To Existing Signs: The dynamic sign standards shall apply
to all existing and future dynamic signs, unless otherwise determined by the

information must be provided for the application to be deemed complete within
fifteen (15) business days of the date of submission.
   D.   Review Process:
      1.   Prior to filing a formal site plan application, applicants may
present a concept plan to the city. The Zoning Administrator shall have the
authority to refer said plan to the planning commission and/or city council for
discussion, review, and informal comment. Any opinions or comments provided to
the applicant regarding a concept site plan application are to be considered
advisory only and shall not constitute a binding decision on the request.
      2.   Subsequent to any concept plan review, an applicant may present a
formal site plan application to the city.
      3.   The Zoning Administrator shall have the authority to require the
applicant to hold a neighborhood meeting to inform nearby property owners of
the request. If required, this meeting shall take place following the submittal
of the formal application to the city but before notices for the public hearing
are published.
      4.   The Zoning Administrator shall refer all formal site plan
applications to the planning commission. The commission shall hold a public
hearing to review the formal site plan application and act on said application
in accordance with subsection C above of this section or applicable state
statute.
   E.   Public Hearing:
      1.   Unless exempted by this section, no site plan shall be considered
until a public hearing has been held by the commission.
      2.   A notice of the time, place and purpose of the hearing shall be
published in the city's official newspaper, at least ten (10) days prior to the
hearing.
      3.   Notices shall be mailed to each property owner within five hundred
(500) feet of the affected property, except when located in A-1, A-2, and RR
districts in which case notice shall be mailed to each property owner within
one-fourth (1/4) mile of the affected property. The city shall use its best
available records to determine the names and addresses of property owners to

the notice shall not invalidate the proceedings, provided a bona fide attempt
was made to comply with these provisions.
      5.   During the public hearing city staff shall present their findings
with regard to the site plan application.
   F.   Review Standards: The Zoning Administrator shall review each
application for site plan review for compliance with the performance standards
contained in the comprehensive plan, this title and other applicable city codes
and policies. These standards may include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      1.   Land use designations and zoning districts.
      2.   Access, parking and loading.
      3.   Exterior building materials.
      4.   Trash enclosure.
      5.   Landscaping and berming.
      6.   Signage.

construct, enlarge, repair, move, improve, convert, demolish, equip, use,
occupy, or maintain any building, structure, or portion thereof, within the
city of Rosemount until proper permits and/or a certificate of occupancy has
been issued by the protective inspections division of the city. All work for
which a permit has been issued must be completed in accordance with title 9,
"Building Regulations," of this code and applicable federal, state and county
laws, codes and regulations.
      1.   Except as provided for by this section, no building permit shall be
issued until a site plan has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of
this title and approved by the commission. Upon approval of the site plan by
the commission, the building official will be authorized to process a building
permit for the proposed project pursuant to adopted building and fire codes.
The site plan approval process does not imply compliance with the requirements
of said building and fire codes.
   H.   Plan Conformance: Development of the site shall conform to all site and
construction plans officially submitted to and approved by the city. Once
approved, no changes, modifications or alterations shall be made to any plan
detail, standard, or specification without prior submission of a plan
modification request.
   I.   Plan Modifications: Major amendments to an approved site plan may be
approved by the planning commission. The notification, public hearing, and
appeal procedure for such amendments shall be the same as those for the
original site plan review. Any other amendments may be made administratively
when the Zoning Administrator determines that review and approval by the
planning commission of a detailed site and building plan is unnecessary to meet
the purpose and intent of this section. The Zoning Administrator's decision
regarding classification of an amendment is final. When determining if an
amendment is major, the Zoning Administrator may consider their determination
on whether the amendment:
      1.   Substantially alters the location of buildings, parking areas or
vehicle access.
      2.   Increases the total gross floor area of all buildings by more than
five percent (5%) or increases the gross floor area of any individual building
by more than ten percent (10%).
      3.   Increases the number of stories of any building.
      4.   Decreases the amount of open space by more than five percent (5%) or
alters it in such a way as to change its original design or intended use.
      5.   Changes the exterior building materials or color of the building.
      6.   Creates noncompliance with any special condition attached to the
approval of the site plan or applicable provision of this title.
   J.   Term Of Approval: Unless otherwise specified, an approved site plan
shall become null and void one (1) year from the date of approval unless the
property owner or applicant has substantially commenced construction of any
building, structure, addition or alteration, or use requested as part of the
approved plan or unless a petition for a time extension has been granted by the
planning commission. All extension requests shall be submitted in writing to
the community development department at least thirty (30) days prior to
expiration of the site plan and shall state facts showing a good faith effort
to complete work permitted under the original approval.
   K.   Site Improvement Performance Agreement And Financial Guarantee:
Following the approval of a site plan required by this title and prior to
issuance of a building permit, the applicant, if deemed necessary by the
planning commission, shall guarantee to the city the completion of all
improvements as shown on the approved site plan and as required by the site
plan approval. This guarantee shall be made by means of a site performance
agreement and a financial guarantee as provided below.
      1.   The applicant shall execute the site performance agreement on forms
provided by the city. The agreement shall define the required work and reflect
the terms of this section as to the required guarantee of the performance of
the work by the applicant.
      2.   The required work includes, but is not limited to, private exterior
amenities such as landscaping, turf establishment, private driveways, parking
areas, curb and gutter, recreational facilities, wetland buffers, erosion
control, fences and screening, and other similar facilities. The required work
shall also include all aspects of the tree preservation plan, if applicable.
      3.   A financial guarantee shall be submitted with the executed site
performance agreement as provided herein:
         a.   Financial guarantees acceptable to the city include cash escrow,
an irrevocable letter of credit, or other financial instrument that provides
equivalent assurance to the city and that is approved by the Zoning
Administrator.
         b.   The term of the financial guarantee shall be for the life of the
site improvement performance agreement, and it shall be the applicant's
responsibility to ensure that a submitted financial guarantee shall continue in
full force and effect until the Zoning Administrator shall have approved and
accepted all of the work undertaken to be done and shall thereby have released
the guarantee or reduced the amount of the guarantee as provided in this
section.
         c.   When any instrument submitted as a financial guarantee contains
provision for an automatic expiration date, after which the instrument may not
be drawn upon, notwithstanding the status of the site performance agreement or
of the required work, it shall be the applicant's responsibility to notify the
city in writing, by certified mail, at least sixty (60) days in advance of the
expiration date of the intent either to renew or not to renew the instrument.
If the instrument is to be renewed, a written renewal shall be provided at
least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration date. If the instrument is not
to be renewed, and has not been released by the Zoning Administrator, another
acceptable financial guarantee in the appropriate amount shall be submitted at
least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration date. Upon receipt of an
acceptable substitute financial guarantee, the Zoning Administrator may release
the original guarantee.
         d.   The amount of the financial guarantee shall be established by the
Zoning Administrator based upon an itemized estimate of the cost of all
required work as provided by the applicant. A cash escrow or irrevocable letter
of credit shall be in the amount of one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of
the approved estimated cost. The amount of any other approved financial
instrument shall be determined by the Zoning Administrator.
         e.   At the option of the city the applicant may submit a separate
financial guarantee for that portion of the required work consisting solely of
landscaping improvements with another financial guarantee for all other
exterior amenities and improvements that comprise the work. All trees shall be
warrantied to be alive, of good quality, and disease free for twelve (12)
months from the time of planting. Any subsequent replacement shall be
warrantied for twelve (12) months from the time of planting.
      4.   The time allowed for completion of the required improvements shall
be set forth in the site performance agreement. This agreement and the
financial guarantee shall guarantee compensation for the required improvements
and provide for reimbursement to the city of the cost of enforcement measures.
As the applicant completes various portions of such required work, the Zoning
Administrator may release such portion of the financial guarantee as it is
attributable to such completed work. Landscaping improvements shall not be
deemed complete until the city has verified survivability of all required
plantings through one winter season, defined for the purposes of this section
as the period between October 31 and April 30.
      5.   The applicant shall notify the Zoning Administrator in writing when
all or part of the required improvements have been completed in accordance with
the approved plan and may be inspected. Upon receipt of such notice, the Zoning
Administrator shall be responsible for the inspection of the improvements to
determine that the work performed meets the standards of this title and any
conditions imposed by the planning commission and the standards for the
particular industry, profession or material used in the performance of the
work. Any required work failing to meet such standards shall not be deemed
complete and the applicant shall be notified in writing as to required
corrections. Upon determination that required work has been completed,
including the winter season survivability of landscape plantings, notice shall
be given to the applicant of the date of completion and action taken by the
Zoning Administrator to release, or to reduce the amount of, the financial
guarantee.  (Ord. 2024-04, 6-4-2024; amd. Ord. 2025-02, 1-21-2025)

the request. If required, this meeting shall take place following the submittal
of the formal application to the city but before notices for the public hearing
are published.
      4.   Commission Recommendation: An amendment not initiated by the
commission shall be referred to the commission for study and report and may not

   A.   Purpose: The purpose of CUPs is to allow for those uses which are not
generally suitable within the zoning district, but which under some
circumstances may be suitable. The applicant for a CUP shall have the burden of
proof that the use is suitable and that the standards set forth in this chapter
have been met.
   B.   Application, Public Hearing, Notice, And Procedure: The application,
public hearing, notice and procedure requirements for CUPs shall be the same as
those identified in section 11-9-1 of this chapter. CUPs may be granted by
majority vote of the entire council. Specific submissions required to complete
an application for a CUP shall address all standards applicable to the proposed
use. The applicant shall provide information as required in the site plan
review.
   C.   Standards: The commission shall recommend a CUP and the council may
issue such CUP if it finds that such use at the proposed location:
      1.   Will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, or

not create traffic congestion or interfere with traffic on surrounding public
streets.
      7.   Will not result in the destruction, loss or damage of a natural,
scenic, or historic feature of major importance and will comply with all local,
state, and federal environmental quality standards.
      8.   These standards apply in addition to specific conditions as may be
applied throughout this code.
   D.   Conditions: In reviewing applications for CUPs, the Commission and the
Council may attach whatever reasonable conditions they deem necessary to
mitigate anticipated adverse impacts associated with these uses, to protect the
value of other property within the district, and to achieve the goals and
objectives of the comprehensive plan and city code provisions. Such conditions
may include, but are not limited to, the following:
      1.   Controlling the number, area, bulk, height, density, intensity, and
location of such uses.
      2.   Regulating ingress and egress to the property and the proposed
structures thereon with particular reference to vehicle and pedestrian safety
and convenience, traffic flow and control, and access in case of fire or other
catastrophe.

to protecting immediately adjacent properties from objectionable views, noise,
traffic and other negative characteristics associated with such uses.
   E.   Revocation: Failure to comply with any condition set forth in a CUP, or
any other violation of city code provisions, shall also constitute sufficient
cause for the termination of the CUP by the council following a public hearing.
   F.   Expiration:
      1.   In any case where a conditional use has not been established within
one (1) year of the date on which the CUP was granted, the permit shall be null
and void unless a petition for extension is requested in writing and filed with
the Zoning Administrator at least thirty (30) days before the expiration of the
deadline. The extension request shall be sent to the City Council for review
and decision.
      2.   If the conditional use is discontinued for six (6) months, the CUP
shall be null and void.
   G.   Permittee: A CUP shall be issued for a particular use and not for a
particular person. (Ord. 2024-04, 6-4-2024)
11-9-4: INTERIM USE PERMIT (IUP):
   A.   Purpose. The purpose of an IUP is to permit a use which would not be
appropriate generally, but which may be allowed within a certain zoning
district with appropriate restrictions. An IUP is not intended to last
indefinitely, but is meant to have a specific end date for when the use will no
longer be allowed on the property.
   B.   Application, Public Hearing, Notice, And Procedure: The application,
public hearing, public notice and procedure requirements for interim use
permits shall be the same as those for amendments as provided in section 11-9-
2 above of this chapter, except that the permit shall be issued on the
affirmative vote of a majority of the entire council. Specific submissions
required to complete an application for an interim use permit shall be
specified for each type of interim use allowed.
   C.   Standards:
      1.   The interim use must be allowed in the zoning district where the
property is located.
      2.   The interim use must meet or exceed the performance standards set
forth in this title and other applicable city ordinances.

identified in this title, and must comply with all conditions of approval which
shall be included in an IUP agreement.
   D.   Conditions: The city may attach conditions to approval of a permit to
mitigate anticipated adverse impacts associated with the use, to ensure
compliance with the standards of approval, to protect the value of other
property, and to achieve the goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan.
   E.   Findings For Interim Use Permits:
      1.   The extent, location, and intensity of the use will be in
substantial compliance with the comprehensive plan.
      2.   The use will provide adequate ingress and egress to minimize traffic
congestion in the public streets.
      3.   The use will not be detrimental to the existing character of the
development in the immediate neighborhood or endanger the public health,
safety, and general welfare.
      4.   The use will not impede the normal and orderly development and
improvement of the surrounding property for uses permitted in the district.
      5.   The use shall, in all other respects, conform to the applicable
regulations of the district in which it is located.
   F.   Termination: An IUP shall terminate on the happening of any of the
following events, whichever first occurs:
      1.   The date stated in the permit.
      2.   Upon violation of the condition(s) under which the permit was
issued.
      3.   Upon change in the city's zoning regulation which renders the use
nonconforming.
   G.   Modification Of Standards Or Conditions: The council, after public
hearing, may modify standards or conditions required for the IUP, when strict
application of such standards or conditions would unreasonably limit or prevent
otherwise lawful use of a property or an existing structure and would result in
exceptional undue hardship to the owner of such property or structure;
provided, that such modification will not impair the intent and purpose of such
standards or conditions and is consistent with reasonable enjoyment of adjacent
property. (Ord. 2024-04, 6-4-2024)
11-9-5: VARIANCE:
   A.   Purpose: A variance is a modification or variation of the provisions of
this zoning code as applied to a specific piece of property. A variance may be
granted when strict enforcement of the provisions of the zoning code would
cause practical difficulties to the property owner, and when it can be
demonstrated that such action will be in keeping with the spirit and intent of
the code.
   B.   Applications: Applications provided by the city must be completed in

FRINGE:      the floodway.
FLOOD        An official map of a community, on which the Federal Insurance Administrator has
INSURANCE    delineated both the special hazard areas and the risk premium zones applicable to
RATE MAP     the community. A FIRM that has been made available digitally is called a Digital
(FIRM):      Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM).
FLOODPLAIN:  The beds, channel and the areas adjoining a wetland, lake or watercourse, or
             other source which have been or hereafter may be inundated by the base flood.
             The bed of a wetland or lake and the channel of a watercourse and those portions
FLOODWAY:    of the adjoining floodplain which must be reserved to carry or store the base
             flood discharge without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more
             than one-half foot.
             A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent
MANUFACTURED chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when
HOME:        attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include
             the term "recreational vehicle."
             A vehicle that is built on a single chassis, is four hundred (400) square feet or

             propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and is designed primarily
RECREATIONAL not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for
VEHICLE:     recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. Those vehicles not meeting this
             definition shall be considered a structure for the purposes of this title. For
             the purposes of this title, the term recreational vehicle is synonymous with the
             term "travel trailer/travel vehicle."
REGULATORY   An elevation no lower than one foot (1') above the elevation of the base flood
FLOOD        plus any increases in water surface elevation caused by encroachments on the
PROTECTION   floodplain that result from designation of a floodway. These increases in water
ELEVATION    surface elevations are typically identified in the Floodway Data Tables, found in
(RFPE):      the Flood Insurance Study.
             A roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally

             Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a
             structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market
             value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement.
             This term includes structures that have incurred "substantial damage," regardless
             of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either:
SUBSTANTIAL  1.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of
IMPROVEMENT: state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been
             identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum

12-2-1: STREET DESIGN STANDARDS:
   A.   A subdivision shall provide for the continuation or appropriate
projection of existing streets in surrounding areas; or a subdivision shall
conform to a plan for the neighborhood approved, or adopted by the council to
meet a particular situation where topography or other conditions make
continuance or conformance to existing streets impractical.
   B.   Local streets shall be so laid out that their use by through traffic
will be discouraged and so that they will not function as collector streets.
   C.   Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed collector
or arterial street, the city may require such treatment as may be necessary for
adequate protection of residential property and to afford separation of through
and local traffic.
   D.   Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way, or
limited access highway right of way, the city may require a frontage street
approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way, at a distance
suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land. Such distances shall
also be determined with due regard for the requirements of approach grades and
future grade separations.
   E.   Centerline offsets at shall conform with the standards listed within
the Engineering Guidelines.
   F.   Sight easements with tangent distances of twenty-five (25) feet shall
be provided at street intersections or the city may permit property lines at
street intersections to be rounded with a radius deemed necessary.
   G.   Street right of way and widths shall conform with the standards listed
within the Engineering Guidelines.

   A.   Sidewalks shall be required along one side of any local street. Where
possible, the required sidewalk shall be located on the same side of the street
as previously existing sidewalks in the area to ensure continuity and reduce
the need for road crossings.
   B.   Sidewalks, trails, or paved pathways shall be located along both sides
of any collector or arterial street. (Ord. 2024-04, 6-4-2024)
12-2-4: EASEMENT DETAILS:
   A.   Utility and drainage easements abutting public street right-of-way and
centered on rear or side lot lines shall be at least ten (10) feet wide or
wider as may be required by the city.
   B.   Where a subdivision is traversed by a ponding area, watercourse,
ponding or utility easements, drainage, channel, or stream there shall be
provided a drainage easement conforming substantially with the lines of such
watercourse, and such further width or construction, or both, as will be
adequate for the purpose as determined by the city. Said drainage or ponding
easements shall be laid out and located in such a manner as to provide
reasonable access for maintenance and dredging purposes without undue
infringement upon the property over which access is taken.
   C.   Trails or pedestrianways shall be shown as trailways on the plat as
separate easements or recorded at the county as the city may direct.
   D.   When double frontage or reverse frontage lots are incorporated in a
plat, a planting screen easement of at least ten (10) feet in width may be
required along the line of lots abutting a collector street or minor or
principal arterial highways. (Ord. 2024-04, 6-4-2024)
12-2-5: LANDLOCKED PARCELS:
   A.   As a general rule, the city shall not permit landlocked parcels or
parcels that are only served by private easements. However, the city may permit
the following:

provided said parcel(s) have access to public street by an easement over
another parcel within the same multiple dwelling or commercial complex.
      2.   Landlocked parcels which are unbuildable (outlots) and reserved as
permanent public open spaces such use as ponding areas may be permitted. A
conservation easement may be required by the city to ensure that the property
is preserved as open space. (Ord. 2024-04, 6-4-2024)
12-2-6: PARK DEDICATION:
   A.   Comprehensive Plans:
      1.   Where a proposed park, trailway, ponding, or open space area, shown
on the city's comprehensive plan, park development guide, comprehensive storm
sewer plan or official map, is located in the whole or in part in a
subdivision, such area or areas shall be shown on the preliminary plat.
      2.   Such area or areas shall also be dedicated to the city by the
subdivider if the council requests such dedication under the provisions of the
subsections below.
   B.   Dedication: In all subdivisions, the city shall require that a
reasonable portion of such land be set aside and dedicated to the public for
parks, playgrounds or other public use exclusive of property dedicated for
streets and other public ways.
      1.   In all residential subdivisions it shall be presumed that a
reasonable amount of land has been dedicated for parks and playgrounds if the
subdivider dedicates at least one twenty-fifth (1/25) of an acre for each Low
Density Residential dwelling unit of the proposed subdivision (acres to be
dedicated = 0.04 x number of dwelling units), 0.03 of an acre for Medium
Density Residential (acres to be dedicated = 0.03 x number of dwelling units)
or 0.02 of an acre for High Density Residential (acres to be dedicated = 0.02 x
number of dwelling units). The land use density determination will be based
upon the approved Comprehensive Land Use Plan. The city shall determine whether
a cash payment in lieu of land dedication is appropriate. The amount of cash
dedication shall be determined by multiplying the number of dwelling units of
the proposed subdivision times the designed fee per dwelling which may be set
from time to time by resolution of the council.
      2.   In all commercial, industrial and other subdivisions, it shall be
presumed that a reasonable amount of land has been dedicated to serve the needs
of the resident and working population for parks and playgrounds if the
subdivider dedicates at least ten percent (10%) of the land in the subdivision
for parks, recreation and usable open space. The city shall determine whether a
cash payment in lieu of land dedication is appropriate. The amount of the cash
dedication shall be determined by multiplying the number of acres (determined
by application of the formula stated above) times the designated fee per acre
which may be set from time to time by resolution of the council.
      3.   The dedication of a portion of land for parks or playgrounds, or the
payment of cash in lieu thereof, provided for above shall be presumed to be
reasonable. However, upon the request of the applicant, the recommendation of
the park and recreation commission, or at the discretion of the council, the
city may either increase or decrease such dedication or payment upon a
determination by the council that such dedication or payment is unreasonable or
insufficient given the specific characteristics of the proposed subdivision and
its intended use.
      4.   Ponding areas, needed as part of the overall city storm drainage
plan, shall be dedicated as land or easement at the option of the city and as
accepted by the city. However, no credit shall be given for park dedication
unless said area meets the criteria for public parks as stated in the city's
park dedication resolution and is approved by the council. Said dedication of
land or easement shall be in a form approved by the council.
      5.   In the case of subdivisions of land which have previously been
subdivided and for which land has been dedicated for parks or playgrounds, or
cash payments in lieu of such dedication have been made, the council shall make
reasonable adjustments to recognize such previous dedication or payment.
   C.   Timing Of Park Dedication: If a new subdivision is designed to be
platted into more than one addition, all park and other public use lands
contemplated under this section in the total subdivision area shall be
dedicated with the final plat of the first phase or addition of the subdivision
unless otherwise approved by the council.
   D.   Condition Of Land To Be Dedicated: Land to be dedicated for public
park, trail, or ponding shall be brought to a suitable condition by the
subdivider in accordance with city policy. All disturbed areas shall have
topsoil restored, be regraded with turf established according to specifications
provided by the city.
   E.   Abstract: Such lands shall be free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances including special assessments as evidenced by a recent abstract of
title or registered property abstract to be submitted at developer's cost to
the city for its examination.
   F.   Dedicated Property: City must have received warranty deed or equivalent
for dedicated park property by the city before final plat is approved. (Ord.

   F.   Turf: Prior to the issuance of occupancy permits for a dwelling so
provided, seeding shall be established and maintainable as a lawn, sod shall be
installed upon the unpaved street right-of-way fronting the lot and in any
drainage swales adjacent to the lot. (Ord. 2024-04, 6-4-2024)
12-2-8: GRADING OF SITE PRIOR TO FINAL PLAT:
Approval of a subdivision grading permit does not obligate the city in any
manner to approve a final plat. For further example, please refer to title 9,
"Building Regulations," of this code. (Ord. 2024-04, 6-4-2024)
12-2-9: HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION:
   A.   The declaration of covenants for a homeowners' association shall be
approved by the city and shall contain the following:
      1.   Duties Of Homeowners' Association: The open space and common areas
of a development shall be maintained and cared for by the developer of the
project until a homeowners' association is formed to maintain open space and
common areas. This homeowners' association shall be responsible for the care
and maintenance of all open space and common areas of this project and also for
the maintenance and appearance of the exterior of each unit.
      2.   Homeowners' Charges: The homeowners' association shall levy charges
to each owner for the maintenance cost, operating costs and improvement costs
for the open space, parks, and green areas and also for the parking and
bituminous surfaced areas which are not publicly owned and maintained. In
addition, the homeowners' association will assume the responsibility to
maintain the exterior of the building and also their front and rear yards in an
acceptable condition which is compatible to the neighboring property. This
condition shall be so kept that it will not cause a blighting of the area or a
general deterioration of the development. The homeowners' association will
cause blighted properties to be repaired, restored, and maintained as necessary
to a proper standard for the area.
      3.   Failure To Organize Homeowners' Association: In the event that the
developer or owner of the project is unable to organize the property owners
into an association for the maintenance of the project after twelve (12) months
from the completion of the construction, the council will call for a public
hearing of all persons so concerned and ask for the creation of such an
association. If no association is formed or if the association ceases to
function any time after it is formed, the council will order such maintenance
work and restoration of the area and then will assess such costs, together with
a reasonable supervision charge, to the property owners in the single-family
attached project or the individual property owner receiving the individual
benefit.
      4.   Declaration Of Covenants: The council may require that the
declaration of covenants include provisions to meet the minimum requirements of
this section or to satisfy conditions of city approval, may be enforced by the
city, and may not be amended or released without city council approval. (Ord.

      11.   That the subdivision is not premature. A premature subdivision may
include any of the following scenarios:
         a.   Lack Of Adequate Drainage: A condition of inadequate drainage
shall be deemed to exist if:
         (1)   Surface or subsurface water retention and runoff is such that it
constitutes a danger to the structural security of the proposed structures.
         (2)   The proposed subdivision will cause pollution of water sources
or damage from erosion and situation on downhill or downstream land.
         (3)   The proposed site grading and development will cause harmful and
irreparable damage from erosion and situation on downhill or downstream land.
         (4)   Factors to be considered in making these determinations may
include: average rainfall for the area; the relation of the land to
floodplains; the nature of soils and subsoils and their ability to adequately
support surface water runoff and waste disposal systems; the slope of the land
and its effect on effluents; and the presence of streams as related to effluent
disposal.
         b.   Lack Of Adequate Water Supply: A proposed subdivision shall be
deemed to lack an adequate water supply if the proposed subdivision does not
have adequate sources of water to serve the proposed subdivision if developed
to its maximum permissible density without causing an unreasonable depreciation
of existing water supplies for surrounding areas.
         c.   Lack Of Adequate Roads Or Highways To Serve The Subdivision: A
proposed subdivision shall be deemed to lack adequate roads or highways to
serve the subdivision when:
         (1)   Roads which serve the proposed subdivision are of such a width,
grade, stability, vertical and horizontal alignment, site distance and surface
condition that an increase in traffic volume generated by the proposed
subdivision would create a hazard to public safety and general welfare, or
seriously aggravate an already hazardous condition, and when, with due regard
to the advice of the county and/or the Mn-DOT, said roads are inadequate for
the intended use.
         (2)   The traffic volume generated by the proposed subdivision would
create unreasonable highway congestion or unsafe conditions on highways
existing at the time of the application or proposed for completion within the
next two (2) years.
         d.   Lack Of Adequate Waste Disposal Systems: A proposed subdivision
shall be deemed to lack adequate waste disposal systems if in subdivisions for
which sewer lines are proposed, there is inadequate sewer capacity in the
present system to support the subdivision if developed to its maximum
permissible density after reasonable sewer capacity is reserved for schools,
planned public facilities, and commercial and industrial development projected
for the next five (5) years; or if in subdivisions where sewer lines are
neither available nor proposed, there is inadequate on site sewer capacity
potential to support the subdivision if developed to the maximum permissible
density.
         e.   Inconsistency With Comprehensive Plan: A proposed subdivision
shall be deemed inconsistent with the city's comprehensive plan when the
subdivision is inconsistent with the purposes, objectives and recommendations
of the adopted comprehensive plan of Rosemount, as may be amended. Subdivisions
which do not follow planned public improvements shall be deemed inconsistent
with the city's growth strategies as outlined in the comprehensive plan.
         f.   Public Service Capacity: A proposed subdivision shall be
determined to lack necessary public service capacity when services such as
recreational facilities, schools, police and fire protection and other public
facilities, which must be provided at public expense, cannot reasonably be
provided for within the next two (2) years.
         g.   Minnesota Environmental Quality Board (EQB) Policies: The
proposed subdivision is inconsistent with the policies of the environmental
quality board, as may be amended, and could adversely impact critical
environmental areas or potentially disrupt or destroy historic areas, which are
designated or officially recognized by the council, in violation of federal and
state historical preservation laws.
         (1)   Inconsistency With Capital Improvement Plan: A proposed
subdivision shall be deemed inconsistent with capital improvement plans when
improvements and/or services necessary to accommodate the proposed subdivision
have not been programmed in the Rosemount, county or other regional capital
improvement plans. The council may waive this criteria when it can be
demonstrated that a revision to capital improvement programs can be
accommodated.

council resolution. The city council shall state, in writing, its findings for
approval or denial, as well as any conditions of approval.

following information shall have been received and approved by the council:
      1.   A subdivision agreement, drafted by the city that identifies all
requirements of the developer and the city;

      3.   Approval of other governmental jurisdictions that have approval
authority of preliminary plats;
      4.   An engineering feasibility report;
      5.   Review and approval by the city's public utilities commission and
park and recreation committee; and

required by the county.
         a.   The signature of the mayor or vice mayor attesting to the date
upon which the council approved the final plat.

with the county recorder within two (2) years after the plat has been released
for recording by the city unless a time extension has been granted by the
council.
         b.   Failure to record the plat within two (2) years of council
approval shall render all approvals by the city null and void until a new
application has been processed and approved by the city or until the city has
granted an extension in time in which the final plat shall be recorded.
      5.   Proof Of Recording: The city shall not take any action related to
the plat such as issuing building permits or awarding public utility or street
contracts on the platted property until such time as the clerk has been
satisfied that the plat has been recorded with the county recorder. (Ord. 2024-

12-3-4: PLATTING ALTERNATIVES:
Alternatives to the standard preliminary and final plat procedures and
requirements may be permitted under certain conditions as defined below.
   A.   Lot Line Adjustment:
      1.   When owners of adjacent properties intend to modify the areas of the
existing parcels while not creating an additional buildable lot, approval of a
lot line adjustment can be requested when all of the following apply:
         a.   The new legal descriptions for the properties are metes and
bounds or simple, easily described division of two (2) platted lots of record
(for example, east ½ of lot 31, north 150 feet of lot 31);
         b.   The adjustment does not result in the creation of a new lot, does
not make one of the lots large enough to be eligible for further subdivision,
and does not make an unbuildable lot buildable; and
         c.   The resulting parcels meet all applicable ordinance requirements,
except that if one of the parcels was previously non-conforming, it must become
more conforming as a result of the subdivision.
      2.   The zoning administrator shall approve or deny the application and
provide the applicant with written notice of the decision and reasons for
approval or denial.
   B.   Agricultural Lot Divisions:
      1.   Lot divisions for single-unit dwellings in the agricultural district
may be exempted from platting requirements in accordance with the requirements
of title 11 chapter 3 of this code.
   C.   Minor Subdivision:
      1.   Property may be subdivided through a minor subdivision procedure
which combines the preliminary and final plat procedures in sections
12-3-1 and
12-3-3 in conformance with the following conditions:
         a.   The resulting subdivision shall contain no more than four (4)
parcels.
         b.   The proposed subdivision shall be in areas where municipal
streets and utilities are already in place and capable of serving the plat.
         c.   Future streets shall not be constructed and the proposed
subdivision shall not interfere with proper development of neighboring adjacent
properties.
         d.   Resulting parcels shall conform with all zoning ordinance
requirements.
      2.   Minor subdivision shall conform to all requirements of standard
subdivision except that some of the information requirements such as the
engineering feasibility report may be waived by the city staff.
   D.   Registered Land Survey (RLS):
      1.   Registered land surveys shall not be used to avoid the requirements
of this title.
      2.   A registered land survey for parcels of less than five (5) acres in
size or three hundred (300) feet in width shall be reviewed by the commission
and approved by the council in the same manner as a preliminary plat. Such
approval shall be attached to the survey.
      3.   All registered land surveys shall be prepared in conformance with
Minn. Stat. § 508.47, subdivision 4.
   E.   Corrections:
      1.   When a survey or description of a parcel or lot has been found to be
inadequate to describe the actual boundaries, approval of a corrective plat may
be requested.
      2.   This type of subdivision creates no new lots or streets.
      3.   The proposed corrective subdivision, in sketch plan form, along with
a letter signed by both property owners agreeing to the new subdivision, shall
be submitted to the council for approval. No hearing or commission review is
necessary unless the proposal is referred to the commission by the planner for
clarification.
      4.   The proposed lots shall not cause any portion of the existing lots,
parcel, or existing buildings to be in violation of this regulation or the
zoning code. A certificate of survey may be required on any proposed lot with
existing buildings in order to determine the placement of the building on the
proposed lot. (Ord. 2024-04, 6-4-2024)
12-3-5: SUBDIVISION VARIANCE:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this section is to provide for variations from
the literal provisions of this title in instances where an unusual hardship

   D.   Review Criteria: The board of appeals and adjustments shall not approve
a variance unless they find that the following criteria, as applicable, have
been met:
      1.   The variance, and its resulting construction or project, would be in
keeping with the spirit and intent of this chapter.
      2.   The variance would alleviate an unusual hardship existing upon the
land such as physical surroundings, shape, or topographical conditions. Unusual
hardship includes, but is not limited to, inadequate access to direct sunlight
for solar energy systems.
      3.   The variance and its resulting construction or project would not be
detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other nearby properties.

streets, utility easements, existing or proposed subdivisions of ownership and
such other information, if any, as required by this chapter, shall be required
as a part of the planned unit development as set forth in section
