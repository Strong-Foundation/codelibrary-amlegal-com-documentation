section, subdivision or subparagraph so amended.

SEC. 6.06. FILING OF PETITIONS AND ACTION THEREON.
   All the signature papers shall be filed in the office of the City
Administrator as one instrument. Within 10 days after the filing of the
petition, the City Administrator shall ascertain by examination the number of
registered voters whose signatures are appended thereto and whether this number
is sufficient. If he finds the petition insufficient or irregular, he shall at
once notify one or more of the committee of sponsors of that fact, certifying
the reasons for his finding. The committee shall then be given 30 days to file
additional signature papers and to correct the petition in all other
particulars. If at the end of that period the petition is found to be still
insufficient or irregular, the City Administrator shall file it in his office
and shall notify each member of the committee of that fact. The final finding
of the insufficiency or irregularity of a petition shall not prejudice the
filing of a new petition for the same purpose, nor shall it prevent the Council
from referring the ordinance to the registered voters at the next regular or
any special election at its option. When the petition is found to be
sufficient, the City Administrator shall so certify to the Council at its next
meeting.
(Ord. 77, Seventh Series, effective 1-26-2019)
SEC. 6.07. ACTION OF COUNCIL ON PETITION. 
   Upon certification by the City Administrator of an ordinance initiated by
petition, the Council shall refer the ordinance to the City Attorney or other
qualified attorney selected by the Council for a written opinion as to the
ordinance’s compliance with Section
6.01, with a direction to the attorney to report to the Council within 30 days.
If the attorney advises the Council that the initiated ordinance is contrary to
the provisions of the law or this chapter, neither the Council nor any city
officer may take any further action with respect to the ordinance. Upon receipt
of the attorney’s opinion that the initiated ordinance complies with Section
6.01 or if the attorney does not report to the Council within the 30-day
period, at its next meeting the Council shall cause a first reading of the
ordinance and refer it to an appropriate committee, which may be a committee of
the whole. The Council shall thereupon provide for a public hearing upon the
ordinance, after the holding of which the ordinance shall be finally acted upon
by the Council not later than sixty (60) days after the date upon which it was
submitted to the Council by the City Administrator. If the Council passes the
proposed ordinance without amendments, the ordinance need not be submitted to
the voters. If the Council passes the proposed ordinance with amendments and at
least four fifths of the sponsoring committee file a statement with the City
Administrator approving the amended form within ten (10) days of its passage by
the Council, the ordinance need not be submitted to the voters. If the Council
fails to enact the ordinance in an acceptable form within seventy (70) days
after the final determination of the sufficiency of the petition, the Council
must schedule a special election on the earliest date possible under Minnesota
law. The ordinance shall be placed on the ballot as stated on the original
petition filed with the City Administrator, unless, not later than seventy (70)
days after the date upon which it was submitted to the council by the City
Administrator, the Council votes to submit the proposed ordinance to the voters
with amendments, and at least four-fifths of the sponsoring committee file a
statement with the City Administrator approving the amendments within ten (10)
days of the City Council vote, in which event the Council must schedule a
special election on the amended ordinance on the earliest date permitted under
Minnesota law. If the majority of those voting on the ordinance, vote in its
favor, it shall become effective thirty (30) days after its adoption unless the
ordinance specifies a later effective date.
(Ord. 77, Seventh Series, effective 1-26-2019)
SEC. 6.08. INITIATIVE BALLOTS. 
   The ballots used when voting upon any such proposed ordinance shall state
the substance of the ordinance and shall give the voters the opportunity to
vote either “yes” or “no” on the question of adoption. The complete text of the
ordinance shall be posted and available for public viewing at all polling
places. If a majority of the registered voters voting on any such ordinance
vote in favor of it, it shall thereupon become an ordinance of the City. Any
number of proposed ordinances may be voted upon at the same election but the
voter shall be allowed to vote for or against each separately. In case of
inconsistency between two initiated ordinances approved at one election, the
one approved by the higher percentage of registered voters voting on the
question shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.
SEC. 6.09. INITIATION OF CHARTER AMENDMENTS.
   Nothing in this Charter shall be construed as in any way affecting the right
of the registered voters under the Constitution and statutes of Minnesota to
propose amendments to this Charter.
Referendum
SEC. 6.10. THE REFERENDUM. 
   Any matter subject to the initiative may be subjected to referendum . The
petition shall state, at the head of each page, or on an attached paper, a
description of the ordinance and is signed by a number of registered voters of
the City equal to at least ten percent (10%) of the total number of voters
registered on the date of the last preceding regular municipal election, and is
filed with the City Administrator requesting that any such ordinance be
repealed or be submitted to a vote of the registered voters. Any ordinance,
which has been adopted by the Council, but which is not yet effective, and upon
which a petition has been filed, shall be suspended in its operation as soon as
a petition is found sufficient; all other ordinances, including an emergency
ordinance, shall remain in effect, but shall be repealed if the majority of the
voters voting on the ordinance vote against it. The Council shall thereupon
reconsider the ordinance at its next regular meeting, and either repeal it or
by aye and no vote re affirm its adherence to the ordinance as passed. In the
latter case, it shall be placed on the ballot at the next election or at a
special election called for that purpose, as the Council determines. If a
majority of the voters voting thereon favor the ordinance, it shall go into
effect immediately or on the dates specified in the ordinance; if a majority of
electors voting thereon vote against the ordinance, it shall be considered
repealed upon certification of the election results.
SEC. 6.11. REFERENDUM PETITIONS. 
   The requirements laid down in Sections
6.04 and
6.05 above as to the formation of committees for the initiation of ordinances
and as to the form of petitions and signature papers shall apply to the
referendum as far as possible, but with such verbal changes as may be
necessary. A referendum petition shall read as follows:

SEC. 6.13. RECALL OF ELECTED OFFICIALS. 
   Any five registered voters may form a recall committee for the purpose of
bringing about the recall of any elected official of the City for which each
member of the recall committee is eligible to vote. The recall committee shall
file a certificate of recall with the City Administrator stating the name of
the official who is subject to removal, a statement of the grounds for removal

SEC. 6.14. RECALL PETITIONS. 
   Within thirty (30) days after the filing of the certificate of recall under
Section
6.13, the committee shall file the completed petition in the office of the City
Administrator. Failure to timely file the petition invalidates the petition.
The petition for the recall shall consist of a copy of the certificate of
recall together with all the signature papers and affidavits thereto attached.
When the official subject to recall is a mayor, such petition shall not be
completed unless signed by registered voters of the City equal to at least
twenty percent (20%) of the total number of voters registered on the date of
the preceding regular municipal election. When the official subject to be
recalled is a ward council member, only registered voters who are residents of
his ward shall be eligible to sign the recall petition and vote at the recall
election and the required number be at least twenty percent (20%) of the total
number of registered voters in the ward on the date of preceding regular
municipal election. All the signatures need not be on one signature paper, but
the circulator of every paper shall make an affidavit that each signature
appended to the paper is the genuine signature of the person whose name it
purports to be. Each signature paper shall be in substantially the following
form:

At the end of the list of signatures shall be appended the affidavit of the
circulator.
SEC. 6.15. REVIEW OF RECALL PETITION. 
   The City Administrator shall examine the sufficiency of the petition for
recall within the next ten (10) days of filing, and if he finds it insufficient
in any way, he shall so notify one or more members of the committee of all
insufficiencies in writing. The committee shall then be given ten (10) days in
which to file additional signature papers and make necessary corrections to the
petition with the City Administrator, but they may not change the grounds of
the recall. The City Administrator shall have five (5) days to examine the
additional signature papers and/or corrections to the petition. If at the end
of that time the City Administrator finds the petition still insufficient or
irregular, he shall notify all the members of the committee of the
insufficiencies in writing and shall file the petition in his office. The final
finding that the petition is insufficient shall not prejudice filing of a new
petition for the same purpose.
SEC. 6.16. RECALL ELECTION. 
   If a petition or amended petition is found sufficient, the City
Administrator shall transmit it to the Council without delay, and shall also
officially notify the person subject to be recalled of the sufficiency of the
petition and of the pending action. The Council shall at its next meeting, by
resolution, schedule a special election on the petition on the earliest date
permitted under Minnesota law.
(Ord. 77, Seventh Series, effective 1-26-2019)
SEC. 6.17. PROCEDURE AT RECALL ELECTION.

the election the statement of the grounds for the recall and also, in not more
than five hundred (500) words, the answer of the official concerned in
justification of his course in office.
SEC. 6.18. FORM OF RECALL BALLOT. 
   Unless the official whose removal is subject resigns within ten (10) days
after the receipt by the Council of the completed recall petition, the form of
the ballot at such election shall be as near as may be: “Shall _____ be
recalled?” the name of the official subject to the recall being inserted in the
blank, and the registered voters shall be permitted to vote separately “yes” or
“no” upon this question. If a majority of those voting on the question of
recall vote in favor of recall, the official shall be thereby removed from
office, and a vacancy shall be deemed to exist in said office. If the official
subject to be recalled resigns within ten (10) days after the receipt by the
Council of the completed recall petition, a vacancy shall be deemed to exist in
said office. The Council shall then provide to fill said vacancy pursuant to
the provisions of Section
2.04.

meetings shall be so conducted as to give interested citizens a reasonable
opportunity to be heard. The Council may revise the proposed budget but no
amendment to the budget shall increase the authorized expenditures to an amount
greater than the estimated fund balances. The Council shall adopt the budget by
a resolution which shall set forth a total for each budgeted fund and each
department. The Council shall also adopt a resolution levying the amount of
taxes provided in the budget and the City Administrator shall certify the tax
resolution to the County Auditor in accordance with the law. At the beginning
of the fiscal year the sums fixed in the budget resolution shall be
appropriated for the purposes named and no other.
(Ord. 77, Seventh Series, effective 1-26-2019)
SEC. 7.07. ENFORCEMENT OF THE BUDGET. 
   The City Administrator shall enforce strictly the provisions of the budget.
He shall not authorize any payment or the incurring of any obligation by the
City unless an appropriation has been made for the same and there is a
sufficient unexpended balance left after deducting the total past expenditures
and encumbrances against the appropriation. No officer or employee of the City
shall place any order or make any purchase for a purpose not authorized in the
budget resolution. Any obligation incurred by any person in the employ of the
City for any purpose not authorized in the budget resolution or for any amount
exceeding a department appropriation shall be a personal obligation upon the
person incurring the obligation unless ratified by the City Council.
SEC. 7.08. ALTERATIONS IN THE BUDGET. 
   After the budget resolution has been adopted, the Council shall not increase
the appropriations beyond the estimated revenue sources except to the extent
that such sources exceed the estimate or available fund balance. At any time
the Council may, by resolution, reduce the sums appropriated for any purpose by
the budget resolution, or authorize the transfer of sums from unencumbered
balances of appropriations in the budget resolution to other purposes.
SEC. 7.09. FUNDS. 
   There shall be maintained in the City Treasury a general fund and such other
funds as may be required by statute, ordinance or resolution. The Council may,

   Except as provided in Sections
7.11 and

shall be issued and sold without the approval of the majority of the voters
voting on the question at a general or special election, except in the case of
obligations for which an election is not required by this Charter or by law.
SEC. 7.11. ANTICIPATION CERTIFICATES. 
   At any time after January 1, the Council may issue certificates of
indebtedness in anticipation of State and Federal Aid and the collection of
taxes levied the previous year for any fund and not yet collected. The total
amount of certificates issued against any fund for any year together with
interest thereon until maturity shall not exceed the total of State and Federal
Aids and current taxes due to the fund and uncollected at the time of issuance.
Such certificates shall be issued on such terms and conditions as the Council
may determine, but they shall become due not later than April 1 of the year
following their issuance. The proceeds of the tax levied and such State or
Federal Aids as the governing body may have allocated for the fund against
which tax anticipation certificates are issued and the full faith and credit of
the City shall be irrevocably pledged for the redemption of the certificates.
SEC. 7.12. EMERGENCY DEBT CERTIFICATES. 
   If in any year the receipts from taxes or other sources should from some
unforeseen cause become insufficient for the ordinary expenses of the City, or
if any calamity or other public emergency necessitates the making of
extraordinary expenditures, the Council may issue on such terms and in such
manner as the Council determines emergency debt certificates to run not to
exceed three (3) years. A tax sufficient to pay principal and interest on such
certificates with the margin required by law shall be levied as required by
law. The emergency debt certificates shall state the nature of the emergency
and be approved by the Council.
(Ord. 77, Seventh Series, effective 1-26-2019)
SEC. 7.13. BANK LOANS.

may borrow money from any bank for the purpose of financing any authorized
capital improvement or other purpose as allowed by this Charter or by law. Such
loans shall be payable within a maximum period of seven (7) years and shall be
issued on such terms and in such manner as the Council may determine. If the
amount of the obligations to be issued to finance any such purchase exceeds one
(1%) percent of the assessed valuation of the City, excluding money and
credits, they shall not be issued for at least thirty (30) days after
publication using the official means of publication of the Council’s resolution
determining the issue; and if, before the end of that time, a petition asking
for an election on the proposition, signed by a number of registered voters of
the City equal to at least ten (10%) percent of the total number of voters
registered on the date of the last preceding regular municipal election, is
filed with the City Administrator, such obligations shall not be issued until
the proposition for their issuance has been approved by a majority of the votes
cast on the question at a regular or special election. A tax levy shall be made
for the payment of the principal and interest on such obligations as in the
case of bonds as prescribed by law. In lieu of borrowing money by bank loans as
authorized by this Section, the Council may issue any other form of legal City
obligation as allowed by law or by this Charter.

   (B)   It is the intention of the City Council that, when adopting the code

§ 10.20 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Any licensed peace officer of the city's Police Department, or the
County Sheriff, or any Deputy Sheriff shall have the authority to enforce any
provision of this code.
   (B)   As permitted by M.S. § 626.862, as it may be amended from time to
time, the City Administrator shall have the authority to administer and enforce
this code. In addition, under that statutory authority, certain individuals
designated within the code or by the Administrator or City Council shall have
the authority to administer and enforce the provisions specified. All and any
person or persons designated may issue a citation in lieu of arrest or
continued detention to enforce any provision of the code.
   (C)   The City Administrator and any city official or employee designated by
this code who has the responsibility to perform a duty under this code may with
the permission of a licensee of a business or owner of any property or resident
of a dwelling, or other person in control of any premises, inspect or otherwise
enter any property to enforce compliance with this code.
   (D)   If the licensee, owner, resident or other person in control of a
premises objects to the inspection of or entrance to the property, the City
Administrator, peace officer or any employee or official charged with the duty
of enforcing the provisions of this code may, upon a showing that probable
cause exists for the issuance of a valid search warrant from a court of
competent jurisdiction, petition and obtain a search warrant before conducting
the inspection or otherwise entering the property. This warrant shall be only
to determine whether the provisions of this code enacted to protect the health,
safety and welfare of the people are being complied with and to enforce these
provisions only, and no criminal charges shall be made as a result of the
warrant. No warrant shall be issued unless there be probable cause to issue the
warrant. Probable cause occurs if the search is reasonable. Probable cause does
not depend on specific knowledge of the condition of a particular property.
   (E)   Every licensee, owner, resident or other person in control of property
within the city shall permit at reasonable times inspections of or entrance to
the property by the City Administrator or any other authorized city officer or
employee only to determine whether the provisions of this code enacted to
protect the health, safety and welfare of the people are being complied with
and to enforce these provisions. Unreasonable refusal to permit the inspection
of or entrance to the property shall be grounds for termination of any and all
permits, licenses or city service to the property. Mailed notice shall be given
to the licensee, owner, resident or other person in control of the property,
stating the grounds for the termination, and the licensee, owner, resident or
other person in control of the property shall be given an opportunity to appear
before the City Administrator to object to the termination before it occurs,
subject to appeal of the Administrator’s decision to the City Council at a
regularly scheduled or special meeting.
   (F)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of
the city to enter private property in urgent emergency situations where there
is an imminent danger in order to protect the public health, safety and
welfare.
§ 10.98 SUPPLEMENTAL ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES.
   (A)   In addition to those administrative penalties established in this code
and the enforcement powers granted in §
10.20 of this chapter, the City Council is authorized to create by resolution,
adopted by a majority of the members of the Council, supplemental
administrative penalties. The resolution may not proscribe administrative
penalties for traffic offenses designated by M.S. § 169.999, as it may be
amended from time to time.
   (B)   These administrative penalty procedures in this section are intended
to provide the public and the city with an informal, cost effective and
expeditious alternative to traditional criminal charges for violations of
certain provisions of this code. The procedures are intended to be voluntary on
the part of those who have been charged with those offenses.
   (C)   Administrative penalties for violations of various provisions of the
code, other than those penalties established in the code or in statutes that
are adopted by reference, may be established from time to time by resolution of
a majority of the members of the City Council. In order to be effective, an
administrative penalty for a particular violation must be established before
the violation occurred.
   (D)   In the discretion of the peace officer, City Administrator or other
person giving notice of an alleged violation of a provision of this code, in a
written notice of an alleged violation, sent by first class mail to the person
who is alleged to have violated the code, the person giving notice may request
the payment of a voluntary administrative penalty for the violation directly to
the City Administrator within 14 days of the notice of the violation. In the
sole discretion of the person giving the notice of the alleged violation, the
time for payment may be extended an additional 14 days, whether or not
requested by the person to whom the notice has been given. In addition to the
administrative penalty, the person giving notice may request in the notice to
the alleged violator to adopt a compliance plan to correct the situation
resulting in the alleged violation and may provide that if the alleged violator
corrects the situation resulting in the alleged violation within the time
specified in the notice, that the payment of the administrative penalty will be
waived.
   (E)   At any time before the payment of the administrative penalty is due,
the person who has been given notice of an alleged violation may request to
appear before the City Council to contest the request for payment of the
penalty. After a hearing before the Council, the Council may determine to
withdraw the request for payment or to renew the request for payment. Because
the payment of the administrative penalty is voluntary, there shall be no
appeal from the decision of the Council.
   (F)   At any time after the date the payment of the administrative penalty
is due, if the administrative penalty remains unpaid or the situation creating
the alleged violation remains uncorrected, the city, through its Attorney, may
bring criminal charges in accordance with state law and this code. Likewise,
the city, in its discretion, may bring criminal charges in the first instance,
rather than requesting the payment of an administrative penalty, even if a
penalty for the particular violation has been established by Council
resolution. If the administrative penalty is paid, or if any requested
correction of the situation resulting in the violation is completed, no
criminal charges shall be initiated by the city for the alleged violation.
§ 10.99 GENERAL PENALTY AND ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Any person, firm or corporation who violates any provision of this
code for which another penalty is not specifically provided, shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor. The penalty which may be imposed for
any crime which is a misdemeanor under this code, including state statutes
specifically adopted by reference, shall be a sentence of not more than 90 days
or a fine of not more than $1,000, or both.
   (B)   Any person, firm or corporation who violates any provision of this
code, including state statutes specifically adopted by reference, which is
designated to be a petty misdemeanor shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a
petty misdemeanor. The penalty which may be imposed for any petty offense which
is a petty misdemeanor shall be a sentence of a fine of not more than $300.
   (C)   Pursuant to M.S. § 631.48, as it may be amended from time to time, in
either the case of a misdemeanor or a petty misdemeanor, the costs of
prosecution may be added. A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon
each day during which a violation occurs or continues.
   (D)   The failure of any officer or employee of the city to perform any
official duty imposed by this code shall not subject the officer or employee to
the penalty imposed for a violation.
   (E)   In addition to any penalties provided for in this section or in §
10.98 of this chapter, if any person, firm or corporation fails to comply with
any provision of this code, the Council or any city official designated by it,
may institute appropriate proceedings at law or at equity to restrain, correct
or abate the violation.

   (C)   Power and duties. The powers and duties of the Commission include the

time. No power may be exercised by the Commission which is contrary to state
law, the Charter or the code. No action of the Commission may contravene any

buildings (including interiors where appropriate), lands, areas, districts or
other objects to be designated or described for heritage preservation in the
city, as follows.

      (3)   Planning Commission review. The Commission shall advise the
Planning Commission of the proposed designation of a heritage preservation
site, including boundaries and a program for the preservation, restoration or
rehabilitation of the site and secure from the Planning Commission its
recommendation with respect to the relationship of the heritage preservation
designation to the comprehensive plan of the city. The Planning Commission will
render its opinion as to the effect of the proposed designation upon the
surrounding neighborhood and any other planning consideration which might be
relevant to the proposed designation. The Planning Commission shall then
recommend to approve, reject or suggest modifications to the proposed
designation. The recommendation shall become part of the official record
concerning the proposed designation and shall be submitted by the Commission
along with its recommendation concerning the proposed designation to the
Council. The Commission may make modifications, changes and alterations
concerning the proposed designation as it deems necessary in consideration of
the recommendations of the Planning Commission.
      (4)   Communications with the state’s Historical Society. A copy of the
Commission’s proposed designation and design guidelines of a heritage
preservation site, including boundaries and a program for the preservation,
restoration or rehabilitation of the site shall be sent to the state’s
Historical Society in accordance with state statutes.
      (5)   Hearings. Prior to the designation, the Council shall hold a public
hearing, notice of which shall have been published in a newspaper of general
circulation at least ten days prior to the date of hearing and notice shall be

preservation, the Commission shall present to the Council any necessary reports
on the site along with a guideline for utilization of the site.
      (7)   Council designation. The Council, after review of the reports and
guideline for utilization of the site and considering any evidence adduced at
the hearing, shall determine by ordinance or resolution whether or not to
designate or describe the specific buildings (including interiors where
appropriate), lands, areas, districts or other objects to be designated or
described for heritage preservation.
      (8)   Acquisition. The Commission may recommend to the Council, after
review and comment by the Planning Commission, that certain property eligible
for designation as a heritage preservation site be acquired by gift,
negotiation or by eminent domain as provided for in M.S. Ch. 117, as it may be
amended from time to time.
   (E)   Review of permits. The Commission shall review any building permits
issued by the city to do any of the following in a building or area or district
designated for heritage preservation in the city:
      (1)   Remodel or repair in any manner that will change the exterior
appearance and/or interior where designated;
      (2)   Move a building;
      (3)   Destroy a building in whole or in part;

use for a property that requires minimal alteration of the building structure
or site and its environment, or to use a property for its originally intended
purpose.
         (b)   The distinguishing historic qualities or character of a
building, structure or site and its environment shall be preserved. The removal
or alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural features
shall be avoided.
         (c)   All buildings, structures, objects and sites shall be recognized
as products of their own time, place and use. Proposed alterations which seek
to create or add features inconsistent to the building’s, structure’s, object’s
or site’s era shall be discouraged.
         (d)   Changes which may have taken place in the course of time that
have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and
preserved.
         (e)   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled
craftsmanship which characterize a building, structure, object or site shall be
preserved.
         (f)   Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than
replaced, whenever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new
material should match the material being replaced in composition, design,
color, texture and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing
architectural features should be based on accurate duplications of features,
substantiated by historic, physical or pictorial evidence rather than on
conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements
from other buildings or structures.
         (g)   The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the
gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other chemical means that could
damage the historic fabric of the building, structure, object or site shall be
avoided.
         (h)   Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when alterations do not destroy significant
historical, architectural or cultural material, and the design is compatible
with the size, scale, color, material and character of the property,
neighborhood or environment.
         (i)   Whenever possible, new additions and adjacent or related new
construction shall be done in a manner that if alterations are removed in the
future, the historic integrity of the designated building, structure, object or
site would remain unimpaired.
         (j)   Significant archaeological resources affected by a project shall
be protected and preserved. If resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures
shall be undertaken.
      (6)   The Commission shall review the permits by holding a public
hearing, notice of which shall have been sent to the property owners involved.
Every application for a building permit in relation to property designated for
heritage preservation in the city shall be accompanied by plans for the
proposed work to be done; and
      (7)   After conducting the public hearing, the Commission shall render
its decision thereon in writing to the Council, with a copy to the Building
Inspector and a copy to the applicant. If the Commission shall have disapproved
the plans, the Building Inspector shall not issue the permit. If the Commission
shall disapprove the plans, its written order of disapproval shall include
recommendations for changes to be made or what other further consideration
should be given to the plan before the Commission’s approval would be given. If
no action upon the plans submitted to the Commission has been taken at the
expiration of 60 days from the date of the application for building permit, and
submission of plans, the plans shall have been deemed to be approved and, if
all other requirements of the city have been met, the Building Inspector shall
authorize the permit for the proposed building. The Building Inspector, upon
receipt from the Commission of its decision, shall forthwith forward to the
Council for placing on its agenda at its next regular meeting the application
for permit as submitted to the Building Inspector.
   (F)   Certificate of no change.
      (1)   An applicant for a building permit requiring the approval of the
Heritage Preservation Commission may elect to dispense with the requirements of
notice to the property owners, public hearing and approval by the full
Commission if the applicant is eligible for a certificate of no change. The
certificate of no change may be issued by the Commission, in the manner
provided in division (F)(2) below, if the proposed property alteration is
limited to:
         (a)   Maintenance, construction or reconstruction where all surface
materials and other visible elements are to be replaced with identical
materials and where the replacement materials will be installed to the original
configuration;
         (b)   Out of view construction of a minor nature which, although
involving some visible alteration to a structure, introduces no significant
change to the existing architectural character. OUT OF VIEW shall be defined as
any alteration located on a minor or secondary elevation or surface and where
the architectural significance of the structure is not impaired to any
measurable degree;
         (c)   A change to any structure built after 1970 located within a
historic district, and which change does not affect the essential character of
the structure or adjacent historic structures. For example: the no-change
process shall be available to summarily approve changes to windows, entrances,
doors and the like, but not to changes in height, coloration, mossing or
encroachment towards historic properties; and
         (d)   Emergency repairs of a temporary nature to structures affected
by fire, vehicle damage, vandalism, windstorm or the like. Approval shall be
limited to alterations necessary to make the structure wind-tight, water-proof
and free from unauthorized entry. Approval shall extend only for a period
deemed necessary by the approving Commissioners up to a maximum of six months.
      (2)   The procedure for obtaining a certificate of no change shall be as
follows.
         (a)   The applicant shall submit a written application on forms
provided by the Commission. The applicant may be asked to provide:
            1.   Photographs of the structure and area to be altered;
            2.   An illustration or drawing of the proposed construction; and
            3.   A sample or appropriate product literature of the materials to
be used.
         (b)   The application, when completed with the above-described
supporting materials, shall be forwarded to the Heritage Preservation
Commission Chair and two Commission members appointed by the Chair.
         (c)   Within 14 calendar days after receipt of a written application,
pursuant to divisions (F)(1)(a) through (F)(1)(c) above, the Commission members
shall either deny the certificate of no change or express their unanimous
approval. If no response is made within 14 calendar days after receipt of the
written application, the application shall automatically be deemed approved by
the Commission. Within three working days after receipt of a written
application, pursuant to division (F)(1)(d) above, the Commission members shall
respond to the request for a certificate of no change. If no response is made
within three business days after receipt of the written application, the
application shall automatically be deemed approved by the Commission.
         (d)   Following any denial, any applicant may submit a revised
application for a certificate of no change or submit an application for regular
consideration by the full Commission using standard procedures for a public
hearing.
         (e)   No published notice to the public or other notice to the
property owners shall be required to obtain a certificate of no change.
         (f)   A summary of any certificates of no change shall be given to all
members of the Commission at each Commission meeting.
   (G)   Review of permit by Council. The Council, upon receipt of the building
permit application and the report of the Commission, shall, in its sole
discretion, decide whether the building permit shall be issued. If the
Commission has recommended disapproval of the permit, the Council, before
approving plans for any proposed building located or to be located in a
district, shall make findings in regard to the following:
      (1)   In case of a proposed alteration or addition to an existing
building that the alteration or addition will not materially impair the
architectural or historic value of the building, and shall make findings
considering the existing structure and existing exterior appearance, building
height, building width, depth or other dimensions, roof style, type of building
materials, ornamentations, paving setback and color;
      (2)   In case of the proposed demolition of a building, prior to the
approval of the demolition, the Council shall make findings on the following:

buildings, the effect of any new proposed construction on the remainder of the
building (in case of partial demolition) and on surrounding buildings, the
economic value or usefulness of building as it now exists, or if altered or
modified in comparison with the value or usefulness of any proposed structures

from participating in decisions where they may have a conflict of interest.

interest. Public officials must not use their position to gain privileges or
special treatment or use public property for private or personal purposes.
(2002 Code, § 2.90) (Ord. 61, Sixth Series, effective 8-20-2008; Ord. 14,
Eighth Series, effective - -2021)
§ 33.02 PUBLIC OFFICIAL.
   In the performance of official duties public officials shall act for the
benefit of the city. The term “public official,” as used in this
Chapter 33, includes elected officials (the City Council and the Mayor),
appointed officials (persons that serve on city boards, committees, and
commissions, including the Charter Commission and the Port Authority), and city
employees.
(2002 Code, § 2.901) (Ord. 61, Sixth Series, effective 8-20-2008; Ord. 14,
Eighth Series, effective - -2021)
§ 33.03 CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.
   (A)   Definition of conflicts of interest and financial interest.  
      (1)   A public official shall avoid any situation that might give rise to
a conflict of interest. The term "conflict of interest", as used in this
Chapter 33, is present when, in the discharge of official duties, a public
official participates in a governmental decision, action or transaction in
which:
         (a)   He or she has a financial interest,
         (b)   A business, organization, corporation, or association which he
or she serves as an officer, director or board member has a financial interest
or other interest which may conflict with the responsibilities owed to the
public as a public official,
         (c)   His or her employer has a financial interest, or
         (d)   His or her spouse, domestic partner, or dependent has a
financial interest.
      (2)   The term "financial interest", as used in this
Chapter 33, is any interest, including loans, which may yield, directly or
indirectly, a monetary or other material benefit
   (B)   Participating with a conflict of interest.
      (1)   No participation. A public official must not participate in making
or attempt to use his or her position to influence any City governmental
decision, action, or transaction in which the public official knows or has
reason to know that he or she has a conflict of interest. To participate or
participation as used in this paragraph (B) means making a decision, taking
action, entering into a transaction, providing advice or a recommendation,
introducing, sponsoring, debating, voting on, approving, and investigating the
decision, action, or transaction. Participation includes the direct and active
supervision of the participation of a subordinate in the matter. Participation
is more than official responsibility, knowledge, perfunctory involvement, or
involvement on an administrative or peripheral basis.
      (2)   A public official may participate in a city governmental decision,
action, or transaction involving an organization or entity if the public
official or his or her spouse, domestic partner, or dependent is an officer,
director, board member, or trustee of the organization and the organization
does not have a financial interest or other interest which may conflict with
the responsibilities owed the public as a public official. However, the public
official must disclose his or her affiliation with the organization or entity
as though it were a conflict of interest.
      (3)   A public official may participate in a city governmental decision
involving a related person, other than his or her spouse, domestic partner or
dependent, if the related person does not have a financial interest in the
governmental decision, action, or transaction. However, the public official
must disclose his or her relationship with the related person as though it were
a conflict of interest.
   (C)   Disclosure of conflicts of interest. If a public official, in the
discharge of his or her official duties, recognizes that his or her
participation may create a conflict of interest, the public official shall
disclose the conflict of interest as follows:
      (1)   The Mayor and members of the City Council shall disclose conflicts
of interest to each other as soon as they become aware of the conflict, orally
at or during a meeting of the City Council, or one of its committees.
      (2)   A department head shall disclose a conflict of interest to the
Mayor, the City Council, and the City Administrator, either orally or by a
written statement describing the matter requiring action or decision and the
nature of his or her conflict of interest.
      (3)   Employees of the city shall disclose a conflict of interest to
their supervisor and to the City Administrator and shall also be disclosed to
the Mayor and City Council.
      (4)   Public officials who are not covered by divisions (1), (2) and (3)
above shall disclose conflicts of interest as soon as they become aware of the
conflict, orally to the committee chair at or during a meeting of the committee
or commission.

ADMINISTRATIVE OFFENSES
§ 33.30 PURPOSE.
   (A)   Administrative offense procedures established pursuant to this
subchapter are intended to provide the public and the city with an informal,
cost effective and expeditious alternative to traditional criminal charges for
violations of certain ordinance provisions. The procedures are intended to be
voluntary on the part of those who have been charged with administrative
offenses. At any time prior to the payment of the administrative penalty as is
provided for hereafter, the individual may withdraw from participation in the
procedures in which event the city may bring criminal charges in accordance
with law.
   (B)   Likewise, the city, in its discretion, may choose not to initiate an
administrative offense and may bring criminal charges in the first instance. In
the event a party participates in the administrative offense procedures, but
does not pay the monetary penalty which may be imposed, the city will seek to
collect the costs of the administrative offense procedures as part of a
subsequent criminal sentence in the event the party is charged and is
adjudicated guilty of the criminal violation.
(2002 Code, § 2.98) (Ord. 73, Fourth Series, passed 2-22-1995)
§ 33.31 DEFINITION.

the city, authorized in writing by the City Administrator and having authority
to enforce this code, shall, upon determining that there has been a violation,
notify the violator or in the case of a vehicular violation, attach to the
vehicle a notice of the violation. The notice shall set forth the nature, date

the alleged violation, the amount of any civil penalty or fee, or the adverse
action. Such appeal must be in writing, must specify the grounds for the
appeal, must be accompanied by a filing fee as established in the city’s
adopted fee schedule in cash or cashier’s check, and must be filed with the
City Administrator or designee within ten calendar days after service of the
notice of code violation. The filing of an appeal shall stay all proceedings in
furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the city determines that such a
stay would cause imminent peril to life, health, or property.
(Ord. 86, Seventh Series, passed 10-7-2019)
§ 33.46 HEARING AND HEARING OFFICER(S).
   Upon receipt of the written appeal, the City Administrator will refer the
matter to an independent hearing officer (which may be a city employee) or may,
with the consent of the person who is the subject of the notice of code
violation, designate himself or herself or an individual or panel as the
hearing officer(s). Appeals involving the interpretations of the State Fire or
Building Code provisions may be conducted through appeal procedures established
under those codes.
   (A)   Scheduling the hearing. The City Administrator or designee shall
schedule a hearing before the hearing officer(s), which will be held within 30
calendar days, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the parties. The City
Administrator or designee shall promptly notify the person appealing of the
date, time, and location of the hearing, and that failure to appear for the
scheduled hearing may result in a finding of default of the violation and
forfeiture of the appeal filing fee.
   (B)   Conduct of the hearing. At the hearing, both parties may be
represented by counsel, shall have the opportunity to present testimony, shall
be able to call and question witnesses and introduce any exhibits; however,
strict rules of evidence shall not apply. The hearing shall be recorded and a
full record of the proceedings shall be maintained by the city according to its
data retention schedule. Except as otherwise provided in this section, any
costs incurred are the responsibility of the individual.
   (C)   Authority of hearing officer(s). The hearing officer(s) has the
authority to do any of the following or a combination thereof:
      (1)   Make a finding that a violation has occurred;
      (2)   Impose, reduce, stay, or waive any fees or civil penalties either
unconditionally or upon compliance with reasonable conditions;
      (3)   Require compliance with this code within a specified time frame;
      (4)   Make a finding that no violation has occurred and dismiss the
notice of violation; and/or
      (5)   Suspend, revoke, deny or approve the licenses.
   (D)   Decision and order. The hearing officer(s) may announce a decision at
the conclusion of the hearing or may take the matter under advisement. The
hearing officer(s) shall issue a decision in the form of an order and shall
serve a written copy of the order upon the parties no later than ten calendar
days after the hearing. Any fee or civil penalty the hearing officer(s) imposes
must be paid to the city within the time frame established in the order. If no
date is specified, it must be paid within 30 calendar days of the order of the
hearing officer(s). If the fee or civil penalty is not paid, the city may
assess outstanding amount against the owner’s property pursuant to M.S. Ch.
429, as it may be amended from time to time. If the hearing officer(s)
determines that no violation occurred, then the city may not proceed with
criminal prosecution for the same act or conduct. The decision of the hearing
officer(s) is final unless appealed in writing to the City Council within ten
calendar days of the issuance of the decision. The decision of the hearing
officer(s) is final except for liquor license decisions, those are
recommendations to the City Council to consider final action.
   (E)   Hearing fee. If the violation or adverse action is overturned, the
hearing officer(s) may order the refunding of the filing fee or any portion
thereof. If the violation is upheld, then the owner, licensee, or other person
must pay the cost of the hearing if an independent hearing officer was
utilized. The initial filing fee will be credited toward these costs. No
additional costs are to be recovered if the City Administrator or panel hears
the request. If the fee is not paid within 30 calendar days, the city may
assess the fee against the property pursuant to M.S. Ch. 429, as it may be
amended from time to time.
   (F)   Failure to appear. Failure to appear at the hearing shall result in a
default judgment against the party who fails to appear. If the person filing
the appeal fails to appear, the violation shall be sustained, the filing fee
forfeited, and any proposed enforcement action may be implemented by the city.
If the city fails to appear, the violation shall be dismissed.
   (G)   Failure to comply with decision and order. Delinquent civil penalties
may be assessed against the property pursuant to M.S. Ch. 429, as it may be
amended from time to time or other lawful means. The city may pursue criminal
charges for uncorrected violations noted in the decision and order.
(Ord. 86, Seventh Series, passed 10-7-2019)
§ 33.47 APPEAL.
   The decision of the hearing officer(s) may be appealed to the City Council.
The written appeal must be filed with the City Administrator or designee within

city planning and preparation for emergency government operations in time of
disasters;
   (B)   To provide for the exercise of necessary powers during emergencies and
disasters;

the maximum extent practicable. The officers and personnel of all city
departments and agencies shall, to the maximum extent practicable, cooperate
with and extend services and facilities to the city's emergency management
organization and to the Governor upon request. The head of each department or
agency in cooperation with the Director shall be responsible for the planning
and programming of those emergency activities as will involve the utilization
of the facilities of the department or agency.
   (F)   The Director shall, in cooperation with those city departments and
agencies affected, assist in the organizing, recruiting, and training of

§ 34.20 EMERGENCY REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Whenever necessary, to meet a declared emergency or to prepare for an
emergency for which adequate regulations have not been adopted by the Governor
or the Council, the Council may by resolution promulgate regulations,
consistent with applicable federal or state law or regulation, respecting: the
conduct of persons and the use of property during emergencies; the repair,
maintenance, and safeguarding of essential public services, emergency health,
fire, and safety regulations, drills or practice periods required for
preliminary training, and all other matters which are required to protect
public safety, health, and welfare in declared emergencies.
   (B)   Every resolution of emergency regulations shall be in writing; shall
be dated; shall refer to the particular emergency to which it pertains, if so

in the affected area as the Council shall designate in the resolution. By
resolution, the Council may modify or rescind a regulation.

acting within or without the corporate limits of the city, to enter into
contracts and incur obligations necessary to combat the disaster by protecting
the health and safety of persons and property and providing emergency
assistance to the victims of a disaster. The city may exercise these powers in
the light of the exigencies of the disaster without compliance with the time-
consuming procedures and formalities prescribed by law pertaining to the
performance of public work, entering rental equipment agreements, purchase of
supplies and materials, limitations upon tax levies, and the appropriation and
expenditure of public funds, including, but not limited to, publication of

examination within 15 days of the city’s request. If, after any investigation
or examination, it is determined that the tax due is greater than that paid,
such excess shall be paid to the city within ten days after the city has given
notice either personally or sent by mail to the address shown on the return. If
the tax paid is greater than the tax found to be due, the excess shall be
refunded within ten days after determination of such refund. Whenever any tax
due has a 10% or more discrepancy, the operator shall reimburse the city for
any costs incurred by the city in reviewing the operator’s return, including
administrative costs and attorneys fees.
   (E)   Refunds. Any operator may apply to the city for a refund of taxes paid
in excess of the amount legally due for that period, provided that it is filed
within one year after such tax was paid, or within one year from the filing of
the return, whichever period is longer. The Finance Director shall review the
request and may approve or deny the request in whole or in part and shall issue
written findings of such decision. The city shall notify the operator of its
decision by sending notice by mail to the address stated upon the refund claim
application. If such claim is approved in whole or in part the city shall
credit the amount of the refund against any taxes due and owing hereunder by
the operator. Any balance of the refund shall promptly be paid by the city to
the operator.
   (F)   Failure to file a return. Any operator who fails to file a return as
required, or who files an incorrect, false, or fraudulent return, then upon
written notice and demand by the city, shall file a return or corrected return
together with any tax due within five days of the city sending the written
notice. Whenever any person fails to file the appropriate return under this
section or fails to pay the tax due after such notice and demand, the city may
determine the appropriate tax from such knowledge and information as the city
is able to obtain and assess such tax accordingly. Any tax determined to be due
and owing under this section shall be paid by the operator within five days
after written notice and demand for such payment is sent by the city. Any
assessment made by the city shall be prima facie correct and valid; and the
operator shall have the burden of establishing the assessment is incorrect or
invalid. Late payments shall be subject to interest at the rate of 10% per
annum.
   (G)   Failure to remit tax payment. If any portion of a tax and penalties is
not paid within 30 days after it is required to be paid, the city may institute
such legal action as it, in its sole discretion, may deem appropriate to cover
the amount due plus interest penalties, the costs and disbursements of any
action.
   (H)   Penalties and interest.
      (1)   If any tax required is not paid within the time specified, the
operator shall pay a penalty equal to 10% of the amount unpaid, in addition to
the tax due and payable.
      (2)   Any tax not paid within 20 days after the end of the month in which
the taxes were collected by the operator, together with any penalty provided
herein, shall bear interest at a rate 10% per annum and shall begin to accrue
at the time the tax was required to be paid. Any interest and penalty shall be
added to the tax and be collected as part thereof.
   (I)   Violations. Any operator who willfully fails to make a return
required, or who fails to pay the tax after written demand for payment, or who
fails to remit the taxes collected or any penalty or interest imposed after
written demand for such payment, or who refuses to permit the city to examine
the books, records, and papers under the operator’s control, or who willfully
makes any incomplete, false, or fraudulent return shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor.
   (J)   Use of proceeds. Ninety-five percent of the proceeds obtained from the
collection of taxes shall be used in accordance with M.S. § 469.190 to fund a
local convention or tourism bureau for the purpose of marketing and promoting
the city as a tourist or convention center.
   (K)   Appeals.
      (1)   Petition required. Any operator who is aggrieved by any notice,
order, or determination made by the city, may file a petition for
administrative review within 30 days after the notice, order, or determination
has been sent to the operator. The petition shall contain the following:
         (a)   A detailed account of the operator's reasons for contesting the
order, notice, or determination.
         (b)   The name of the operator, the operator’s address, and the
location of the lodging establishment subject to the order, notice, or
determination.
      (2)   Hearing. Upon receipt of the petition, the City Administrator, or
the Administrator’s designee, shall set a date for a hearing and give the
operator at least 14 days prior written notice of the date, time, and place of
the hearing. At the hearing, the operator has the burden to prove that the
notice, order, or determination is in error. The operator may be represented by
counsel at operator’s own expense. The hearing shall be conducted by the City
Administrator or Administrator’s designee, provided that the person conducting
the hearing shall not have participated in the decision in the notice, order,
or determination for which review is sought. The notice, order, or
determination may be affirmed, reversed, or modified. Any decision by the City
Administrator shall be supported by written findings of fact based upon the
applicable provisions of this section and the evidence presented.
      (3)   Appeal to the City Council. The operator may appeal the decision of
the City Administrator or the Administrator’s designee to the City Council by
filing a written notice of appeal with the City Clerk within ten days after the
decision has been sent to the operator. The matter will be set before the City
Council as soon as is practical, and the operator shall be given 14 days notice
of the Council hearing. The Council’s standard of review of the Administrator’s
decision shall be based on the record and the operator shall have the burden to
prove the city’s notice, order, or determination is in error. The Council may
modify, reverse, or affirm the decision of the City Administrator.
   (L)   Alternate method of collection. The city may agree with the state
Commissioner of Revenue that the tax imposed by this section shall be collected
by the Commissioner together with the sales tax imposed by M.S. Ch. 297A and
subject to the same interest, penalties, and other rules, and that the
proceeds, less the cost of collection, shall be remitted to the city. If the
city makes such an agreement pursuant to M.S. § 469.190, subd. 7 with the
Commissioner of Revenue, then the interest, penalties, and other rules
applicable to the collection of the sales tax under M.S. Ch. 297A shall also be
applicable to the lodging tax imposed by this section, in lieu of the interest,
penalties, and collection rules set forth in this section.

shall connect, disconnect or in any manner change or cause to be changed or
interfere with the meter or outside register, or the action thereof.
   (B)   The city shall maintain and repair all meters and outside registers
when rendered unserviceable through ordinary wear and shall replace them if
necessary. Where replacement, repair or adjustment of any meter or outside
register is rendered necessary by freezing, or by the act, neglect or
carelessness of the owner or occupant of any premises, any expense incurred by
the city thereby shall be charged against and collected from the water
consumer, and water service may be discontinued until the cause is corrected
and the amount charged collected.
   (C)   In the event a consumer makes a complaint that the meter reading
appears excessive, the meter will, on written request and deposit of
appropriate sum, be tested by the city. The consumer may, if he or she so
desires, be present when the test is made. Charges for the meter test shall be
in accordance with a regular schedule adopted by a resolution of the Council
and which may be amended from time to time in the same manner; provided that, a
schedule of fees, together with the date of adoption of each fee, shall be kept
on file in the office of the City Administrator and the City Engineer, and
available for distribution upon request therefor.
   (D)   The fees shall be uniformly enforced upon the adoption or amendment.
When the test shows an accurate measurement of water, or error of over 2% in
favor of the consumer, the amount deposited shall be retained by the city to
cover part of the expense of making a test and the bill adjusted accordingly.
In the event the test should show an error of over 2% in favor of the city, the
deposit will be refunded to the consumer, a correctly calibrated meter will be
installed and the bill will be adjusted accordingly. The adjustment, pertaining
to both parties, shall not extend back more than one year from the date of the
written request for the test, and the minimum charge shall not be affected.
   (E)   All water meters and outside registers shall be, and shall remain, the
property of the city and may be removed or replaced or changed by the city
whenever deemed necessary. City employees delegated for that purpose shall have
free access at reasonable hours of the day to all parts of every building and
premises connected to the city water system for reading, for servicing and for
repair of meter and inspection of water piping.

§ 53.03 SEWER SYSTEM CHARGES.
   (A)   Sewer system charges are hereby imposed upon all units of service in a
total amount sufficient to pay the costs of the treatment system. Sewer system
charges consist of the fixed capital charge (FCC), the reserve capital charge
(RCC) and the variable user charge.
   (B)   The fixed capital charge (FCC) shall be an amount necessary to recover
the capital costs associated with the portion of the treatment works capacity
currently in use, including, but not limited to, the cost of capital
improvements, sewer billing and administration. The total revenue to be raised
through FCC shall be in the same percentage to annual capital cost repayment as
the fraction of flow and loading treatment capacity currently received at the
treatment works. The FCC for participants in the industrial pretreatment
program shall be based on their individual flow and loading capacity included
in the treatment works capacity. The FCC for all other system users shall be
determined at an amount proportional to water meter size.

for all connections shall be based upon the flow and load characteristics of
wastewater discharged by each user, as estimated by water meter readings, and
shall be collected in a total amount sufficient to recover the annual operation
and maintenance costs of the treatment works. Each industrial unit of service
shall be subject to appropriate metering and monitoring.
   (E)   An industrial pretreatment charge is hereby imposed upon all
industrial units of service subject to national and local industrial
pretreatment standards. The industrial pretreatment charge shall be in the
amount necessary to recover the administrative costs associated with permitting
and monitoring the discharge of industrial wastewater into the treatment
system. The costs of laboratory analyses of wastewater constituents shall be
borne by each individual unit of service, respectively.
   (F)   Each user shall pay operation, maintenance and replacement costs in
proportion to the user’s proportionate contribution of wastewater flows and
loadings to the treatment plan, with the minimum rate for loadings of BOD, TSS
and phosphorus being the rate established for concentrations of normal domestic
strength wastewater.
   (G)   The Finance Director shall maintain a proper system of accounts
suitable for determining the operation and maintenance, equipment replacement
and debt retirement costs of the treatment works and shall furnish the Council
with a report of the costs annually.
   (H)   (1)   The Council shall annually determine whether or not sufficient
revenue is being generated for the effective operation, maintenance,
replacement and management of the treatment works, and whether sufficient
revenue is being generated for debt retirement.
      (2)   The Council will also determine whether the user charges are
distributed proportionately to each user in accordance with this subchapter and
§ 204(b)(2)(A) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended.
      (3)   The city shall thereafter, but not later than December, reassess
and as necessary revise the sewer service charge system then in use to insure
the proportionality of the user charges and to insure the sufficiency of funds
to maintain the capacity and performance to which the facilities were
constructed, and to retire the construction debt.

§ 53.04 RATES AND CHARGES.
   (A)   Charges and rates shall be made against each lot, parcel of land or
premises which may have an active sewer connection with the wastewater disposal
system or which may otherwise discharge wastewater either directly or
indirectly into the system or any part thereof. The charges and rates shall be
based upon the quantity of wastewater discharged thereon or therein as the
quantity may be measured by wastewater flow meters or the water meter serving
the lot, parcel of land or premises.
   (B)   Occupants of any lot, parcel of land or premises discharging into the
sanitary sewer but not using city water wholly or partly shall, at their own
expense, be required to install meters or other measuring devices approved by
the City Engineer to measure either the water used or the discharge to the
sanitary sewer. Occupants of any lot, parcel of land or premises desiring
credit for water consumed for purposes where the water is not returned to the
sanitary sewer, must at their own expense, separately meter the water for the
uses.
   (C)   Charges for residential sewer service shall be based on a “winter
quarter” meter reading. The “winter quarter” meter reading shall include three
of the following months as shall be designated by the Council: November;
December; January; February; and March. The amount of wastewater discharged in
the “winter quarter” shall be used to compute the quarterly charge for each
residential user and the charge shall apply for the remaining three quarters of
the year. Charges for commercial and industrial sewer service shall be based on
the metered wastewater flow measured quarterly.
   (D)   For any lot, parcel of land or premises from which connection is made
with the wastewater disposal system, or which discharges wastewater into the
wastewater disposal system, either directly or indirectly, the charges and
rates for the first payment period after the beginning date of wastewater
discharge into the wastewater disposal system, shall be based upon the per the
pro rata amount of the FCC and RCC and the wastewater discharged at the
established rates.
   (E)   The pretreatment program provides for the recovery of costs from
industrial users of the wastewater disposal system for the implementation of
the program. The applicable charges or fees shall be set forth in the schedule
of rates and charges to be adopted by the Council. The charges and fees may
include:
      (1)   Fees for monitoring, inspections and surveillance procedures of
industrial wastewater flows;
      (2)   Fees for permit applications;
      (3)   Appeal fees; and

         (b)   When the influent concentration of any of these pollutants
exceeds its limit, the city shall immediately investigate to determine the
source of the loading increase to the collection system. If the loading
increase originates at a single source, corrective action will be to assess
fines if a permit violation at the source is occurring or to revise permit
limitations to more stringent levels if a violation is not occurring. If the
loading increase originates from several sources, fines will be assessed if
permit violations are occurring, limitations will be established where no
limitations existed previously, or limitations may be revised to more stringent
levels.
      (3)   Any wastewater having a pH less than 5.0 or having any other
corrosive property capable of causing damage or hazard to structures, equipment
and personnel of the wastewater disposal system;
      (4)   Any liquid or vapor having a temperature higher than 150°F (65°C)
or causing, individually or in combination with other wastewater, the influent
at the wastewater treatment plant to have a temperature exceeding 104°F (40°C);
      (5)   Solid or viscous substances in quantities or of a size capable of
causing obstruction to the flow in sewers, or other interference with the
proper operating of the sewage works such as, but not limited to, ashes, spent

grains, spent hops, waste paper, asphalt residues, residues from refining or
processing of fuel or lubricating oil, glass grinding or polishing wastes;
      (6)   Any chlorinated solvents, pesticides or other substances in the
form of noxious or malodorous liquids, gases or solids which either singly or
by interaction with other wastes are capable of creating a public nuisance or
hazard to life or are sufficient to prevent entry into the sewers for their
maintenance and repair;
      (7)   Any substance which may cause the wastewater disposal system’s
effluent or any other product of the wastewater treatment process such as
residues, sludges or scums, to be unsuitable for reclamation and reuse or to
interfere with the reclamation process. In no case, shall a substance
discharged to the wastewater disposal system cause the system to be in non-
compliance with sludge use or disposal criteria, guidelines or regulations
developed under § 405 of the Act; any criteria, guidelines or regulations
affecting sludge use or disposal developed pursuant to the Solid Wastes
Disposal Act, the Clean Air Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act or state
standards applicable to the sludge management method being used;
      (8)   Any substance which will cause the wastewater disposal system to
violate its NPDES and/or state disposal system permit or the receiving water
quality standards; and
      (9)   Any wastewater which creates conditions at or near the wastewater
disposal system which violates any statute or any rule, regulations or
ordinance of any public agency or state or federal regulatory body.
   (D)   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged the following
described substances, materials, waters or wastes if it appears likely in the
opinion of the City Engineer that the wastes can harm either the sewers,
wastewater treatment process or equipment, have an adverse effect on the
receiving stream, or can otherwise endanger life, limb, public property or
constitute a nuisance. In forming his or her opinion as to the acceptability of
these waste, the City Engineer will give consideration to the factors as the
quantities of subject wastes in relation to flows and velocities in the sewers,
materials of construction of the sewers, nature of the wastewater treatment
process, capacity of the wastewater treatment plant, degree of treatability of
wastes in the wastewater treatment plant and other pertinent factors. The
substances prohibited are:
      (1)   Any water or waste containing fats, wax, grease or oils, whether
emulsified or not, in excess of 100 mg/l or containing substances which may
solidify or become viscous at temperatures between 32°F and 150°F (0°C and
65°C);
      (2)   Any waters or wastes containing strong acid iron pickling wastes,
or concentrated plating solutions whether neutralized or not;
      (3)   Any waters or wastes containing phenols or other taste-or-odor
producing substances, in concentrations exceeding limits after treatment of the
composite wastewater, to meet the requirements of the state, federal or other
public agencies of jurisdiction for the discharge to the receiving waters;
      (4)   Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of the half-life or
concentration as may exceed limits in compliance with applicable state or
federal regulations;
      (5)   Any waters or wastes having a pH in excess of 9.5; or
      (6)   Materials which exert or cause:
         (a)   Unusual concentrations of inert suspended solids (such as but
not limited to, Fullers earth, lime slurries and lime residues) or of dissolved
solids (such as but not limited to, sodium chloride and sodium sulfate);
         (b)   Excessive discoloration (such as but not limited to, dye wastes
and vegetable tanning solutions);
         (c)   Unusual BOD, chemical oxygen demand or chlorine requirements in
quantities as to constitute a significant load on the wastewater treatment
works;
         (d)   Unusual volume or concentration of wastes constituting (slugs),
as defined herein; or
         (e)   Any unpolluted water including, but not limited to, cooling
water, storm water or ground water.
   (E)   (1)   Federal pretreatment standards. Federal pretreatment standards
promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pursuant to the
Act shall be met by all users which are subject to standards in any instance
where they are more stringent than the limitations in this subchapter unless
the City Engineer has applied for, and obtained from the MPCA approval to
modify the specific limits in the federal pretreatment standards. When
requested, an application for modifications of the federal pretreatment
standards will be considered for submittal by the City Engineer when the
wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of all the pollutants.
CONSISTENT REMOVAL shall mean reduction in the amount of pollutant or
alteration of the nature of a pollutant which is in the influent to the
wastewater treatment system to a less toxic or harmless state by the time it is
discharged in the effluent. The reduction or alteration will be demonstrated by
averaging the lowest 50% of the removals measured by 12 or more samples
according to the procedures set forth in 40 C.F.R. § 403.7(c)(2) of the General
Pretreatment Regulations for Existing and New Sources of Pollution.
      (2)   State requirements. State requirements and limitations on
discharges shall be met by all users which are subject to standards in any
instance in which they are more stringent than federal requirements and
limitations or those in this subchapter.
      (3)   City’s right of revision. The city reserves the right to establish,
by ordinance, more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the
wastewater disposal system if deemed necessary to comply with the objectives
presented in §
53.20 of this chapter.
      (4)   Dilution. No user shall increase the use of process water, or in
any way, attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for
adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained herein,
contained in the federal pretreatment standards or contained in any state
requirements.
   (F)   Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of
prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this subchapter. Where
necessary, facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials
shall be provided and maintained at the owner or user’s own cost and expense.
Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this
protection shall be submitted to the City Engineer for review, and shall be
approved by the City Engineer before construction of the facility. Review and
approval of plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial
user from the responsibility to modify the user’s facility as necessary to meet
the requirements of this subchapter.
   (G)   If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be
discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess
the characteristics enumerated in divisions (G)(3) and (G)(4) below, and which,
in the judgment of the City Engineer, may have a deleterious effect upon the
wastewater disposal system processes, equipment or receiving waters or which
otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the City
Engineer may:
      (1)   Reject the wastes;
      (2)   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
the public sewers;
      (3)   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or
      (4)   Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treatment
of the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges. If the City
Engineer permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the design
and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the review and
approval of the City Engineer, and subject to the requirements of all
applicable laws.
   (H)   Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the City Engineer, they are necessary for the proper handling of the
liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts or any flammable wastes,
sand or other harmful ingredients; except that, the interceptors shall not be
required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall
be of a type and capacity approved by the City Engineer and shall be located as
to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Where
installed, all grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be maintained by the
owner, at his or her expense, in continuously efficient operation at all times.
   (I)   Where preliminary treatment of flow-equalizing facilities are provided
for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory
and effective operation by the owner at his or her expense.
   (J)   (1)   Monitoring facilities to allow inspections, sampling and flow
measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems shall be
provided and operated by all significant industrial users or other industrial
user which may have a significant effect as determined by the City Engineer.
The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user’s premises, the
City Engineer may, when a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship
on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or
sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or
parked vehicles. There shall be ample room in or near the sampling manhole or
facility to allow accurate sampling and compositing of samples for analysis.
The facility, sampling and measurement equipment shall be maintained at all
times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
      (2)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and
monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the City Engineer’s
requirements and all applicable construction standards and specifications.
Construction shall be completed within 90 days following written notification
by the City Engineer, unless a time extension is otherwise granted by the City
Engineer. The City Engineer may in certain cases elect to delegate to the city
the responsibilities for sampling or monitoring the wastewater from an industry
if the City Engineer and the industry are in agreement, in which case total
costs to the city for monitoring and sampling will be assessed to the industry.
   (K)   All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this subchapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at the control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with EPA approved methods
contained in 40 C.F.R. part 136 to reflect the effect of constituents upon the
wastewater disposal system and to determine the existence of hazards to life,
limb and property. (The particular analyses involved will determine whether a
24-hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a
grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and
suspended solids analyses are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls
whereas pH is determined from periodic grab samples.)
   (L)   No statement contained in this section shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the city for treatment, subject to payment therefor, by the
industrial concern; providing that, federal categorical, prohibited discharge
or NPDES permit limitations are not violated. The user pays operation,
maintenance and replacement costs in proportion to the user’s proportionate
contribution of wastewater flows and loadings to the treatment plant, and no
user is charged at a rate less than that of normal domestic strength
wastewater.
   (M)   Any person, owner, lessee or occupant, and any plumber or building
contractor who has heretofore made or permitted to be made, or shall hereafter
make or permit to be made, any connection to the sanitary system for the
purpose of discharging into the system the substances described in this
division shall immediately remove the connection. If the connection is not
removed within 15 days after notice of the violation delivered personally to
the person, owner, lessee or occupant or posted on the premises where the
violation may occur, the Council may order the City Engineer to cause the
connection to be removed at the expense of the city, and the expense of the
removal shall be assessed against the premises and certified to the County
Auditor for collection in the same manner as other special assessments, and the
same shall become a lien on the property until paid. Any person, owner, lessee,
occupant, plumber or building contractor may in addition be prosecuted for
having committed a misdemeanor.

§ 53.26 LIABILITY.
   (A)   Each user or owner shall be responsible for cleaning the sewer
connection from the house or building to the sewer main. The city shall
maintain the sewer main and interceptor lines as well as the service pipe
installed within its public right-of-way. The city shall not be liable for any
stoppages in the sewers or services. Each user should provide a suitable back
water valve to prevent flooding of basements in the event of sewer stoppage.
   (B)   (1)   Any sewer connection that is abandoned for non-use or found not
to meet all requirements of this subchapter shall be disconnected and plugged
at the sewer location by a means acceptable to the City Engineer.
      (2)   All costs and expenses incidental to disconnecting the building
sewer shall be borne by the owner.

proposing to discharge wastewater to the wastewater disposal system file a
periodic discharge report. The discharge report may include, but not be limited
to, nature of process, rates of flow, mass discharge rate, raw material and
production quantities, hours of operation, number and classification of
employees, compliance status with any state or federal pretreatment standards
or other information which relates to the generation of waste, including
wastewater constituents and characteristics in the wastewater discharge.
Reports may also include the chemical constituents and quantity of liquid or
gaseous materials stored on site, even though they may not normally be
discharged. At a minimum, a summary of the data indicating each industrial
user’s compliance with this subchapter shall be prepared quarterly and
submitted to the City Engineer. In addition to discharge reports, the City
Engineer may require information in the form of wastewater discharge permit
applications, self-monitoring reports and compliance schedules.

as it may be amended from time to time. In all cases where the City
Administrator, or designee, shall have determined, after hearing or notice of
hearing and default, that any nuisance shall be abated, he or she shall issue
an order requiring the abatement of the nuisance within a time named in the
order, and shall serve the order of abatement upon the person or entity who
maintains, operates or permits the nuisance. In the event the nuisance is not
abated by the party within the time provided in the order, the City
Administrator, or his or her designee, shall cause the nuisance to be abated.
      (4)   Notice of motion for summary enforcement. Written notice of any
motion for summary enforcement shall be made as provided for in M.S. § 463.17
(Hazardous and Substandard Building Act), as it may be amended from time to
time.
      (5)   Grievance. Any person aggrieved by an order of abatement may appeal
the order to the City Council. An appeal shall be taken within ten days from
the date of the order of abatement by filing with the City Administrator and
the City Administrator a notice of appeal which shall specify the grounds of
appeal. The matter shall be placed on the City Council's next regularly-
scheduled meeting for a public hearing. An appeal stays all proceedings in
furtherance of the action appealed from. The City Council may reverse or
affirm, in whole or in part, or may modify the order of abatement and may issue
and order, requirement, decision or determination as is consistent with city
ordinances.
      (6)   Failure to abate by owner. Any person or entity who fails to remove
and abate any nuisance after proper notice, the opportunity to be heard and
final order shall be liable to the city for all expenses incurred in the
removal and abatement of the nuisance. The city shall have the right to recover
all such costs and a lien may be imposed upon the property to secure payment of
the costs. The procedure for establishing the lien shall be in accordance with
M.S. § 429.101, as it may be amended from time to time.
   (B)   Procedure.
      (1)   Whenever the officer charged with enforcement determines that a
public nuisance is being maintained or exists on premises in the city, the
officer shall notify in writing the owner of record or occupant of the premises
of the fact and order that the nuisance be terminated or abated. The notice of
violation shall specify the steps to be taken to abate the nuisance and the
time within which the nuisance is to be abated. If the notice of violation is
not complied with within the time specified, the enforcing officer shall report
that fact forthwith to the City Administrator or designee. Thereafter, the City
Administrator or designee may, after notice to the owner or occupant and an
opportunity to be heard, determine that the condition identified in the notice
of violation is a nuisance and further order that, if the nuisance is not
abated within the time prescribed by the City Administrator or designee, the
city may seek injunctive relief by serving a copy of the City Administrator
order and notice of motion for summary enforcement.
      (2)   Whoever has been given one notice to abate a nuisance and,
subsequently, within a 12-month period from the date of the first notice
commits a second violation of this subchapter at the same location, the City
Engineer, Street Superintendent, Police Department or other designated person
may elect to commence an administrative violation procedure or criminal
violation procedure immediately and without providing the violator an
opportunity to correct the violation. However, the City Engineer, Street
Superintendent, Police Department or other designated person may not abate the
violation without complying with the provisions consistent with this division
(B).
   (C)   Emergency procedure; summary enforcement. In cases of emergency, where
delay in abatement required to complete the notice and procedure requirements
set forth in division (B) above will permit a continuing nuisance to
unreasonably endanger public health safety or welfare, the City Council may
order summary enforcement and abate the nuisance. To proceed with summary
enforcement, the officer charged with enforcement shall determine that a public
nuisance exists or is being maintained on premises in the city and that delay
in abatement of the nuisance will unreasonably endanger public health, safety
or welfare. The enforcement officer shall notify in writing the occupant or
owner of the premises of the nature of the nuisance and of the city's intention
to seek summary enforcement and the time and place of the City Council meeting
to consider the question of summary enforcement. The City Council shall
determine whether or not the condition identified in the notice to the owner or
occupant is a nuisance, whether public health, safety or welfare will be
unreasonably endangered by delay in abatement required to complete the
procedure set forth in division (A) above, and may order that the nuisance be
immediately terminated or abated. If the nuisance is not immediately terminated
or abated, the City Council may order summary enforcement and abate the
nuisance.
   (D)   Immediate abatement. Nothing in this section shall prevent the city,
without notice or other process, from immediately abating any condition which
poses an imminent and serious hazard to human life or safety.
   (E)   Unlawful parties or gatherings. When law enforcement determines that a
gathering is creating such a noise disturbance as prohibited under §
90.23(D), the officer may order all persons present, other than the owner or
tenant of the premises where the disturbance is occurring, to disperse
immediately. No person shall refuse to leave after being ordered to do so by
law enforcement. Every owner or tenant of such premises who has knowledge of
the disturbance shall make every reasonable effort to see that the disturbance
is stopped.
   (F)   Judicial remedy. Nothing in this section shall prevent the city from
seeking a judicial remedy when no other adequate administrative remedy exists.

§ 90.30 RECOVERY OF COST.
   (A)   Personal liability. The owner of the premises on which a nuisance has
been abated by the city, or a person who has caused a public nuisance on
property not owned by that person, shall be personally liable for the cost to
the city of the abatement, including administrative costs. As soon as the work
has been completed and the cost determined, the City Administrator or other
city person designated shall prepare a bill for the cost and mail it to the
owner. Thereupon the amount shall be immediately due and payable at the office
of the City Administrator.
   (B)   Assessment. After notice and hearing as provided in Minn. Stat. §
429.061, as it may be amended from time to time, if the nuisance is a public
health or safety hazard on private property, the accumulation of snow and ice
on public sidewalks, the growth of weeds on private property or outside the
traveled portion of streets, or unsound or insect-infected trees, the City
Administrator shall, on or before November 30 next following abatement of the
nuisance, list the total unpaid charges along with all other such charges as
well as other charges for current services to be assessed under Minn. Stat. §
429.101 against each separate lot or parcel to which the charges are
attributable. The City Council may then spread the charges against the property
under that statute and any other pertinent statutes for certification to the
county auditor and collection along with current taxes the following year or in
annual installments, not exceeding ten, as the City Council may determine in
each case.

(2002 Code, § 6.26) (Ord. 119, Sixth Series, effective 4-27-2010; Ord. 82,
Seventh Series, effective 4-5-2019)
§ 91.02 DOGS AND CATS.
   (A)   (1)   Running at large prohibited. It shall be unlawful for a dog or
cat of any person who owns, harbors, or keeps a dog or cat, to run at large. A
person, who owns, harbors, or keeps a dog or cat which runs at large shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor. Dogs or cats on a leash and accompanied by a
responsible person or accompanied by and under the control and direction of a
responsible person, so as to be effectively restrained by command as by leash,
shall be permitted on streets or on public land unless posted with signs
indicating dogs or cats are prohibited.
      (2)   Confining dogs or cats by electronic control measures such as an
invisible fence with an electronic collar is permitted which shall only be used
in the rear yards of lots so that the animal cannot appear to be free to
threaten or upset people who may be using the public sidewalks or streets
fronting the lot. If the electronic restraint is not sufficient to confine a
dog or cat to the rear yard of the property, and the animal is found to have
crossed beyond the electronic barrier, then the electronic confinement shall no
longer be considered adequate for that animal, and the animal must be
restrained by physical means such as by leash or cable.
   (B)   License required for dogs and cats.
      (1)   All dogs and cats over the age of six months kept, harbored, or
maintained in the city shall be licensed and registered with the city. For each
dog or cat required to be registered and licensed, the owner must complete an
application for license providing the owner's name and address and the name,
breed, color, and sex of the dog or cat. No license shall be granted for a dog
that has not been vaccinated against rabies, as evidenced by a certificate by a
veterinarian qualified to practice in the state in which the dog is vaccinated.
      (2)   Upon providing a complete application, the required rabies
vaccination certificate, and payment of the license fee the City Administrator
shall issue to the owner a license certificate and metallic tag for each dog or
cat licensed. The tag shall have stamped on it the year for which it is issued
and the number corresponding with the number on the dog or cat license
certificate. Every owner must provide each dog or cat with a collar to which
the license tag must be affixed, and shall see that the collar and tag are
constantly worn by each dog or cat. In case a tag is lost or destroyed, a
duplicate tag shall be issued by the City Administrator upon payment by the
owner of the duplicate tag fee. Tags are not transferable from one dog or cat
to another and no refunds will be made on any license fee or tag because of the
death of a dog or cat or the owners leaving the city prior to the expiration of
the license period.
      (3)   The licensing provisions of this division (B) shall not apply to
dogs or cat whose owners are nonresidents temporarily within the city, nor to
dogs or cats brought into the city for the purpose of participating in any dog
or cat show. Documented service dogs do not require a license.
      (4)   The funds received by the City Administrator from all licenses and
metallic tags fees shall first be used to defray any costs incidental to the
enforcement of this chapter; including, but not restricted to, the costs of
licenses, metallic tags, and impounding and maintenance of dogs or cats.
   (C)   Dogs and cats.
      (1)   Number allowed per dwelling unit. It shall be unlawful for any
person, or a combination of any persons who reside at a residence, to own,
harbor or keep more than three dogs or three cats or more than a combination of
four dogs and cats at any dwelling unit. This division (C)(1) does not apply to
a fresh litter of pups or kittens which may be kept for a period of three
months before that keeping shall be deemed to be a kennel.
      (2)   Kennels.
         (a)   Definition of kennel. The keeping of more than three dogs or
three cats or more than a combination of four dogs and cats at a residence or
dwelling unit whether owned by the same person or not and for whatever purpose,
shall constitute a KENNEL, except that of a fresh litter of pups or kittens
which may be kept for a period of three months before that keeping shall be
deemed to be a KENNEL.
         (b)   Kennel as a nuisance. Because kennels may cause discomfort to
persons in the area by way of smell, noise, hazard, and general aesthetic
depreciation of premises they are hereby declared to be a public nuisance and
no person shall keep or maintain a kennel within any residences or dwelling
unit within any area of the city zoned residential.
      (3)   Vaccination.
         (a)   All dogs and cats kept harbored, maintained, or transported
within the city shall be vaccinated against rabies at least once every three
years as evidenced by a certificate of vaccination by a veterinarian qualified
to practice in the state in which the dog or cat is vaccinated. The certificate
of vaccination shall provide:
            1.   The date of the vaccination;
            2.   The owner's name and address;
            3.   The animal's name (if applicable), sex, description and
weight;
            4.   The type of vaccine; and
            5.   The veterinarian's signature.
         (b)   Owners must always have a current certificate of vaccination for
each dog or cat required to be vaccinated and upon demand made by the City
Administrator, the Animal Control Officer or a police officer, the owner shall
present for examination the required certificate of vaccination for each dog or
cat. In cases where certificates are not presented, the owner or keeper of the
dog or cat shall have seven days in which to present the certificate(s). It is
unlawful for any person to keep or harbor a dog or cat that is either
unvaccinated for rabies or has not been vaccinated for rabies within three
years. It is also unlawful for any person to not present a certificate of
vaccination as requested and within the time period required in this section.
(Ord. 22, Eighth Series, effective 2-27-2022) Penalty, see §
91.99
§ 91.03 BARKING/CRYING/WHINING DOGS.
   (A)   Habitual barking. It shall be unlawful for any person to keep or
harbor a dog which habitually barks or cries. Habitual barking shall be defined
as barking for repeated intervals of at least five minutes with less than one
minute of interruption. The barking must also be audible off of the owner’s or
caretaker’s premises.
   (B)   Damage to property. It shall be unlawful for any person’s dog or other
animal to damage any lawn, garden, or other property, whether or not the owner
has knowledge of the damage.
   (C)   Cleaning up litter. The owner of any animal or person having the
custody or control of any animal shall be responsible for cleaning up any feces
of the animal and disposing of the feces in a sanitary manner whether on their
own property, on the property of others or on public property.
   (D)   Warrant required. The Animal Control Officer or police officer shall
not enter the property of the owner of an animal described in this section
unless the officer has first obtained the permission of the owner to do so or
has obtained a warrant issued by a court of competent jurisdiction to search
for and seize the animal.

§ 91.04 [RESERVED].
§ 91.05 [RESERVED].
§ 91.06 [RESERVED].
§ 91.07 IMPOUNDING ANIMALS.
   (A)   Running at large. Any animal running at large is hereby declared a
public nuisance. Any Animal Control Officer or police officer may impound any
animal found unlicensed or any animal found running at large and shall give
notice of the impounding to the owner of the animal, if known. Except as
otherwise provided in this subchapter, it shall be unlawful to kill, destroy or
otherwise cause injury to any animal, including dogs and cats running at large.
   (B)   Biting animals. Any animal that has not been inoculated by a live
modified rabies vaccine and which has bitten any person, wherein the skin has
been punctured or the services of a doctor are required, shall be confined in
the city pound or local humane society for a period of not less than ten days,
at the expense of the owner. The animal may be released at the end of the time
if healthy and free from symptoms of rabies and by the payment of all costs by
the owner. However, if the owner of the animal shall elect immediately upon
receipt of notice of need for the confinement by the officer to voluntarily and
immediately confine the animal for the required period of time in a veterinary
hospital of the owner’s choosing, not outside of the county in which the city
is located, and provide immediate proof of confinement in the manner as may be
required, the owner may do so. If, however, the animal has been inoculated with
a live modified rabies vaccine and the owner has proof of the vaccination by a
certificate from a licensed veterinarian, the owner may confine the dog or
other animal to the owner’s property.
   (C)   Reclaiming. All animals transported to the pound shall be kept, with
humane treatment and sufficient food and water for their comfort, up to five
regular business days, unless the animal is a dangerous animal as defined under
§
91.32 of this chapter, in which case it shall be kept for ten regular business
days. The provisions of M.S. § 343.21, as it may be amended from time to time,
relating to overworked and mistreated animals apply to anyone seeking to
reclaim an animal. In all cases, an owner or keeper desiring to reclaim an
animal from the pound shall:
      (1)   Pay the applicable release fee;
      (2)   Pay all maintenance costs of the pound for housing and caring for
the animal for each day the animal is in the pound; and
      (3)   Provide proof of a current city issued license or obtain the
required city issued license for an impounded dog as required in this chapter.
   (D)   Unclaimed animals.
      (1)   At the expiration of the times established in division (C) above,
if the animal has not been reclaimed in accordance with the provisions of this
section, the officer appointed to enforce this section may let any person claim
the animal by complying with all provisions in this subchapter, or the officer
may sell the animal to the University of Minnesota, or cause the animal to be
destroyed in a proper and humane manner and shall properly dispose of the
remains thereof.
      (2)   Any money collected under this section shall be payable to the City
Administrator.

Animal Control Officer making a contemporaneous complaint about the animal;
   (B)   The officer reasonably believes the animal meets either the habitual
barking or noise criteria set out in §

large at this address on a prior date;
   (D)   The officer has made a reasonable attempt to contact the owner of the
animal and the property to be entered and those attempts have either failed or
have been ignored;
   (E)   The seizure will not involve the forced entry into a private
residence. Use of a pass key obtained from a property manager, landlord,
innkeeper or other authorized person to have that key shall not be considered
unauthorized entry; and

chickens, in which case no permit shall be issued. No permit shall be issued
for an incomplete application or for the keeping of chickens on any rental
premises.
      (3)   A permit for the keeping of chickens may be revoked or suspended by

use of property shall remain enforceable and take precedence over a permit.
Private restrictions include, but are not limited to, deed restrictions,
condominium master deed restrictions, neighborhood association by-laws,
covenant declarations and deed restrictions. A permit issued to a person whose
premises are subject to private restrictions and/or covenants that prohibit the
keeping of chickens is void. The interpretation and enforcement of the private
restriction is the sole responsibility of the private parties involved.
   (H)   Refusal to grant or renew permit. The Animal Control Officer may
refuse to grant or renew a permit to keep or maintain chickens for failure to
comply with the provisions of this section, submitting an inaccurate or

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 95.01 WEED ELIMINATION.
   (A)   Weeds declared a nuisance; duty of owner.
      (1)   Any weeds, whether noxious or not as defined by state law, or turf
grass growing at a height greater than six inches upon any privately-owned lot
or tract of land in the city or upon any public boulevard or similar public
property alongside the traveled portion of a street or alley abutting the
private property are hereby declared to be a nuisance, except as authorized in
§
95.04 of this chapter. Turf grass is any type of vegetative grasses used for
recreational or residential purposes.
      (2)   The owner or occupant of any such property or abutting property
shall prevent the nuisance and, if the nuisance occurs, the owner or occupant
shall cut and remove the weeds from the property or cut the turf grass to a
height of less than six inches.
   (B)   Notice; abatement and assessment.
      (1)   The city shall determine that conditions exist which may violate
this section. Upon identification of a violation, notice shall be served upon
the property owner or responsible party as provided herein. The notice shall
identify the nature of the nuisance and the violation of this chapter and it
shall specify an abatement deadline, which shall be determined by the
enforcement officer and which shall allow for a reasonable amount of time for
abatement, and it shall order the property owner or responsible party to abate
the nuisance within the specified time. Upon receipt or posting of the notice,
the property owner or responsible party shall abate the nuisance with the time
specified in the notice. For purposes of this chapter, when service of a notice
is required, any one or more of the following methods of service upon the
property owner or responsible party shall be adequate:
         (a)   By personal service;
         (b)   By certified mail via the United States Postal Service; or
         (c)   If the appropriate party or mailing address cannot be determine
after reasonable effort, or if the notice sent certified mail is returned
undelivered, or if the nature of the nuisance is such that delay resulting from
personal service or service by mail would unreasonably delay abatement of the
nuisance by posting a copy of the notice in a conspicuous place on the
property; in which case, the notice shall also state the date on which it was
posted.
      (2)   The property owner or responsible party may appeal the order to the
City Administrator; provided that, any appeal must be submitted in writing to
the City Administrator no later than the time for abatement specified in the
notice or ten days, whichever is sooner.
      (3)   If the property owner or responsible party requests and appeal in
compliance with the provisions established in this division (B), a hearing
before the City Administrator, or his or her designee, shall be scheduled
within 15 days after the filing of the notice of appeal. Following the hearing,
the City Administrator, or his or her designee, shall report its determination
and findings to the City Council and the City Council shall determine whether a
violation is evident. The property owner or responsible party may present at
the City Council meeting and may present information to the City Council as
determined necessary by the City Council. Upon finding a violation, the City
Council shall order that the cited conditions be abated.
      (4)   The city shall proceed with making the necessary arrangements to
have the cited violation abated. Any and all costs that may be incurred by the
city to alleviate the cited violation shall be the property owner’s or
responsible party’s obligation.
      (5)   Failure by a property owner or responsible party to reimburse the
city for any reasonable costs incurred concerning the enforcement of this
chapter shall be cause to certify the costs to the County Auditor as a special
assessment against the property in question.
   (C)   Abatement notice. In all cases of nuisances described in this chapter,
the written notice to be served upon the property owner or responsible party
shall identify property address or parcel identification number of the property
in question, include a description of the nuisance, advise the property owner
or responsible party he, she or they may appeal the order to the City
Administrator; provided that, any appeal must be submitted in writing to the
City Administrator no later than the time for abatement specified in the notice
or ten days, whichever is sooner, and advise that an administrative fee in an
amount approved by Council and costs of abatement incurred by the city shall be
assessed and a lien may be imposed on the property to secure the payment, and
that a third or subsequent violations with a 12-month calendar year shall be a
misdemeanor.

considered to be PROHIBITED PLANTS.
      RAIN GARDEN. A native plant garden that is designed not only to
aesthetically improve properties, but also to reduce the amount of storm water
and accompanying pollutants from entering streams, lakes and rivers.
      RANK VEGETATION. Uncultivated vegetation growing at a rapid rate due to
unplanned, unintentional or accidental circumstances.

TREE DISEASES
§ 96.01 DECLARATION OF POLICY.
   The City Council determines that the health of the elm, oak and ash trees
within the city is threatened by fatal diseases known as Dutch Elm, Oak Wilt
and Emerald Ash bore diseases, and other trees may be threatened by other
epidemic diseases of shade trees. The City Council further determines that the
loss of elm, oak and other trees growing upon public and private property would
substantially depreciate the value of property within the city and impair the
safety, good order, general welfare and convenience of the public. It is
declared to be the intention of the City Council to control and prevent the
spread of those diseases and this subchapter is enacted for that purpose.
(2002 Code, § 6.71) (Ord. 110, Sixth Series, effective 7-4-2009)
§ 96.02 DESIGNATED ENFORCEMENT OFFICER.
   It shall be the duty of the officer designated by the City Council to
coordinate, under the direction and control of the City Council, all activities
of the city relating to the control and prevention of Dutch Elm disease, Oak
Wilt disease, Emerald Ash bore and other epidemic diseases of shade trees. The
officer shall recommend to the City Council the details of a program for the
control of diseases, and perform the duties incident to a program adopted by
the City Council.

respond to the notice within 14 days of receipt of the notice to what will be

§ 111.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   Because the city recognizes that many persons under the age of 21
years purchase or otherwise obtain, possess and use tobacco, tobacco-related
devices, electronic delivery devices and nicotine or lobelia delivery products,
and the sales, possession and use are violations of both state and federal
laws; and because studies, which the city hereby accepts and adopts, have shown
that most smokers begin smoking before they have reached the age of 21 years
and that those persons who reach the age of 18 years without having started
smoking are significantly less likely to begin smoking; and because tobacco use
has been shown to be the cause of several serious health problems which
subsequently place a financial burden on all levels of government; this chapter
shall be intended to regulate the sale, possession and use of tobacco, tobacco-
related devices, electronic delivery devices and nicotine or lobelia delivery
products for the purpose of enforcing and furthering existing laws, to protect
minors against the serious effects associated with the illegal use of tobacco,
tobacco-related devices, electronic delivery devices and nicotine or lobelia
delivery products, and to further the official public policy of the state in
regard to preventing young people from starting to smoke as stated in M.S. §
144.391, as it may be amended from time to time.
   (B)   Unregulated electronic delivery devices, commonly referred to as
electronic cigarettes, or e-cigarettes, closely resemble and purposefully mimic
the act of smoking by having users inhale vaporized liquid nicotine or other
substances created by heat through an electronic ignition system. After testing
a number of e-cigarettes from two leading manufacturers, the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) determined that various samples tested contained not only
nicotine, but also detectable levels of known carcinogens and toxic chemicals,
including tobacco-specific nitrosamines and diethylene glycol, a toxic chemical
used in antifreeze. The FDA’s testing also suggested that quality control
processes used to manufacture these products are inconsistent or non-existent.
(“Summary of results: Laboratory analysis of electronic cigarettes conducted by
FDA, “Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 7-22-2009. E-cigarettes produce a
vapor of undetermined and potentially harmful substances, which may appear
similar to smoke emitted by traditional tobacco products. Their use in
workplaces and public places where smoking of traditional tobacco products is
prohibited creates concern and confusion and leads to difficulties in enforcing
the smoking prohibitions.”)
   (C)   In making these findings, the City Council accepts the conclusions and
recommendations of Centers for Disease Control in its study Selected Cigarette
Smoking Initiation and Quitting Behaviors Among High School Students, United
States, 1997, and of the following medical professionals in these medical
journals: Khuder SA, et al., Age at Smoking Onset and its Effect on Smoking
Cessation, Addictive Behavior 24(5):673-7, September-October 1999; D’Avanzo B,
et al., Age at Starting Smoking and Number of Cigarettes Smoked, Annals of
Epidemiology 4(6):455-59, November 1994; Chen, J & Millar, WJ, Age of Smoking
Initiation: Implications for Quitting, Health Reports 9(4):39-46, Spring 1998;
Everett SA, et al., Initiation of Cigarette Smoking and Subsequent Smoking
Behavior Among U.S. High School Students, Preventive Medicine, 29(5):327-33,
November 1999, copies of which are adopted by reference.

§ 112.01 DEFINITIONS.
   Except as may otherwise be provided or clearly implied by context, all terms
shall be given their commonly accepted definitions. For the purpose of this
chapter, the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly
indicates or requires a different meaning.
   PEDDLER. A person who goes from house-to-house, door-to-door, business-to-
business, street-to- street, or any other type of place-to-place movement, for
the purpose of offering for sale, displaying or exposing for sale, selling or
attempting to sell, and delivering immediately upon sale, the goods, wares,
products, merchandise or other personal property that the person is carrying or
otherwise transporting. The term PEDDLER shall mean the same as the term
“hawker.”
   PERSON. Any natural individual, group, organization, corporation,
partnership or association. As applied to groups, organizations, corporations,
partnerships and associations, the term shall include each member, officer,
partner, associate, agent or employee.
   REGULAR BUSINESS DAY. Any day during which the city hall is normally open
for the purpose of conducting public business. Holidays defined by state law
shall not be counted as regular business days.
   SOLICITOR. A person who goes from house-to-house, door-to-door, business-to-
business, street- to-street, or any other type of place-to-place movement, for
the purpose of obtaining or attempting to obtain orders for goods, wares,
products, merchandise, other personal property or services of which he or she
may be carrying or transporting samples, or that may be described in a catalog
or by other means, and for which delivery or performance shall occur at a later
time. The absence of samples or catalogs shall not remove a person from the
scope of this provision if the actual purpose of the person's activity is to
obtain or attempt to obtain orders as discussed above. The term shall mean the
same as the term “canvasser.”
   TRANSIENT MERCHANT. A person who temporarily sets up business out of a
vehicle, trailer, boxcar, tent, other portable shelter, or empty store front
for the purpose of exposing or displaying for sale, selling or attempting to
sell, and delivering, goods, wares, products, merchandise or other personal
property and who does not remain or intend to remain in any one location for
more than 14 consecutive days.
§ 112.02 EXCEPTIONS TO DEFINITIONS.
   (A)   For the purpose of the requirements of this chapter, the terms
PEDDLER, SOLICITOR, and TRANSIENT MERCHANT shall not apply to any person
selling or attempting to sell at wholesale any goods, wares, products,
merchandise or other personal property to a retailer of the items being sold by
the wholesaler. The terms also shall not apply to any person who makes initial
contacts with other people for the purpose of establishing or trying to
establish a regular customer delivery route for the delivery of perishable food
and dairy products such as baked goods and milk, nor shall they apply to any
person making deliveries of perishable food and dairy products to the customers
on his or her established regular delivery route.
   (B)   In addition, persons conducting the type of sales commonly known as
garage sales, rummage sales, or estate sales, as well as those persons
participating in an organized multi-person bazaar or flea market, shall be
exempt from the definitions of PEDDLERS, SOLICITORS, and TRANSIENT MERCHANTS,
as shall be anyone conducting an auction as a properly licensed auctioneer, or
any officer of the court conducting a court-ordered sale. Exemption from the
definitions for the scope of this chapter shall not excuse any person from
complying with any other applicable statutory provision or local ordinance.
   (C)   Nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted to prohibit or restrict
door-to-door advocacy. Persons engaging in door-to-door advocacy shall not be
required to register as solicitors under §

pamphleteering as vehicles for the dissemination of religious, political and

make a false statement or omission upon any application form. Any false
statement in such application or any willful omission to state any information
called for on such application form shall, upon discovery of such falsehood,

license issued pursuant thereto void and of no effect to protect the applicant
from prosecution for violation of this subchapter or any part thereof.
   (C)   Application and investigation fees. At the time of the initial

change in the ownership or beneficial interest in the shares entitled to be
voted at a meeting of the shareholders of a corporate licensee, which results
in the change of voting control of the corporation by the persons owning the
shares therein, shall be deemed equivalent to a transfer of the license issued
to the corporation. The Council or any officer of the city designated by it may
at any reasonable time examine the stock transfer records and minute books of
any corporate licensee in order to verify and identify the shareholders, and

writing of intention to cancel it. Such notice must be addressed to the City
Administrator.

responsibility and exemption affidavits filed with the city under this section
shall be submitted by the Commissioner of Public Safety.
(2002 Code, § 11.03)
§ 115.05 PROCESSING OF APPLICATION.

Apprehension. The Council may approve any application for the period of the
remainder of the then current license year or for the entire ensuing license
year. All applications including proposed license periods must be consistent
with this subchapter. Prior to consideration of any application for a license,

person who, by reason of age, character, reputation, and other attributes,

justified.

§ 115.09 REVOCATION, SUSPENSION OR FINE.
   (A)   Violations and penalties.
      (1)   Upon a finding that the holder of any license granted pursuant to
this subchapter has sold alcoholic beverages to another retail licensee for the
purpose of resale, purchased alcoholic beverages from another retail licensee
for the purpose of resale, conducted or permitted the conduct of gambling on
the licensed premises in violation of the law, or failed to comply with any

the Council may revoke the license, suspend the license for a period not to
exceed 60 days, or impose a civil penalty of up to $2,000 for each violation,
or impose any combination of these sanctions. The civil penalty and/or
suspension and revocation imposed pursuant to this section shall be based on
the licensee’s total number of violations at the specific location, at which
the violation occurred, within the preceding 24-month period as follows:
         (a)   First violation: up to $500 or purchase and use of automated age
verification system;
         (b)   Second violation: up to $1,000 and up to three days license

less than five days nor more than 60 days or revocation as determined by the
City Council.
      (2)   Payment of the civil penalty shall be made within 30 days of
issuance of the citation referred to in this subsection (2). A suspension for a
third violation under this section shall be served for consecutive days
starting on the first Monday following the later of the expiration of the time
to request a hearing under this subsection (2), if a hearing is not requested,
or, if a hearing has been timely requested, the date a decision is rendered
pursuant to division (B)(4) of this section that a violation occurred. A
suspension for a fourth violation under this section shall be served in the
manner and at such time as decided by the City Council.
   (B)   Notification, hearing and appeal. The following notification, hearing
and appeals process will apply to violations of this section.
      (1)   Notice. Upon discovery of a suspected violation of this section,
the alleged violator shall be issued, either personally or by mail, a citation
that sets forth the alleged violations and which shall inform the alleged
violator of his or her right to be heard on the accusation. The person
responsible for the violation must either pay the scheduled fine or request a
hearing under subsection (2) below. Payment of the fine constitutes admission
of the violation.
      (2)   Hearings. No suspension or revocation shall take effect until the
license holder has been given an opportunity for a hearing before the hearing
examiner, pursuant to M.S. §§ 14.57 through 14.69, as they may be amended from
time to time. Unless a hearing is required as stated in the first sentence of
this subsection (2), any person accused of violating this section who desires a
hearing must submit a request to the hearing examiner within 15 days after
issuance of the citation. A hearing requested, or in the case of suspension or
revocation, required, in accordance with this section shall be scheduled by the
hearing examiner for a date not to exceed 45 days from receipt of the request
or in the case of suspension or revocation, within 45 days from the date of
issuance of the citation. Notice of the hearing must be served in person or by
mail on the person responsible for the violation at least 15 days in advance of
the hearing, unless a shorter time is accepted by all parties. Such notice
shall contain the time, place and issues involved, but if by reason of the
nature of the case, the issues cannot be fully stated in advance of the
hearing, or if subsequent amendment of the issues is necessary, they shall be
fully stated as soon as practicable, and opportunity shall be afforded to the
holder of the license to present evidence and argument with respect thereto.
      (3)   Hearing Examiner. The City Council may designate the entire
Council, a committee of the Council, a member thereof or an employee of the
Office of Administrative Hearings to serve as hearing examiner.
      (4)   Decision. If it is determined at a hearing that a violation of this
section occurred, that decision along with the reasons for finding a violation
and the penalty to be imposed under this section shall be recorded in writing,
a copy of which shall be provided to the accused violator and the City Council
if it is not the hearing examiner. In the case of a fourth violation, if the
City Council has designated someone other than the entire Council to serve as
the hearing examiner, the hearing examiner’s decision and recommendation for
the penalty to be imposed shall be referred to the City Council. The City
Council shall consider the recommendation of the hearing examiner and impose a
penalty within 30 days of the Council’s receipt of the decision. If it is
determined at hearing that no violation occurred or finds grounds for not
imposing any penalty, such findings shall be recorded and a copy provided to
the acquitted violator.
      (5)   Appeal. Appeal of any decision made by the hearing examiner shall
be filed in County District Court.
   (C)   Continued violation. Each violation and every day in which a violation
occurs or continues, shall constitute a separate offense.
   (D)   Late payment. A late payment fee of 10% of the penalty shall be
assessed for each 30-day period in which the penalty remains unpaid after the
due date.
   (E)   Misdemeanor prosecution. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the
city from seeking prosecution as a petty misdemeanor, misdemeanor or gross
misdemeanor for any violation of this section. If the city elects to seek
prosecution, an administrative penalty may also be imposed.

§ 115.20 SOCIAL HOST.
   (A)   Purpose and findings. The City Council intends to discourage underage
possession and consumption of alcohol, even if done within the confines of a
private residence, and intends to hold persons criminally responsible who host
events or gatherings where persons under 21 years of age possess or consume
alcohol regardless of whether the person hosting the event or gathering
supplied the alcohol. The City Council finds that:
      (1)   Events and gatherings held on private or public property where
alcohol is possessed or consumed by persons under the age of 21 are harmful to
those persons and constitute a potential threat to public health requiring
prevention or abatement.
      (2)   Prohibiting underage consumption acts to protect underage persons,
as well as the general public, from injuries related to alcohol consumption,
such as alcohol overdose or alcohol-related traffic collisions.
      (3)   Alcohol is an addictive drug which, if used irresponsibly, could
have drastic effects on those who use it as well as those who are affected by
the actions of an irresponsible user.
      (4)   Often, events or gatherings involving underage possession and
consumption occur outside the presence of parents. However, there are times
when the parent(s) is/are present and, condone the activity, and in some
circumstances provide the alcohol.
      (5)   Even though giving or furnishing alcohol to an underage person is a
crime, it is difficult to prove, and an ordinance is necessary to help further
combat underage consumption.
      (6)   A deterrent effect will be created by holding a person criminally
responsible for hosting an event or gathering where underage possession or
consumption occurs.
   (B)   Authority. This subchapter is enacted pursuant to M.S. § 145A.05, as
it may be amended from time to time.
   (C)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following

ADULTS USES
§ 115.45 STATEMENT OF POLICY.
   (A)   The City Council deems it necessary to provide for the special and
express regulation of businesses or commercial enterprises which operate as
adult body painting studios, adult bookstores, adult cabarets, adult
companionship establishments, adult hotels or motels, adult massage parlors or
health clubs, adult mini-motion picture theaters, adult modeling studios, adult
motion picture arcades or theaters, adult novelty businesses, adult saunas and
similar adult-oriented services operating under different names in order to
protect the public health, safety and welfare, and to guard against the
inception and transmission of disease. The City Council further finds that the
commercial enterprises such as the types described above and all other similar
establishments whose services include sessions offered to adults conducted in
private by members of the same or opposite sex, and employing personnel with no
specialized training, are susceptible to operation in a manner contravening,
subverting or endangering the morals of the community by being the site of acts
of prostitution, illicit sex and occasions of violent crimes, and thus
requiring close inspection, licensing and regulation.
   (B)   The City Council also finds that control and regulation of commercial
establishments of these types, in view of the abuses often perpetrated, require
intensive efforts by the Police Department and other departments of the city.
As a consequence, the concentrated use of city services in control detracts
from and reduces the level of service available to the rest of the community
and thereby diminishes the ability of the city to promote the general health,
welfare, morals and safety of the community. In consideration for the necessity
on the part of the city to provide numerous services to all segments of the
community without a concentration of public services in one area working to the
detriment of the members of the general public, it is hereby decided that adult
use principal should be limited to the B-2 District as a conditional use and
that adult use accessory should be limited to the B-2 Service Business District
and B-3 General Business District as a permitted use and should require the
issuance of licenses.

§ 117.01 RENTAL DWELLING REGISTRATION; PURPOSE.
   (A)   The City Council concludes the regulation of rental practices of
single-family and multiple- tenant residential dwelling units through
registration will promote the health, safety and welfare of the residents of
the city, particularly those residents who live in rental properties and
neighborhoods surrounding them.
   (B)   It is the purpose of this chapter to protect the public health, safety
and welfare of citizens of the city by adopting a rental dwelling registration,
inspection and maintenance program that corrects substandard conditions,
maintains a standard for existing, newly constructed and/or converted rental
dwellings, and ensures neighborhood stability in the city. The operation of
rental properties is a business enterprise that includes certain
responsibilities.
   (C)   Rental dwelling owners and managers are responsible to take necessary
reasonable actions to ensure that the citizens who occupy such rental dwelling
units, as well as neighboring properties, may pursue the quiet enjoyment of the
normal activities of life in surroundings that are safe, secure, and sanitary,
free from noise, nuisances and annoyances, and free from unreasonable fears
about safety of persons and property.
(Ord. 86, Seventh Series, passed 10-7-2019)
§ 117.02 INTERPRETATION.
   This chapter is to be construed liberally in conjunction with the provisions
of this code to give effect to the policy, purpose, and objectives of this
chapter, but is not to be construed to modify, amend or otherwise alter the
provisions of this code relating to health, safety, building or land use
regulation. It is not the intention of the city to intrude upon the fair
accepted contractual relationship between tenant and landlord. The city does
not intend to intervene as an advocate of either party, or to act as an
arbiter. It is determined that certain conditions within existing buildings,
lawful at the time of construction of the building, and not creating a
hazardous condition, may not comply with the minimum requirements of this
chapter. Such conditions are referred to as “built in deficiencies”, and the
code official, in administering this chapter, may consider built in
deficiencies as being beyond reasonable correction and accept them as an
alternate method of meeting the intent of this chapter.

§ 117.04 REGISTRATION REQUIRED.
   (A)   Generally. No person shall rent any unit upon real property for
residential purposes any place in the city without first obtaining a
registration issued by the City Administrator and paying a registration fee.
Registrations are required for each building with shared common area and for
each unit. All dwelling units in a rental residential building must be
registered regardless of occupancy. In a manufactured home park, individual
manufactured homes that are rented and not owner occupied shall require a
rental registration. No person may rent, lease or occupy a rental residential
building, rental dwelling unit or portion thereof that does not have a valid
and current city registration. Each rental dwelling unit must have an owner, or
local property manager designated by the owner, who resides within 30 miles of
the city.
   (B)   Application. An application for a registration to rent real property
shall be made on a form provided by the city. An application shall not be
submitted and shall be denied unless the rental dwelling has been inspected
pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. The application shall include, but
is not limited to, requiring the full name of the applicant, property owner,
and property manager; the applicant, owner, and property manager business
address, e-mail address, and telephone numbers including a 24- hour contact
phone number; and the name of the proposed registration holder and the address
for which the registration is sought. The completed application along with the
application fee shall be submitted to the City Administrator or designee for
review. If the City Administrator or designee determines that an application is
incomplete, he or she shall return the application to the applicant with notice
of the deficiencies. Should any application information change during the
registration period, the applicant shall notify the city within seven business
days. Failure to do so may be considered a registration violation.
   (C)   Action. The City Administrator or its designee may either approve or
deny the registration or may delay action for up to 60 days to permit the city
to complete any investigation of the application or the applicant as deemed
necessary. If the City Administrator approves the registration, a registration
shall be issued to the applicant. If the City Administrator denies the
application, a notice of denial shall be sent to the applicant at the business
address provided on the application along with the reasons for the denial. The
notice shall also inform the applicant of their right to appeal the decision to
the City Council pursuant to the process set forth in §
117.12 of this chapter. If a registration is mistakenly issued or renewed to an
applicant or registration holder, it shall be revoked by the City Administrator
or designee upon the discovery that the person, applicant or registration
holder was ineligible for the registration under this chapter.
   (D)   Term. All registrations are issued for a period of one year. The
registration period shall be as determined by the City Administrator. Refunds
of registration fees will not be given.
   (E)   Adverse registration action. Any registration issued under this
chapter may be denied, suspended, revoked or not renewed as provided in §
117.10 of this chapter.
   (F)   Transfers. All registrations issued under this chapter shall be valid
only on the premises for which the registration was issued and only for the

another location or person shall be valid without the prior approval of the
city administrator or designee.
   (G)   Renewals. The renewal of a registration under this chapter shall be
handled in the same manner as the original application and shall be submitted a
minimum of 30 days prior to the registration expiration. Renewal applications
received after the due date but before the registration expiration date shall
be subject to late fees as determined by City Council resolution. The issuance
of a registration under this chapter shall be considered a privilege and not an
absolute right of the applicant and shall not entitle the holder to an
automatic renewal of the registration.
   (H)   Denials. The following shall be grounds for denying the issuance or
renewal of a registration under this chapter. The following list is not
exhaustive or exclusive:
      (1)   The applicant has had more than one registration to lease rental
property revoked within the preceding 12 months of the date of application;
      (2)   The applicant fails to provide any information required on the city
registration application or fails to pay the required registration fee or
provides false or misleading information;
      (3)   The applicant or rental dwelling unit has outstanding Building,
Fire or Property Maintenance Code violations, fines, penalties or delinquent
property taxes, assessments, utility or other charges owed to the city; or

contract or land use covenants that restricts rental units.
   (I)   Consideration of suspension or revocation. At any time during a
registration period, if a rental property does not meet or exceed the criteria
established for the current registration, the registration may be brought forth
to the City Council for consideration of registration suspension or revocation.
   (J)   Registration required; penalties. No person may rent, lease or occupy
a rental residential building, dwelling unit or portion thereof that does not
have a valid and current city registration. The owner of rented buildings,
dwelling units or portion thereof, shall be given 30 days to apply for such
registration. A violation of this chapter is a misdemeanor, punishable in
accordance with state law. In addition to criminal sanctions, the city may
impose civil penalties in the amount of $1,000 for renting, leasing, or
occupying a rental residential building or rental dwelling unit or part thereof
without a registration.

§ 117.06 INSPECTIONS.
   (A)   Rental residential buildings, properties, and rental units shall be
inspected in their entirety every three years prior to issuing or renewing an
annual rental registration. Multi-family rental residential buildings with
shared common areas within a building shall be subject to an annual Fire Code
inspection. Buildings, units, and properties shall also be inspected following
any violation of this chapter, this code, Building Code or the Fire Code and
thereafter at the property owner’s expense.
   (B)   Such inspections shall confirm compliance with Building, Fire,
Property Maintenance Codes as well as §
117.09 of this chapter. Buildings, units and properties not in compliance will
not be granted a registration. Rental units that meet this inspection standard
with no deficiencies or repairs noted and have received the highest inspection
rating as determined by the City Administrator, will be eligible for self-
inspection during the next inspection cycle provided the applicant certifies
they inspected the rental unit and it meets all of the compliance requirements
as established by the City Administrator. A self-inspection is only valid for a
period of three years and at no time will a rental unit be allowed to be
registered for a period of more than six years without an inspection conducted
by the City Administrator.
   (C)   Any deficiencies or repairs noted in the inspection must be remedied
in a timely fashion by the property owner and re-inspected for compliance by
the city. The applicant is responsible for reinspection costs as noted in §
117.08 of this chapter.
   (D)   The City Administrator or designee is authorized to make inspections
reasonably necessary to enforce this chapter. All authorized inspectors have
the authority to enter any rental dwelling or unrented and unoccupied rental
dwelling unit at all reasonable times. The city will notify the registration
holder to schedule the inspection; however, it is the responsibility of the
registration holder to work with the city to ensure the inspection is scheduled
and satisfactorily completed. The registration holder is responsible for
notifying any existing tenant of the inspection at least 24 hours in advance.
The city will make reasonable efforts to notify the registration holder. The
registration holder must provide access to the property to the requesting city
official at the date and time of the scheduled inspection. Failure to provide
access for any reason may result in a reinspection fee, in addition to any
other sanctions imposed for noncompliance. The city will not charge a
reinspection fee if the owner/manager cooperates with gaining access to
occupied units if refused by the tenant. If any owner, owner’s agent,
registration holder, property manager or tenant fails or refuses to permit
entry to a rental dwelling under its control for an inspection pursuant to this
section, the City Administrator or designee may pursue any remedy at law or
under the city code, including, but not limited to, securing an administrative
search warrant for the rental dwelling, issuing an administrative citation,
denying a rental registration application, revoking or suspending a rental
registration, or denying a renewal registration. The city will use its best
efforts to coordinate inspections with other governmental agencies when
appropriate.
   (E)   (1)   Rental units registered as a standard rental unit prior to
November 15, 2018, are exempt from mandatory inspections as required in this
section until the first of the following occurs:
         (a)   A call to service to the unit regarding a health or safety issue
and the unit fails an inspection;
         (b)   The unit fails an inspection based on a complaint generated
inspection for code violations;
         (c)   The unit fails an inspection based on a complaint generated from
a tenant or neighbor; or
         (d)   The unit is visibly in need of substantial repair based upon a
complaint or observation.
      (2)   If any of these conditions occur, the unit will no longer be exempt
from mandatory inspections and the City Administrator may require an immediate
inspection of the rental unit, issue compliance orders, and/or suspend or
revoke the rental registration as provided in this chapter. This exemption from
mandatory inspections of this division (E) does not apply to any rental units
or real property that: receives tax abatement, tax increment financing, public
assistance, or any other form of public subsidy; or is sold, transferred or
conveyed. All rental units that are exempt from mandatory inspections shall pay
a standard registration fee as set by the City Council. Rental units that are
exempt from inspections must comply with all other provision of this chapter.
(Ord. 86, Seventh Series, passed 10-7-2019)
§ 117.07 ISSUANCE OF REGISTRATION.
   (A)   The application will be reviewed and the property will be inspected
pursuant to §
117.06 of this chapter. If the property meets applicable codes, laws and
ordinances, and fees have been paid, the code official shall recommend issuance
of the registration. If the property does not meet applicable codes, laws and
ordinances, the code official will advise the applicant of the deficiencies.
The applicant shall address the deficiencies and thereafter request a
reinspection of the property. All fees including reinspection fees must be paid
prior to issuance of the registration.
   (B)   The City Administrator or designee may issue a provisional rental
registration when corrections required following inspection do not constitute a
fire, safety or health hazard to the occupants or the general public, and the
repairs are not practically feasible as a result of factors beyond the rental
property owner’s control. Such factors may include climatic conditions, or the
unavailability of contractors, supplies or materials needed to make the
corrections. A provisional rental registration shall be conditioned upon the
rental property owner’s making the needed corrections with timelines determined
by the City Administrator or designee. The provisional rental registration
shall expire if the work is not completed, inspected and approved by the date
listed thereon.
(Ord. 86, Seventh Series, passed 10-7-2019)
§ 117.08 REGISTRATION FEES AND CHARGES.
   (A)   Generally. The application fee shall be determined by the City Council
from time to time by resolution and shall be paid at the time of application.
In the case of licensing periods of less than one year, registration fees may
be prorated quarterly.
   (B)   Conversion fee. An owner-occupied unit that has not previously been a
registered rental property and is converted to a rental property shall pay a
conversion fee as adopted in the city fee schedule. The onetime conversion fee
includes the rental registration application and inspection fees for the first
year. A rental property with a registration that has been expired for greater
than one year will be subject to the full conversion fee and licensing
inspection upon application for a rental registration.
   (C)   Annual fire inspection fee. Multi-family rental residential buildings
with shared common areas subject to an annual Fire Code inspection are required
to pay the cost of the inspection as determined by the City Council by
resolution and shall be paid prior to issuance of the registration.
   (D)   Reinspection fees. The costs of any reinspections shall be at the
applicant’s/owner’s expense and shall be paid prior to issuing the registration
for that property.
   (E)   Other fees. The registration holder shall be responsible for any city
costs in enforcing the registration provisions including reinspection fees,
attorney fees and the like.
(Ord. 86, Seventh Series, passed 10-7-2019)
§ 117.09 CONDITION OF PROPERTY.
   (A)   Registration holders obligations and codes adopted. 
      (1)   It is the responsibility of the registration holder to ensure that
every rental residential building and rental dwelling unit is maintained in
compliance with all city ordinances and state and federal laws. The city’s
Property Maintenance Code, Building Code, and Fire Code are, in their entirety,
except as modified or amended in this code, adopted by reference and are made a
part of this chapter as if fully set out at length. Failure to maintain the
property in compliance may result in registration suspension, revocation or
denial.
      (2)   Upon denial, suspension, revocation or other enforcement action of
a registration, the city will notify all affected tenants of the action against
the registration by posting a notice to tenants on the main entrance of the
rental residential building or rental dwelling unit. If the registration is
revoked or suspended the registration holder may not let, rent or allow to be
occupied any vacant dwelling units, or dwelling units that become vacant during
the revocation or suspension period.
   (B)   Unfit for human habitation.
      (1)   Any building, premises, dwelling unit, or portion thereof that is
unsafe, unlawful or, because of the degree to which the property is in
disrepair or lacks maintenance, is unsanitary, vermin or rat infested, contains
filth and contamination, or lacks ventilation, illumination, sanitary or
heating facilities, or other essential utilities services and equipment
required by this code, or because the location of a structure constitutes a
hazard to the occupants of the property or to the public may be declared unfit
for human habitation. Whenever any building, premises, or dwelling unit has
been declared unfit for human habitation, the City Administrator or designee
shall order same vacated within a reasonable time and shall post a placard on
same indicating that it is unfit for human habitation, and any operating
registration previously issued for such building, premises, or dwelling unit
shall be suspended or revoked.
      (2)   It shall be unlawful for such building or portion thereof to be
used for human habitation until the defective conditions have been corrected
and written approval has been issued by the City Administrator or designee. It
shall be unlawful for any person to deface or remove the declaration placard
from any such building.
   (C)   Hazardous building declaration. If a building has been declared unfit
for human habitation and the owner has not remedied the defects within a
prescribed reasonable time, the building may be declared a hazardous building
and treated consistent with the provisions of the state statutes. The City
Administrator or designee will post the date the rental residential building or
rental dwelling unit shall be vacated, and no person shall reside in, occupy or
cause to be occupied that rental residential building or rental dwelling unit
until the city administrator or City Council permits it.
   (D)   Compliance order. Whenever the City Administrator or designee
determines that any building or portion thereof, or the premises surrounding
any of these, fails to meet the provisions of this chapter, a compliance order
setting forth the violations of this chapter and ordering the owner, occupant,
operator, or agent to correct such violations shall be issued. This compliance
order shall:
      (1)   Be in writing;
      (2)   Include a description of the real estate sufficient for
identification;
      (3)   Include a statement of the violation(s) and why the notice is being
issued;
      (4)   Include a correction order allowing a reasonable time to make the
repairs and improvements required to bring the dwelling unit or structure into
compliance with the provisions of this code;
      (5)   Inform the property owner or owner’s authorized agent of the right
to appeal the issuance of the compliance order as set forth in this chapter;
      (6)   Include a statement of the right to levy an assessment in
accordance with M.S. § 429.101, as it may be amended from time to time;
      (7)   Be served upon the owner or agent or occupant, as the case may
require. Such notice shall be deemed to be properly served upon such owner or
agent, or upon any such occupant, if a copy thereof is:
         (a)   Served upon owner, agent or occupant personally;
         (b)   Sent by first class mail to his/her last known address; or
         (c)   Upon failure to provide notice through subsections (a) and (b)
above, posted at a conspicuous place in or about the building, or portion
thereof, that is affected by the notice.
      (8)   State that violations may be cited by the city and prosecuted, and
registration suspension, revocation or nonrenewal and other civil remedies may
be undertaken by the city whether or not a compliance order has been issued.
   (E)   Action plan. The compliance official may require an action plan to be
completed by the registration holder, manager, or local agent in a designated
time frame that indicates the steps taken to correct identified violations and
the measures to be taken to ensure ongoing compliance with city ordinances and
applicable codes.
   (F)   Right of appeal. When it is alleged by any person to whom a compliance
order is directed that such compliance order is based upon erroneous
interpretation of this chapter, such person may appeal the compliance under
this chapter.
(Ord. 86, Seventh Series, passed 10-7-2019)
§ 117.10 REGISTRATION SUSPENSION, REVOCATION, DENIAL AND NONRENEWAL.
   (A)   Violations. The following actions by property owners or registration
holders are misdemeanors punishable as set forth in state law and are subject
to civil penalties, may constitute the basis for revocation of registrations,
and may result in injunctive action by the city. The property owner shall be
responsible for the conduct of its agents or employees while engaged in normal
business activities on the registered premises. Any violation of this chapter
shall be considered an act of the property owner or registration holder for
purposes of registration revocation. If a registration is revoked, it is
unlawful for the owner to permit occupancy of any rental unit or permit new
occupancy of any vacant rental unit or any units that become vacant during
registration revocation.
   (B)   Basis for sanctions. 
      (1)   The City Administrator or designee may revoke, suspend, deny or
decline to renew any registration issued under this chapter for part or all of

property owner or registration holder is in violation of this section.
   (C)   Penalties. Any violation of this chapter may be grounds to revoke or
suspend a registration. A revocation or suspension under this chapter does not
preclude criminal prosecution under this chapter or the state statutes. All
fines are cumulative and revocation periods will run consecutively. The City
Administrator or designee may temporarily suspend a registration pending a
hearing on the suspension or revocation when, in his or her judgment, the
public health, safety, and welfare is endangered by the continuance of the
registered activity.

§ 117.11 DISORDERLY USE BY TENANTS, EVICTION FOR THREE VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   Conduct constituting disorderly use. The following conduct by tenants
or their guests on the registered premises is hereby deemed to be a disorderly
use, if such conduct is in violation of any of the following statutes or
ordinances. A determination that a rental dwelling has been used in a
disorderly manner as described in this section shall be made upon a fair
preponderance of the evidence to support such a determination. It is not
necessary that criminal charges be brought in order to support a determination
of disorderly use nor does the fact of dismissal or acquittal of such a
criminal charge operate as a bar to adverse registration action under this

was given, the city shall notify the registration holder by mail of the
violation and shall also require the registration holder to immediately
undertake the process necessary to remove the tenant from the property. If the
registration holder fails to comply with the requirements of this section
within 14 days, this constitutes a property owner violation under §
117.10(B)(5) of this chapter.
   (C)   Postponement of penalty. An action to revoke or not renew a
registration based upon violations of this section may be postponed or
discontinued at any time if it appears that the registration holder has taken
appropriate measures which will prevent further instances of disorderly use. No
adverse registration action shall be imposed where the instance of disorderly
use of registered premises occurred during the pendency of eviction proceedings
(unlawful detainer) or within 30 days of notice given by the registration
holder to a tenant to vacate the premises, where the disorderly use was related
to conduct by the tenant or by other occupants or guests of the tenant’s unit.
Eviction proceedings shall not be a bar to adverse registration action,
however, unless the registration holder diligently pursues them.
   (D)   Standard of review. A determination that the registered premises have
been used in a disorderly manner as described in this section shall be made
upon substantial evidence to support such a determination.
   (E)   Reapplication for revoked registration. Following the revocation of a
registration for a unit, the property owner or former registration holder must
wait for the expiration of the appropriate revocation term and then must apply
for a new registration for the unit. Any unit revoked must be inspected at the
property owner’s expense prior to the reissuance of a registration.
(Ord. 86, Seventh Series, passed 10-7-2019)
§ 117.12 HEARING ON DENIAL OR VIOLATION.
   (A)   Notice of action. If the City Administrator or designee denies the
issuance of a registration, or suspends, or revokes a registration, or imposes
civil penalties as prescribed in this chapter, the City Administrator or
designee shall send to the applicant, or registration holder, by certified
mail, return receipt requested, written notice of the action, and the right to
an appeal. Appeals shall be heard as set forth in §§
33.45 through
33.47 of this code.
   (B)   Default. If the applicant or registration holder has been provided
written notice of the denial, nonrenewal, or violation and if no request for a
hearing is filed within the ten-day period, then the denial under §
117.04 of this chapter or civil penalty or revocation imposed in §
117.10 of this chapter shall take immediate effect by default. The City
Administrator or designee shall mail notice of the denial, fine, suspension, or
revocation to the applicant or registration holder. The City Administrator
shall investigate compliance with the denial or revocation.
   (C)   Continuing obligations; penalty. Revocation, suspension or nonrenewal
of a registration shall not excuse the owner/registration holder from
compliance with all terms of this section, this code, and state laws for as
long as any units in the facility are occupied. Failure to comply with all
terms of this chapter during the term of revocation, suspension or nonrenewal
is a misdemeanor and grounds for extension of the term of such revocation or
suspension or continuation of nonrenewal, or for a decision not to reinstate
the registration, notwithstanding any limitations on the period of suspension,
revocation or nonrenewal specified in the City Council’s written decision.
   (D)   New registrations prohibited. A person who has a rental registration
revoked may not receive a rental registration for another property within the
city for a period of one-year from the date of revocation. The person may
continue to operate other currently registered rental properties if the
properties are maintained in compliance with city codes and other applicable
regulations.

§ 117.13 REGISTRATION REINSTATEMENT OR REAPPLICATION.

corrected. The owner shall make application for the registration and comply
with requirements of this chapter prior to issuance including payment of
registration fee and inspection of affected units.
   (B)   All new applications must be accompanied by a reinstatement fee, as
specified by Council resolution, in addition to all other fees required by this
chapter.
(Ord. 86, Seventh Series, passed 10-7-2019)
§ 117.14 ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Written agreement. The registration holder/manager shall sign a
written agreement as part of the registration application. Said agreement shall
include, but not be limited to: an acknowledgment of this chapter regarding
rental licensing; the required rental property inspection conducted by a city
inspector, and continued maintenance of the property in accordance to city
codes; and that registrations may be revoked for failure to address tenant or
property issues.
   (B)   Background checks. Background checks shall be completed for any
manager. The definition MANAGER also includes leasing agents, maintenance
personnel and the like. The owner/manager shall also acknowledge and comply
with the Kari Koskinen Manager Background Check Act, M.S. §§ 299C.66 to
299C.71, as they may be amended from time to time.

shall allow inspections at reasonable and appropriate times by officials of the
city or consultants as the city deems appropriate to retain. The license holder

§ 120.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   The state legislature amended M.S. § 151.72 and legalized the sale and
adult use of certain products containing tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The
purpose of this chapter is to regulate the sale of products that contain THC
and are intended for human or animal consumption, excluding medical cannabis,
as defined by M.S. § 152.22, subd. 6, as the same may be amended from time to
time, (THC product or licensed product) for the following reasons:
      (1)   The state legislature recognized the danger of cannabis use among
youth by prohibiting the sale of any product containing cannabinoid or
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) extracted or otherwise derived from hemp to those
under the age of 21 and requiring that edible cannabinoid products be packaged
without appeal to children and in child-resistant packaging or containers;
      (2)   A local regulatory system for THC product retailers is appropriate
to ensure that retailers comply with THC product laws and business standards of
the city to protect the health, safety, and welfare of our youth and most
vulnerable residents;
      (3)   State law requires THC product retailers to check the
identification of purchasers to verify that they are at least 21 years of age,
comply with certain packaging and labeling requirements to protect children and
youth, and meet certain potency and serving size requirements;
      (4)   State law authorizes the Board of Pharmacy to adopt product and
testing standards in part to curb the illegal sale and distribution of THC
products and ensure the safety and compliance of commercially available THC
products in the state;
      (5)   State law does not preempt the authority of a local jurisdiction to
adopt and enforce local ordinances to regulate THC product businesses
including, but not limited to, local zoning and land use requirements and
business license requirements;
      (6)   A requirement for a THC product retailer license will not unduly
burden legitimate business activities of retailers who sell or distribute THC
products to adults but will allow the city to regulate the operation of lawful
businesses to discourage violations of state and local THC product-related
laws.
   (B)   In making these findings and enacting this chapter, City Council
intends to ensure responsible THC product retailing, allow legal sale and
access without promoting increases in use, and discourage violations of THC
product-related laws, especially those which prohibit or discourage the
marketing, sale, distribution, possession, and use of THC products to or by
youth under 21 years of age.
(Ord. 35, Eighth Series, effective 1-22-2023)
§ 120.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   COMPLIANCE CHECKS. The system the city uses to investigate and ensure that
those authorized to sell licensed products are following and complying with the
requirements of this chapter. COMPLIANCE CHECKS shall involve the use of minors
as authorized by this chapter. COMPLIANCE CHECKS shall also mean the use of
minors who attempt to purchase licensed products for educational, research and
training purposes as authorized by state and federal laws. COMPLIANCE CHECKS
may also be conducted by other units of government for the purpose of enforcing
appropriate federal, state or local laws and regulations relating to licensed
products.
   LICENSE. A license issued under this chapter.
   LICENSED PRODUCT or THC PRODUCT. Any product that contains more than trace
amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol and that meets the requirements to be sold for
human or animal consumption under M.S. § 151.72, as the same may be amended
from time to time. LICENSED PRODUCT or THC PRODUCT does not include medical
cannabis.
   MEDICAL CANNABIS. Shall have the meaning provided in M.S. § 152.22, subd. 6,
as the same may be amended from time to time.
   MOVEABLE PLACE OF BUSINESS. Any form of business operated out of a kiosk,
truck, van, automobile, trailer, or other type of vehicle or transportable
shelter and is not a fixed address storefront or other permanent type of
structure authorized for sales transactions.
   RETAIL ESTABLISHMENT. Any place of business where licensed products are
available for sale to the general public.
   SALE. Any transfer of goods for money, trade, barter, or other
consideration.
   SELF-SERVICE MERCHANDISING. Open displays of licensed products in any manner
where any person shall have access to the licensed products without the
assistance or intervention of the licensee or the licensee’s employee. The
assistance or intervention shall entail the actual physical exchange of the
licensed product between the customer and the licensee or employee. SELF-
SERVICE SALES are interpreted as being any sale where there is not an actual
physical exchange between the clerk and the customer.

the City Clerk in writing of any change in ownership of the business. Any

to a transfer of the license, and any such license shall be revoked 30 days

§ 134.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The city finds and declares that predatory offenders present an extreme
threat to public safety. Predatory offenders are likely to use physical
violence and to repeat their offenses, and most predatory offenders commit many
offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported and are prosecuted for
only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of predatory offender
victimization to society at large, while incalculable, unmistakably steep. It
is the intent of this chapter to serve the city’s compelling interest to
promote, protect and improve the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of
the city by imposing residency restrictions upon predatory offenders and
creating safety zones around locations where vulnerable populations regularly
congregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain predatory offenders are
prohibited from establishing temporary or permanent residence and wherein
access by predatory offenders shall be restricted and excluded.

continually inspect or supervise the work.
(2002 Code, § 5.07) (Ord. 45, Second Series, effective 7-1-1974; Ord. 159,
Third Series, effective 12-1-1987; Ord. 166, Third Series, effective 1-31-1988)
§ 151.040 POLICY FOR SIDEWALK, CURB AND GUTTER CONSTRUCTION.
   (A)   It is hereby made the duty of all owners of land abutting on any
street or avenue in the city, to construct, reconstruct and maintain in good
repair sidewalks, curb and gutters along any street or avenue in accordance
with the current established policy on file in the office of the City Engineer.
   (B)   A sidewalk plan for the city shall be developed by the City Engineer
and adopted by resolution of the Council and which may be amended from time to
time in the same manner. Sidewalks will be classified as arterial, collector or
local, as defined below. This classification will be used to determine the
priority for construction and repair: arterials, first; collectors, second;
local sidewalks, third. A map of the approved arterial and collector sidewalk
routes will be kept on file in the office of the City Engineer. All sidewalks
on public rights-of-way shall be concrete constructed according to the
standards on file in the City Engineer’s office, five feet in width, and be
located with the inside edge of the sidewalk one foot outside the property line
where parallel to private frontage. Exceptions to width and location
requirements are stated in division (B)(4) below.
      (1)   Arterial sidewalks shall be located on either side or both sides of
all arterial streets, thoroughfares, some collector streets and streets on
elementary school walkway routes.
      (2)   Collector sidewalks shall provide access, where not provided by the
arterial system, to parks, apartment and retirement complexes, the middle
school, high schools, colleges, hospitals, clinics and business areas, and also
provide neighborhood access to the arterial system.
      (3)   Local sidewalks are all other sidewalks not designated as an
approved arterial or collector route. No new local sidewalks are required
unless petitioned by affected landowners and approved by the Council, or
initiated and approved by the Council. Isolated segments of local sidewalks,
abutting on only one landowner, may be removed if requested by the landowner,
with permission of the City Engineer. Removal of local sidewalks abutting on
more than one landowner requires a petition signed by all abutting landowners
and approved by the Council.
      (4)   (a)   The City Engineer is hereby empowered to reduce or increase
the width of sidewalk where it is deemed in the best interest of the public.
         (b)   The City Engineer is hereby empowered to exempt properties from
the requirement that the sidewalk be constructed with the inside edge one foot
outside the property line when upon investigation he or she determines that:
            1.   Healthy specimen trees of two inches or greater diameter would
be destroyed;
            2.   Sidewalk alignment within a block would be different from
existing walks within the block; and/or
            3.   Severe grade problems would result.
         (c)   The City Engineer is hereby empowered to postpone construction
of walks required until the time of street construction when a lot or lots abut
an unimproved (lacking curb and gutter) street that is expected to be scheduled
for improvement at some future date and when, in his or her opinion, a delay of
construction to coincide with street construction would be advisable.
         (d)   Residential type “house walks” (generally perpendicular to the
sidewalk or street) on public right-of-way are installed and reconstructed at
the option and full expense of the landowner, are exempt from width
requirements, are not included in the sidewalk classification (arterial,
collector, local), but do require a permit for construction or reconstruction.
   (C)   (1)   If required sidewalks, curbs and gutters are not constructed
within the time limits established by the city, or whenever the city shall deem
it necessary and expedient to construct, rebuild or repair any of the
foregoing, it may adopt a resolution to the effect, which resolution shall
specify the place or places where the improvement shall be constructed, rebuilt
or repaired, the size and manner of construction thereof and the time within
which the same shall be completed. The resolution shall contain the names of
the owners of all lots, parts of lots and parcels of ground fronting the street
or streets where the improvement or construction is to be constructed, rebuilt
or repaired.
      (2)   The resolution shall be served upon the person named in the
resolution at least 30 days prior to the time therein named for the completion
of the improvement, be the same sidewalks, curbs or gutters. The resolution
shall be served by registered mail or by personal service upon the record owner
of the property and the occupant, if the owner does not reside in the city or
cannot be found therein, ordering the owner to have the sidewalks, curb or
gutter repaired and made safe within 30 days and stating that, if the owner
fails to do so, the Council will have the same done, and that the expense
thereof must be paid by the owner and that, if unpaid, it will be made special
assessment against the property concerned.
      (3)   If the requested improvement is not made within 30 days after the
receipt of the notice, the Council shall, by resolution, order the construction
made. If the construction, reconstruction or repair not be made within the time
prescribed in the resolution, then the Council may order the same to be done,
under the supervision of the City Engineer, by day labor or cause the same to
be done by contract to the lowest responsible bidder, the entire expenses
thereof to be paid out of the funds as the city shall designate.
      (4)   If the construction, reconstruction or maintenance work is
performed by the city, as set forth above, the City Administrator shall
forthwith, upon completion thereof, ascertain the cost attributable to each
lot, piece or parcel of abutting land. The City Administrator shall, at the
next regular meeting thereof, present the certificate to the Council and obtain
its approval thereof. When the certificate has been approved it shall be
extended as to the cost therein stated as a special assessment shall, at the
time of certifying taxes to the County Auditor, be certified for collection as
other special assessments are certified and collected.
      (5)   (a)   All costs of portions of sidewalks crossing private driveways
(driveway sections) shall be the obligation of the property owner. Where new
sidewalk construction occurs along a street having existing curb and gutter a
six-inch thick un-reinforced concrete driveway approach slab, meeting the
standards on file in the City Engineer’s office, is required between the
sidewalk and the gutter at the full expense of the landowner.
         (b)   For all sidewalks abutting private property the assessed cost,
excluding the cost of driveway sections, shall be a price per linear foot
adopted by a resolution of the Council, and which may be amended in the same
manner, if the work is done by the city. The resolution, containing the
effective date thereof, shall be kept on file in the office of the City
Administrator. For walks damaged by city trees, see division (C)(5)(d) below.
If the work is done by a licensed paving contractor, see division (C)(5)(e)
below. For sidewalks abutting public property, see division (C)(5)(g) below.
         (c)   The city will pay the cost of all necessary crosswalks, and
other walks not abutting on at least one side upon private property, if the
work is done by the city or by a licensed paving contractor. (See division (C)
(5)(e) below.)
         (d)   Small segments (up to 12 feet in length) of sidewalk abutting
private property which are in good condition, except for damage caused
exclusively by the growth of trees on city property or right-of-way will be
repaired at city cost if approved in advance by the City Engineer and the work
is done by the city.
         (e)   City participation in eligible work done by a licensed paving
contractor shall be limited to a price set by the City Engineer.
         (f)   All other costs will be the obligation of the property owner.
         (g)   For all sidewalks abutting public (including federal, state,
county, city, public school district and the like) property, the full cost
shall be assessed to or paid by the owner.
      (6)   It is not the intent of this division (C) to, in any manner, limit
the use of the procedures and methods set forth in Local Improvement Code of
the state, presently beginning with M.S. § 429.011, as the same may from time
to time be amended. This division (C) is intended to be an addition and
separate procedure to construct, reconstruct or repair sidewalks, curbs and
gutters.

   (A)   Timing. The work to be done under the excavation permit, and the
patching and restoration of the right-of-way as required herein, must be
completed within the dates specified in the permit, increased by as many days
as work could not be done because of circumstances beyond the control of the
permittee or when work was prohibited as unseasonal or unreasonable under this
subchapter.
   (B)   Patch and restoration. The permittee shall patch its own work. The
city may choose either to have the city restore the right-of-way or to restore
the right-of-way itself.
      (1)   City restoration. If the city restores the right-of-way, the
permittee shall pay the costs thereof within 30 days of billing. If, following

from the Director, not including days during which work cannot be done because
of circumstances constituting force majeure or days when work is prohibited as
unseasonal or unreasonable under this subchapter.
   (E)   Failure to restore. If the permittee fails to restore the right-of-way
in the manner and to the condition required by the Director, or fails to
satisfactorily and timely complete all restoration required by the Director,
the Director, at his or her option, may do the work. In that event, the
permittee shall pay to the city, within 30 days of billing, the cost of
restoring the right-of-way. If the permittee fails to pay as required, the city
may exercise its rights under the construction performance bond.
   (F)   Degradation fee in lieu of restoration. In lieu of right-of-way

make application for a permit extension and pay any additional fees required
thereby, and be granted a new permit or permit extension.
   (B)   Limitation on dates. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the dates
specified in the permit. No permittee may begin its work before the permit
start date or, except as provided herein, continue working after the end date.
If a permittee does not finish the work by the permit end date, it must apply
for a new permit for the additional time it needs, and receive the new permit
or an extension of the old permit before working after the end date of the
previous permit. This supplementary application must be submitted before the
permit end date.

necessary to bring itself into compliance with this subchapter for the actions
it took in response to the emergency.
      (2)   If the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding facilities, the
city will attempt to contact the local representative of each facility owner
affected, or potentially affected, by the emergency. In any event, the city may
take whatever action it deems necessary to respond to the emergency, the cost
of which shall be borne by the person whose facilities occasioned the
emergency.
   (B)   Non-emergency situations. Except in an emergency, any person who,

way and comply with all of the requirements of this subchapter.
(2002 Code, § 5.08)

to revoke any right-of-way permit, without a fee refund if there is a
substantial breach of the terms and conditions of any statute, ordinance, rule
or regulation, or any material condition of the permit. A substantial breach by
the permittee shall include, but shall not be limited, to the following:
      (1)   The violation of any material provision of the right-of-way permit;
      (2)   An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the right-
of-way permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit

conform to a condition indicated on an order issued pursuant to §
151.065 of this chapter.

has committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any statute,
ordinance, rule, regulation or any condition of the permit the city shall make
a written demand upon the permittee to remedy that violation. The demand shall
state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. A
substantial breach, as stated above, will allow the city, at its discretion, to
place additional or revised conditions on the permit to mitigate and remedy the
breach.
   (C)   Response to notice of breach. Within 24 hours of receiving
notification of the breach, the permittee shall provide the city with a plan,
acceptable to the city, that will cure the breach. The permittee’s failure to
so contact the city, or the permittee’s failure to submit an acceptable plan,
or the permittee’s failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be
cause for immediate revocation of the permit.
   (D)   Reimbursement of city costs. If a permit is revoked, the permittee
shall also reimburse the city for the city’s reasonable costs, including
restoration costs and the costs of collection and reasonable attorneys’ fees
incurred in connection with the revocation.

way, or any particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of
facilities that is or, pursuant to current technology, the city expects will
someday be located within the right-of-way. All excavation, obstruction or
other permits issued by the city involving the installation or replacement of
facilities shall designate the proper corridor for the facilities at issue.
   (C)   Limitation of space. To protect the health, safety and welfare or when
necessary to protect the right-of-way and its current use, the Director shall
have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional
facilities within the right-of-way. In making those decisions, the Director
shall strive to the extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential
users of the right-of-way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of
the public interest, the public’s needs for the particular utility service, the
condition of the right-of-way, the time of year with respect to essential
utilities, the protection of existing facilities in the right-of-way and future
city plans for public improvements and development projects which have been
determined to be in the public interest.

STORM WATER DRAINAGE UTILITY
§ 152.01 ESTABLISHMENT.
   Pursuant to M.S. § 444.075, as it may be amended from time to time, the city
establishes a storm drainage utility and authorizes the imposition of just and
reasonable charges for the use and availability of storm drainage facilities.
The storm drainage utility operations shall be a part of the Public Works
Department and under the administration of the City Administrator.
(2002 Code, § 3.93) (Ord. 14, Fifth Series, passed 11-18-1996)
§ 152.02 FINDINGS AND DETERMINATION.
   (A)   In the exercise of its governmental authority and in order to promote
the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare, the city has
constructed, operated and maintained a storm drainage system. This subchapter
is adopted in the further exercise of the authority and for the same purposes.
   (B)   The system, as constructed heretofore, has been financed and paid for
through the imposition of special assessments and ad valorem taxes. It is now
necessary and desirable to provide an additional method of recovering some or
all of the future costs of improving, establishing, enlarging, replacing,
repairing, maintaining and operating the system through the imposition of
charges as provided in this subchapter.
   (C)   In imposing charges, it is necessary to establish a methodology that
undertakes to make them just and equitable. Taking into account the status of
completion of the system, past methods of recovering system costs, the
topography of the city and other relevant factors, it is determined that it
would be just and equitable to assign responsibility for some or all of the
future costs of improving, establishing, enlarging, replacing, repairing,
maintaining and operating the system on the basis of the expected storm water
runoff from the various parcels of land within the city during a standard
rainfall event.
(2002 Code, § 3.93) (Ord. 14, Fifth Series, passed 11-18-1996)
§ 152.03 STORM DRAINAGE UTILITY FUND.
   There is hereby created a Storm Drainage Utility Fund into which all
charges, when collected, and all moneys received from the sale of any
facilities or equipment or any by-products shall be placed. The moneys shall be
used first to pay the normal, reasonable and current costs of operating and
maintaining the facilities.
(2002 Code, § 3.93) (Ord. 14, Fifth Series, passed 11-18-1996)
§ 152.04 “RUNOFF EQUIVALENT FACTOR” (“REF”) DEFINED.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, RUNOFF EQUIVALENT FACTOR (REF) is
defined as the ratio of the average volume of surface water runoff generated by
one acre of a given land use to the average volume of runoff generated by one
acre of typical single-family residential land, during a standard one-year
rainfall event.
(2002 Code, § 3.93) (Ord. 14, Fifth Series, passed 11-18-1996)
§ 152.05 STORM WATER DRAINAGE CHARGES.
   (A)   In determining charges, the City Council shall, by resolution,
establish a basic system rate to be charged monthly against one standardized or
measured drainage unit having an REF of one. The charge to be made against each
parcel of land shall then be determined by multiplying the REF for the parcel’s
land use, classification times the parcel’s drainage unit times the basic
system rate.
   (B)   The REF values for various land uses are as follows:
 
Class Land Use                                                           REF
1     Single-family and duplex residential                               1.00
2     Small commercial                                                   2.00
3     Large commercial, industrial, institutional, churches and the like 4.00
4     Parks, cemeteries and vacant land                                  0.00
 
(2002 Code, §3.93) (Ord. 14, Fifth Series, passed 11-18-1996)
§ 152.06 DRAINAGE UNITS.
   (A)   Standardized drainage unit (Classification 1). For the purpose of
calculating storm water drainage charges, all Classification 1 land use parcels
shall be considered to have one drainage unit per residence (duplex, two
residences).
   (B)   Standardized drainage unit (Classification 2). For the purpose of
calculating storm water drainage charges, all Classification 2 land use parcels
shall be considered to have one drainage unit per business (maximum parcel size
= one-half an acre).
   (C)   Measured drainage unit (Classification 3). For the purpose of
calculating storm water drainage charges, all Classification 3 land use parcels
shall be considered to have one drainage unit for each one acre of measured
impermeable surface (roofs, parking lots and the like) located on the parcel
(minimum parcel size = one-half an acre).
(2002 Code, § 3.93) (Ord. 14, Fifth Series, passed 11-18-1996)
§ 152.07 OTHER LAND USES.
   (A)   Other land uses not listed in the foregoing table shall be classified
by the City Administrator by assigning them to classes most nearly like the
listed uses, from the standpoint of runoff volume for the standard rainfall
event.
   (B)   An appeal of the classifications from the determination of the City
Administrator may be made to the City Council.
(2002 Code, § 3.93) (Ord. 14, Fifth Series, passed 11-18-1996)
§ 152.08 ADJUSTMENT OF CHARGE.
   The City Council may, by resolution, adopt policies providing for the
adjustment of charges for parcels based upon land use data supplied by affected
property owners which demonstrates a runoff volume for a standard rainfall
event substantially different from the REF being used for the parcels. The
adjustments for storm water drainage charges shall not be made retroactively.
(2002 Code, § 3.93) (Ord. 14, Fifth Series, passed 11-18-1996)
§ 152.09 EXEMPTIONS.
   Public street rights-of-way, cemeteries, parks and vacant land with ground
cover are exempt from storm water drainage charges.
(2002 Code, § 3.93) (Ord. 14, Fifth Series, passed 11-18-1996)
§ 152.10 PAYMENT OF CHARGE.
   Statements for storm water drainage charges shall be made a part of the
present utility billing system invoiced through the City Administrator’s office
on a monthly basis. All charges shall be subject to established procedure for
determining and collecting customer charges.
(2002 Code, § 3.93) (Ord. 14, Fifth Series, passed 11-18-1996)
§ 152.11 LATE PAYMENT PENALTY.
   Each billing for storm water drainage charges which are not paid when due
shall incur a penalty charge of 10% of the amount past due.
(2002 Code, § 3.93) (Ord. 14, Fifth Series, passed 11-18-1996)
§ 152.12 ESTABLISHMENT OF TAX LIEN.
   Any past due storm water drainage charges will be certified to the County
Auditor for collection with real estate taxes against the property served by
the utility established in this subchapter for collection as other taxes are
collected in the following year pursuant to M.S. § 444.075, subd. 3, as it may
be amended from time to time, and the code. In addition, the city may have the
right to bring a civil action or take other legal remedies to collect unpaid
charges.
(2002 Code, § 3.93) (Ord. 14, Fifth Series, passed 11-18-1996)
STORM WATER MANAGEMENT
§ 152.25 PURPOSE.
   (A)   This subchapter outlines the requirements for storm water management
systems within the city. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of
this subchapter or other regulations adopted by the city, the state or federal
authorities, the more restrictive standard prevails. The objectives of this
subchapter are as follows:
      (1)   To protect the natural resources within the city from undesirable
impacts related to development or other activities;
      (2)   To promote the safety of people and property through effective
storm water quantity and quality management practices;
      (3)   To regulate land development activity, land-disturbing activity or
other activities that may have an adverse impact on storm water quantity or
quality;
      (4)   To establish standards and procedures for land development
activities throughout the city, which balance development and the protection of
water quality;
      (5)   To provide the basis for storm water system analysis necessary to
protect public and private property, water quality and existing natural
resources; and
      (6)   To comply with the requirements of the city’s National Pollution
Discharge Elimination System’s (NPDES) municipal separate storm sewer system
(MS4) permit and associated storm water pollution prevention program (SWPPP).
   (B)   Except as otherwise provided herein, the City Engineer shall
administer, implement and enforce the provisions of this subchapter.
(2002 Code, § 3.94) (Ord. 109, Sixth Series, effective 6-25-2009; Ord. 24,
Seventh Series, effective 5-23-2015)
§ 152.26 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   APPLICANT. Any person or group that applies for a building permit,
subdivision approval, zoning change, approach, excavation or special use
permit, storm water plan approval or any other permit which allows land-
disturbing activities.
   BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES (BMP). Erosion and sediment control and water
quality management practices that are the most effective and practicable means
of controlling, preventing and minimizing the degradation of surface water,
including construction-phasing, minimizing the length of time soil areas are
exposed, prohibitions and other management practices published by federal,
state or designated area-wide planning agencies.
   BMPs. Measures designed to:
      (1)   Prevent pollutants from leaving a specific area;
      (2)   Reduce/eliminate the introduction of pollutants;
      (3)   Protect sensitive areas; or
      (4)   Prevent the interaction between precipitation and pollutants.
   BUFFER. 
      (1)   The buffer strip begins at the ordinary high water mark for
wetlands and the top of the bank of the channel for rivers and streams. This
start point corresponds to the State Department of Natural Resources’
definition of a “shoreline” in Minn. Rules part 6115.0030 or as may be amended
from time to time.
      (2)   A protective vegetated zone located adjacent to a natural resource,
such as a water of the state that is subject to direct or indirect human
alteration. Such a buffer strip is an integral part of protecting an aquatic
ecosystem through trapping sheet erosion, filtering pollutants, reducing
channel erosion and providing adjacent habitat.
   CITY. The City of Fergus Falls or the City Council of the City of Fergus
Falls.
   CITY ENGINEER. The City Engineer of the City of Fergus Falls or authorized
agent. The CITY ENGINEER may require a third party Engineer’s service at the
applicant’s expense.
   COMMON PLAN OF DEVELOPMENT OR SALE. A contiguous area where multiple
separate and distinct land-disturbing activities may be taking place at
different times, or on different schedules, but under one proposed plan. This
item is broadly defined to include design, permit application, advertisement or
physical demarcation indicating that land-disturbing activities may occur.
   CONTROL MEASURE. A practice or combination of practices to control erosion
and attendant pollution. See also BMPs (BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES).
   COUNCIL. The City Council of the City of Fergus Falls.
   DETENTION FACILITY. A natural or human-made structure, including wetlands,
used for the temporary storage of runoff and which may contain a permanent pool
of water or may be dry during times of no runoff.
   DEVELOPMENT. Any land-disturbance activity that changes the site’s runoff
characteristics in conjunction with residential, commercial, industrial or
institutional construction or alteration.
   DEVELOPER. A person, firm, corporation, sole proprietorship, partnership,
federal or state agency, or political subdivision thereof engaged in a land-
disturbance and/or land development activity.
   DISCHARGE. The release, conveyance, channeling, runoff or drainage of storm
water, including snowmelt.
   DRAINAGE EASEMENT. A right to use the land of another for a specific
purpose, such as a right-of-way for the movement of water across or under the
land surface or the storage of water.
   DRAINAGE SYSTEM. Local drainage system.
   EROSION. Removing the surface of the land by the action of water, wind, ice
or gravity. EROSION can be accelerated by the activities of humans and nature.
   EROSION CONTROL. Refers to methods employed to prevent erosion. Examples
include soil stabilization practices, horizontal slope grading, temporary or
permanent cover, and construction phasing.
   EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL PLAN (E&S CONTROL PLAN). A written description
and/or plan indicating the number, locations, sizes and other pertinent
information about best management practice methods designed to reduce erosion
of the land surface and the deposition of sediment within a waterway. An E&S
CONTROL PLAN is required as part of a storm water management plan. Both the
storm water management plan and E&S CONTROL PLANS are used in developing the
state-mandated storm water pollution prevention plan (SWPPP). An E&S CONTROL
PLAN may be required for certain projects not requiring a full storm water
management plan, as outlined in this subchapter or determined necessary by the
City Engineer.
   EXPOSED SOIL AREAS. All areas of the construction site where the vegetation
(trees, shrubs, brush, grasses and the like) or impervious surface has been
removed, thus rendering the soil more prone to erosion. This includes topsoil
stockpile areas, borrow areas and disposal areas within the construction site.
It does not include temporary stockpiles or surcharge areas of clean sand,
gravel, concrete or bituminous, which have less stringent protection. Once soil
is exposed, it is considered EXPOSED SOIL, until it meets the definition of
“final stabilization”.
   FINAL STABILIZATION. All soil disturbing activities at the site have been
completed, and that a uniform (evenly distributed - e.g., without large bare
areas) perennial vegetative cover with a density of 70% of the cover for
unpaved areas and areas not covered by permanent structures has been
established, or equivalent permanent stabilization measures have been employed.
Simply sowing grass seed is not considered FINAL STABILIZATION. Where
agricultural land is involved, such as when pipelines are built on crop or
rangeland, FINAL STABILIZATION constitutes returning the land to its
preconstruction agricultural use.
   HYDRIC SOILS. Soils that are saturated, flooded or ponded long enough during
the growing season to develop anaerobic conditions in the upper part of the
soil profile.
   HYDROPHYTIC VEGETATION. Macrophytic (large enough to be observed by the
naked eye) plant life growing in water, soil or on a substrate that is at least
periodically deficient in oxygen as a result of excessive water content.
   IMPERVIOUS AREA. A constructed hard surface that either prevents or retards
the entry of water into the soil, and causes water to run off the surface in
greater quantities and at an increased rate of flow than existed prior to
development. Examples include rooftops, sidewalks, patios, driveways, parking
lots, storage areas and concrete, asphalt or gravel parking lots and roads.
   LAND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY. The act of subdivision or platting properties for
personal use, adding value or for the purposes of resale. This includes the
construction and/or demolition of buildings, structures, roads, parking lots,
paved storage areas and similar facilities.
   LAND-DISTURBING ACTIVITY. Any land change that may result in soil erosion
from water or wind and the movement of sediments into or upon waters or lands
within the city’s jurisdiction, including construction, clearing and grubbing,
grading, excavating, transporting and filling of land. Within the context of
this subchapter, LAND-DISTURBANCE ACTIVITY does not mean:
      (1)   MINOR LAND-DISTURBANCE ACTIVITIES such as home gardens and an
individual’s home landscaping, repairs and maintenance work, which will not
result in sediments entering the storm water system;
      (2)   Additions or modifications to existing single-family structures
that result in creating under 5,000 square feet of exposed soil or impervious
surface and will not result in sediments entering the storm water system;
      (3)   Construction, installation, and maintenance of trees, fences,
signs, posts, poles and electric, telephone, cable television, utility lines or
individual service connections to these utilities, which result in creating
under 5,000 square feet of exposed soil or impervious surface and will not
result in sediments entering the storm water system;
      (4)   Tilling, planting or harvesting of agricultural, horticultural or
silvicultural (forestry) crops; and/or
      (5)   Emergency work to protect life, limb or property and emergency
repairs, unless the land- disturbing activity would have otherwise required an
approved erosion and sediment control plan, except for the emergency. If such a
plan would have been required, then the disturbed land area shall be shaped and
stabilized in accordance with the city’s requirements as soon as possible.
   LANDOWNER. Any person holding title to or having a divided or undivided
interest in land.
   LOCAL DETENTION. Detention intended to serve only the developing area in
question and no areas outside of the development boundaries. As such, it is
under the control of one owner or group of owners. This is also known as ON-
SITE DETENTION.
   LOCAL DRAINAGE SYSTEM. The storm drainage system which transports the minor
and major storm water runoff to the major storm water system serving only the
property within the development boundaries, under the control of one owner or
group of owners. This is also known as the ON-SITE DRAINAGE SYSTEM.
   MANAGEMENT PRACTICE. A practice or combination of practices to control
erosion and water quality degradation.
   MUNICIPAL SEPARATE STORM SEWER SYSTEM (MS4). The system of conveyances and
structural stormwater BMPs (including sidewalks, roads with drainage systems,
municipal streets, catch basins, curbs, gutters, ditches, constructed channels
or storm drains) owned or operated by the city, designed or used for collecting
or conveying stormwater, and not used for collection or conveying wastewater
that discharges to waters of the country.
   NATIONAL POLLUTION DISCHARGE ELIMINATION SYSTEM (NPDES) STORM WATER PERMIT.

any other surface runoff and drainage. STORM WATER does not include
construction site dewatering.
   STORM WATER DEPRESSED DETENTION. Temporary storage of storm water runoff in
ponds, parking lots, grassy areas, rooftops, buried underground tanks and the
like, for future or controlled release. Used to delay and attenuate flow.
   STORM WATER MANAGEMENT. The planned set of public policies and activities
undertaken to regulate runoff and reduce erosion, and maintain or improve water
quality under various specified conditions within various portions of the
drainage system. It may establish criteria for controlling peak flows and/or
runoff volumes, for runoff detention and retention, or for pollution control,
and may specify criteria for the relative elevations among various elements of
the drainage system. STORM WATER MANAGEMENT is primarily concerned with
limiting future flood damages and environmental impacts due to development,
whereas flood control aims at reducing the extent of flooding that occurs under
current conditions.
   STORM WATER MANAGEMENT CRITERIA. Specific guidance provided to the engineer/
designer to carry out drainage and storm water management policies. An example
might be the specification of local design hydrology and use of the design
storm.
   STORM WATER MANAGEMENT PLAN. A document containing the requirements
identified by the city in §§
152.29 and
152.30 of this chapter that when implemented will provide solutions to storm
water management problems that may occur as a result of the proposed
development or land-disturbing activity.
   STORM WATER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. Physical facilities that collect, store,
convey and treat storm water runoff in urban areas. These facilities normally
include detention and retention facilities, streets, storm sewers, inlets, open
channels and special structures, such as inlets, manholes and energy
dissipaters.
   STORM WATER POLLUTION PREVENTION PLAN (SWPPP). A joint storm water and
erosion and sediment control plan that is written as a prerequisite to
obtaining an NPDES storm water permit for construction activity, that when
implemented will decrease soil erosion on a parcel of land and off-site non-
point pollution. It involves both temporary and permanent controls. The SWPPP,
which draws its information from a storm water management plan and is typically
condensed, must be incorporated into the construction grading plans for the
project.
   STORM WATER RETENTION STRUCTURE. Storage designed to eliminate or reduce the
frequency of subsequent surface discharge. Wet ponds are the most common type
of retention storage (though wet ponds may also be used for detention storage).
Anything manufactured, constructed or erected which is normally attached to or
positioned on land, including portable structures, earthen structures, roads,
parking lots and paved storage areas.
   SUBDIVISION. Any tract of land divided into building lots for private,
public, commercial, industrial and the like development for the purpose of
sale, rent or lease, including planned unit development.
   SYSTEM CHARGE OR ASSESSMENT. A charge for connecting an outlet to a regional
storm water management facility, typically a pond. The charge is normally
assessed to recover the proportional cost of constructing a regional pond or
storm water treatment facility.
   TEMPORARY PROTECTION. Short-term methods employed to prevent erosion.
Examples of such protection are straw, mulch, erosion control blankets, wood
chips and erosion netting.
   UNDEVELOPED LAND. Land that in its current state has not been impacted by
significant land- disturbance activities, annexed into the city or subdivided
into multiple ownership lots and is typically zoned agricultural.
   URBAN AREA. Land associated with, or part of, a defined city or town.
   USER. Any person who discharges, causes or permits the discharge of storm
water into the city’s storm water management system.
   VIOLATION. The willful or negligent act of non-compliance with the
conditions attached to an approved storm water plan and/or permit, or any other
provisions contained in this subchapter, subject to enforcement and penalty or
non-compliance fees.
   WATERCOURSE. The natural path for the flow of water where there is
sufficient natural and accustomed runoff to form and maintain a distinct and
defined channel or an open channel facility that has been constructed for such
purpose. This shall include any easements obtained for the purposes of runoff
conveyance.
   WATERS OF THE STATE. All streams, lakes, ponds, marshes, watercourses,
waterways, wells, springs, reservoirs, aquifers, irrigation systems, drainage
systems and all other bodies or accumulations of water, surface or underground,
natural or artificial, public or private, which are contained within, flow
through or border upon the state or any portion thereof.
   WATERSHED MASTER PLAN. A plan that an engineer/designer formulates to manage
urban storm water runoff for a particular project or drainage area. It
typically addresses such subjects as characterization of the existing and
future site development, land use and grading plan, peak rates of runoff, flow
duration, runoff volumes for various return frequencies, locations, criteria
and sizes of detention or retention ponds and conveyances; runoff control
features; land parcels, easement locations, opinions of probable costs,
measures to enhance runoff quality, salient regulations and how the plan
addresses them and consistency with secondary objectives such as public
recreation, aesthetics, public safety and ground water recharge. It may be
submitted to regulatory officials for their review for adoption.
   WET POND or WET DETENTION FACILITY. A retention facility which includes a
permanent pool of water used for the purposes of providing for the treatment of
storm water runoff.
   WETLANDS. Lands that transition between terrestrial and aquatic systems
(excluding drainage ditch bottoms) where the water table is usually at or near
the surface or the land is covered by shallow water. For purposes of this
definition, WETLANDS must have the following three attributes:
      (1)   A predominance of hydric soils;
      (2)   Are inundated or saturated by the surface or ground water at a
frequency and duration sufficient to support a prevalence of hydrophytic
vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions; and
      (3)   Under normal circumstances support the prevalence of the
vegetation.

2022)
§ 152.27 SCOPE; EXEMPTIONS; INSTALLATION AND REPAIR.
   (A)   Prohibited discharges. It shall be considered an offense for any
person to cause or allow a prohibited discharge into waters of the state,
including the city storm water system or any natural water.
   (B)   Land-disturbing activity requiring a storm water management plan. Any
person, firm, sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, state agency or
political subdivision proposing subdivision or plat approval, a building permit
or any land-disturbance activity greater than one acre within the city must
submit a state-issued NPDES permit and storm water pollution prevention plan to
the City Engineer unless a waiver is provided in accordance with this
subchapter. No subdivision approval, plat approval or building permit shall be
issued until a state NPDES permit and storm water pollution prevention plan or
a waiver of the approval requirements has been approved by the City Engineer in
strict conformance with the provisions of this subchapter. No land shall be
disturbed until the permit is approved by the City Engineer and conforms to the
standards set forth herein. A storm water management plan may also be required
in some situations as determined by the City Engineer (i.e., development within
an existing subdivision with documented flooding problems associated with storm
water runoff).
   (C)   Exemptions. Exemptions to the storm water management plan requirements
of this subchapter include:
      (1)   Any part of a subdivision that is included in a plat that has been
approved by the City Council and recorded with the office of the County
Recorder on or before the effective date of this subchapter. A storm water
permit for land-disturbing activities on such properties may still be required,
as determined by the City Engineer, and such activities are still subject to
other compliance requirements in accordance with this subchapter;
      (2)   A storm water management plan is generally not required for
individual lots or properties located within a subdivision or plat for which a
storm water management plan has already been approved. This exemption is
subject to the City Engineer’s consideration and approval;
      (3)   A parcel for which a building permit has been approved on and/or
before the effective date of this section and an NPDES/SDS permit was not
required;
      (4)   Any land-disturbance activity not associated with building
construction that will affect less than one acre of undeveloped land; or
      (5)   Emergency work to protect life, limb or property.
   (D)   Land-disturbing activity involving the construction of a single-family
or two-family dwelling. Construction of single-family or two-family dwellings
must comply with in place approved BMPs and any existing permitted SWPPP for
the subdivision, including NPDES/SDS permit requirements and subdivision
agreement. Compliance with the single-family residential construction erosion/
sediment control standards is required.
   (E)   Installation and repair of utility service lines.
      (1)   At project sites that require permit coverage where a utility
contractor is not the site owner or operator, each utility contractor must
comply with the provisions of the storm water pollution prevention plan (SWPPP)
for the project their construction activities will impact. Each utility
contractor must ensure that their activities do not render ineffective, the
erosion prevention and sediment control best management practices (BMPs) for
the site. Should a utility contractor damage or render ineffective any BMPs for
the site, the owner must ensure such BMPs are repaired or replaced within seven
days of completion of utility installation on the site.
      (2)   At project sites where a utility contractor is the site owner or
operator, and the utility company disturbs one or more acres of soil for the
purpose of installation of utility service lines, including, but not limited
to, residential electric, gas, telephone and cable lines, the utility company
must apply for permit coverage from the state prior to commencement of
construction.
      (3)   Utility contractors working in a street right-of-way to repair
existing or install new utilities and disturbing less than one acre are
required to provide appropriate inlet protection and sediment control during
the course of the work so as to ensure the storm sewer system is protected from
pollution. The utility contractor is also required to provide street sweeping
as necessary to ensure that sediments resulting from their activity do not
enter the storm water system following construction. The street shall be swept
within working day of completion of utility installation on the site. All
disturbed vegetation shall be replaced with seed or sod within seven days of
completion of utility installation on the site. The city will provide guidance
regarding acceptable temporary protection BMPs for inlets and methods to
stabilize the exposed soil areas until they meet the definition of final
stabilization.
   (F)   Waivers. The City Engineer may waive any requirement of this
subchapter upon making a finding that compliance with the requirement will
involve an unnecessary hardship, and the waiver of such requirement is not
contrary to the objectives in this subchapter. The City Engineer may require as
a condition of the waiver, the dedication or construction, or agreement to
dedicate or construct, as may be necessary to adequately meet the standards and
requirements.

§ 152.28 SITE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   Any landowner shall provide for the installation and maintenance of
vegetation on his or her property in accordance with the following criteria,
regardless as to whether or not a storm water management plan has been approved
or is necessary under this subchapter.
      (1)   Use of impervious surfaces. No person shall apply items included in
the definition of “prohibited discharge” on impervious surfaces or within storm
water drainage systems with impervious liners or conduits.
      (2)   Unimproved land areas. Except for driveways, sidewalks, patios,
areas occupied by structures, landscaped areas or areas that have been
otherwise improved, all areas shall be covered by plants or vegetative growth.
      (3)   Use of pervious surfaces. No person shall deposit grass clippings,
leaves or other vegetative materials, with the exception of normal mowing or
weed control, within natural or human-made watercourses, wetlands or within
wetland buffer areas. No person shall deposit items included in the definition
of “prohibited discharge”, except as noted above.
   (B)   Failure to comply with this subchapter shall constitute a violation
and subject the landowner to the enforcement provisions, penalties and non-
compliance fees outlined in §§
152.39 and
152.99 of this chapter.

§ 152.32 CONDITIONS.
   A storm water management plan may be approved subject to compliance with
conditions reasonable and necessary to ensure that the requirements contained
in this subchapter are met. The conditions may, among other matters, limit the
size, kind or character of the proposed development, require the construction
of structures, drainage facilities, storage basins and other facilities,
require replacement of vegetation, establish required monitoring procedures,
stage the work over time, require alteration of the site design to ensure
proper buffering, require the acquisition or dedication of certain lands or
easements and require the conveyance to the city or other public entity of
certain lands or interests therein for storm water system facilities. The City
Engineer may specify special requirements or conditions for specific major or
minor watersheds within the city and its extraterritorial jurisdiction. The
nature of these requirements will be subject to the unique environmental and
natural resource environment of each sub watershed. Approval of a plan shall
bind the applicant to perform and comply with all the requirements and
conditions of the plan prior to commencing or concurrent with any land-
disturbing activities.

§ 152.33 PLAN; APPROVAL STANDARDS.
   The City Engineer shall not approve a storm water management plan which
fails to meet the standards set forth within this section. Other standards of
the most currently approved NPDES/SDS and NPDES MS4 permit must be met by
proposed stormwater plans. If the standards of different agencies conflict, the
more restrictive standards shall apply. It shall be the applicant’s
responsibility to obtain any required permits from other governmental agencies
having any jurisdictional authority over the work to be performed. The city may
choose to obtain some of the required permits. The applicant will be notified
which permits are to be obtained by the city.

§ 152.34 STATE’S STORM WATER MANUAL.
   The Minnesota Storm Water Manual contains the principal standards and design
criteria for developing an effective and acceptable storm water management
plan. The Manual contains an overview of state storm water management policy
and design objectives as well as a detailed discussion of the required contents
for storm water management plans submitted to the state for approval. The
Manual contains detailed criteria for hydrologic evaluations, the design of
storm water management system facility components, water quality protection
standards, instructions for the development of an erosion and sedimentation
control plan. The Manual also contains a discussion of operation and
maintenance requirements, standard forms to be used and standard construction
details approved by the state.

§ 152.35 MODELS, METHODOLOGIES AND COMPUTATIONS.
   Other than those outlined in the Manual, any hydrologic models and/or design
methodologies used to determine runoff conditions and to analyze storm water
management structures and facilities, shall be approved in advance by the City
Engineer. All storm water management plans, drawings, specifications and
computations for storm water management facilities submitted for review shall
contain a validated seal and shall be signed by a professional engineer
registered in the state.
(2002 Code, § 3.94) (Ord. 109, Sixth Series, effective 6-25-2009; Ord. 24,
Seventh Series, effective 5-23-2015)
§ 152.36 CRITERIA FOR NEW AND REDEVELOPED PERMANENT FACILITIES.
   Storm water control facilities, included as part of the final design for a
permanent development, shall be addressed in the storm water management plan
and shall meet the following criteria:
   (A)   Pre- versus post-hydrological response of site. An applicant shall
design, install or construct, on or for the proposed land-disturbing activity,
development activity or redevelopment activity, all storm water management
facilities necessary to manage runoff such that increases in flow under the
design conditions will not occur that could exceed the capacity of the outlet,
or the storm water management system, into which the site discharges or that
would cause the storm water management system to be overloaded or accelerate
channel erosion as a result of the proposed land-disturbing activity or
development activity. Under no circumstances shall the two-, ten- or 100-year
developed peak flow exceed the two-, ten- or 100-year existing peak flow
without prior written approval by the City Engineer. Post construction storm
water management BMPs shall be installed to the maximum extent practical (MEP)
and shall show a net per annual basis reduction for volume, total suspended
solids (TSS) and total phosphorus (TP) for new or redeveloped sites from pre-
project conditions. For regional detention or storm water management system,
the City Engineer shall recommend a proposed system charge or assessment to be
approved by the City Council based upon an approved watershed master plan and
an analysis of required drainage systems, projected costs and flood protection
benefits provided to those properties directly or indirectly impacted by the
regional detention or storm water management system. Design criteria must meet
the most current state approved NPDES/SDS and NPDES/MS4 general permit
requirements.
   (B)   Natural features of the site. The applicant shall give consideration
to reducing the need for storm water management system facilities by
incorporating the use of natural topography and land cover such as wetlands,
ponds, natural swales and depressions as they exist before development to the
degree that they can accommodate the additional water flow without compromising
the integrity or quality of these natural features.
   (C)   Storm water management strategies.
      (1)   The following storm water management practices shall be
investigated when developing a storm water management plan in accordance with
this section and the city code:
         (a)   Natural infiltration of precipitation and runoff on-site, if
suitable soil profiles can be created during site grading. The purpose of this
strategy is to encourage the development of a storm water management plan that
encourages natural infiltration. This includes, providing as much natural or
vegetated area on the site as possible, minimizing impervious surfaces and
directing runoff to vegetated areas rather than onto adjoining streets, storm
sewers and ditches;
         (b)   Flow attenuation by use of open vegetated swales and natural
depressions;
         (c)   Storm water detention facilities;
         (d)   Storm water retention facilities (on a case by case basis); and
         (e)   Other facilities requested by the City Engineer.
      (2)   A combination of successive practices may be used to achieve the
applicable minimum control requirements specified. Justification shall be
provided by the applicant for the method selected, except as provided in storm
water management “limitations” noted in the state’s NPDES general permit.
      (3)   For non-linear projects, where the water quality volume cannot cost
effectively be treated on the site of the original construction activity, the
applicant is required to identify locations where off-site treatment projects
can be completed. If the entire water quality volume is not addressed on the
site of the original construction activity, the remaining water quality volume
must be addressed through off-site treatment.
         (a)   Off-site treatment project areas shall be selected in the
following order of preference: locations that yield benefits to the same
receiving water that receives runoff from the original construction activity;
locations within the same Department of Natural Resource (DNR) catchment area
as the original construction activity; locations in the next adjacent DNR
catchment area up-stream; or locations anywhere within the regulated party’s
jurisdiction.
         (b)   Off-site treatment projects must involve the creation of new
structural stormwater BMPs or the retrofit of existing structural stormwater
BMPs, or the use of a properly designed regional structural stormwater BMP.
Routine maintenance of structural stormwater BMPs already required by the
general permit cannot be used to meet this requirement.
   (D)   Adequacy of outlets. The adequacy of any outlet used as a discharge
point for proposed storm water management system must be assessed and
documented to the satisfaction of the City Engineer. To the extent practicable,
hydraulic capacities of downstream natural channels, storm sewer systems or
streets shall be evaluated to determine if they have sufficient conveyance
capacity to receive and accommodate post-development runoff discharges and
volumes. In addition, projected velocities in downstream natural or human-made
channels shall not exceed that which is reasonably anticipated to cause erosion
unless protective measures acceptable to the City Engineer are approved and
installed as part of the storm water management plan. The assessment of outlet
adequacy shall be included in the storm water management plan.
(2002 Code, § 3.94) (Ord. 109, Sixth Series, effective 6-25-2009; Ord. 24,
Seventh Series, effective 5-23-2015; Ord. 31, Eighth Series, effective 12-11-
2023)
§ 152.37 OPERATION, MAINTENANCE AND INSPECTION.
   (A)   All storm water management systems shall be designed to minimize the
need for maintenance, to provide easy vehicle (typically eight feet or wider)
and personnel access for maintenance purposes, and to be structurally sound.
All storm water management systems shall have a plan of operation and
maintenance that assures continued effective removal of pollutants carried in
storm water runoff. The City Engineer may inspect all public and private storm
water management systems at any time. Inspection records will be kept on file
at the City Engineer’s office. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant
to obtain any necessary easements or other property interests to allow access
to the storm water management system for inspection and maintenance purposes.
The owner must perform routine maintenance and inspections that are required
annually and includes mowing grass, controlling weeds and woody vegetation,
repairing eroded areas and removing debris. Owner shall maintain records and
provide annual maintenance and inspection reports. The reports shall be made
available to the city upon request.
   (B)   The owner must perform non-routine maintenance which includes sediment
cleanout and major structural repairs when needed. Inspections for non-routine
maintenance items must occur at a minimum of every five years. Sediment
cleanout must occur when 50% of the permanent pool storage volume is sediment.
The City Engineer shall retain enforcement powers for assuring adequate
operation and maintenance activities through permit conditions, penalties, non-
compliance orders and fees.
(2002 Code, § 3.94) (Ord. 109, Sixth Series, effective 6-25-2009; Ord. 24,

2023)
§ 152.38 EASEMENTS.
   Easements may be required as conditions to the issuance of a storm water
management plan approval. If a storm water management plan involves directing
some or all of the site’s runoff to a drainage easement, the applicant or his
or her designated representative shall obtain from the property owners any
necessary easements or other property interests concerning the flowing of the
water. No fill, structures, fences, walls, rip-rap, buildings, docks, bridges,
fountains or other similar encumbrances to access or restrictions to the flow
of water may be placed within the drainage easement without the prior written
consent of the city.

§ 152.39 PLAN APPLICABILITY.
   A storm water management plan approval issued under this subchapter runs
with the land and is a condition of plat or development approval. Any landowner
or subsequent landowner of any parcel within the plat or development area must
comply with the plan or any approval, condition, revision or modification of
the plan. The landowner must also comply with all applicable state subdivision
registration, permit transfer/modification and notice of termination permits
and provide a copy of the permit applications to the city for approval. Failure
to comply with this plan shall constitute a violation and subject the
permittee, developer and/or landowner to the enforcement provisions, penalties
and non-compliance fees.

§ 152.40 PLAN AMENDMENT.
   Storm water management plans may be amended only by a written request
submitted to the City Engineer. This request shall contain the reason for the
change and documentation related to any additional change in projected impacts,
which may result from amendment approval. Amendment requests submitted prior to
final approval of a plan application shall be considered part of the original
submittal. Amendment requests filed after plan approval shall be considered
following the same procedures as if it were a new application and subject to
applicable review periods.

§ 152.41 NPDES PERMITS.
   (A)   It is unlawful to initiate any land development activity, land-
disturbing activity or other activities which may result in an increase in
storm water quantities, degradation of storm water quality, or restriction of
flow in any storm sewer system, open ditch or natural channel, storm water
easement, waterbody or wetland outlet within the jurisdiction of the city,
without having first complied with the terms of this subchapter. Other
activities include those outlined herein.
      (1)   Permit. All persons subject to meeting the requirements and needing
to obtain a NPDES permit shall apply for coverage and file a copy with the City
Engineer. The permit will be accompanied by a storm water management plan as
prescribed under §§
152.29 and
152.30 of this chapter, if such a plan has not been previously approved. Permit
applications may be denied if the applicant is not in compliance with the NPDES
permit currently in effect. Commencing earthwork on a project prior to plan or
permit approval is considered a violation of this subchapter.
      (2)   Permit delays. The City Engineer may withhold granting approval of
a permit until all issues associated with the site are resolved to the
satisfaction of the City Engineer. Permits may be conditioned with delays such
that work cannot begin until a specified date or until after the site is
inspected.
      (3)   Permit amendments. NPDES permits may be amended (by applicant) only
by a written request submitted by the permittee to the state. This request
shall contain the reason for the change and documentation related to any
additional impacts, which may result from amendment approval. A copy of the
request will be submitted to the City Engineer within seven days of the
submittal to the state. The state- approved amended permit will also be
submitted to the City Engineer within seven days of receipt.
      (4)   Permit transfer. A NPDES permit runs with the property it covers,
until the permitted activities are completed, and is transferable to new
landowners in its entirety or by parcel, with each parcel being subject to the
permit and any conditions, which apply to that parcel. Land transfers must be
reported to the City Engineer prior to issuing of permits.
      (5)   Inspection. The City Engineer may inspect the storm water
management system of any permittee to determine compliance with the
requirements of this subchapter. The applicant shall promptly allow the city

2023)
§ 152.44 CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES.
   Construction operations must at a minimum comply with any applicable federal
or state permit and SWPPP in addition to the following best management
practices.
   (A)   Site dewatering. Water pumped from the site shall be treated by
temporary sedimentation basins, grit chambers, sand filters, upflow chambers,
hydro-cyclones, soil concentrators or other appropriate controls as deemed
necessary. Water may not be discharged in a manner that causes erosion,
sedimentation or flooding on the site, on downstream properties, in the
receiving channels or in any wetland.
   (B)   Waste and material disposal. All waste and unused building materials
(including garbage, debris, cleaning wastes, wastewater, petroleum based
products, paints, toxic materials or other hazardous materials) shall be
properly disposed of off-site and shall not be allowed to be carried by runoff
into a receiving channel, storm sewer system or wetland.
   (C)   Tracking management. Each site shall have roads, access drives and
parking areas of sufficient width, length and surfacing to minimize sediment
from being tracked onto public or private roadways. Any material deposited by
vehicles or other construction equipment onto a public or private road shall be
removed (not by flushing) before the end of each day’s work.
   (D)   Water quality protection. The construction contractor, including the
general contractor and all subcontractors, shall be required to control oil and
fuel spills and chemical discharges to prevent the spills or discharges from
entering any watercourse, sump, sewer system, waterbody or wetland.
   (E)   Site erosion and sedimentation control. Construction operations must
include erosion and sedimentation control measures meeting accepted design
criteria, standards and specifications contained in the Minnesota Storm Water
Manual or other standards determined by the City Engineer.
   (F)   Water quantity. The construction contractor, including the general
contractor and all subcontractors, shall be required to minimize the volume of
surface water runoff which flows from any specific site during development.
This volume is not to exceed the pre-development hydrologic regime to the
maximum extent practicable.
   (G)   Temporary sediment basins. Where ten or more acres of disturbed soil
drain to a common location, the permittee(s) must provide a temporary sediment
basin to provide treatment to the runoff before it leaves the construction site
or enters surface waters. A temporary sediment basin may be converted to a
permanent basin after construction is complete. The temporary basin is no
longer required when permanent cover has reduced the acreage of disturbed soil
to less than ten acres draining to a common location. The permittee(s) is/are
encouraged, but not required, to install temporary sediment basins where
appropriate in areas with steep slopes or highly erodible soils even if less
than ten acres drains to one area. The basins must be designed and constructed
according to the state’s NPDES general permit requirements.
   (H)   Mitigation provisions. Construction must meet all of the state’s NPDES
general permit requirements.

for a new permit for the additional time it needs, and receive the new permit
or an extension of the old permit before working after the end date of the
previous permit. This supplementary application must be submitted before the
permit end date.

Seventh Series, effective 4-5-2019)
§ 153.28 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.
   (A)   Compliance with other laws. Obtaining a right-of-way permit does not
relieve permittee of its duty to obtain all other necessary permits, licenses
and authority and to pay all fees required by the city or other applicable
rule, law or regulation. A permittee shall comply with all requirements of
local, state and federal laws, including, but not limited to, M.S. §§ 216D.01
to 216D.09 (Gopher One Call Excavation Notice System), as they may be amended
from time to time, and Minn. Rules Ch. 7560. A permittee shall perform all work
in conformance with all applicable codes and established rules and regulations,
and is responsible for all work done in the right-of-way pursuant to its
permit, regardless of who does the work.
   (B)   Prohibited work. Except in an emergency, and with the approval of the
city, no right-of-way obstruction or excavation may be done when seasonally
prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable for the work.
   (C)   Interference with right-of-way.
      (1)   A permittee shall not so obstruct a right-of-way that the natural
free and clear passage of water through the gutters or other waterways shall be
interfered with.
      (2)   Private vehicles of those doing work in the right-of-way may not be
parked within or next to a permit area, unless parked in conformance with city
parking regulations.
      (3)   The loading or unloading of trucks must be done solely within the
defined permit area unless specifically authorized by the permit.
   (D)   Trenchless excavation. As a condition of all applicable permits,
permittees employing trenchless excavation methods, including, but not limited
to, horizontal directional drilling, shall follow all requirements set forth in
M.S. Ch. 216D, as it may be amended from time to time, and Minn. Rules Ch. 7560
and shall require potholing or open cutting over existing underground utilities
before excavating, as determined by the Director.
(2002 Code, § 5.04) (Ord. 154, Second Series, effective 1-1-1979; Ord. 80,
Seventh Series, effective 4-5-2019)
§ 153.29 DENIAL OR REVOCATION OF PERMIT.
   (A)   Reasons for denial. The city may deny a permit for failure to meet the
requirements and conditions of this chapter or if the city determines that the
denial is necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public or
when necessary to protect the right-of-way and its current use.
   (B)   Procedural requirements. The denial or revocation of a permit must be
made in writing and must document the basis for the denial. The city must
notify the applicant or right-of-way user in writing within three business days
of the decision to deny or revoke a permit. If an application is denied, the
right-of-way user may address the reasons for denial identified by the city and
resubmit its application. If the application is resubmitted within 30 days of
receipt of the notice of denial, no additional application fee shall be
imposed. The city must approve or deny the resubmitted application within 30
days after submission.

Seventh Series, effective 4-5-2019)
§ 153.30 INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS.
   The excavation, backfilling, patching and restoration, and all other work
performed in the right-of-way shall be done in conformance with Minn. Rules
parts 7819.1100 and 7819.5000 and other applicable local requirements, in so
far as they are not inconsistent with the M.S. §§ 237.162 and 237.163, as they
may be amended from time to time. Installation of service laterals shall be
performed in accordance with Minn. Rules Ch. 7560 and these ordinances. Service
lateral installation is further subject to those requirements and conditions
set forth by the city in the applicable permits and/or agreements referenced
herein.
(2002 Code, § 5.04) (Ord. 154, Second Series, effective 1-1-1979; Ord. 80,
Seventh Series, effective 4-5-2019)
§ 153.31 INSPECTIONS.
   (A)   Notice of completion. When the work under any permit hereunder is
completed, the permittee shall furnish a completion certificate in accordance
with Minn. Rules part 7819.1300.
   (B)   Site inspection. The permittee shall make the work site available to
the city and to all others as authorized by law for inspection at all
reasonable times during the execution of and upon completion of the work.
   (C)   Authority of Director.
      (1)   At the time of inspection, the Director may order the immediate
cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the life, health, safety
or well-being of the public.
      (2)   The Director may issue an order to the permittee for any work that
does not conform to the terms of the permit or other applicable standards,
conditions or codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the
violation will be cause for revocation of the permit. Within ten days after
issuance of the order, the permittee shall present proof to the Director that
the violation has been corrected. If the proof has not been presented within
the required time, the Director may revoke the permit pursuant hereto.
(2002 Code, § 5.04) (Ord. 154, Second Series, effective 1-1-1979; Ord. 80,
Seventh Series, effective 4-5-2019)
§ 153.32 WORK DONE WITHOUT PERMIT.
   (A)   Emergency situations.
      (1)   Each registrant shall immediately notify the Director of any event
regarding its facilities that it considers to be an emergency. The registrant
may proceed to take whatever actions are necessary to respond to the emergency.
Excavators’ notification to Gopher State One Call regarding an emergency
situation does not fulfill this requirement. Within two business days after the
occurrence of the emergency, the registrant shall apply for the necessary
permits, pay the fees associated therewith and fulfill the rest of the
requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with this chapter for
the actions it took in response to the emergency.
      (2)   If the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding a registrant’s
facilities, the city will attempt to contact the local representative of each
registrant affected, or potentially affected, by the emergency. In any event,
the city may take whatever action it deems necessary to respond to the
emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the registrant whose facilities
occasioned the emergency.
   (B)   Non-emergency situations. Except in an emergency, any person who,
without first having obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or excavates a
right-of-way must subsequently obtain a permit and, as a penalty, pay double
the normal fee for said permit, pay double all the other fees required by the
city code, deposit with the city the fees necessary to correct any damage to
the right-of-way and comply with all of the requirements of this chapter.
(2002 Code, § 5.04) (Ord. 154, Second Series, effective 1-1-1979; Ord. 80,
Seventh Series, effective 4-5-2019)
§ 153.33 SUPPLEMENTARY NOTIFICATION.
   If the obstruction or excavation of the right-of-way begins later or ends
sooner than the date given on the permit, the permittee shall notify the city
of the accurate information as soon as this information is known.
(2002 Code, § 5.04) (Ord. 154, Second Series, effective 1-1-1979; Ord. 80,
Seventh Series, effective 4-5-2019)
§ 153.34 REVOCATION OF PERMITS.
   (A)   Substantial breach. The city reserves its right, as provided herein,
to revoke any right-of-way permit without a fee refund if there is a
substantial breach of the terms and conditions of any statute, ordinance, rule
or regulation, or any material condition of the permit. A substantial breach by
permittee shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following:
      (1)   The violation of any material provision of the right-of-way permit;
      (2)   An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the right-
of-way permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit
upon the city or its citizens;
      (3)   Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a
right-of-way permit;
      (4)   The failure to complete the work in a timely manner, unless a
permit extension is obtained or unless the failure to complete work is due to
reasons beyond the permittee’s control; and/or
      (5)   The failure to correct, in a timely manner, work that does not
conform to a condition indicated on an order issued pursuant hereto.
   (B)   Written notice of breach. If the city determines that the permittee
has committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any statute,
ordinance, rule, regulation or any condition of the permit, the city shall make
a written demand upon the permittee to remedy the violation. The demand shall
state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. A
substantial breach, as stated above, will allow the city, at its discretion, to
place additional or revised conditions on the permit to mitigate and remedy the
breach.
   (C)   Response to notice of breach.
      (1)   Within 24 hours of receiving notification of the breach, the
permittee shall provide the city with a plan, acceptable to the city, that will
cure the breach. The permittee’s failure to so contact the city, or the
permittee’s failure to timely submit an acceptable plan, or the permittee’s
failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be cause for immediate
revocation of the permit.
      (2)   Further, the permittee’s failure to so contact the city, or the
permittee’s failure to submit an acceptable plan, or the permittee’s failure to
reasonably implement the approved plan, shall automatically place the permittee
on probation for one full year.
   (D)   Cause for probation. From time to time, the city may establish a list
of conditions of the permit, which if breached will automatically place the
permittee on probation for one full year, such as, but not limited to, working
out of the allotted time period or working on right-of-way grossly outside of
the permit authorization.
   (E)   Automatic revocation. If a permittee, while on probation, commits a
breach as outlined above, the permittee’s permit will automatically be revoked
and the permittee will not be allowed further permits for one full year, except
for emergency repairs.
   (F)   Reimbursement of city costs. If a permit is revoked, the permittee
shall also reimburse the city for the city’s reasonable costs, including
restoration costs and the costs of collection and reasonable attorneys’ fees
incurred in connection with the revocation.
(2002 Code, § 5.04) (Ord. 154, Second Series, effective 1-1-1979; Ord. 80,
Seventh Series, effective 4-5-2019)
CONDITIONS AND REGULATIONS
§ 153.45 MAPPING DATA.
   (A)   Information required. Each registrant and permittee shall provide
mapping information required by the city in accordance with Minn. Rules parts
7819.4000 and 7819.4100. Within 90 days following completion of any work
pursuant to a permit, the permittee shall provide the Director accurate maps
and drawings certifying the “as-built” location of all equipment installed,
owned and maintained by the permittee. The maps and drawings shall include the
horizontal and vertical location of all facilities and equipment and shall be
provided consistent with the city’s electronic mapping system, when practical
or as a condition imposed by the Director. Failure to provide maps and drawings
pursuant to this division (A) shall be grounds for revoking the permit holder’s
registration.
   (B)   Service laterals. All permits issued for the installation or repair of
service laterals, other than minor repairs as defined in Minn. Rules part
7560.0150, subp. 2, shall require the permittee’s use of appropriate means of
establishing the horizontal locations of installed service laterals and the
service lateral vertical locations in those cases where the Director reasonably
requires it. The permittees or their subcontractors shall submit to the
Director evidence satisfactory to the director of the installed service lateral
locations. Compliance with this division (B) and with applicable Gopher State
One Call law and state rules governing service laterals installed after 12-31-
2005 shall be a condition of any city approval necessary for:
      (1)   Payments to contractors working on a public improvement project,
including those under M.S. Ch. 429, as it may be amended from time to time; and
      (2)   City approval under development agreements or other subdivision or
site plan approval under M.S. Ch. 462, as it may be amended from time to time.
The Director shall reasonably determine the appropriate method of providing
such information to the city. Failure to provide prompt and accurate
information on the service laterals installed may result in the revocation of
the permit issued for the work or future permits to the offending permittee or
its subcontractors.
(2002 Code, § 5.04) (Ord. 154, Second Series, effective 1-1-1979; Ord. 80,
Seventh Series, effective 4-5-2019)
§ 153.46 LOCATION AND RELOCATION OF FACILITIES.
   (A)   Compliance. Placement, location and relocation of facilities must
comply with the Act, with other applicable law, and with Minn. Rules parts
7819.3100, 7819.5000 and 7819.5100, to the extent the rules do not limit
authority otherwise available to cities.
   (B)   Undergrounding. Unless otherwise agreed in a franchise or other
agreement between the applicable right-of-way user and the city, facilities in
the right-of-way must be located or relocated and maintained underground in
accordance herewith.
   (C)   Corridors.
      (1)   The city may assign a specific area within the right-of-way, or any
particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of facility that
is or, pursuant to current technology, the city expects will someday be located
within the right-of-way. All excavation, obstruction or other permits issued by
the city involving the installation or replacement of facilities shall
designate the proper corridor for the facilities at issue.
      (2)   Any registrant who has facilities in the right-of-way in a position
at variance with the corridors established by the city shall, no later than at
the time of the next reconstruction or excavation of the area where the
facilities are located, move the facilities to the assigned position within the
right-of-way, unless this requirement is waived by the city for good cause
shown, upon consideration of such factors as the remaining economic life of the
facilities, public safety, customer service needs and hardship to the
registrant.
   (D)   Nuisance. One year after the passage of this chapter, any facilities
found in a right-of-way that have not been registered shall be deemed to be a
nuisance. The city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in
equity, including, but not limited to, abating the nuisance or taking
possession of the facilities and restoring the right-of-way to a useable
condition.
   (E)   Limitation of space. To protect the health, safety and welfare of the
public, or when necessary to protect the right-of-way and its current use, the
city shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or
additional facilities within the right-of-way. In making the decisions, the
city shall strive to the extent possible to accommodate all existing and
potential users of the right-of-way, but shall be guided primarily by
considerations of the public interest, the public’s needs for the particular
utility service, the condition of the right-of-way, the time of year with
respect to essential utilities, the protection of existing facilities in the
right-of-way and future city plans for public improvements and development
projects which have been determined to be in the public interest.

§ 153.47 PRE-EXCAVATION FACILITIES LOCATION.
   In addition to complying with the requirements of M.S. §§ 216D.01 through
216D.09 (One Call Excavation Notice System), as it may be amended from time to
time, before the start date of any right-of- way excavation, each registrant
who has facilities or equipment in the area to be excavated shall mark the
horizontal and vertical placement of all facilities. Any registrant whose
facilities are less than 20 inches below a concrete or asphalt surface shall
notify and work closely with the excavation contractor to establish the exact
location of its facilities and the best procedure for excavation.
(2002 Code, § 5.04) (Ord. 154, Second Series, effective 1-1-1979; Ord. 80,
Seventh Series, effective 4-5-2019)
§ 153.48 DAMAGE TO OTHER FACILITIES.
   When the city does work in the right-of-way and finds it necessary to
maintain, support or move a registrant’s facilities to protect it, the city
shall notify the local representative as early as is reasonably possible. The
costs associated therewith will be billed to that registrant and must be paid
within 30 days from the date of billing. Each registrant shall be responsible
for the cost of repairing any facilities in the right-of-way which it or its
facilities damage. Each registrant shall be responsible for the cost of
repairing any damage to the facilities of another registrant caused during the
city’s response to an emergency occasioned by that registrant’s facilities.
(2002 Code, § 5.04) (Ord. 154, Second Series, effective 1-1-1979; Ord. 80,
Seventh Series, effective 4-5-2019)
§ 153.49 RIGHT-OF-WAY VACATION.
   If the city vacates a right-of-way that contains the facilities of a
registrant, the registrant’s rights in the vacated right-of-way are governed by
Minn. Rules part 7819.3200.
(2002 Code, § 5.04) (Ord. 154, Second Series, effective 1-1-1979; Ord. 80,

   By registering with the city, or by accepting a permit under this chapter, a
registrant or permittee agrees to defend and indemnify the city in accordance
with the provisions of Minn. Rules part 7819.1250.
(2002 Code, § 5.04) (Ord. 154, Second Series, effective 1-1-1979; Ord. 80,
Seventh Series, effective 4-5-2019)
§ 153.51 ABANDONED AND UNUSABLE FACILITIES.
   (A)   Discontinued operations. A registrant who has determined to
discontinue all or a portion of its operations in the city must provide
information satisfactory to the city that the registrant’s obligations for its
facilities in the right-of-way under this chapter have been lawfully assumed by
another registrant.
   (B)   Removal. Any registrant who has abandoned facilities in any right-of-
way shall remove it from that right-of-way if required in conjunction with
other right-of-way repair, excavation or construction, unless this requirement
is waived by the city.

§ 154.017 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Request for a variance, conditional use permit or rezoning. A request
for a variance, conditional use permit or rezoning which has been acted upon
may not be requested again until a period of 12 months has passed, unless the
applicant can show to the satisfaction of the City Council that the conditions
which were present when the earlier request was filed, have changed or that the
request is substantially different.
   (B)   Variances.
      (1)   Purpose and scope of application. The City Council may grant
variances from the strict application of the provisions of this chapter and
impose conditions and safeguards in the variances so granted, where practical
difficulties result from carrying out the strict letter of the regulations of
this chapter. PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES, as used in connection with the granting
of a variance, mean that the applicant proposes to use the property in a
reasonable manner not permitted by the zoning provisions of this code; the
plight of the applicant is due to circumstances unique to the property not
created by the applicant; and the variance, if granted, will not alter the
essential character of the locality. Economic considerations alone do not
constitute practical difficulties.
      (2)   Petition. A petition for a variance shall be filed with the city
and shall state the exceptional conditions and the peculiar and practical
difficulties claimed as a basis for a variance. The petition shall also include
the name and address of each affected property owner of directly abutting
property along the side of the property under consideration.
      (3)   Referral to the Board. Before authorization of any variance, the
request shall be referred to the Board of Appeals and Adjustments for study
concerning the effect of the proposed variance upon the comprehensive guide
plan and on the character and development of the neighborhood, and for its
recommendation to the Council in connection with the request. The Board shall
make its recommendation within 30 days after the request is referred to it, and
after that time, the City Council may act without the recommendation. The Board
may recommend the conditions related to the variance regarding the location,
character and other features of the proposed building, structure or use as it
may deem advisable. Any condition recommended must be directly related to, and
must bear a rough proportionality to the impact created by the variance.
      (4)   Action on request.
         (a)   The Board of Appeals and Adjustments may hold a public hearing
on the variance request if it deems it necessary or advisable. The procedures
for the notice and public hearing shall be the same as that described in §
154.020 of this subchapter, except that the public hearing shall be held by the
Board.
         (b)   The Board may recommend to the City Council and the City Council
may grant approval, approval with conditions, or denial of the request. In
considering a request for a variance and whether the applicant established that
there are practical difficulties in complying with provision(s) of this
chapter, the Board and City Council shall consider the following factors:
            1.   Special conditions apply to the structures or land in question
that are particular to the property and do not apply generally to other land or
structures in the district or vicinity in which the land is located;
            2.   The granting of the proposed variance will not be contrary to
the intent of this chapter;
            3.   The special conditions or circumstances do not result from the
actions of the owner/applicant;
            4.   The granting of the variance will not merely serve as a
convenience to the applicant, but is necessary to alleviate practical
difficulties in complying with the zoning provisions of this code; and
            5.   The variance requested is the minimum variance necessary to
alleviate the practical difficulty.
         (c)   The Council may grant the variance and impose certain conditions
and safeguards therein that are directly related to and bear a rough
proportionality to the impact created by the variance. The variance, however,
may not be granted for a use that is otherwise not allowed in a particular
zoning district, that is inconsistent with the comprehensive guide plan, or
that is not in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the zoning
provisions of this chapter.
      (5)   Referral back to the Board. The City Council may refer any variance
petition back to the Board of Appeals and Adjustments for further review and
recommendation.
      (6)   Denial. Variances may be denied by the City Council and the denial
shall constitute a finding and determination that the conditions required for
approval did not exist.
      (7)   Lapse of variance. A variance shall become void one year after it
has been granted unless made use of within the year or a longer period as the
Council may provide.

   (D)   Temporary certificates. A temporary certificate of occupancy may be
issued for a period not to exceed six months. Additionally, one extension of a
temporary certificate of occupancy for a period not to exceed six months may be
authorized. Conditions may be imposed on the issuance of a temporary
certificate of occupancy in order to ensure compliance with this chapter,
including posting financial security acceptable to the city. Issuance of a
temporary certificate of occupancy will not alter the rights or obligations of
the owner, tenant or city with respect to full compliance with the requirements
of this chapter or other provisions of the code of ordinances.
   (E)   Non-conforming uses. A certificate of occupancy shall be required for
all non-conforming uses or buildings. The certificate issued for non-conforming
uses or buildings shall state the manner and extent to which the requirements
of this chapter are not met.
   (F)   Revocation. A certificate of occupancy may be revoked if the building
or use is no longer in compliance with the code of ordinances. The procedure
for revocation shall be the same as that for licenses specified in §§
33.45 through

§ 154.019 CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   In order to give the district use regulations of this chapter the
flexibility necessary to achieve the objectives of the comprehensive guide plan
in certain districts, conditional uses are permitted subject to the granting of
a use permit. Conditional uses include those uses generally not suitable in a
particular zoning district, but which may, under some circumstances, be
suitable. When the circumstances exist, a conditional use permit may be
granted.
      (2)   Conditions may be applied to issuance of a permit and a periodic
review of the permit may be required. The permit shall be issued for a
particular use and not for a particular person or firm. The applicant shall
have the burden of proof that the use is suitable and that the standards set
forth in this section have been met.
   (B)   Petition, public hearing, notice and procedure. Except as otherwise
noted and provided under this section, the petition, public hearing, public
notice and procedural requirements for conditional use permits shall be the
same as those for zoning amendments provided in §
154.020 of this subchapter.
   (C)   Action by the City Council. The City Council may grant a conditional
use permit, as the use permit was applied for or in modified form, if it is
determined that the proposed location of the conditional use is in accord with
the objectives of the comprehensive guide plan and the purposes of the district
in which the site is located and would not be materially injurious to
properties or improvements in the vicinity. The City Council may grant a
conditional use permit only by ordinance of the City Council. A certified copy
of the conditional use permit shall be recorded with the County Recorder and
shall include the legal description of the property included.
   (D)   Standards. The Planning Commission shall recommend a conditional use
permit and the Council may issue conditional use permits if it finds that the
use at the proposed location:
      (1)   Will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety,
or general welfare of the neighborhood or the city;
      (2)   Will be harmonious with the general and applicable specific
objectives of the comprehensive plan and code provisions;
      (3)   Will be designed, constructed, operated and maintained so as to be
compatible or similar in an architectural and landscape appearance with the
existing or intended character of the general vicinity and will not change the
essential character of that area, nor substantially diminish or impair property
values within the neighborhood;
      (4)   Will be served adequately by existing (or those proposed in the
project) essential public facilities and services, including streets, police
and fire protection, drainage, structures, refuse disposal, water and sewer
systems and schools;
      (5)   Will not involve uses, activities, processes, materials, equipment
and conditions of operation that will be hazardous or detrimental to any
persons, property or the general welfare because of excessive production of
traffic, noise, smoke, fumes, glare or odors;
      (6)   Will have vehicular ingress and egress to the property which does
not create traffic congestion or interfere with traffic on surrounding public
streets;
      (7)   Will not result in the destruction, loss or damage of a natural,
scenic or historic feature of major importance; and
      (8)   These standards apply in addition to specific conditions as may be
applied throughout the code.
   (E)   Conditions. In reviewing applications of conditional use permits, the
Planning Commission and the Council may attach whatever reasonable conditions
they deem necessary to mitigate anticipated adverse impacts associated with
these uses, to protect the value of other property within the district, and to
achieve the goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan. In all cases in
which conditional uses are granted, the Council shall require evidence and
guarantees as it may deem necessary as proof that the conditions stipulated in
connection therewith are being and will be complied with.
   (F)   Denial for noncompliance. If the Planning Commission recommends denial
of a conditional use permit or the Council orders the denial, it shall include
in its recommendation or determination findings as to the manner in which the
proposed use does not comply with the standards required by this section.
   (G)   Periodic review; term of permit. A periodic review of the use may be
attached as a condition of approval of a conditional use permit. Unless
otherwise stipulated, the term shall be the life of the use.
   (H)   Lapse of conditional use permit by non-use. Whenever within one year
after granting a conditional use permit, the use as allowed by the permit shall
not have been completed or utilized, then the permit shall become null and void
unless a petition for an extension of time in which to complete or utilize the
use that has been granted by the City Council. The extension shall be requested
in writing and filed with the Zoning Administrator at least 30 days before the
expiration of the original conditional use permit. There shall be no charge for
the filing of the petition. The request for extension shall state facts showing
a good faith attempt to complete or utilize the use permitted in the
conditional use permit. The petition shall be presented to the Planning
Commission for a recommendation and to the City Council for decision.
   (I)   Enforcement and revocation. Failure to comply with any condition set
forth in a conditional use permit, or any other violation of this section,
shall constitute sufficient cause for termination of the conditional use permit
by the City Council following a public hearing. Written notification of the
public hearing shall be mailed at least ten days prior to the hearing to the
current holder of the conditional use permit. The notice should outline the
violation(s) considered by the city to be grounds for revocation and inform the
current holder of the conditional use permit of the opportunity to be heard at
the public hearing. In addition to other remedies provided in this code or at
law, failure to comply with any condition set forth in a conditional use
permit, or any other violation of this section, shall be a misdemeanor.

§ 154.020 ZONING AMENDMENTS.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to prescribe the procedure and
requirements for any change to the zoning classification or zoning boundaries
of a property or any amendment to any provision of this chapter.
   (B)   Initiation. Proceedings for amendment of the chapter shall be
initiated by:
      (1)   A petition of the owner or owners of the property which is to be
rezoned;
      (2)   By action of the Planning Commission; and
      (3)   By action of the City Council.
   (C)   Pre-petition meeting. Prior to the submission of any petition by an
owner or owners of property to amend a zoning classification or zoning
boundary, the applicant shall hold a pre-petition meeting with the City Planner
to introduce himself or herself as a potential petitioner, learn the relevant
requirements of this chapter, discuss the anticipated uses of the subject
property, and to set and determine how to provide notice of a pre-petition
meeting with the City Planner and neighbors that live within 350 feet of the
subject property.
   (D)   Petitions. All petitions for amendments which are initiated by the
owner or owners of the property shall be filed with the City Administrator and,
if the application involves the changing of zoning districts and boundaries
thereof, the application shall be accompanied by an abstractor’s certified
property certificate showing the property owners within 350 feet of the outer
boundaries of the property in question. The petition shall be forwarded to the
Planning Commission by the City Administrator.
   (E)   Public hearing, notice and procedure. The Planning Commission shall
hold at least one public hearing, affording the parties interested the
opportunity to be heard, and shall give not less than ten days’ notice of the
time and place of the hearing, published in the designated legal newspaper for
the city. The notice shall also include the description of the land and the
proposed changes in zoning. At least ten days before the hearing, the City
Administrator shall mail an identical notice to the owners of the property and
to each of the property owners within 350 feet of the outside boundaries of the
land proposed to be rezoned. Failure to give mailed notice to individual
property owners or defects in the notice shall not invalidate the proceeding
provided a bona fide attempt to comply with this requirement has been made. The
City Council may waive the above mailed notice requirement in connection with a
citywide zoning or amendment to the text of this chapter initiated by the
Planning Commission or the City Council.
   (F)   Referral to Planning Commission. The City Council shall not rezone any
land or area in any zoning district or make any other proposed amendment to
this chapter without first having referred it to the Planning Commission for
its consideration and recommendation.
   (G)   Maps or descriptions included. Petitions for rezoning shall include a
detailed map and legal description clearly indicating the land or area to be
rezoned.
   (H)   Council action; time limits. If the Planning Commission fails to make
a report within 30 days after the close of the hearing, the City Council may
act without the recommendation. The Council may grant the petition, in whole or
in part, or it may continue the petition, from time to time, for further
investigation and hearing. The Council may also request further information and
report from the Planning Commission. The City Council may adopt a zoning
regulation, amend a zoning regulation herein, or change the zoning
classification or zoning boundaries of a property by ordinance, except any
change to all or part of an existing classification of a zoning district from
residential to either commercial or industrial requires an ordinance with a
two-thirds majority vote of all members of the Council.

§ 154.060 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION AND POLICY.
   (A)   Statutory authorization. This subchapter is adopted pursuant to the
authorization and policies contained in M.S. Ch. 105, as it may be amended from
time to time, Minn. Rules parts 6120.2500 through 6120.3900 and planning and
zoning enabling legislation in M.S. Ch. 462, as it may be amended from time to
time.
   (B)   Policy. The uncontrolled use of shorelands in the city affects the
public health, safety and general welfare not only by contributing to pollution
of public waters, but also by impairing the local tax base. Therefore, it is in
the best interests of the public health, safety and welfare to provide for the
wise subdivision, use and development of shorelands of public waters. The
legislature of the state has delegated responsibility to local governments of
the state to regulate the subdivision, use and development of the shorelands of
public waters and thus preserve and enhance the quality of surface waters,
conserve the economic and natural environmental values of shorelands, and
provide for the wise use of waters and related land resources. This
responsibility is hereby recognized by the city.

§ 154.069 ZONING AND WATER SUPPLY, SANITARY PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Design criteria for structures.
      (1)   High water elevations. Structures must be placed in accordance with
any floodplain regulations applicable to the site. Where these controls do not
exist, the elevation to which the lowest floor, including basement, is placed
or flood-proofed must be determined as follows:
         (a)   For lakes, by placing the lowest floor at a level at least three
feet above the highest known water level, or three feet above the ordinary high
water level, whichever is higher;
         (b)   For rivers and streams, by placing the lowest floor at least
three feet above the flood of record, if data are available. If data are not
available, by placing the lowest floor at least three feet above the ordinary
high water level or by conducting a technical evaluation to determine effects
of proposed construction upon flood stages and flood flows and to establish a
flood protection elevation. Under all three approaches, technical evaluations
must be done by a qualified engineer or hydrologist consistent with Minn. Rules
parts 6120.5000 to 6120.6200 governing the management of floodplain areas. If
more than one approach is used, the highest flood protection elevation
determined must be used for placing structures and other facilities; and
         (c)   Water-oriented accessory structures may have the lowest floor
placed lower than the elevation determined in this item, if the structure is
constructed of flood-resistent materials to the elevation, electrical and
mechanical equipment is placed above the elevation and, if long duration
flooding is anticipated, the structure is built to withstand ice action and
wind-driven waves and debris.
      (2)   Water-oriented accessory structures. Each lot may have one water-
oriented accessory structure not meeting the normal structure setback in §
154.068(G) of this chapter if this water-oriented accessory structure complies
with the following provisions.
         (a)   The structure or facility must not exceed ten feet in height,
exclusive of safety rails, and cannot occupy an area greater than 250 square
feet. Detached decks must not exceed eight feet above grade at any point.
         (b)   The setback of the structure or facility from the ordinary high
water level must be at least ten feet.
         (c)   The structure or facility must be treated to reduce visibility
as viewed from public waters and adjacent shorelands by vegetation, topography,
increased setbacks or color, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions.
         (d)   The roof may be used as a deck with safety rails, but must not
be enclosed or used as a storage area.
         (e)   The structure or facility must not be designed or used for human
habitation and must not contain water supply or sewage treatment facilities.
         (f)   As an alternative for general development and recreational
development waterbodies, water-oriented accessory structures used solely for
watercraft storage, and including storage of related boating and water-oriented
sporting equipment, may occupy an area up to 400 square feet; provided, the
maximum width of the structure is 20 feet as measured parallel to the
configuration of the shoreline.
      (3)   Stairways, lifts and landings. Stairways and lifts are the
preferred alternative to major topographic alterations for achieving access up
and down bluffs and steep slopes to shore areas. Stairways and lifts must meet
the following design requirements.
         (a)   Stairways and lifts must not exceed four feet in width on
residential lots. Wider stairways may be used for commercial properties, public
open space recreational properties and planned unit developments.
         (b)   Landings for stairways and lifts on residential lots must not
exceed 32 square feet in area. Landings larger than 32 square feet may be used
for commercial properties, public open space recreational properties and
planned unit developments.
         (c)   Canopies or roofs are not allowed on stairways, lifts or
landings.
         (d)   Stairways, lifts and landing may be either constructed above the
ground on posts or pilings or placed into the ground; provided, they are
designed and built in a manner that ensures control of soil erosion.
         (e)   Stairways, lifts and landings must be located in the most
visually inconspicuous portions of lots, as viewed from the surface of the
public water assuming summer, leaf-on conditions, whenever practical.
         (f)   Facilities such as ramps, lifts or mobility paths for
physically-handicapped persons are also allowed for achieving access to shore
areas; provided that, the dimensional and performance standards of divisions
(A)(3)(a) through (A)(3)(f) above are complied in addition to the requirements
of Minn. Rules Ch. 1340.
      (4)   Significant historic sites. No structure may be placed in a
significant historic site in a manner that affects the values of the site
unless adequate information about the site has been removed and documented in a
public repository.
      (5)   Steep slopes.

§ 154.070 SHORELAND ALTERATIONS.
   (A)   Purpose. Alterations of vegetation and topography will be regulated to
prevent erosion into public waters, fix nutrients, preserve shoreland
aesthetics, preserve historic values, prevent bank slumping and protect fish
and wildlife habitat.
   (B)   Vegetation alterations.
      (1)   Vegetation alteration necessary for the construction of structures
and sewage treatment systems are exempt from the vegetation alteration
standards that follow.
      (2)   Removal or alteration of vegetation, except for agriculture and
forest management uses as regulated in divisions (B)(6) and (B)(7) below,
respectively, is allowed subject to the following standards.
         (a)   Intensive vegetation clearing within the shore and bluff impact
zones and on steep slopes is not allowed. Intensive vegetation clearing for
forest land conversion to another use outside of these areas is allowable as a
conditional use if an erosion control and sedimentation plan is developed and
approved by the soil and water conservation district in which the property is
located.
         (b)   In shore and bluff impact zones and on steep slopes, limited
clearing of trees and shrubs and cutting, pruning and trimming of trees is
allowed to provide a view to the water from the principal dwelling site and to
accommodate the placement of stairways and landings, picnic areas, access
paths, livestock watering areas, beach and watercraft access areas and
permitted water-oriented accessory structures or facilities; provided that:
            1.   The screening of structures, vehicles or other facilities as
viewed from the water, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions, is not
substantially reduced;
            2.   Along rivers, existing shading of water surfaces is preserved;
and
            3.   The above provisions are not applicable to the removal of
trees, limbs or branches that are dead, diseased or pose safety hazards.
   (C)   Topographic alterations/grading and filling.
      (1)   Grading and filling and excavations necessary for the construction
of structures, sewage treatment systems and driveways under validly issued
construction permits for these facilities do not require the issuance of a
separate grading and filling permit. However, the grading and filling standards
in this section must be incorporated into the issuance of permits for
construction of structures, sewage treatment systems and driveways.
      (2)   Notwithstanding division (C)(1) above, a grading and filling permit
will be required for:
         (a)   The movement of more than ten cubic yards of material on steep
slopes or within shore or bluff impact zones; and
         (b)   The movement of more than 50 cubic yards of material outside of
steep slopes and shore and bluff impact zones.
      (3)   The following considerations and conditions must be adhered to
during the issuance of construction permits, grading and filling permits,
conditional use permits, variances and subdivision approvals.
         (a)   Grading or filling in any Type 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 wetland
must be evaluated to determine how extensively the proposed activity would
affect the following functional qualities of the wetland:
            1.   Sediment and pollutant trapping and retention;
            2.   Storage of surface runoff to prevent or reduce flood damage;
            3.   Fish and wildlife habitat;
            4.   Recreational use;
            5.   Shoreline or bank stabilization; and
            6.   Noteworthiness, including special qualities such as historic
significance, critical habitat for endangered plants and animals or others.
         (b)   This evaluation must also include a determination of whether the
wetland alteration being proposed requires permits, reviews or approvals by
other local, state or federal agencies such as a watershed district, the
state’s Department of Natural Resources or the United States Army Corps of
Engineers. The applicant will be so advised.
         (c)   Alterations must be designed and conducted in a manner that
ensures only the smallest amount of bare ground is exposed for the shortest
time possible.
         (d)   Mulches or similar materials must be used, where necessary, for
temporary bare soil coverage, and a permanent vegetation cover must be
established as soon as possible.
         (e)   Methods to minimize soil erosion and to trap sediments before
they reach any surface water feature must be used.
         (f)   Altered areas must be stabilized to acceptable erosion control
standards consistent with the field office technical guides of the local soil
and water conservation districts and the United States Soil Conservation
Service.
         (g)   Fill or excavated material must not be placed in a manner that
creates an unstable slope.
         (h)   Plans to place fill or excavated material on steep slopes must
be reviewed by qualified professionals for continued slope stability and must
not create finished slopes of 30% or greater.
         (i)   Fill or excavated material must not be placed in bluff impact
zones.
         (j)   Any alterations below the ordinary high water level must first
be authorized by the Commissioner under M.S. § 105.42, as it may be amended
from time to time.
         (k)   Alterations of topography must only be allowed if they are
accessory to permitted or conditional uses and do not adversely affect adjacent
or nearby properties.
         (l)   Placement of natural rock riprap, including associated grading
of the shoreline and placement of a filter blanket, is permitted if the
finished slope does not exceed three feet horizontal to one foot vertical, the
landward extent of the riprap is within ten feet of the ordinary high water
level, and the height of the riprap above the ordinary high water level does
not exceed three feet, unless approved by the City Engineer.
      (4)   Excavations where the intended purpose is connection to a public
water, such as boat slips, canals, lagoons and harbors, must be controlled by
local shoreland controls. Permission for excavations may be given only after
the Commissioner has approved the proposed connection to public waters.
      (5)   Fill below OHW and construction of channels must be in accordance
with M.S. § 103G.245, as it may be amended from time to time.
   (D)   Storm water management. The following general and specific standards
shall apply.
      (1)   When possible, existing natural drainage ways, wetlands and
vegetated soil surfaces must be used to convey, store, filter and retain
stormwater runoff before discharge to public waters.
      (2)   Development must be planned and conducted in a manner that will
minimize the extent of disturbed areas, runoff velocities, erosion potential
and reduce and delay runoff volumes. Disturbed areas must be stabilized and
protected as soon as possible and facilities or methods used to retain sediment
on the site.
      (3)   When development density, topographic features and solid and
vegetation conditions are not sufficient to adequately handle stormwater runoff
using natural features and vegetation, various types of constructed facilities
such as diversions, settling basins, skimming devices, waterways and ponds may
be used. Consideration should be given to designs using surface drainage,
vegetation and infiltration rather than buried pipes and human-made materials
and facilities.
   (E)   Specific standards.
      (1)   When constructed facilities are used for storm water management,
documentation must be provided by a qualified individual that they are designed
and installed consistent with acceptable engineering practices.
      (2)   New constructed stormwater outfalls to public waters should provide
for filtering or settling of suspended solids and skimming of surface debris
before discharge whenever possible.
   (F)   Agriculture use standards.
      (1)   General cultivation, farming, grazing, nurseries, horticulture,
truck farming, sod farming and wild crop harvesting are permitted uses if steep
slopes and shore and bluff impact zones are maintained in permanent vegetation
or operated under an approved conservation plan (resource management systems)
consistent with the field office technical guides of the local soil and water
conservation districts or the United States Soil Conservation Service.
      (2)   Application of fertilizer, herbicides, pesticides, animal wastes or
other chemicals within shorelands must be done in a way as to minimize impact
on the shore impact zone or public water by proper application or use of earth
or vegetation.
      (3)   Animal feedlots shall not be permitted in the shoreland of public
waters.
   (G)   Forest management standards. The harvesting of timber and associated
reforestation or conversion of forested use to a non-forested use must be
conducted consistent with the following standards.
      (1)   Timber harvesting and associated reforestation must be conducted
consistent with the provisions of the state’s Non-Point Source Pollution
Assessment Forestry and the provisions of Water Quality in Forest Management,
Best Management Practices in Minnesota.
      (2)   If allowed by local governments, forest land conversion to another
use requires issuance of a conditional use permit and adherence to the
following standards.
         (a)   Shore and bluff impact zones must not be intensively cleared of
vegetation.
         (b)   An erosion and sediment control plan is developed and approved
by the local soil and water conservation district before issuance of a
conditional use permit for the conversion.
      (3)   Use of fertilizer, pesticides or animal wastes within shorelands
must be done in a way as to minimize impact on the shore impact zone or public
water by proper application or use of earth or vegetation.
   (H)   Extractive use standards.
      (1)   Site development and restoration plan. An extractive use site
development and restoration plan must be developed, approved and followed over
the course of operation of the site. The plan must address dust, noise,
possible pollutant discharges, hours and duration of operation and anticipated
vegetation and topographic alterations. It must also identify actions to be
taken during operation to mitigate adverse environmental impacts, particularly
erosion and must clearly explain how the site will be rehabilitated after
extractive activities end.
      (2)   Setbacks for processing machinery. Processing machinery must be
located consistent with setback standards for structures from ordinary high
water levels of public waters and from bluffs.
      (3)   Placement and design of roads, driveways and parking areas.
         (a)   Public and private roads and parking areas must be designed to
take advantage of natural vegetation and topography to achieve maximum
screening from view from public waters. Documentation must be provided by a
qualified individual that all roads and parking areas are designed and
constructed to minimize and control erosion to public waters consistent with
the field office technical guides of the local soil and water conservation
district, or other applicable technical materials.
         (b)   Roads, driveways and parking areas must meet structure setbacks
and must not be placed within bluff and shore impact zones, when other
reasonable and feasible placement alternatives exist. If no alternatives exist,
they may be placed within these areas, and must be designed to minimize adverse
impacts.
         (c)   Public and private watercraft access ramps, approach roads and
access-related parking areas may be placed within shore impact zones provided
the vegetative screening and erosion control conditions of this division (H)
are met. For private facilities, the grading and filling provisions of this
division (H) must be met.

§ 154.073 NON-CONFORMITIES.
   All legally established non-conformities as of the effective date of this
subchapter may continue, but they will be managed according to applicable state
statutes and other regulations of this chapter for the subject of alterations
and additions, repair after damage, discontinuance of use and intensification
of use; except that, the following standards will also apply in shoreland
areas.
   (A)   Construction on non-conforming lots of record.
      (1)    Lots of record in the office of the County Recorder on the date of
enactment of local shoreland controls that do not meet the requirements of §
154.068(G) of this chapter may be allowed as buildings sites without variances
from lot size requirements; provided, the use is permitted in the zoning
district, the lot has been in separate ownership from abutting lands at all
times since it became substandard, was created compliant with official controls
in effect at the time and sewage treatment and setback requirements of this
subchapter are met.
      (2)   A variance from setback requirements must be obtained before any
use, sewage treatment system or building permit is issued for a lot. In
evaluating the variance, the Board of Adjustment shall consider sewage
treatment and water supply capabilities or constraints of the lot and shall
deny the variance if adequate facilities cannot be provided.
      (3)   If, in a group of two or more contiguous lots under the same
ownership, any individual lot does not meet the requirements of §
154.068(G) of this chapter, the lot must not be considered as a separate parcel
of land for the purposes of sale or development. The lot must be combined with
the one or more contiguous lots so they equal one or more parcels of land, each
meeting the requirements of §
154.068(G) of this chapter as much as possible.

§ 154.074 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS (PUDS).
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of the “PUD” Planned Unit Development District is
to permit flexibility in the use and design of structures and land in
situations where modification of specific provisions of this section would not
be contrary to its intent and purpose or significantly be inconsistent with the
planning on which it is based, and will not be harmful to the neighborhood in
which the district occurs. The PUD process may allow:
      (1)   Variety. Within a comprehensive site design concept a mixture of
land uses, housing types, and densities.
      (2)   Sensitivity. By departing from the strict application of required
performance standards associated with traditional zoning, planned unit
development can maximize the development potential of land while remaining
sensitive to its unique and valuable natural and scenic characteristics.
      (3)   Efficiency. The consolidation of areas for recreation and
reductions in street lengths and other utility related expenses.
      (4)   District integration. The combination of uses which are allowed in
separate zoning districts such as:
         (a)   Mixed residential allows both densities and unit types to be
varied within the PUD.
         (b)   Mixed commercial, residential, or institutional land use with
the integration of compatible land uses within the PUD.
   (B)   Types of PUDs permissible. Planned unit developments (PUDs) are
allowed for new projects on undeveloped land, redevelopment of previously built
sites or conversions of existing buildings and land in land use districts
classified as R-4 Multiple-Residence, only.
   (C)   Processing of PUDs. Planned unit developments must be processed as a
conditional use and comply with the provisions of this section in addition to
those standards outlined elsewhere in the zoning and subdivision regulations.
When there is a conflict in requirements, the more stringent of the
requirements shall be applied. An expansion to an existing commercial PUD
involving six or less new dwelling units or sites since the date this section
was adopted is permissible as a permitted use provided the total project
density does not exceed the allowable densities calculated in the project
density evaluation procedures. Approval cannot occur until all applicable
environmental reviews are complete.
   (D)   Application for a PUD. The applicant for a PUD must submit the
following documents prior to final action being taken on the application
request:
      (1)   A site plan and/or plat for the project showing locations of
property boundaries, surface water features, existing and proposed structures
and other facilities, land alterations, sewage treatment and water supply
systems (where public systems will not be provided) and topographic contours at
ten-foot intervals or less. When a PUD is a combined commercial and residential
development, the site plan and/or plat must indicate and distinguish which
buildings and portions of the project are residential, commercial or a
combination of the two;
      (2)   A property owner’s association agreement (for residential PUDs)
with mandatory membership, and all in accordance with the requirements of this
section;
      (3)   Deed restrictions, covenants, permanent easements or other
instruments that:
         (a)   Properly address future vegetative and topographic alterations,
construction of additional buildings, beaching of watercraft and construction
of commercial buildings in residential PUDs; and
         (b)   Ensure the long-term preservation and maintenance of open space
in accordance with the criteria and analysis specified in this section.
      (4)   When necessary, a master plan/drawing describing the project and
the floor plan for all commercial structures to be occupied; and
      (5)   Those additional documents as requested by the city that are
necessary to explain how the PUD will be designed and will function.
   (E)   Maintenance and design criteria. Deed restrictions, covenants,
permanent easements, public dedication and acceptance or other equally
effective and permanent means must be provided to ensure long-term preservation
and maintenance of open space. The instruments must include all of the
following protections:
      (1)   Vegetation and topographic alterations other than routine
maintenance prohibited;
      (2)   Construction of additional buildings or storage of vehicles and
other materials prohibited; and
      (3)   Uncontrolled beaching of watercraft prohibited.
   (F)   Open space requirements. Planned unit developments outside the
shoreland management area must contain open space meeting all the following
criteria:
      (1)   At least 40% of the total project area must be preserved as open
space;
      (2)   Dwelling units or sites, road rights-of-way or land covered by road
surfaces, parking areas or structures, except water-oriented accessory
structures or facilities, are developed areas and shall not be included in the
computation of minimum open space;
      (3)   Open space must include areas with physical characteristics
unsuitable for development in their natural state, and areas containing
significant historic sites or unplatted cemeteries;
      (4)   Open space may include outdoor recreational facilities for use by
owners of dwelling units or sites, by guests staying in commercial dwelling
units or sites and by the general public;
      (5)   Open space may include subsurface sewage treatment systems if the
use of the space is restricted to avoid adverse impacts on the systems;
      (6)   Open space must not include commercial facilities or uses, but may
contain water-oriented accessory structures or facilities; and
      (7)   The appearance of open space areas, including topography,
vegetation and allowable uses, must be preserved by use of restrictive deed
covenants, permanent easements, public dedication and acceptance or other
effective and permanent means.
   (G)   Density determination for PUDs within the shoreland management area.
Proposed new or expansions to existing planned unit developments must be
evaluated using the following procedures:
      (1)   Step 1: identify density analysis tiers. Divide the project parcel
into tiers by drawing one or more lines parallel to the ordinary high water
level at the following intervals, proceeding landward:
 
Waterbody classification                    No sewer (ft) Sewer (ft)
General development lakes — first tier    200           200
General development lakes — all other tier267           200
Recreational development lakes              267           267
Natural environment lakes                   400           320
All rivers                                  300           300
 
      (2)   Step 2: calculate suitable area for development. Calculate the
suitable area within each tier by excluding all road rights-of-way or
easements, wetlands, bluffs, or land below the ordinary high water level of
public waters.
      (3)   Step 3: determine base density.
         (a)   For residential PUDs, divide the suitable area within each tier
by the minimum single residential lot area for lakes to determine the allowable
number of dwelling units, or base density, for each tier. For rivers, if a
minimum lot area is not specified, divide the tier width or river frontage by
the minimum single residential lot width.
         (b)   For commercial PUDs:
            1.   Determine the average area for each dwelling unit or dwelling
site within each tier. Include both existing and proposed dwelling units and
sites in the calculation.
               a.   For dwelling units, determine the average inside living
floor area of dwelling units in each tier. Do not include decks, patios,
garages, or porches and basements, unless they are habitable space.
               b.   For dwelling sites (campgrounds), determine the area of
each dwelling site as follows: For manufactured homes, use the area of the
manufactured home, if known, otherwise use 1,000 square feet; for recreational
vehicles, campers or tents, use 400 square feet.
            2.   Select the appropriate floor area/dwelling site area ratio
from the following table for the floor area or dwelling site area:

power lines and transformers, that service the facility may be owned by a
separate entity, but are also included as part of the AGGREGATED PROJECT.
   COMMERCIAL WECS. A WECS of equal to or greater than 35 kW in total name
plate generating capacity.
   FALL ZONE. The area, defined as the furthest distance from the tower base,
in which a guyed tower will collapse in the event of a structural failure. This
area is less than the total height of the structure.
   FEEDER LINE. Any power line that carries electrical power from one or more
wind turbines or individual transformers associated with individual wind
turbines to the point of interconnection with the electric power grid, in the
case of interconnection with the high voltage transmission systems, the point
of interconnection shall be the substation serving the WECS.
   METEOROLOGICAL TOWER. Those towers which are erected primarily to measure
wind speed and directions, plus other data relevant to siting WECS.
METEOROLOGICAL TOWERS do not include towers and equipment used by airports, the
state’s Department of Transportation or other similar applications to monitor
weather conditions.
   NON-COMMERCIAL WECS. A WECS of less than 35 kW in total name plate
generating capacity.
   PROPERTY LINE. The boundary line of the area over which the entity applying
for a WECS permit has legal control for the purposes of installation of a WECS.
This control may be attained through fee title ownership, easement or other
appropriate contractual relationship between the project developer and
landowner.
   PUBLIC CONSERVATION LANDS. Land owned in fee title by state or federal
agencies and managed specifically for conservation purposes, including, but not
limited to, state wildlife management areas, state parks, state scientific and
natural areas, federal wildlife refuges and waterfowl production areas. For the
purposes of this subchapter, PUBLIC CONSERVATION LANDS will also include lands
owned in fee title by non-profit conservation organizations. PUBLIC
CONSERVATION LANDS do not include private lands upon which conservation
easements have been sold to public agencies or non-profit conservation
organizations.
   ROTOR DIAMETER. The diameter of the circle described by the moving rotor
blades.
   SUBSTATIONS. Any electrical facility designed to convert electricity
produced by wind turbines to a voltage greater than 35,000 volts (35 kV) for
interconnection with high voltage transmission lines shall be located outside
of the road right-of-way.
   TOTAL HEIGHT. The highest point, above ground level, reached by a rotor tip
or any other part of the WECS.
   TOWER. Towers include vertical structures that support the electrical
generator, rotor blades or meteorological equipment.
   TOWER HEIGHT. The total height of the WECS exclusive of the rotor blades.
   TRANSMISSION LINE. Those electrical power lines that carry voltages of at
least 40,000 volts (40 kV) and are primarily used to carry electric energy over
medium to long distances rather than directly interconnecting and supplying
electric energy to retail customers.
   WECS or WIND ENERGY CONVERSION SYSTEM. An electrical generating facility
comprised of one or more wind turbines and accessory facilities, including, but
not limited to: power lines, transformers, substations and meteorological
towers, that operate by converting the kinetic energy of wind into electrical
energy. The energy may be used on-site or distributed into the electrical grid.
   WIND TURBINE. A wind turbine is any piece of electrical generating equipment
that converts the kinetic energy of blowing wind into electrical energy through
the use of airfoils or similar devices to capture the wind.

§ 154.151 FINDINGS.
   The city finds the following:
   (A)   Wireless telecommunication systems provide a valuable service to the
public. However, telecommunications facilities and systems are not a public
utility, nor part of the public infrastructure system;
   (B)   To promote and preserve the public health, safety, welfare and
aesthetics of the community, the location, design, construction and
modification of telecommunication facilities and systems must be regulated;
   (C)   To minimize the visual impact of telecommunication facilities:
      (1)   Installation of facilities on existing support structures is
favored over installation of new, freestanding telecommunication towers; and
      (2)   New telecommunication towers must be designed to accommodate more
than one telecommunication provider and must incorporate stealth design
techniques.
   (D)   To minimize safety hazards and visual impacts, and to ensure continued
and adequate space for public utilities, public right-of-way should be
minimally used for telecommunication facilities.

Series, effective 4-5-2019)
§ 154.152 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
References hereafter to “sections” are, unless otherwise specified, references
to sections in this chapter. Defined terms remain defined terms, whether or not
capitalized.
   ACCESSORY EQUIPMENT. Wires, cables, generators or other equipment or
apparatus associated with an antenna and necessary for telecommunication
transmission.
   ANTENNA. Any device used for the transmission or reception of wireless radio
television, or electromagnetic waves for cellular, internet service, personal
communication service, enhanced specialized mobilized radio service or
television purposes.

(2002 Code, § 7.36) (Ord. 25, Fifth Series, passed 4-6-1998; Ord. 81, Seventh
Series, effective 4-5-2019)
§ 154.155 GENERAL CONDITIONS AND REGULATIONS.
   All telecommunication facilities, administratively or conditionally
permitted, are subject to the following general regulations.
   (A)   Service provider. A telecommunications service provider must be
identified for the proposed telecommunication facility and must occupy the
facility within 12 months of approval.
   (B)   Historic places. No telecommunications facility may be located within
400 feet of the boundary of any property that contains a facility or structure
listed on the national register of historic places.
   (C)   Location. Facilities must be located in an area that will meet the
applicant’s reasonable coverage and capacity needs. However, the city may
require that a different location be used if it would result in less public
visibility, is available and would continue to meet the applicant’s reasonable
capacity and coverage needs.
   (D)   Collocation. New towers must be designed to accommodate more than one
telecommunication provider at more than one height within the tower, unless it
is physically impossible or impractical to do so at the tower’s proposed
location. In addition, the applicant, tower owner, landlord and their
successors must agree in writing to:
      (1)   Meet reasonable terms and conditions for shared use; and
      (2)   Submit a dispute over the potential terms and conditions to binding
arbitration.
   (E)   Stealth design. Facilities must use as many stealth design techniques
as reasonably possible. Economic considerations alone are not justification for
failing to provide stealth design techniques.
   (F)   Construction. Telecommunications facilities must be in compliance with
all building and electrical code requirements. A tower must be designed and
certified by an engineer to be structurally sound and in conformance with the
Building Code. Structural design, mounting and installation of the
telecommunications facilities must be in compliance with the manufacturer’s
specifications.
   (G)   Landowner authorization. When applicable, the applicant must provide
written authorization from the property owner. The property owner must sign the
approval document provided by the city agreeing to the permit conditions,
agreeing to remove the telecommunication facilities when they are unused,
obsolete or become hazardous, and agreeing to the city’s right to assess
removal costs as set forth below.
   (H)   Removal. Obsolete telecommunications facilities must be removed within
90 days after cessation of their use at the site, unless an exemption is
granted by the City Council. Unused telecommunications facilities and all
related equipment must be removed within one year after cessation of operation
at the site, unless an exemption is granted by the City Council.
Telecommunications facilities and related equipment that have become hazardous
must be removed or made not hazardous within 30 days after written notice to
the current owner and to any separate landowner, unless an exemption is granted
by the City Council. Notice may be made to the address listed in the
application, unless another one has subsequently been provided, and to the
taxpayer of the property listed in the county tax records. Telecommunications
facilities and all related equipment that are not removed within this time
limit are declared to be public nuisances and may be removed by the city. The
city may assess its costs of removal against the property.

§ 154.156 SPECIFIC CONDITIONS AND REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Facilities located within public right-of-way. In addition to the
regulations outlined in §
154.155 of this chapter, telecommunication facilities located within the public
right-of-way are subject to the following general regulations.
      (1)   Facilities are subject to the requirements of
Ch. 153 of this code of ordinances. To the extent that the provisions of
Ch. 153 of this code of ordinances are more restrictive than this chapter, the
provisions of
Ch. 153 of this code of ordinances govern.
      (2)   Facilities may not impact the public health, safety or welfare,
interfere with safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the right-of-way,
or otherwise negatively impact the right-of-way or its users. In determining
compliance with this standard, the city many consider one or more of the
following factors:
         (a)   The extent to which right-of-way space is available for the
proposed facility, including accessory equipment;
         (b)   The potential demand for the particular space in the right-of-
way;
         (c)   The availability of other locations in the right-of-way that
would have less public impact;
         (d)   The extent to which the facility placement minimizes impacts on
adjacent property; and
         (e)   The applicability of ordinances or other regulations that may
affect the location of the facility or accessory equipment.
      (3)   Facilities must be removed when required by the road authority.
   (B)   Facilities located outside of public right-of-way. In addition to the
regulations outlined in §
154.155 of this chapter, all telecommunication facilities located outside the
public right-of-way are subject to the following specific regulations.
      (1)   Location. Telecommunication facilities may be located within any
zoning district. However, on properties zoned R-1 or R-2 Residential,
facilities may only be located on public or institutional property.
      (2)   Height.
         (a)   Maximum tower height, excluding lightning rods, is restricted
based on the land use designation of property on which the tower is located:
 
Land Use Designation Single-User Tower Multiple-User Tower
Business districts   75 feet           90 feet
Industrial districts 150 feet          150 feet
R-3, R-4 and R-5     75 feet           90 feet
R-A, R-1 and R-2     60 feet           90 feet
All other zones      60 feet           90 feet
 
         (b)   The City Council may increase height if the applicant can
demonstrate that the increase would not have a significant impact on
surrounding properties because of things like proximity, topography or
screening by trees or buildings. The Council may likewise waive height
restrictions for towers wholly or partially for essential public services, such
as public safety.
      (3)   Setbacks. Towers located adjacent to low or medium-density
residential properties must meet the minimum setback requirements established
for principal structures within the associated residential zoning district, but
only from the property line abutting the residential district. The City Council
may waive the setback requirement if necessary to implement stealth design
techniques. Accessory equipment must meet minimum setback requirements
established for accessory structures within the zoning district.
      (4)   Horizontal projection. Antennas may not project out from an antenna
support structure or tower, unless it is physically impossible to locate the
antenna with the structure or tower, in which case they may not project out
more than three feet.
      (5)   Vertical projection. Antennas mounted on an antenna support
structure may not extend more than 15 feet above the structure to which they
are attached. Wall or facade-mounted antennas may not extend above the cornice
line and must be constructed of a material or color that matches the exterior
of the building.
      (6)   Accessory equipment.
         (a)   Accessory equipment or buildings must be architecturally
designed to blend in with the surrounding natural or built environment or must
be screened from view by suitable vegetation, except where a design of non-
vegetative screening better reflects and complements the character of the
surrounding neighborhood.
         (b)   No more than one accessory building is permitted for each tower.
      (7)   Color. Antennas and towers must be painted a non-contrasting color
consistent with the surrounding area such as blue, gray, brown or silver, or
have a galvanized finish to reduce visual impact. Metal towers must be
constructed of, or treated with, corrosion-resistant material.
      (8)   Lighting. Telecommunications facilities may not be artificially
illuminated unless required by law or by a governmental agency to protect the
public’s health and safety or unless necessary to facilitate service to ground-
mounted equipment.
   (C)   Facilities located within public right-of-way. In addition to the
regulations outlined in §
154.155 of this chapter, all telecommunication facilities located within the
public right-of-way are subject to the following specific regulations.
      (1)   Location.
         (a)   Within residential zoning districts, facilities are only
permitted within the rights-of-way of collector or arterial streets as
designated by the City Engineer.
         (b)   Facilities are not permitted adjacent to residentially zoned
property unless an applicant demonstrates, by providing a study prepared by a
radio or electrical engineer, that the proposed location is necessary to
reasonably meet the coverage and capacity needs of its system and no other
location is feasible in a non-residential area.
      (2)   Height.
         (a)   Maximum height, including attachments other than lightning rods,
is restricted based on the land use designation of property adjacent to the
proposed facility:
 
Adjacent Land Use Designation  Maximum Height
All residential, including R-A 60 feet
Industrial                     75 feet
Office, commercial, business   60 feet
All other zones                60 feet
 
         (b)   The Council may waive height restrictions for facilities wholly
or partially for essential public services, such as public safety.
      (3)   Width. The support structure or tower, including ancillary
equipment or supports such as guy wires or secondary stabilizers, cannot exceed
the width of the closest public utility pole by more than 50%, but in no case
may it exceed 18 inches in diameter.
      (4)   Horizontal projection. Antennas may not project out from a support
structure or tower, unless it is physically impossible to locate the antenna
with the structure or tower, in which case they may not project out more than
two feet.
      (5)   Vertical projection. Antennas mounted on an antenna support
structure may not extend more than ten feet above the structure to which they
are attached.
      (6)   Facility separation. Telecommunication facilities must be separated
by at least 330 feet.
      (7)   Ground-mounted accessory equipment.
         (a)   Equipment will be allowed only if it will not adversely impact
public health, safety or welfare of the community. In determining compliance
with this standard, the city many consider whether the equipment will disrupt
vehicle traffic or pedestrian circulation, and/or whether the equipment
location and screening minimizes impact on adjacent properties.
         (b)   Equipment must not exceed the following size limits:
 
Adjacent Land Use Designation Maximum Height Maximum Volume
Non-residential               5 feet         81 cubic feet
Residential and R-A           3 feet         28 cubic feet
 
         (c)   Equipment must meet the follow setbacks requirements:
 
                                              Minimum Setback
Existing or planned edge of roadway pavement  10 feet
Existing or planned edge of sidewalk or trail 3 feet
Nearest intersection right-of-way line        50 feet
Nearest principal residential structure       50 feet
 
         (d)   Equipment must be screened by vegetative or other screening
compatible with the surrounding area, as required by the city.
      (8)   Color. The support structure or tower must match the materials and
colors of the closest public utility structures located within the right-of-
way, or as required by the city.
      (9)   Lighting. Telecommunications facilities may not be artificially
illuminated unless required by law or by a governmental agency to protect the
public’s health and safety or unless necessary to facilitate service to ground-
mounted equipment.

duration and are those signs that are not affixed to a permanent structure and
are removed immediately after the event it is advertising, such as a grand
opening, sale, lease or real estate. Includes, but not limited to, banner
signs, hanging metal signs freestanding changeable text signs, signs affixed to
a vehicle or trailer or any other similar sign as determined by the Zoning
Administrator.
      (2)   Permit required. It is unlawful for any person to place, erect,
construct or locate a temporary sign within the city without first obtaining an
annual permit for the sign. Failure to obtain a temporary sign permit prior to
sign placement shall result in a double permit fee. Permit fee shall be set by
the City Council and will be reviewed annually.
      (3)   Guidelines.
         (a)   There shall be up to seven sign placements allowed per legal
parcel within one calendar year.
         (b)   An annual temporary sign permit of $50 will be required by the
sign owner/operator.

not more than 30 days and shall be removed within three days of the cessation
of the activity, service, project or sale.
         (d)   Signs shall be anchored or temporarily affixed in a manner to
prevent being blown away or blown over.

area for each exposed face area, nor more than six feet in height above grade.
         (f)   Temporary signs shall not be permitted in any class of

division (L)(3)(j) below.
         (g)   A temporary sign is to be located in the front yard of the lot
and shall not extend over any property line or be placed within 15 feet of any
driveway access to a public street. No temporary sign placed within 100 feet of
an area zoned for residential use, described as R-A, R-1, R-2, R-3 and R-4 may
have blinking, flashing, rotating or fluttering lights or other illuminating
device that has a change in intensity, brightness or color.
         (h)   A temporary sign shall not be placed on or affixed to a vehicle
or trailer which is parked on a public right-of-way or public property or
private property, where the sign causes the allowable square footage to be
exceeded (zone specific), where the apparent sole purpose is to advertise a
product or direct people to a business or activity located on the same or any
other property.
         (i)   The city must grant permission (no permit required) to install
any banner (unless the banner is to be installed for less than 24 hours).
Banners may not be installed on a property if the banner causes other allowable
square footage of signage to be exceeded (zone specific). Banners are allowed
to be installed on a property for a maximum of two weeks and must be removed
within three days of cessation of the event. The banner must be placed on
private property with the property owner’s consent.
         (j)   If the city has determined that a temporary sign is for a
community-wide event, a non-profit event, or a business use conditionally
allowed in a residential zone, a temporary sign that has been issued a permit
may be placed for a maximum of two weeks and must be removed within three days
of cessation of the event. The sign must be placed on private property with the
property owner’s consent. Temporary signs, having been issued a permit,
advertising a community-wide event or sponsored by a non-profit agency may be
located in the Van Dyk and Triangle Parks. No more than two signs will be
permitted at either park at any one time. The temporary signs may be located
for a maximum of 14 days and must be removed with three days of cessation of
event, permission required.
         (k)   No temporary sign may be placed upon or project into the public
right-of-way, except by permission from the city (no permit is required)
sandwich type or sidewalk signs may be placed in front of a business located in
a B-3 (General Business District). Placement must be at least six feet out from
the building where the advertised event is occurring. Size may not exceed six
square feet per side. Signs must be temporarily affixed or anchored in a manner
to prevent them from blown away or blown over. Signs must be brought into the
place of business at the close of the business day.
         (l)   All temporary signs must be kept in good repair and in a proper
state of maintenance, including, but not limited to, replacing lamps, replacing
or repairing the sign face, replacing the trim and the like. If the city
determines a sign is in significant need of repair, the city may after 30 day
of written notification, revoke the annual permit of that sign until it is
repaired.
         (m)   Signs which have been placed within any portion of any right-of-
way may be confiscated after a five business day written notification by any
city employee or agent under the direction of the city’s Zoning Administrator.
Signs may be recovered by the owner upon payment of a fine (double permit fee
as set by the City Council). Except: a conditional use permit request may be
made if extenuating circumstances exist and the issue is referred to the
Planning Commission for review. Circumstances may include extra wide right-of-
way, blockage of view of sign, blockage of view of all types of traffic and
construction obstructions. Concerns about approval may include utility
interference, safety hazards, health hazards and obstruction of traffic views.
Conditions would include that the permit is not permanent and the sign will be
removed upon 30-day notice.
         (n)   The erection of temporary signs shall be exempt from the
requirements (licensed sign hanger) of §§
114.20 through
114.23 of this code of ordinances, as amended.
   (M)   Building and zoning staff shall approve a permit for an electronic

following:
         (a)   The applicant demonstrates that the impact of adjacent
residential properties will be minimal in nature;
         (b)   The applicant agrees to turn off the electronic message center
sign between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. unless the applicant can
demonstrate that the sign in question will not be visible from any
residentially-zoned property; and
         (c)   The Planning Commission may require additional restrictions on
the usage of the sign so as to minimize potential impacts on adjacent
residential properties.
      (4)   All electronic message center signs, regardless of the zoning
district in which they are placed shall come equipped with automatic dimming
technology that automatically adjusts the sign’s brightness in direct
correlation with ambient light conditions.
      (5)   No electronic message center sign shall exceed a brightness level
of 0.3 footcandle above ambient light as measured using a foot candle meter at
a preset distance depending on sign size. Measuring distance is calculated
using the following: the square root of the product of the sign area and 100.
Example using a 12-square-foot sign:
v(12x100) = 34.6 feet measuring distance
      (6)   The use of traffic signal and/or emergency vehicle signal colors
may be proscribed on an electronic message center if land use, road proximity
or terrain consideration indicate a potential problem.

direction of the Council, bring civil suit in a court of competent jurisdiction
to recover from the persons owning the lots or parcels which were cleared the
cost of clearing and the costs and disbursements of a civil action therefor.

City of Fergus Falls”.
   (B)   References in those sections to this subchapter, unless the context
clearly indicates contrary intent, shall be to the subject of subdividing.
(2002 Code, § 7.70) (Ord. 117, Third Series, effective 4-10-1985)
§ 154.216 PURPOSE.
   (A)   (1)   In order to safeguard the best interests of the city and to
assist the subdivider in harmonizing his or her interests with those of the
city at large, this subchapter is adopted.
      (2)   Because each new subdivision becomes a permanent unit in the basic
structure of the expanding community, and to which the community will be forced
to adhere, and because piecemeal planning of subdivisions will bring on
undesirable disconnected patchwork of pattern and poor circulation of traffic
unless its design and arrangement is correlated to a Comprehensive Plan of the
city aiming at a unified scheme of community interests, all subdivisions of
land hereafter submitted for approval to the Planning Commission shall, in all
respects, fully comply with the regulations hereinafter set forth in this
subchapter.
   (B)   It is the purpose of this subchapter to make certain regulations and
requirements for the platting of land within the city pursuant to the authority
contained in M.S. Ch. 429, 471 and 505, and M.S. § 462.358, as they may be
amended from time to time, which regulations the Council deems necessary for
health, safety and the general welfare.

12-11-1965;
   (C)   Was a separate parcel of not less than two and one-half acres in area
and 150 feet in width on 1-1-1966; or
   (D)   If a single parcel of land of not less than 50 acres and having a
width of not less than 300 feet, and its conveyance does not result in the
division of land into two or more lots or parcels, any one of which is less
than five acres in area or 300 feet in width. Building permits shall not be
issued for buildings on tracts which have been subdivided and conveyed in
violation of this section, and the city may refuse to take over or improve
tracts as streets or roads therein, or refuse to repair or maintain the tracts.

   (B)   The regulations contained herein shall apply to the subdivision of a
previously unplatted lot, tract or parcel of land into two or more lots, tracts
or other division of land for the purpose of sale or building development,
whether immediate or future. The resubdivision or replatting of land or lots
for the purpose of changing previously established lot lines is required if the
proposed changes either affect the boundaries of more than six lots, affect any
public right-of-way, or is recommended by the City Engineer in conjunction with
the Planning Commission.
   (C)   Division of tracts larger than two and one-half acres in area and 150
feet in width shall be exempt from the requirements of this chapter where no
new street is involved.

§ 154.220 LAND SUITABILITY.
   No land shall be subdivided which is held unsuitable by the Council for the

other feature likely to be harmful to the health, safety or welfare of future
residents of the proposed subdivision or of the community.

approval or disapproval of the preliminary plat, to approve it with conditions
attached and to disapprove it until and unless certain conditions are first
complied with.
         (d)   Upon the making of its determination, the Planning Commission

deny an application for a preliminary plat within 120 days after the completed
application is filed, unless the applicant agrees to an extension of this time.

be deemed to be a denial of the application. A motion to deny the application
must be adopted. The facts upon which the decision is based and the reasons for
the decision shall be stated in writing at the time of the decision.
         (a)   Upon the adoption of the motion hereinabove provided by the
Planning Commission, the plat shall come before the Council for review. Within

         (e)   Upon decision by the Council, the City Administrator shall
transmit a copy of the motion, or notice of adoption without change, to the
subdivider.
         (f)   The approval of the preliminary plat shall not constitute an
acceptance of the subdivision, but it shall be deemed to be an authorization to
proceed with the preparation of the final plat.
         (g)   The approval of the preliminary plat by the Council shall be
effective for a period of one year from the date of approval by the Council.
         (h)   The subdivider may file a final plat limited to the portion of
the preliminary plat which he or she proposes to record and develop at the
time; provided that, the portion must conform to all requirements of this
chapter. If some portion, or all, of the final plat has not been submitted to
the Planning Commission for approval within the time hereinabove provided, a
preliminary plat must again be submitted to the Planning Commission and the
Council for approval, unless the Commission and the Council shall waive this
requirement.
   (B)   Approval of preliminary and final plat simultaneously. Where the
developer has submitted all data required for both the preliminary and final
plat, the Planning Commission, following a public hearing on the plat, may
recommend to the Council approval of both the preliminary and final plat
simultaneously. Upon the recommendation, the Council may follow the above
procedure as when a final plat is submitted to it.

final plat shall be submitted as follows.
   (A)   Submittal to Planning Commission.
      (1)   The final plat shall be submitted to the City Engineer at least ten
days prior to the Planning Commission meeting at which the same shall be
considered. The City Engineer shall prepare a report thereon setting out
whether or not the final plat is in substantial agreement with the preliminary
plat and, if not, in which particulars it varies therefrom, and whether or not
it conforms to the requirements of state law and the city’s ordinances and that
the final plat meets all the conditions attached to the final approval of the
preliminary plat.
      (2)   The Planning Commission shall consider the final plat at the
meeting at which it is submitted, and may consider it at a special or adjourned
meetings as it shall determine are necessary.
      (3)   The Planning Commission shall have the authority to recommend
approval or disapproval of the final plat. If it shall determine that it cannot
approve it unless certain conditions are attached, it shall by motion set forth
the conditions for approval and forthwith send a copy of the conditions to the
subdivider, and all further action on the plat shall be suspended until the
subdivider shall respond thereto; provided that, if no further action is taken
by the subdivider within a period of three months from the date of the adoption
of the conditions, the plat shall be deemed to be disapproved.
      (4)   Final action by motion on the final plat shall be communicated
forthwith to the subdivider by the Secretary of the Planning Commission, and a
copy of the motion shall be sent to the Council, together with the plat, and
other data as the Commission shall determine.
      (5)   If the Planning Commission approves the final plat, the Chairperson
and Secretary shall sign the same.
   (B)   Submittal to the Council.
      (1)   Upon the adoption of the motion of approval or disapproval by the
Planning Commission, the final plat shall come before the Council for review.
The City Council shall either approve or deny an application for a final plat
within 60 days after the completed application is filed, unless the applicant
agrees to a longer time. The failure of a vote to decide an appeal or approve
an application shall not be deemed to be a denial of the application. A motion
to deny the application must be adopted. The facts upon which the decision is
based and the reasons for the decision shall be stated in writing at the time
of the decision.
      (2)   The Council shall have the authority to hold hearings on the final
plat as it shall determine, and upon the notice as it shall provide.

thereon at the next meeting and report back to the Council no later than 45
days after the action of the Council.
      (4)   If the Council shall determine to accept the plat, it shall by
resolution so determine, and the resolution shall provide for the acceptance of
all streets, alleys, easements or other public ways, parks and other spaces
dedicated to public purposes.
      (5)   The action of the Council finally determining the matter shall be

effective 1-1-1981; Ord. 25, Fourth Series, effective 12-15-1991)
§ 154.227 BLOCKS.
   (A)   Block length. In general, intersecting streets, determining block
lengths, shall be provided at intervals as to serve cross-traffic adequately
and to meet existing streets. Where no existing plats control, the blocks in
residential subdivisions shall normally not exceed 1,000 feet in length, except
where topography or other conditions justify a departure from this maximum. In
blocks longer than 800 feet, pedestrian ways and/or easements through the block
may be required. The width and location of pedestrian ways shall be subject to
the approval of the City Engineer and the Planning Commission. Blocks for
business or industrial use should normally not exceed 600 feet in length.
   (B)   Block width. The width of the block shall normally be sufficient to
allow two tiers of lots of appropriate depth. Blocks intended for business or
industrial use shall be of a width as to be considered most suitable for their
respective use, including adequate space for off-street parking and deliveries.
(2002 Code, § 7.77) (Ord. 325, effective 12-11-1965; Ord. 47, Second Series,
effective 7-1-1974; Ord. 161, Third Series, effective 12-1-1987; Ord. 25,
Fourth Series, effective 12-15-1991)
§ 154.228 STREETS AND ALLEYS.
   (A)   The arrangement of thoroughfares and collector streets shall conform
as nearly as possible to the Comprehensive Plan. Except for culs-de-sac,
streets normally shall connect with streets already dedicated in adjoining or
adjacent subdivisions, or provide for future connections to adjoining
unsubdivided tracts, or shall be a reasonable projection of streets in the
nearest subdivided tracts. The arrangement of thoroughfares and collector
streets shall be considered in their relation to the reasonable circulation of
traffic to topographic conditions, to run-off storm water, to public
convenience and safety and in their appropriate relation to the proposed use of
the area to be served.
   (B)   Minor streets should be so planned as to discourage their use by non-
local traffic. Dead-end streets are prohibited, but culs-de-sac will be
permitted whereby topography or other conditions justify their use. Culs-de-sac
shall normally not be longer than 500 feet, including a terminal turn-around
which shall be provided at the closed end, with a right-of-way radius of not
less than 50 feet.
   (C)   Where the plat to be submitted includes only part of the tracts owned
or intended for development by the subdivider, a tentative plan of a proposed
future street system for the unsubdivided portion shall be prepared and
submitted by the subdivider.
   (D)   When a tract is subdivided into larger than normal building lots or
parcels the lots or parcels shall be so arranged as to permit the logical
location and openings of future streets and appropriate resubdivision, with
provision for adequate utility connections for the resubdivision.
   (E)   Under normal conditions, streets shall be laid out so as to intersect
as nearly as possible at right angles, except where topography or other
conditions justify variations. The minimum angle of intersection of streets
shall be 80 degrees. Street intersection jogs with an offset of less than 125
feet shall be avoided.
   (F)   Wherever the proposed subdivision contains or is adjacent to the
right-of-way of a limited access U.S. or state highway or thoroughfare,
provision may be made for a marginal access street approximately parallel and
adjacent to the boundary of the right-of-way, or for a street at a distance
suitable for the appropriate use of land between streets and right-of-way. The
distance shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance
required for approach connections to future grade separations, grade crossings
or for lot depths.
   (G)   Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial districts;
except that, this requirement may be waived where other definite and assured
provision is made for service access, such as off-street loading, unloading and
parking consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed. Except where
justified by special conditions such as the continuation of an existing alley
in the same block, alleys will not be approved in residential districts.
Alleys, where provided, shall not be less than 16 feet wide for residential
alleys and not less than 25 feet for commercial and industrial alleys. Dead-end
alleys shall not be permitted.
   (H)   Dedication of half streets will not be approved, except where it is
essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision and in conformity
with the other requirements of these regulations where it is found that it will
be practical to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining
property is subdivided, or where it becomes necessary to acquire the remaining
half by condemnation so it may be improved in the public interest.
      (1)   For all public ways hereafter dedicated and accepted, the minimum
right-of-way widths for streets and thoroughfares shall be as shown in the
Comprehensive Plan and where not shown therein, the minimum right-of-way width
for streets, thoroughfares, alleys or pedestrian ways included in any
subdivision shall not be less than the minimum dimensions for each
classification as follows:
Rights-of-Way Minimum Width
Rights-of-Way               Minimum Width
Collector street            75 feet
Industrial commercial alley 25 feet
Marginal access street      50 feet
Minor street                75 feet
Pedestrian way              10 feet
Primary thoroughfare        100 feet
Residential alley           16 feet
Secondary thoroughfare      80 feet
 
      (2)   Where existing or anticipated traffic on primary and secondary
thoroughfares warrants greater widths of rights-of-way, these shall be
required.
   (I)   (1)   The grades in all streets, thoroughfares, collector streets,
minor streets and alleys in any subdivision shall not be greater than the
maximum grades for each classification as follows:
 
Rights-of-Way          Maximum Grades
Alley                  8%
Collector street       5%
Minor street           8%
Primary thoroughfare   4%
Secondary thoroughfare 4%
 
      (2)   In addition, there shall be a minimum grade on all streets and
thoroughfares of not less than 0.4%.
   (J)   The horizontal and vertical alignment standards on all streets shall
be as follows:
      (1)   Horizontal radii of centerline:
         (a)   Major thoroughfare: 500 feet minimum;
         (b)   Secondary thoroughfare: 500 feet minimum;
         (c)   Collector street: 400 feet minimum;
         (d)   Minor street: 150 feet minimum; and
         (e)   There shall be a tangent between all reversed curves of a length
in relation to the radii of the curves so as to provide for a smooth flow of
traffic.
      (2)   Vertical: all changes in street grades shall be connected by
vertical parabolic curves of the length as follows:
         (a)   Primary thoroughfare or secondary thoroughfare: 30 times the
algebraic difference in the percent of grade of the two adjacent slopes; and
         (b)   Collector street or minor street: 20 times the algebraic
difference in the percent of grade of the two adjacent slopes.
   (K)   All proposed streets shall be offered for dedication as public
streets. No private streets shall be permitted, except as set forth in other
ordinances.

   (A)   For lots intended for building sites, the minimum lot area, width and
depth shall not be less than that established by the zoning regulations.
   (B)   Corner lots for residential use shall have additional width to permit
appropriate building setback from both streets, as defined in the zoning
regulations.
   (C)   Side lines of lots shall be approximately at right angles to street
lines or radial to curved street lines.
   (D)   Double frontage lots shall be avoided, except where lots back on a
thoroughfare or other arterial street, or where topographic or other conditions
render subdividing otherwise unreasonable. Double frontage lots shall have an
additional depth of at least 20 feet in order to allow space for screen
planting along the back lot line.
   (E)   Every lot must have at least the minimum required frontage on a public
dedicated street other than an alley.

§ 154.230 BASEMENTS.
   (A)   An easement for utilities, at least five feet wide, shall be provided
along each side of a side line of lots and along any other lot line as may be
deemed necessary to form a continuous right-of-way, at least ten feet in width.
If necessary for the extension of main water or sewer line or similar
utilities, easements of greater width may be required along lot lines or across
lots.
   (B)   Utility easements shall connect with easements established in
adjoining properties. These easements, when approved, shall not thereafter be
changed without the approval of the Council, by ordinance upon the
recommendation of the Planning Commission.
   (C)   Additional easements for pole guys should be provided at the outside
of turns. Where possible, lot lines shall be arranged to bisect the exterior
angle so that pole guys will fall along side lot lines.

channel or stream, a storm water easement, drainage right-of-way or park
dedication, whichever the Planning Commission may deem the most adequate,
conforming substantially with the lines of the watercourses shall be provided,
together with further width or construction, or both, as will be adequate for
the storm water drainage of the area. The width of the easements shall be
determined by the City Engineer.

§ 154.231 PUBLIC SITES AND OPEN SPACES.
   In subdividing land or resubdividing an existing plat, due consideration
shall be given by the subdivider to the dedication or reservation of suitable
sites, for schools, parks, playgrounds, conservation areas or other public or
semi-public recreational areas or open spaces. Areas so dedicated or reserved
shall conform as nearly as possible to the Comprehensive Plan. All areas to be
reserved for or dedicated to public use shall be indicated on the preliminary
plat in order that it may be determined when and in what manner the areas will
be dedicated to or acquired by the appropriate agency.

in each deed so affected.
         (e)   Storm sewer.

      (1)   It is the intention of this subchapter that all registered land
surveys under the jurisdiction of this subchapter should be presented to the
Planning Commission in the form of a preliminary plat in accordance with the
standards set forth in this subchapter for preliminary plats and that the
Planning Commission shall first approve the arrangement, sizes and relationship
of proposed tracts in the registered land surveys, and that tracts to be used

in which the land conveyed is described by metes and bounds shall be made or

§ 154.234 VARIANCES.
   (A)   General conditions. The Planning Commission may recommend a variance
from the provisions of this subchapter when, in its opinion, undue hardship on
the land may result from strict compliance. In granting any variance, the
Planning Commission shall prescribe only conditions that it deems necessary to
or desirable for the public interest. In making its findings, the Commission
shall take into account the nature of the proposed use of land and the existing
use of land in the vicinity, the number of persons to reside or work in the
proposed subdivision and the probable effect of the proposed subdivision upon
traffic conditions in the vicinity. No variance shall be granted unless the
Commission finds:

property so that the strict application of the provisions of this chapter would
deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of his or her land;
      (2)   The variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a
substantial property right of the petitioner; and
      (3)   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
welfare or injurious to other property in the territory in which the property
is situated.
   (B)   Applications required.
      (1)   Applications for any the variance shall be submitted in writing by
the subdivider at the time when the preliminary plat is filed for consideration
by the Commission, stating fully and clearly all facts relied upon by the
petitioner and shall be supplemented with maps, plans or other additional data
which may aid the Commission in the analysis of the proposed project.

restrictions or other legal provisions necessary to guarantee the full
achievement of the plan.

improvements. It is unlawful for any person owning an addition or subdivision
of land within the city to represent that any improvement upon any of the
