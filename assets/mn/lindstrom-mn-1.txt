§ 10.20 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Any Licensed Peace Officer of the city’s Police Department, or the

provision of this code.
   (B)   As permitted by M.S. § 626.862, as it may be amended from time to
time, the City Administrator shall have the authority to administer and enforce
this code. In addition, under that statutory authority, certain individuals
designated within the code have the authority to administer and enforce the
provisions specified. All and any person or persons designated by the City
Administrator may issue a citation in lieu of arrest or continued detention to
enforce any provision of the code.
   (C)   The City Administrator and any city official or employee designated by
this code who has the responsibility to perform a duty under this code may with
the permission of a licensee of a business or owner of any property or resident
of a dwelling, or other person in control of any premises, inspect or otherwise
enter any property to enforce compliance with this code.
   (D)   If the licensee, owner, resident, or other person in control of a
premises objects to the inspection of or entrance to the property, the City
Administrator, Peace Officer, or any employee or official charged with the duty
of enforcing the provisions of this code may, upon a showing that probable
cause exists for the issuance of a valid search warrant from a court of
competent jurisdiction, petition and obtain a search warrant before conducting
the inspection or otherwise entering the property. This warrant shall be only
to determine whether the provisions of this code enacted to protect the health,
safety and welfare of the people are being complied with and to enforce these
provisions only, and no criminal charges shall be made as a result of the
warrant. No warrant shall be issued unless there be probable cause to issue the
warrant. Probable cause occurs if the search is reasonable. Probable cause does
not depend on specific knowledge of the condition of a particular property.
   (E)   Every licensee, owner, resident or other person in control of property
within the city shall permit at reasonable times inspections of or entrance to
the property by the City Administrator or any other authorized city officer or
employee only to determine whether the provisions of this code enacted to
protect the health, safety and welfare of the people are being complied with
and to enforce these provisions. Unreasonable refusal to permit the inspection
of or entrance to the property shall be grounds for termination of any and all
permits, licenses or city service to the property. Mailed notice shall be given
to the licensee, owner, resident or other person in control of the property,
stating the grounds for the termination, and the licensee, owner, resident or
other person in control of the property shall be given an opportunity to appear
before the City Administrator to object to the termination before it occurs,
subject to appeal of the City Administrator’s decision to the City Council at a
regularly scheduled or special meeting.
   (F)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of
the City to enter private property in urgent emergency situations where there
is an imminent danger in order to protect the public health, safety and
welfare.
§ 10.98 SUPPLEMENTAL ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES.
   (A)   In addition to those administrative penalties established in this code
and the enforcement powers granted in §
10.20, the City Council is authorized to create by resolution, adopted by a
majority of the members of the Council, supplemental administrative penalties.
The resolution may be in the form established in Appendix A of this chapter.
   (B)   These administrative penalty procedures in this section are intended
to provide the public and the city with an informal, cost effective and
expeditious alternative to traditional criminal charges for violations of
certain provisions of this code. The procedures are intended to be voluntary on
the part of those who have been charged with those offenses.
   (C)   Administrative penalties for violations of various provisions of the
code, other than those penalties established in the code or in statutes that
are adopted by reference, may be established from time to time by resolution of
a majority of the members of the City Council. In order to be effective, an
administrative penalty for a particular violation must be established before
the violation occurred.
   (D)   In the discretion of the peace officer, City Administrator, or other
person giving notice of an alleged violation of a provision of this code, in a
written notice of an alleged violation, sent by first class mail to the person
who is alleged to have violated the code, the person giving notice may request
the payment of a voluntary administrative penalty for the violation directly to
the City Administrator within 14 days of the notice of the violation. A sample
notice is contained in Appendix B of this chapter. In the sole discretion of
the person giving the notice of the alleged violation, the time for payment may
be extended an additional 14 days, whether or not requested by the person to
whom the notice has been given. In addition to the administrative penalty, the
person giving notice may request in the notice to the alleged violator to adopt
a compliance plan to correct the situation resulting in the alleged violation
and may provide that if the alleged violator corrects the situation resulting
in the alleged violation within the time specified in the notice, that the
payment of the administrative penalty will be waived.
   (E)   At any time before the payment of the administrative penalty is due,
the person who has been given notice of an alleged violation may request to
appear before the City Council to contest the request for payment of the
penalty. After a hearing before the Council, the Council may determine to
withdraw the request for payment or to renew the request for payment. Because
the payment of the administrative penalty is voluntary, there shall be no
appeal from the decision of the Council.
   (F)   At any time after the date the payment of the administrative penalty
is due, if the administrative penalty remains unpaid or the situation creating
the alleged violation remains uncorrected, the city, through its Attorney, may
bring criminal charges in accordance with state law and this code. Likewise,
the city, in its discretion, may bring criminal charges in the first instance,
rather than requesting the payment of an administrative penalty, even if a
penalty for the particular violation has been established by Council
resolution. If the administrative penalty is paid, or if any requested
correction of the situation resulting in the violation is completed, no
criminal charges shall be initiated by the city for the alleged violation.
§ 10.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person, firm, or corporation who violates any provision of this
code for which another penalty is not specifically provided, shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor. The penalty which may be imposed for
any crime which is a misdemeanor under this code, including Minnesota Statutes
specifically adopted by reference, shall be a sentence of not more than 90 days
or a fine of not more than $1,000, or both.
   (B)   Any person, firm or corporation who violates any provision of this
code, including Minnesota Statutes specifically adopted by reference, which is
designated to be a petty misdemeanor shall, upon conviction be guilty of a
petty misdemeanor. The penalty which may be imposed for any petty offense which
is a petty misdemeanor shall be a sentence of a fine of not more than $300.
   (C)   In either the case of a misdemeanor or a petty misdemeanor, the costs
of prosecution may be added. A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon
each day during which a violation occurs or continues.
   (D)   The failure of any officer or employee of the city to perform any
official duty imposed by this code shall not subject the officer or employee to
the penalty imposed for a violation.
   (E)   In addition to any penalties provided for in this section or in §
10.98, if any person, firm or corporation fails to comply with any provision of
this code, the Council or any city official designated by it, may institute
appropriate proceedings at law or at equity to restrain, correct or abate the
violation.

it the city may initiate criminal proceedings for this alleged violation.
   Payment is due within 14 days of the date of this notice. Before the due
date, you may request an additional 14-day extension of the time to pay the
administrative penalty.
   As an alternative to the payment of this administrative penalty, if the

administrative penalty will be waived.
   Even if the administrative penalty is paid, the city reserves the right to
institute appropriate proceedings at law or at equity to restrain, correct or
abate the violation.
   Before the due date, you may request to appear before the City Council to
contest the request for payment of the penalty. After a hearing before the
Council, the Council may determine to withdraw the request for payment or to
renew the request for payment. Because the payment of the administrative
penalty is voluntary, there shall be no appeal from the decision of the
Council.
   If you pay the administrative penalty, the city will not initiate criminal
proceedings for this alleged violation. However, the Council, or any city
official designated by it, may institute appropriate proceedings at law or at
equity to restrain, correct or abate the violation.
   Payment of the administrative penalty may be made by check, cash or money
order to the City Administrator.

   (A)   Timing. The work to be done under the excavation permit, and the
patching and restoration of the right-of-way as required herein, must be
completed within the dates specified in the permit, increased by as many days
as work could not be done because of circumstances beyond the control of the
permittee or when work was prohibited as unseasonal or unreasonable under this
subchapter.
   (B)   Patch and restoration. The permittee shall patch its own work. The
city may choose either to have the permittee restore the right-of-way or to
restore the right-of-way itself.
      (1)   City restoration. If the city restores the right-of-way, the
permittee shall pay the costs thereof within 30 days of billing. If following
the restoration, the pavement settles due to the permittee’s improper
backfilling, the permittee shall pay to the city, within 30 days of billing,
all costs associated with having to correct the defective work.
      (2)   Permittee restoration. If the permittee restores the right-of-way
itself, it may be required at the time of application for an excavation permit

provisions of Minn. Rules part 7819.3000, as it may be amended from time to
time.

permittee upon notification from the City Administrator, Utilities
Superintendent or other person designated by the Council, shall correct all
restoration work to the extent necessary, using the method required by the City
Administrator, Utilities Superintendent or other person designated by the
Council. The work shall be completed within five calendar days of the receipt
of the notice from the City Administrator, Utilities Superintendent or other
person designated by the Council, not including days during which work cannot
be done because of circumstances constituting force majeure or days when work
is prohibited as unseasonal or unreasonable under this subchapter.
   (E)   Failure to restore. If the permittee fails to restore the right-of-way
in the manner and to the condition required by the City Administrator,
Utilities Superintendent or other person designated by the Council, or fails to
satisfactorily and timely complete all restoration required by the City
Administrator, Utilities Superintendent or other person designated by the
Council, the City Administrator, Utilities Superintendent or other person
designated by the Council at his or her option may do the work. In that event
the permittee shall pay to the city, within 30 days of billing, the cost of
restoring the right-of-way. If the permittee fails to pay as required, the city
may exercise its rights under the construction performance bond.
   (F)   Degradation fee in lieu of restoration. In lieu of right-of-way
restoration, a right-of-way user may elect to pay a degradation fee as

patching and the degradation fee shall not include the cost to accomplish these
responsibilities.

   (A)   Limitation on area. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the area
of the right-of-way specified in the permit. No permittee may do any work
outside the area specified in the permit, except as provided herein. Any
permittee which determines that an area greater than that specified in the
permit must be obstructed or excavated must before working in that greater area
make application for a permit extension and pay any additional fees required
thereby, and be granted a new permit or permit extension.
   (B)   Limitation on dates. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the dates
specified in the permit. No permittee may begin its work before the permit
start date or, except as provided herein, continue working after the end date.
If a permittee does not finish the work by the permit end date, it must apply
for a new permit for the additional time it needs, and receive the new permit
or an extension of the old permit before working after the end date of the
previous permit. This supplementary application must be submitted before the
permit end date.
§ 90.09 DENIAL OF PERMIT.

designated by the Council may issue an order to the permittee for any work
which does not conform to the terms of the permit or other applicable
standards, conditions, or codes. The order shall state that failure to correct
the violation will be cause for revocation of the permit. Within ten days after
issuance of the order, the permittee shall present proof to the City
Administrator, Utilities Superintendent or other person designated by the
Council that the violation has been corrected. If proof has not been presented
within the required time, the City Administrator, Utilities Superintendent or
other person designated by the Council may revoke the permit pursuant to §

§ 90.12 WORK DONE WITHOUT A PERMIT.
   (A)   Emergency situations.
      (1)   Each person with facilities in the right-of-way shall immediately
notify the city of any event regarding its facilities which it considers to be
an emergency. The owner of the facilities may proceed to take whatever actions
are necessary to respond to the emergency. Within two business days after the
occurrence of the emergency, the owner shall apply for the necessary permits,
pay the fees associated therewith and fulfill the rest of the requirements
necessary to bring itself into compliance with this chapter for the actions it
took in response to the emergency.
      (2)   If the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding facilities, the
city will attempt to contact the local representative of each facility owner
affected, or potentially affected, by the emergency. In any event, the city may
take whatever action it deems necessary to respond to the emergency, the cost
of which shall be borne by the person whose facilities occasioned the
emergency.
   (B)   Non-emergency situations. Except in an emergency, any person who,
without first having obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or excavates a
right-of-way must subsequently obtain a permit, and as a penalty pay double the
normal fee for the permit, pay double all the other fees required by this code,
deposit with the city the fees necessary to correct any damage to the right-of-
way and comply with all of the requirements of this chapter.
§ 90.13 SUPPLEMENTARY NOTIFICATION.
   If the obstruction or excavation of the right-of-way begins later or ends
sooner than the date given on the permit, the permittee shall notify the City
Administrator, Utilities Superintendent or other person designated by the
Council of the accurate information as soon as this information is known.
§ 90.14 REVOCATION OF PERMITS.
   (A)   Substantial breach. The city reserves its right, as provided herein,
to revoke any right-of-way permit, without a fee refund if there is a
substantial breach of the terms and conditions of any statute, ordinance, rule
or regulation, or any material condition of the permit. A substantial breach by
the permittee shall include, but shall not be limited, to the following:
      (1)   The violation of any material provision of the right-of-way permit;
      (2)   An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the right-
of-way permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit

      (3)   Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a
right-of-way permit;

      (5)   The failure to correct, in a timely manner, work that does not
conform to a condition indicated on an order issued pursuant to §
90.11.
   (B)   Written notice of breach. If the city determines that the permittee
has committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any statute,
ordinance, rule, regulation or any condition of the permit the city shall make
a written demand upon the permittee to remedy that violation. The demand shall
state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. A
substantial breach, as stated above, will allow the city, at its discretion, to
place additional or revised conditions on the permit to mitigate and remedy the
breach.
   (C)   Response to notice of breach.  Within 24 hours of receiving
notification of the breach, the permittee shall provide the city with a plan,
acceptable to the city, that will cure the breach. The permittee’s failure to
so contact the city, or the permittee’s failure to submit an acceptable plan,
or the permittee’s failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be
cause for immediate revocation of the permit.
   (D)   Reimbursement of city costs. If a permit is revoked, the permittee
shall also reimburse the city for the city’s reasonable costs, including
restoration costs and the costs of collection and reasonable attorneys’ fees

way, or any particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of
facilities that is or, pursuant to current technology, the city expects will
someday be located within the right-of-way. All excavation, obstruction, or
other permits issued by the city involving the installation or replacement of
facilities shall designate the proper corridor for the facilities at issue.

when necessary to protect the right-of-way and its current use, the City
Administrator, Utilities Superintendent or other person designated by the
Council shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or
additional facilities within the right-of-way. In making those decisions, the
City Administrator, Utilities Superintendent or other person designated by the
Council shall strive to the extent possible to accommodate all existing and
potential users of the right-of-way, but shall be guided primarily by
considerations of the public interest, the public’s needs for the particular
utility service, the condition of the right-of-way, the time of year with

required. The costs associated therewith will be billed to that registrant and
must be paid within 30 days from the date of billing. Each facility owner shall
be responsible for the cost of repairing any facilities in the right-of-way

repair, excavation, or construction, unless this requirement is waived by the
City Administrator, Utilities Superintendent or other person designated by the
Council.
§ 90.21 APPEAL.
   A right-of-way user that has been denied registration; has been denied a
permit; has had permit revoked; or believes that the fees imposed are invalid,
may have the denial, revocation, or fee imposition reviewed, upon written
request, by the City Council. The City Council shall act on a timely written
request at its next regularly scheduled meeting. A decision by the City Council
affirming the denial, revocation, or fee as imposition will be in writing and
supported by written findings establishing the reasonableness of the decision.
§ 90.22 RESERVATION OF REGULATORY AND POLICE POWERS.

Registrar of Motor Vehicles which shall be sufficient title to dispose of the

and receive a certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and claims of
ownership. Before a vehicle is issued a new certificate of title, it must
receive a motor vehicle safety check.
   (B)   Unsold vehicles. Abandoned or junk vehicles not sold by the city or

lienholder for 90 days and then shall be deposited in the treasury of the city.
   (D)   Sale proceeds; nonpublic impound lots. The operator of a nonpublic

suspected contraband or other items that likely would be subject to forfeiture
in a criminal trial must be turned over to the appropriate law enforcement
agency.
§ 91.10 DISPOSAL AUTHORITY.
   The city may contract with others or may utilize its own equipment and
personnel for the inventory of impounded motor vehicles and abandoned scrap
metal and may utilize its own equipment and personnel for the collection,
storage and transportation of these vehicles and abandoned scrap metal. The
city may utilize its own equipment and personnel only for the collection and
storage of not more than five abandoned or unauthorized vehicles without
advertising for or receiving bids in any 120-day period.
§ 91.11 CONTRACTS; REIMBURSEMENT BY MPCA.
   (A)   MPCA review and approval. If the city proposes to enter into a
contract with a person licensed by the MPCA pursuant to this section or a
contract pursuant to §
91.10, the MPCA may review the proposed contract before it is entered into by
the city, to determine whether it conforms to the MPCA’s plan for solid waste
management and is in compliance with MPCA rules. A contract that does so
conform may be approved by the MPCA and entered into by the city. Where a
contract has been approved, the MPCA may reimburse the city for the costs
incurred under the contract that have not been reimbursed under §
91.09. Except as otherwise provided in §
91.10, the MPCA shall not approve any contract that has been entered into
without prior notice to and request for bids from all persons duly licensed by
the MPCA to be a party to a disposal contract pursuant to M.S. § 116.07, as it
may be amended from time to time; does not provide for a full performance bond;
or does not provide for total collection and transportation of abandoned motor
vehicles, except that the MPCA may approve a contract covering solely
collection or transportation of abandoned motor vehicles where the MPCA
determines total collection and transportation to be impracticable and where
all other requirements herein have been met and the unit of government, after
proper notice and request for bids, has not received any bid for total
collection and transportation of abandoned motor vehicles.
   (B)    The city may perform work. If the city utilizes its own equipment and
personnel pursuant to its authority under §
91.10, and the use of the equipment and personnel conforms to the MPCA’s plan
for solid waste management and is in compliance with MPCA rules, the city may
be reimbursed by the MPCA for reasonable costs incurred which are not
reimbursed under §
91.09.
   (C)   The city required to contract work. The MPCA may demand that the city
contract for the disposal of abandoned motor vehicles and other scrap metal
pursuant to the MPCA’s plan for solid waste disposal. If the city fails to
contract within 180 days of the demand, the MPCA, through the Department of
Administration and on behalf of the city, may contract with any person duly
licensed by the MPCA for the disposal.

APPENDIX: CHICKEN CARE SHEET
CONSIDERATIONS BEFORE PURCHASE
While livestock animals must be kept as carefully as pet animals, it is
important to keep in mind
that when these animals are kept as pets they can live up to 14 years or
longer.
Will you have sufficient time to clean the coop on a weekly basis?
Are you willing to spend $10 to $15 twice a year for fecal examination?
Are you able to provide the birds with proper veterinary care and the
vaccinations needed?
Chickens need to be tended to twice daily. Will you have a person ready to
substitute for you when you have a reason to be absent?
HOW TO RECOGNIZE HEALTHY CHICKENS
Smooth, shiny and full plumage.
Intensely colored red comb and wattles.
Alert and shiny eyes,
Relatively firm, well formed; they must be clean; animals must be active,
curious, busily picking or scratching for food; chickens should be actively
dusting and preening their plumage; birds should be free of ectoparasites like
mites, fleas or ticks.
THE RIGHT PLACE FOR THE COOP
Chickens require light, warmth and shelter from wind and drafts. The coop
should be constructed with a southern exposure for the front (including a
window and door); this will provide some heat and light to the coop. To protect
the coop from winds, hedges, shrubs or bushes should be placed toward the
northeast and western sections of the coop. Despite their love of warmth,
chickens tolerate heat poorly, as they have no sweat glands to allow for
perspiration. For summer heat you must provide access to shade.
   •   Space Requirements: If you plan to raise large breeds, at least four
square feet will be needed for each bird. If the chickens will be confined to
the coop for a great portion of the time, they will need more room: allow ten
square feet for each bird, or six to eight square feet per bantam.
   •   Nesting Box: Some kind of nesting box will be needed in the coop. Supply
one nest for every four hens.
   •   Perches/Roots: Perches or roosts will also be needed; a good rule of
thumb is one per bird.
   •   Heat: You might consider running electricity to your coop. This is
especially desirable if it tends to get very cold in the winter, as chickens
are prone to frostbitten combs and wattles. A few properly placed heat lamps,
kept burning at night, will keep chickens warm and may prevent their drinking
water from freezing.
   •   Walls: Avoid building materials that permit absorption of moisture, as
this will have a bad effect on the health of your chickens. Chemically treated
wood is the most suitable building material for coops. Treatment of the wood
should be done only with chemical compounds that are non-toxic to animals. A
good compound with antifungal agents is good for humid areas. Clear varnish is
also good. Everything should be treated or painted before it is assembled.
Wooden structures should be built with double walls that have a one and one-
half inch insulated layer between them. All bantams need warmer coop
temperatures than larger chickens.
   •   Roofing: The coop roof should be made of a material that will not
collect and hold heat. The roof surface should be covered with an insulating
tar paper to protect from heavy rains. The roof should be slightly inclined to
allow water to run off; if it overhangs at the front wall, it will protect from
downpours. A few small openings along the eaves allow moisture to escape and
provide fresh air.
   •   Floorings: The floor should be one that will not collect and hold
moisture, is easy to clean, and that the chickens will not have trouble walking
on. A dirt floor fulfills most to the essential demands, a concert floor is
ideal, especially since it discourages rodents. A wood floor is adequate;
provided it is at least on foot off the ground, insulated and sealed properly.
It is a good idea to throw litter on the floor wherever the chickens will be to
absorb moisture and facilitate cleaning.
CLEANING
How often the coop is cleaned depends on a lot of variables. If the chickens
are kept inside, ideally droppings should be removed every day, but not less
than every two to three days. Perches/roosts should get a quick wiping off at
the same time. In a larger coop outdoors, once a week might be appropriate, but
a major cleaning must be done twice annually: once in the spring and again in
the fall. All of the litter must be removed, and all parts and accessories
washed, scrubbed and thoroughly disinfected and dried before returning the
birds to the coop.
FEEDING
It has been found that chickens, like people, need a variety of foods in order
to remain healthy, and like people, suffer several nutritional disorders if
certain things are missing for their diet. Prepared chicken feeds are designed
to provide a perfectly balanced diet. Most prepared feeds contain such
ingredients as meat and bone scraps, blood meal, bone meal, molasses, ground
grains and grain meals. They also contain minerals and vitamins that chickens
are known to need.
   •   Scratch: This is an old time favorite chicken feed and is a mixture of
various whole grains and cracked corn. This feed goes over big with chickens,
but is not complete dietary ration. Scratch mixtures with a high proportion of
corn are not recommended. Some corn is fine, but as grains go, corn is lower in
protein and higher in fat, and it tends to make the chickens obese.
   •   Grit: Chickens must have access to grit in order for their digestive
systems to function properly. Since chickens do not have teeth, the grinding
function is performed by their gizzards. The gizzards uses grit as a grinding
agent, which may simply be pebbles and other small stones. The grit gradually
gets ground up along with the grain so it must be continuously renewed.
   •   Greens: Chickens love fresh greens, salad scraps, weeds and surplus or
overripe fruit and vegetables from the garden. These are an important part of
feeding program for a backyard flock. Not only will it help keep down your feed
bill, but it adds variety and needed vitamins and nutrients to their diet. When
you feed scraps, sort out anything that has begun to rot as it might make the
chickens sick.
HOW MUCH AND HOW OFTEN TO FEED
An average bantam in confinement may consume 40 to 50 pounds of feed annually,
while a larger breed may consume twice that amount. Chickens won't eat more
then they need, so they should be allowed to eat as much as they want. Although
feed should be continuously available, it is wise to feed them each day rather
then put a lot of feed out every few days. Feeding troughs are more sanitary
and economical then just throwing feed on the ground. Once a week you should
clean out the feed troughs and dispose of any residue to help keep the feed
fresh.
WATER
Fresh water must be available to the chickens at all times. This cannot be
overemphasized. They must have clean water with their feed to be able to digest
it properly. A chicken is more than 50% water. A large chicken will drink from
one to two cups of water a day, depending on the weather. Chickens cannot drink
much at one time, so they must drink often. Puddles of stagnant water from rain
or leaky waters are a breeding ground for harmful bacteria and other disease-
causing organisms, and also tend to become fouled by the chickens’ excrement.
Even if fresh water is available, puddles should be eliminated so the chickens
do not have access to them for this reason.
NOISE
If you are going to be keeping any roosters, you should know that it is a myth
that they only crow at sunup. The truth is they crow anytime they feel like it,
sometimes even at night. If complaints are received, your permit could be
revoked.
PREDATOR PROTECTION
You must provide protection from predators; raccoons, fox, mink and skunks all
like chickens. Raccoons can open latches and reach through screens.

Failure to comply with this section shall constitute a violation.
      (2)   Removal by city. The City Administrator or other person designated

of removal adjacent to each separate lot and parcel.
   (C)   Public health and safety hazards. When the city removes or eliminates

      (2)   Inspections; notice. The City Council or its designee shall make

§ 93.02 TREE DISEASES.
   (A)   Trees constituting nuisance declared. The following are public

premises the person owns or controls within the city. The City Council may by
resolution order the nuisance abated. Before action is taken on that
resolution, the City Council shall publish notice of its intention to meet to

the affected property owner and published once no less than one week prior to
the meeting. The notice shall state the time and place of the meeting, the

Administrator shall list the total unpaid charges for each abatement against

The City Council may then spread the charges or any portion thereof against the
property involved as a special assessment as authorized by M.S. § 429.101 as it
may be amended from time to time and other pertinent statutes for certification
to the County Auditor and collection the following year along with the current
taxes.
Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 93.03 REPEAT NUISANCE CALL SERVICE FEE.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to protect the public safety,
health and welfare and to prevent and abate repeat service response calls by
the city to the same property or location for nuisance service calls, as
defined herein, which prevalent police or public safety services to other
residents of the city. It is the intent of the city by the adoption of this
section to impose and collect service call fees from the owner or occupant, or
both, of property to which city officials must repeatedly respond for any
repeat nuisance event or activity that generates extraordinary costs to the
city. The repeat nuisance service call fee is intended to cover that cost over
and above the cost of providing normal law or code enforcement services and
police protection city wide.
   (B)   Scope and application. This section shall apply to all owners and
occupants of private property which is the subject or location of the repeat
nuisance service call by the city. This section shall apply to any repeat
nuisance service calls as set forth herein made by a peace officer, part time
peace officer, community service officer, animal control officers and code
enforcement officers/technicians.
   (C)   Definition of nuisance call or similar conduct. The term NUISANCE
SERVICE CALL shall mean any activity, conduct, or condition occurring upon
private property within the city which: (i) unreasonably annoys, injures or
endangers the safety, health, morals, comfort or repose of any member of the
public; (ii) or will, or will tend to, alarm, anger or disturb others or
provoke breach of the peace, to which the city is required to respond,
including, but not limited to the following:
      (1)   Any activity, conduct, or condition deemed as a public nuisance
under any provision of the city code;
      (2)   Any activity, conduct, or condition in violation of any provision
of
Chapter 154;
      (3)   Any conduct, activity or condition constituting a violation of
Minnesota State laws prohibiting or regulating prostitution, gambling,
controlled substances, use of firearms; and
      (4)   Any conduct, activity, or condition constituting disorderly conduct
under M.S. Chapter 609 as it may be amended from time to time.
   (D)   Repeat nuisance service call fee. The city may impose a repeat
nuisance service call fee upon the owner or occupant of private property if the
city has rendered services or responded to the property on three or more
occasions within a period of 365 days in response to or for the abatement of
nuisance conduct, activity, or condition of the same or similar kind. The
repeat nuisance service call fee under this section shall be an amount as set
forth and duly adopted by City Council resolution. All repeat nuisance service
call fees imposed and charged against the owner or occupant under this section
shall be deemed delinquent 30 days after the city’s mailing a billing statement
therefore. Delinquent payments are subject to a 10% late penalty of the amount
due.
   (E)   Notice. No repeat nuisance service call fee may be imposed against an
owner or occupant of property without first providing the owner or occupant
with written notice of the prior nuisance service calls prior to the latest
nuisance service call rendered by the city upon which the fee is imposed. The
written notice shall:
      (1)   State the nuisance conduct, activity or condition that is or has
occurred or is maintained or permitted on the property, the dates of the
nuisance conduct, activity or condition;
      (2)   State that the owner or occupant may be subject to a repeat
nuisance call service fee if a third nuisance service call is rendered to the
property for the same nuisance, in addition to the city’s right to seek other
legal remedies or actions for abatement of the nuisance or compliance with the
law; and
      (3)   Be served personally or by U.S. Mail upon the owner or occupant at
the last known address.
   (F)   Right to appeal nuisance service call fee.
      (1)   Upon the imposition of a repeat nuisance service call fee, the city
shall inform the owner or occupant of his or her right to a hearing on the
alleged repeat nuisance service calls. The owner or occupant upon whom the fee
is imposed may request a hearing by serving upon the City Administrator within
five business days of the mailing of the fee invoice, inclusive of the day the
invoice is mailed, a written request for hearing. The hearing shall be heard by
the hearing office within 14 days of the date of the owner’s or occupant’s
request for hearing.
      (2)   The hearing shall be conducted in an informal manner and the
Minnesota Rules of Civil Procedure and Rules of Evidence shall not be strictly
applied. The hearing need not be transcribed, but may be transcribed at the
sole expense of the party who requests the transcription. After considering all
evidence submitted, the Hearing Officer shall make written findings of fact and
conclusions on the issue of whether the city responded to or rendered services
for repeat nuisance service calls of the same or similar kind on three or more
occasions within a 365-day period. The findings and conclusions shall be served
upon the owner or occupant by U.S. Mail within five days of the notice of
hearing.
      (3)   An owner’s or occupant’s right to a hearing shall be deemed waived
if the owner or occupant fails to serve a written request for hearing as
required herein or fails to appear at the scheduled hearing date. Upon waiver
of the right to hearing, or upon the hearing officer’s written findings of fact
and conclusions that the repeat nuisance call service fee is warranted
hereunder, the owner or occupant shall immediately pay the fee imposed.
   (G)   Legal remedies nonexclusive. Nothing in this section shall be
construed to limit the city’s other available legal remedies for any violation
of the law which may constitute a nuisance service call hereunder, including
criminal, civil, injunctive or others.

§ 93.19 DUTIES OF CITY OFFICERS.
   The Police Department or Sheriff, if the city has at the time no Police
Department, shall enforce the provisions relating to nuisances. Any peace
officer shall have the power to inspect private premises and take all
reasonable precautions to prevent the commission and maintenance of public
nuisances.
§ 93.20 ABATEMENT.
   (A)   Notice. Written notice of violation; notice of the time, date, place
and subject of any hearing before the City Council; notice of City Council
order; and notice of motion for summary enforcement hearing shall be given as
set forth in this section.
      (1)   Notice of violation. Written notice of violation shall be served by
a peace officer on the owner of record or occupant of the premises either in
person or by certified or registered mail. If the premises is not occupied, the
owner of record is unknown, or the owner of record or occupant refuses to
accept notice of violation, notice of violation shall be served by posting it
on the premises.
      (2)   Notice of City Council hearing. Written notice of any City Council
hearing to determine or abate a nuisance shall be served on the owner of record
and occupant of the premises either in person or by certified or registered
mail. If the premises is not occupied, the owner of record is unknown, or the
owner of record or occupant refuses to accept notice of the City Council
hearing, notice of City Council hearing shall be served by posting it on the
premises.
      (3)   Notice of City Council order. Except for those cases determined by
the city to require summary enforcement, written notice of any City Council
order shall be made as provided in M.S. § 463.17 (Hazardous and Substandard
Building Act), as it may be amended from time to time.
      (4)   Notice of motion for summary enforcement. Written notice of any
motion for summary enforcement shall be made as provided for in M.S. § 463.17
(Hazardous and Substandard Building Act), as it may be amended from time to

   (B)   Procedure. Whenever a peace officer determines that a public nuisance
is being maintained or exists on the premises in the city, the officer shall
notify in writing the owner of record or occupant of the premises of such fact
and order that the nuisance be terminated or abated. The notice of violation
shall specify the steps to be taken to abate the nuisance and the time within
which the nuisance is to be abated. If the notice of violation is not complied
with within the time specified, the officer shall report that fact forthwith to
the City Council. Thereafter, the City Council may, after notice to the owner
or occupant and an opportunity to be heard, determine that the condition
identified in the notice of violation is a nuisance and further order that if
the nuisance is not abated within the time prescribed by the City Council, the
city may seek injunctive relief by serving a copy of the City Council order and
notice of motion for summary enforcement.
   (C)   Emergency procedure; summary enforcement. In cases of emergency, where
delay in abatement required to complete the notice and procedure requirements
set forth in divisions (A) and (B) of this section will permit a continuing
nuisance to unreasonably endanger public health safety or welfare, the City
Council may order summary enforcement and abate the nuisance. To proceed with
summary enforcement, the officer shall determine that a public nuisance exists
or is being maintained on premises in the city and that delay in abatement of
the nuisance will unreasonably endanger public health, safety or welfare. The
officer shall notify in writing the occupant or owner of the premises of the
nature of the nuisance and of the city’s intention to seek summary enforcement
and the time and place of the City Council meeting to consider the question of
summary enforcement. The City Council shall determine whether or not the
condition identified in the notice to the owner or occupant is a nuisance,
whether public health, safety or welfare will be unreasonably endangered by
delay in abatement required to complete the procedure set forth in division (A)
of this section, and may order that the nuisance be immediately terminated or
abated. If the nuisance is not immediately terminated or abated, the City
Council may order summary enforcement and abate the nuisance.
   (D)   Immediate abatement. Nothing in this section shall prevent the city,
without notice or other process, from immediately abating any condition which
poses an imminent and serious hazard to human life or safety.
Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 93.21 RECOVERY OF COST.
   (A)   Personal liability. The owner of premises on which a nuisance has been
abated by the city shall be personally liable for the cost to the city of the
abatement, including administrative costs. As soon as the work has been
completed and the cost determined, the City Administrator or other official
shall prepare a bill for the cost and mail it to the owner. Thereupon the
amount shall be immediately due and payable at the office of the City
Administrator.
   (B)   Assessment. If the nuisance is a public health or safety hazard on
private property, the accumulation of snow and ice on public sidewalks, the
growth of weeds on private property or outside the traveled portion of streets,
or unsound or insect-infected trees, the City Administrator shall, on or before
September 1 next following abatement of the nuisance, list the total unpaid
charges along with all other the charges as well as other charges for current
services to be assessed under M.S. § 429.101, as it may be amended from time to

under that statute and other pertinent statutes for certification to the County
Auditor and collection along with current taxes the following year or in annual
installments, not exceeding ten, as the City Council may determine in each
case.

exceptions
   
96.04   Property owners prohibited from renting real property to certain sexual
offenders and sexual predators; penalties
§ 96.01 FINDINGS AND INTENT.
   (A)   Repeat sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence,
and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual predators who present an
extreme threat to the public safety. Sexual offenders are extremely likely to
use physical violence and to repeat their offenses. Most sexual offenders
commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are
prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of sexual
offender victimization to society at large, while incalculable, clearly
exorbitant.
   (B)   It is the intent of this chapter to serve the city's compelling
interest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety and welfare of its
citizens by creating a civil, non-punitive regulatory scheme, establishing
areas around locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated
numbers, wherein certain sexual offenders and sexual predators are prohibited
from establishing temporary or permanent residence.

component, part or accessory of a tobacco product; cigars; cheroots; stogies;
perique; granulated, plug cut, crimp cut, ready rubbed, and other smoking

§ 116.01 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The City Council finds that use of services provided by pawnbrokers
provides an opportunity for the commission of crimes and their concealment
because pawn businesses have the ability to receive and transfer property
stolen by others easily and quickly. The City Council also finds that consumer
protection regulation is warranted in transactions involving pawnbrokers. The
City Council further finds that the pawn industry has outgrown the city's
current ability to effectively or efficiently identify criminal activity
related to pawnshops. The purpose of this chapter is to prevent pawn businesses
from being used as facilities for the commission of crimes, and to assure that
such businesses comply with basic consumer protection standards, thereby
protecting the public health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the
city.
   (B)   To help the Police Department better regulate current and future pawn
businesses, decrease and stabilize costs associated with the regulation of the
pawn industry, and increase identification of criminal activities in the pawn
industry through the timely collection and sharing of pawn transactions
information, this chapter also implements and establishes the required use of
the Automated Pawn System (APS).
(Ord. 201414420-01, passed 11-20-14)
§ 116.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   BILLABLE TRANSACTION. Every reportable transaction conducted by a pawnbroker
is a BILLABLE TRANSACTION except renewals, redemptions or extensions of
existing pawns on items previously reported and continuously in the licensee's
possession, voided transactions, and confiscations.
   PAWN TRANSACTION. Any loan on security of pledged goods or any purchase of
pledged goods on the condition that the pledged goods are left with the
pawnbroker and may be redeemed or repurchased by the seller for a fixed price
within a fixed period of time.
   PAWNBROKER.  Any natural person, partnership or corporation, either as
principal, agent or employee thereof, who loans money on deposit or pledge of
personal property or other valuable thing, or who deals in the purchasing of
personal property or other valuable thing on condition of selling the same back
again at a stipulated price, or who loans money secured by chattel mortgage on
personal property, taking possession of the property or any part thereof so
mortgaged. Any such person whose business includes buying personal property
previously used, rented or leased, or selling such property on consignment, is
hereby deemed PAWNBROKER.
   PAWNSHOP. The location at which or premises in which a pawnbroker regularly
conducts business.
   REPORTABLE TRANSACTION.  Every transaction conducted by a pawnbroker in
which merchandise is received through a pawn, purchase, consignment or trade,
or in which a pawn is renewed, extended or redeemed, or for which a unique
transaction number or identifier is generated by their point-of-sale software,
or an item is confiscated by law enforcement, is reportable except:
      (1)   The bulk purchase or consignment of new or used merchandise from a
merchant, manufacturer or wholesaler having an established permanent place of

   (C)   Each license shall remain in full force and effect until surrendered,

filed under this chapter. However, the Director shall be authorized to make any
investigation or examination of the records and accounts of the person making
the return, if the Director reasonably determines that such steps are necessary

incorrect, false, or fraudulent return, the operator shall, upon written notice
and demand, file such return or corrected return within five days of receipt of
such written notice and shall at the same time pay any tax due on the basis
thereof. If such person shall fail to file such return or corrected return, the
Director shall make a return or corrected return for such person from such
knowledge and information as the Director can obtain, and assess a tax on the
basis thereof, which tax, less any payments theretofore made on account of the
tax for the taxable period covered by such return, shall be paid within five
days of the receipt of written notice and demand for such payment. Any such
return or assessment made by the Director shall be prima facie correct and
valid, and such person shall have the burden of establishing its incorrectness
or invalidity in any action or proceeding in respect thereto.

residential units when they will improve the livability thereof, provided they
will not increase the number of dwelling units or size or volume of the
building.

safe condition when the structure is declared unsafe by the Zoning
Administrator providing the necessary repairs shall not constitute more than

conformity with the regulations of this chapter, and as specifically provided
in subsection (B) of this section.

nonconformity, including the lawful use or occupation of land or premises
existing at the time of the adoption of an additional control under this
chapter, may be continued, including through repair, replacement, restoration,
maintenance, or improvement, but not including expansion, unless:
      (1)   The nonconformity or occupancy is discontinued for a period of more
than one year.
      (2)   The nonconforming use or building is destroyed by fire or other
peril to the extent of greater than 50% of its estimated market value, as
indicated in the records of the County Assessor at the time of damage, and no
building permit has been applied for within 180 days of when the property is
damaged.

changed to lessen the nonconformity of use. Once a nonconforming structure or
parcel of land has been changed, it shall not thereafter be so altered to
increase the nonconformity.
   (B)   When any lawful nonconforming use of a structure or land in any
district has been changed to a conforming use, it shall not thereafter be
changed to any nonconforming use.
(Ord. 20220120-01, passed 1-20-22)

DIVISION 02: BASE ZONING DISTRICTS
PART 1. GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.02.11 PURPOSE STATEMENTS.
   The following are the purpose statements for each of the city’s base zoning
districts:
   (A)   R-1, Low Density Detached Residential District. The purpose of the R-
1 District is to provide for the preservation of existing single-family
residential neighborhoods. This district is intended to apply to areas of
existing single-family development and is not meant to be expanded further.
   (B)   R-2, Low Density Attached and Detached Residential District. The
purpose of the R-2 District is to support a mixture of detached and attached
single-family dwellings, as well as smaller multiple-family buildings. This
district is intended to be located in existing residential areas near downtown
and in areas of potential infill and redevelopment throughout the city to serve
as a transition between higher density residential and/or commercial districts
and lower density residential neighborhoods. Neighborhoods in this district are
generally expected to be more dense than those found in the R-1 District and
should be characterized by a walkable grid or connected street pattern, a range
of housing types, and convenient access to goods and services.
   (C)   R-3, Mixed Density Residential District. The purpose of the R-
3 District is to encourage the creation of residential neighborhoods with a
mixture of residential uses including single-family detached and attached
dwellings, attached townhouses and rowhouses, and multiple-family buildings.
This district is intended to be located in new development areas of the city
where public sewer and water are available. It is intended that the overall
density of a residential development will meet the underlying Comprehensive
Plan designation. Neighborhoods should be designed with a connected street
pattern, range of housing types, and interspersed parks and green spaces.
   (D)   R-4, Medium/High Density Residential District. The purpose of the R-
4 District is to accommodate a variety of medium to high density housing types
including townhouses, apartments, and senior housing to meet the diverse and
evolving housing needs of Lindstrom. Developments within this district should
be walkable and should provide convenient access to goods and services.
   (E)   RM, Manufactured Home Park District. The purpose of the R-M District
is to provide for manufactured home uses in an appropriate, safe, sanitary and
attractive environment.
   (F)   CBD, Central Business District. The purpose of the CBD District is to
provide for the establishment of a downtown which stresses the interaction of
people and businesses within a compact central area. This district should
contain a mix of cultural, civic, entertainment, residential, retail, service,
and office uses. Consideration for pedestrian and bicycle access shall be
integrated.
   (G)   B-1, General Business District. The B-1 District is intended for
retail and service-oriented businesses which are oriented toward motorists and
rely on higher volumes of traffic.
   (H)   B-2, Business Park District. The B-2 District is intended to provide
accessible opportunities near transportation corridors for industries that may
benefit from the accommodation of both office and light industrial uses on-
site. Uses in this district are limited to those that are compatible with lower
intensity residential and business uses and which have limited amounts of truck
traffic in comparison to higher intensity industrial uses.
   (I)   I-1, Industrial District. The purpose of the I-1 District is to
provide for industrial, manufacturing, and warehouse uses.
   (J)   AO, Agriculture Open Space. The AO District is intended to provide a
district which will allow suitable areas of the city to be retained and
utilized in open space, parks, recreational, and/or agricultural uses and
prevent scattered non-farm uses from developing improperly.
   (K)   DH, Development Holding. The DH District is intended to be a holding
district for those parcels which are annexed into the city where existing uses
may continue without changes. At the time of annexation, parcels will be zoned
DH unless special action is taken to place it in another district. A parcel
will be rezoned from DH to the appropriate city zoning district at the time of
development following review and approval by the City Council.
(Ord. 20220120-01, passed 1-20-22)
PART 2. USES
§ 151.02.21 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   In any district, whenever a use is neither specifically permitted nor
denied, the use shall be considered prohibited, except in the CBD, B-1, and B-
2 Districts. In the CBD, B-1, and B-2 Districts, the Zoning Administrator may
determine that a proposed use is very similar to any allowed use in that
district. In such case, the proposed use shall be allowed in the CBD, B-1, or
B-2 District. If the proposed use is either not an allowed use or is not very
similar to an allowed use in the CBD, B-1, or B-2 Districts, the Council or the
Planning Commission, on their own initiative or upon request, may conduct a
study to determine if the use is acceptable and if so what zoning district
would be most appropriate and the determination as to conditions and standards
relating to development of the use. The Council, Planning Commission or
property owner shall, if appropriate, initiate an amendment to this chapter to
provide for the particular use under consideration or shall find that the use
is not compatible for development within the city.
   (B)   When a property is located within the boundaries of one or more
overlay districts, the most restrictive use provision among the overlay and
base zoning districts shall apply.

§ 151.02.22 PRINCIPAL USES TABLE.
   (A)   
Table 151.02.01 lists land uses and indicates whether they are permitted,
permitted with standards, conditional, or prohibited. The table also includes
references to whether additional use specific standards are applicable to that
use. The following definitions shall be referenced when using
Table 151.02.01:
      (1)   Permitted uses – a “P” in a cell of the use table indicates that
the land use is allowed by right in the base zoning district.
      (2)   Permitted with standards uses – a “PS” in a cell of the use table
indicates that the land use is allowed when standards identified in
Division 151.05 Use-Specific Standards are met. Uses permitted with standards
are also subject to all other applicable requirements of this chapter. Any
request to vary from the standards set forth for a permitted with standards use
shall be processed as a variance.
      (3)   Conditional uses – a “C” in a cell of the use table indicates that
the land use is allowed in the base zoning district only upon approval of a
conditional use permit as described in
Division 151.06 Procedures and in compliance with any use-specific standards
identified in
Division 151.05 Use-Specific Standards. Uses subject to a conditional use
permit are also subject to all other applicable requirements in the City Code.
      (4)   Prohibited uses – a blank cell in the use table indicates that the
land use is prohibited in that base zoning district.

PART 3. LOT AND SITE DIMENSIONS
§ 151.02.31 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Lot of record.
      (1)   A lot of record existing July 1, 1987 which does not meet the
minimum area or lot width requirements of this chapter, may be utilized
providing that the measurements of the area or width are within 70% of the
requirements of this chapter. This provision shall not apply to a lot of record
in the Shoreland Overlay District, for which M.S. § 462.357, Subd. 1e shall
apply.
      (2)   However, if in a group of two or more contiguous lots of record
under a single ownership, any individual lot does not meet the minimum lot area
or width requirements of this chapter, the individual lot cannot be considered
as a separate parcel of land for the purposes of sale or development, but must
be combined with adjacent lots under the same ownership so that the
combinations of lots will equal one or more parcels of land each meeting the
lot width or area requirements of this chapter. This provision shall not apply
to a group of two or more contiguous lots of record under a common ownership in
the Shoreland Overlay District, for which M.S. § 462.357, subd. 1e shall apply.
      (3)   A lot of record in a residential district which is not within the
70% of the area and width requirements of this chapter and is not located
contiguous to lots under a single and same ownership, may have a single-family
detached dwelling and accessory buildings constructed without a variance
provided the use complies with all other requirements of the City Code,
including but not limited to setbacks and impervious surface requirements. This
provision shall not apply to a lot of record in the Shoreland Overlay District,
for which M.S. § 462.357, subd. 1e shall apply.
   (B)   Impervious surface.
      (1)   In an effort to reduce the quantity and improve the quality of
runoff in all areas of the city, no lot shall be covered by more than 50%
impervious surface.
         (a)   In residential districts, properties may use pervious pavers to
meet impervious surface requirements if approved by the City Council through a
variance process in accordance with the city pervious paver policy, which shall
be incorporated herein.
         (b)   This standard shall not apply to uses in the CBD, B-1, B-2, and
I-1 Districts if the proposed use either causes no increase in surface water
discharge or if all discharges are accommodated by a surface water management
system or program approved by the city.
         (c)   Properties located within the Shoreland District shall be
subject to impervious surface limits as specified in §
151.03.22.
      (2)   Pervious pavers. Any use of pervious pavers or pavement shall only
be allowed on residential properties in accordance with the pervious paver
policy adopted by the City Council, commercial properties, and industrial
properties under the following conditions:
         (a)   All pervious pavers must be designed and professionally
installed in accordance with manufacturer’s specifications.
         (b)   Pervious paver installations must be certified by the contractor
when complete and shall be subject to the city’s approval. After the first year
(365 days from the date of the first certification), the pervious pavers must
be recertified every three years or any time the property is sold or
transferred to a new owner in order to ensure that the pervious pavers are
being properly maintained.
         (c)   All pervious pavers or pavement must be properly maintained. The
owner of the property shall be required to provide the city with a maintenance
plan to ensure that the use of the pervious pavers or pavement conforms to the
manufacturer’s guidelines. The maintenance plan shall include the frequency and
type of maintenance that must be performed to properly maintain the pervious
pavers or pavement.
      (3)   Certification process. Each property using pervious pavers to meet
impervious surface requirements through a variance is required to maintain an
active certification with the city as outlined above. The certification and
recertification process is described below:
         (a)   All installations require at least one observation port made
from a perforated pipe (preferably PVC) wrapped in fabric that allows water to
enter from the underlying storage layer (sand or gravel).
         (b)   After the installation is complete, the designer/installer shall
perform a simulated infiltration test on the pervious pavers or pavement by
running a water hose across the surface for a 15-minute period. The city staff
shall observe this process and record the length of time it takes for water to
reach the observation port. If the water shows up with an allowable variance
from the original installation (original time plus 25%), then it passes.
Alternatively, the city, in its discretion, may use the manufacturer’s
recommended standards or verification process to determine if the pervious
pavers or pavement may be certified.
         (c)   After three years, the property owner shall conduct the same 15
minute saturation test and measure how long it takes water to enter the
observation port. If the water shows up with an allowable variance from the
original installation (original time plus 25%), then it passes, and another
certification is conducted in three years. Each recertification must pass the
saturation test with original time plus 25%. If it does not pass, then the
surface must be rehabilitated (i.e. cleaned/vacuumed) based on the
manufacturer’s recommendations, then rechecked upon completion of
rehabilitation. Alternatively, the city, in its discretion, may use the
manufacturer’s recommended standards or verification process to determine if
the pervious pavers or pavement may be certified. Subsequently, the property
must be recertified one year from the date that the pervious pavers or pavement
were rehabilitated. Thereafter, if the property passes the inspection, the
property shall be recertified three years from the date of that inspection.
         (d)   Notwithstanding the certification schedule described above,
pervious pavers or pavement must be recertified any time the property is sold
or transferred to a new owner.
      (4)   Administrative penalty. Any person who violates any provision of
this section or fails to certify or recertify pervious pavers or pavement shall
face a presumptive administrative civil penalty of $100 for a first violation,
$300 for second violation, and $500 for each violation thereafter. Appeals of
an administrative civil penalty issued pursuant to this section shall be heard
in accordance with the procedure set forth in §
10.98 of this code.
      (5)   Other penalties. Any person who violates any provision of this
section or fails to certify or recertify pervious pavers or pavement is guilty
of a misdemeanor offense and upon conviction shall be according to the
Minnesota Statute for misdemeanor offenses. The imposition of an administrative
penalty does not prevent the city from exercising its discretion to initiate
criminal charges or civil court actions.
   (C)   Story calculations. The following standards shall apply for all
apartment, mixed-use, and non-residential structures in the R-3, R-4, and CBD
Districts:
      (1)   Ground floor height must be no less than 12 feet.
      (2)   Ground floor height is limited to 20 feet, above which it counts as
an additional story.
      (3)   Stories above the ground floor are limited to 14 feet in height.

   (D)   Principal structures.
      (1)   Only one principal structure shall be located, erected, or moved
onto a lot in the R-1 and R-2 Residential Zoning Districts.
      (2)   More than one principal structure shall be allowed on a lot for
manufactured home park, medium density residential, medium/high density
residential, business, industrial, and planned unit development uses as long
as:
         (a)   The use specific standards and the standards of the applicable
zoning district can be met.
         (b)   A minimum separation of 10 feet per building is maintained.
         (c)   Individual buildings are not sold independently.
         (d)   Any future subdivision can only occur if setbacks of the zoning
district can be met and easements established as needed.

single-family homes located within the Central Business District.
         (g)   The City Council, after receiving a recommendation from the
Planning Commission, may approve additional building materials on a case-by-
case basis, provided that such materials exhibit the quality and durability
desired and do not detract from the aesthetic character of the building and the
surrounding area.
         (h)   Construction shall follow the approved architectural plans. At
the discretion of the Zoning Administrator, a request to change up to 5% of the
originally approved building materials may be reviewed administratively.
Requests for more significant changes, and requests determined by the Zoning
Administrator to need additional review, shall follow the site plan permit
process identified in §
151.06.12.
      (9)   Building façade transparency.
         (a)   Tinted windows shall be no darker than 20% tint.

      (1)   Regulations, except shoreland regulations listed in Part 151.03.2
Shoreland Overlay District, may be modified expressly by conditions imposed by
the Council at the time of rezoning to PUD or by the adoption of development
plans that establish standards for the PUD; and
      (2)   In the case of districts rezoned to “PUD Mixed,” the Council shall
specify regulations applicable to uses and structures in various parts of the
district.
(Ord. 20220120-01, passed 1-20-22)
§ 151.03.13 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   (A)   Minimum area. A PUD shall have a minimum area of one acre, excluding
wetlands, land lying below the ordinary high water level of any lake, and
existing rights-of-way unless. At the discretion of the City Council, the city
may consider a PUD with less than one acre if one of the following conditions
exist:
      (1)   There are unusual physical features of the property or of the
surrounding neighborhood such that development as a PUD will conserve a
physical or terrain feature of importance to the neighborhood or community;
      (2)   The property is directly adjacent to or across a public right-of-
way from property that previously was developed as a PUD and the new PUD will
be perceived as and function as an extension of that previously approved
development; or
      (3)   The property is located in a transitional area between different
land uses and development will be used as a buffer between the uses.
   (B)   Overall density.
      (1)   Within a PUD, overall density for residential developments shall be
consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and the Shoreland Overlay District
regulations.
      (2)   Individual buildings or lots within a PUD may exceed these
standards, provided that density for the entire PUD does not exceed the
permitted standards. Dwelling units or sites may be clustered into one or more
groups.
   (C)   Allowed uses. Each PUD shall be used for the use for which the site is
designated in the Comprehensive Plan. A PUD may not contain uses which,
according to the city’s underlying districts, are not allowed anywhere in the
city. The city may permit up to 25% of the gross floor area of all buildings in
a PUD to be used for land uses for which the site is not designated in the
Comprehensive Plan if the City Council finds that such use is in the best
interests of the city and is consistent with the requirements of this section.
   (D)   The various setback and height regulations of the most closely related
underlying zoning district shall be considered presumptively appropriate, but
may be departed from in order to accomplish the purposes described in this
section.
   (E)   The city may allow more than one principal building to be constructed
on each platted lot within a PUD as long as the buildings are separated by at
least 15 feet.
   (F)   Open space. PUDs must contain open space meeting all of the following
criteria. PUDs located in the Shoreland Overlay District must meet the criteria
identified in §
151.03.14 PUDs in Shoreland Areas.
      (1)   Each residential PUD shall provide at least 300 square feet per
unit of usable open space.
      (2)   PUDs without residential uses shall provide central area(s) or
feature(s) such as a patio with seating, pedestrian plaza with benches, water
features, and/or other designated areas or focal points. The size of this area
shall be no smaller than 3% of the total PUD area. All such areas shall be
openly accessible to the public, connected to any public or private sidewalk
system, and designed with materials compatible with the building and remainder
of the site. The central area(s) or feature(s) shall be maintained over the
life of the development.
      (3)    For PUDs with both residential and non-residential uses,
subsection (F)(1) of this section shall apply to the residential portion of the
PUD while subsection (F)(2) of this section shall be used to calculate the
appropriate amount of open space for the non-residential portion.
      (4)   Road rights-of-way or land covered by road surfaces, parking areas,
structures or footprints reserved for future structures are developed areas and
shall not be included in the computation of minimum open space.
      (5)   Open space must include areas with physical characteristics
unsuitable for development in their natural state, and areas containing
significant historic sites such as unplatted cemeteries.
      (6)   Open space may include pervious outdoor recreation facilities for
use by owners of dwelling units or sites, by customers/guests in commercial
PUDs and by the general public.
   (G)   Open space preservation. Deed restrictions, covenants, permanent
easements, public dedication and acceptance or other equally effective and
permanent means must be provided to ensure long term preservation and
maintenance of open space.
   (H)   Impervious surface requirements. The impervious surface requirements
of PUDs shall not exceed that of the underlying zoning district or §
151.03.22 if the PUD is in a shoreland area.
   (I)   All property to be included within a PUD shall be under unified
ownership or control and subject to legal restrictions or covenants as may be
necessary to ensure compliance with the approved development plan and site
plan.
   (J)   The uniqueness of each PUD requires that specifications and standards
for streets, utilities, public facilities and the approval of land subdivision
may be subject to modifications from the city ordinances generally governing
them. The City Council, may, therefore, approve streets, utilities, public
facilities and land subdivisions which are not in compliance with usual
specifications or ordinance requirements.
   (K)   Homeowners association. Unless an equally effective alternative
community framework is established and approved by the city, all residential
PUDs that include common ownership or common maintenance elements must use an
owners’ association with the following features:
      (1)   Membership must be mandatory for each dwelling unit or site
purchaser and owner.
      (2)   Each member must pay a pro rata share of the association’s
expenses. Unpaid assessments shall become liens on units or sites.
      (3)   Assessments must be adjustable for changing conditions.
      (4)   The association must be responsible for insurance, taxes and
maintenance of all commonly-owned property and facilities.
      (5)   All stormwater management facilities within the PUD shall be owned
and maintained by the homeowners association. The homeowners association must
have a signed maintenance agreement on file at the city outlining the minimum
maintenance activities for all stormwater management devices.
(Ord. 20220120-01, passed 1-20-22)
§ 151.03.14 PUDS IN SHORELAND AREAS.
   (A)   Types permissible. PUDs located within 1,000 feet of any lake within
the city are allowed for new projects on undeveloped land, redevelopment of
previously built sites or conversions of existing buildings and land.
   (B)   Processing. PUDs in the Shoreland Overlay District must meet the
following requirements in addition to all those outlined elsewhere in city’s
zoning and subdivision regulations. When there is a conflict in requirements,
the more stringent of the requirements shall be applied.
      (1)    In order for a residential PUD in a shoreland area to be
processed, the proposed project must have at least five dwelling units or have
a total project area of at least 50,000 square feet for a general development
lake; 75,000 square feet for a recreational development lake; and 100,000
square feet for a natural environment lake. Determination of allowable
densities shall be determined by subsections (C) and (D) of this section.
      (2)   PUDs must be processed as conditional uses. Approval cannot occur
until the appropriate environmental review is complete, if applicable.
      (3)   A property owner’s association agreement (for residential PUDs)
with mandatory membership must be submitted and approved by the city prior to
final approval of the proposal. The agreement shall be in compliance with all
provisions of this section.
      (4)   Deed restrictions, covenants, permanent easements or other
instruments shall be created and approved by the city that:
         (a)   Properly address future vegetative and topographic alterations,
construction of additional buildings, beaching of watercraft and construction
of commercial buildings in PUDs where allowed; and
         (b)   Ensure the long term preservation and maintenance of open space
in accordance with the criteria and analysis, specified in §
151.03.13 Development Standards.
   (C)   Site “suitable area” evaluation. Proposed new or expansions to
existing PUDs must be evaluated using the following procedures and standards to
determine the suitable area for the dwelling unit/dwelling site density
evaluation in subsection (D) of this section.
      (1)   The project parcel must be divided into tiers by locating one or
more lines approximately parallel to a line that identifies the ordinary high
water level (OHW) at the following intervals and proceeding landward:
Table 151.03.01 Shoreland Tier Dimensions
 
Shoreland Tier Dimensions
General Development Lake      First Tier      200 feet
General Development Lake      All other tiers 200 feet
Recreational Development Lake All tiers       267 feet
 
      (2)   The suitable area within each tier is next calculated by excluding
from the tier area all wetlands, bluffs or land below the OHW of public waters.
This suitable area and the proposed project are then subjected to either the
residential or commercial PUD density evaluation steps to arrive at an
allowable number of dwelling units or sites.
   (D)   Density evaluation. The procedures for determining the “base” density
of a PUD and density increase multipliers are as follows.
      (1)   Allowable densities may be transferred from any tier to another
tier further from the water body, but must not be transferred to any other tier
closer to the waterbody.
      (2)   When a PUD is a combined commercial and residential development,
the site plan and/or plat must indicate and distinguish which buildings and
portions of the project area are residential, commercial, or a combination of
the two.
      (3)   Residential PUD “base” density evaluation.
         (a)   The suitable area within each tier is divided by the single
residential lot size standard to yield a base density of dwelling units or
sites for each tier.
         (b)    Proposed locations and numbers of the base number of dwelling
units or sites for the residential PUD are then evaluated to determine whether
the tiers and suitable area can support these units while meeting the required
design criteria in subsections (F) and (G) of this section.
      (4)   Commercial PUD “base” density evaluation.
         (a)   Determine the average inside living area size of dwelling units
or sites within each tier, including both existing and proposed units and sites
(computation of inside living area sizes need not include decks, patios,
stoops, steps, garages, porches, or basements unless the basements are a
habitable space);
         (b)   Select the appropriate floor area ratio from the following
table:
Table 151.03.02 Commercial Floor Area Ratios
Commercial Floor Area Ratios*
Average Unit Floor Area General Development Lake Recreational Development Lake
Commercial Floor Area Ratios*
Average Unit Floor Area General Development Lake Recreational Development Lake

1,500 sq. ft.           0.150                    0.075
*For average unit floor areas less than shown, use the floor area ratios
listed for 200 sq. ft. For areas greater than shown, use the ratios listed for
1,500 sq. ft. For recreational camping areas, use the ratios listed at 400 sq.
ft. Manufactured home sites in recreational camping areas shall use a ratio
equal to the ratios listed for 1,000 sq. ft.
 
         (c)   Multiply the suitable area within each tier by the floor area
ratio to yield total floor area for each tier allowed to be used for dwelling
units or sites;
         (d)    Divide the total floor area by tier computed in subsection (D)
(4)(c) of this section by the average inside living area size determined in
subsection (D)(4)(a) of this section (this yields a base number of dwelling
units and sites for each tier); and
         (e)   Proposed locations and numbers of dwelling units or sites for
commercial PUDs are then evaluated to determine whether the tiers and suitable
area can support these units while meeting the required design criteria in
subsections (F) and (G) of this section.
   (E)   Density increase multipliers.
      (1)   The allowable density increase in subsection (E)(2) of this section
will only be allowed if structure setbacks from the OHW are increased to at
least 50% greater than the minimum setback, or the impact on the waterbody is
reduced an equivalent amount through vegetative management, topography, or
additional means, and the setback is at least 25% greater than the minimum
setback.
      (2)   Allowable dwelling unit or dwelling site density increases for
residential or commercial PUDs:
Table 151.03.03 Density Increases
 
Maximum Density Increase by Tier
First  50%
Second 100%
Third  200%
Fourth 200%
Fifth  200%
 
   (F)   Maintenance and design criteria,
      (1)   Maintenance and administration requirements. Before final approval
of a PUD in a Shoreland District, adequate provisions must be developed for
preservation and maintenance in perpetuity of open spaces and for the continued
existence and functioning of the development.
      (2)   Open space criteria. PUDs in shoreland areas must contain open
space, which shall meet all of the following criteria:
         (a)   Open space must constitute at least 50% of the total project
area and must include:
            1.   Areas with physical characteristics unsuitable for development
in their natural state.
            2.   Areas containing significant historic sites or unplatted
cemeteries.
            3.   Portions of the Shore Impact Zone preserved in its natural
state or existing states as follows:
               a.   For existing residential PUDs, at least 50% of the Shore
Impact Zone.
               b.   For new residential PUDs, at least 70% of the Shore Impact
Zone.
               c.   For all commercial PUDs, at least 50% of the Shore Impact
Zone.
         (b)   Open space may include:
            1.   Outdoor recreational facilities for use by owners of dwelling
units or sites, by guests staying in commercial dwellings or sites, and by the
general public;
            2.   Subsurface sewage treatment systems if the use of the space is
restricted to avoid adverse impacts on the systems; and
            3.   Wetlands that are not designated public waters.
         (c)   Open space shall not include:
            1.   Structures, portions of a structure, or other shelter designed
as short or long-term living quarters for one or more persons. This includes
all residential dwellings and rental or timeshare accommodations such as motel,
hotel, and resort rooms, and cabins; or
            2.   Road rights-of-way or land covered by road surfaces and
parking areas; or
            3.   Land below the OHW of public waters; or
            4.   Commercial facilities or uses; or
            5.   Locations or sites used for residential use by one or more
persons using temporary or movable shelter, including camping and recreational
vehicle sites; or
            6.   Footprints or designated portions of the site intended for
future structure, road, or parking development if the PUD is phased.
         (d)   The appearance of open space areas, including topography,
vegetation, and allowable uses, must be preserved by use of restrictive deed
covenants, permanent easements, public dedication, and acceptance or other
equally effective and permanent means.
   (G)   General design standards.
      (1)   All habitable structures within the PUD shall be serviced by one of
the following:
         (a)   City-owned water and sewer systems.
         (b)   Community, on-site water supply and sewage treatment systems.
These must be centralized and meet the standards of §
151.03.27 Public and Private Utilities. Sewage treatment systems must meet the
setback requirements of §
151.03.22 Requirements for Sewered and Unsewered Areas.
      (2)    Dwelling units or sites must be clustered into one or more groups
and located on suitable areas of the development. They must be designed and
located to meet or exceed the following dimensional standards for the relevant
shoreland classification: setback form the OHW, setbacks from bluffs, elevation
above the surface water features, and maximum height. Setbacks from the OHW
must be increased in accordance with subsection (E) of this section for
developments with density increases.
      (3)   Water-oriented accessory structures and facilities may be allowed
if they meet or exceed design standards contained in §
151.03.22 and are centralized.
      (4)   Shore recreation facilities, including but not limited to swimming
areas, docks and watercraft mooring areas, and launching ramps, must be
centralized and located in suitable areas approved by the city. Evaluation of
suitability must include consideration of land slope, water depth, vegetation,
soils, depth to groundwater and bedrock, compatibility with adjacent land uses
and other relevant factors.
      (5)   One launching ramp facility may be provided for use only by
occupants of dwelling units in the PUD. A launching ramp is a conditional use
and is dependent upon site characteristics as well as numbers of launching
ramps on the body of water. Where shore recreation facilities including
launching ramps and docks have been installed, the requirements of this section
shall not preclude continued use of such launching ramp or docks subject to
approval of a conditional use permit.
      (6)   Lake access outlots which meet or exceed the following standards
are intended as controlled accesses to public waters or recreation areas for
use only by owners of nonriparian lots within the PUD:
         (a)   Lake access outlots or access easements must meet the width and
size requirements for residential lots, and be suitable for the intended uses
of lake access outlots or access easements. Docking or mooring of watercraft is
allowed at an access outlot or access easement, subject to provisions of §
151.03.25(B);
         (b)   Lake access outlots must be jointly owned by all purchasers of
lots in the subdivision or by all purchasers of nonriparian lots in the
subdivision who are provided riparian access rights on the controlled access
lot;
         (c)   Covenants or other equally effective legal instruments may be
developed that specify which lot owners have authority to use the lake access
outlot or access easement and what activities are allowed. The activities may
include watercraft loading, beaching, mooring, or docking. They may also
include other outdoor recreational activities that do not significantly
conflict with general public use of the public water or the enjoyment of normal
property rights by adjacent property owners. Examples of the non-significant
conflict activities include swimming, sunbathing, or picnicking. The covenants
may limit the total number of vehicles allowed to be parked and the total
number of watercraft allowed to be moored or docked, and may require
centralization of all common facilities and activities in the most suitable
locations on the lot to minimize topographic and vegetation alterations. The
covenants may also require all parking areas, storage buildings, and other
facilities to be screened by vegetation or topography as much as practical from
view from the public water, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions. In no case
shall covenant provisions be less restrictive than provisions of this section
or any other city ordinance;
         (d)   Dock lighting shall be allowed provided such lighting is not
directed toward the lake in such a manner that it impairs the vision of or
confuses operators of watercraft. No oscillating, rotating, flashing, or moving
sign or light may be used on any dock. No light shall shine on neighboring lots
in excess of 0.4 footcandles; and
         (e)    The Planning Commission and City Council may waive or vary any
of the requirements in subsection (G)(6) of this section based on the nature of
the property or a demonstrated unique need associated with the property.
      (7)   Structures, parking areas, and other facilities must be treated to
reduce visibility as viewed from public waters and adjacent shore lands by
vegetation, topography, increased setbacks, color or other means, assuming
summer, leaf-on conditions. Vegetative and topographic screening must be
preserved, if existing, or may be required to be provided.
   (H)   Conversions. Existing resorts, mobile home courts or other land uses
and facilities may be converted to residential PUDs if all of the following
standards are met:
      (1)   Proposed conversions must be initially evaluated using the same
procedures for residential PUDs involving all new constructing. Inconsistencies
between existing features of the development and these standards must be
identified.
      (2)   Deficiencies involving water supply and sewage treatment, structure
visibility, impervious surface coverage, open space, and shore recreation
facilities must be corrected as part of the conversion or as specified in the
conditional use permit.
      (3)   Shore and Bluff Impact Zone deficiencies must be evaluated and
reasonable improvements made as part of the conversion. These improvements must
include, where applicable, the following:
         (a)   Removal of extraneous buildings, docks, or other facilities that
no longer need to be located in shore or Bluff Impact Zones;
         (b)   Remedial measures to correct erosion sites and improve
vegetative cover and screening of buildings and other facilities as viewed from
the water;
         (c)   If existing dwelling units are located in shore or Bluff Impact
Zones, conditions are attached to approvals of conversions that preclude
exterior expansions in any dimension or substantial alterations; or
         (d)   The conditions must also provide for future relocation of
dwelling units, where feasible, to other locations, meeting all setback and
elevation requirements when they are rebuilt or replaced.
      (4)    Existing dwelling unit or dwelling site densities that exceed
standards in subsections (D) or (E) of this section may be allowed to continue
but must not be allowed to be increased, either at the time of conversion or in
the future. Efforts must be made during the conversion to limit impacts of high
densities by requiring seasonal use, improving vegetative screening,
centralizing shore recreation facilities, or other means.
   (I)   Exemptions. If less than 10% of the land in a proposed PUD project is
located in the city's Shoreland Overlay District and does not abut any public
waters, the State Department of Natural Resources may, in writing, determine
that the city's Shoreland PUD requirements need not be applied to the
development.
   (J)   Fee. The processing fee for a PUD shall be set by a motion adopted by
the Council and reviewed annually.
   (K)   Evaluation criteria. In addition to the guidelines provided elsewhere
in the city ordinances, the City Council shall evaluate a PUD in the shoreland
area using the following criteria:
      (1)   Existing recreational use of the surface water and likely increases
in use associated with planned unit developments;
      (2)   Physical and aesthetic impacts of increased density;
      (3)   Suitability of lands for the planned unit development approach;
      (4)   Level of current development in the area; and
      (5)   Amounts and types of ownership of undeveloped lands.

      (2)   The boundaries of the district may be reduced as indicated on the
city's Shoreland Overlay District Map, if approved by the Commissioner of
Natural Resources.
   (F)   Classification. The surface waters affected by this chapter and which
require controlled development of their Shoreland Overlay District are shown on
the map designated as the Shoreland Overlay District Map which is properly
approved and made a part thereof. Surface waters generally greater than ten
acres, and given an identification number by the state are listed herein. Other
surface waters affected by this part, generally having less than ten acres, are
classified as wetland systems and thus regulated by Chisago County. Where the
boundaries of the district are in question, the Board of Adjustment shall make
the necessary interpretation. If any boundary is disputed, the burden of proof
shall rest with the applicant.

   (C)   Height. The maximum building structure height shall follow the
individual district requirements of the base zoning district.
   (D)   Placement of structures and sewage treatment systems on lots. When
more than one setback applies to a site, structures and facilities must be
located to meet all setbacks.
      (1)    Buildings, including all structures such as decks, must have a
setback of 30 feet from the top of any bluff and a setback from the ordinary
high water level (OHW) as follows:
Table 151.03.06. Setbacks (in feet) from Ordinary High Water Level

      (2)   No structure, except stairways and landings, may be placed within
Bluff Impact Zones.
   (E)   Setbacks from roads/rights-of-way. Any structure abutting a county or
state highway must meet the setback required by the controlling county or state
authority for that parcel. The building setback in residential districts shall
be a minimum of 30 feet from state, federal, or county roads and city street
rights-of-way.
   (F)   Design criteria for structures.
      (1)   High water elevations. Structures must be placed in accordance with
all floodplain regulations applicable to the site. Where these controls do not
exist, the elevation to which the lowest floor, including basement, is placed
or flood-proofed must be determined as follows:
         (a)    The lowest floor shall be no lower in elevation than a level at
least three feet above the OHW of any riparian lake or the highest known
elevation of any other riparian water body.
         (b)   Water-oriented accessory structures may have the lowest floor
placed lower than the elevation determined in subsection (F)(1)(a) of this
section if the structure is constructed of flood-resistant materials to the
elevation, electrical, and mechanical equipment is placed above the elevation
and, if long duration flooding is anticipated, the structure is built to
withstand ice action, wind driven waves, and debris.
      (2)   Water oriented accessory structures. Each lot may have one water-
oriented accessory structure not meet normal structure setback set forth in
this chapter provided the water-oriented accessory structure complies with the
following provisions:
         (a)   The structure or facility shall not exceed ten feet in height,
exclusive of safety rails and cannot occupy an area greater than 250 square
feet. The structure or facility may include detached decks not exceeding eight
feet above grade at any point or at-grade patios.
         (b)   The structure or facility is not in the Bluff Impact Zone.
         (c)   The setback of the structure or facility from the OHW must be at
least ten feet.
         (d)   The structure is not a boathouse or a boat storage structure.
         (e)   The structure or facility must be treated to reduce visibility
as viewed from public waters and adjacent shorelands by vegetation, topography,
increased setbacks, color, or other means acceptable to the city, assuming
summer, leaf-on conditions.
         (f)   Roofs of structures may be used as an open-air deck with safety
rails, but must not be enclosed or used as a storage area.
         (g)   The structure or facility must not be designed or used for human
habitation and must not contain water supply or sewage treatment facilities.
         (h)   The owner or occupant of any riparian lot may have one fish
house in addition to the one water-oriented accessory structure allowed by the
provisions of this division without obtaining a variance. The fish house must
display a current state fish house license issued to that fish house in order
to qualify for this exemption. Only one of the two structures may be located in
the Shoreland Impact Zone.
      (3)   Stairways, lifts, and landings. Stairways and lifts are the
preferred alternative to major topographic alterations for achieving access up
and down bluffs and steep slopes to shore areas. Stairways and lifts must meet
the following design requirements:
         (a)   Stairways and lifts must not exceed four feet in width on
residential lots. Wider stairways may be used for commercial properties, public
open space recreational properties and planned unit developments.
         (b)   Landings for stairways and lifts on residential lots must not
exceed 32 square feet in area. Landings larger than 32 square feet may be used
for commercial properties, public open-space recreational properties, and
planned unit developments.
         (c)   Canopies or roofs are not allowed on stairways, lifts, or
landings.
         (d)   Stairways, lifts and landings may be either constructed above
the ground on posts or pilings or placed into the ground, provided they are
designed and built in a manner that ensures control of soil erosion.
         (e)   Stairways, lifts and landings must be located in the most
visually inconspicuous portions of lots, as viewed from the surface of the
public water assuming summer, leaf-on conditions, whenever practical.
         (f)   Facilities such as ramps, lifts or mobility paths for physically
disabled persons are also allowed for achieving access to shore areas, provided
that the dimensional and performance standards of this section are met and the
facilities comply with Minn. Admin. Rules Chapter 1341.
      (4)   Decks. Except as provided herein, decks must meet the structure
setback standards. Decks that do not meet setback requirements from public
waters may be allowed without a variance to be added to structures existing on
the date the shoreland structure setbacks were established by ordinance, if all
of the following criteria and standards are met:
         (a)   A thorough evaluation of the property and structure reveals no
reasonable location for a deck meeting or exceeding the existing OHW setback of
the structure;
         (b)   The deck encroachment toward the OHW does not exceed 15% of the
existing shoreline setback of the existing structure from the OHW or does not
encroach closer than 30 feet, whichever is more restrictive; and
         (c)   The deck is constructed primarily of wood and is not roofed or
screened.
      (5)   Access lots. Access lots, which are intended as controlled accesses
to public waters or recreation areas for use by owners of non-riparian lots
within subdivisions must meet or exceed the following standards:
         (a)   They must meet the width and size requirements for residential
lots and be suitable for the intended uses of controlled access lots.
         (b)   They must be jointly owned by all purchasers of lots in the
subdivision or by all purchasers of non-riparian lots in the subdivision who
are provided riparian access rights on the access lot.
         (c)   Covenants or other equally effective legal instruments may be
developed that specify which lot owners have authority to use the access lot
and what activities are allowed. The activities may include watercraft
launching, loading, beaching, mooring or docking. They may also include other
outdoor recreational activities that do not significantly conflict with general
public use of the public water or the enjoyment of normal property rights by
adjacent property owners. Examples of the non-significant conflict activities
include swimming, sunbathing, or picnicking. The covenants may limit the total
number of vehicles allowed to be parked and the total number of watercraft
allowed to be moored or docked and may require centralization of all common
facilities and activities in the most suitable locations on the lot to minimize
topographic and vegetation alterations. They may also require all parking
areas, storage buildings, and other facilities to be screened by vegetation or
topography as much as practical from view from the public water, assuming
summer, leaf-on conditions. In no case shall covenant provisions be less
restrictive than provisions of this section or any other city ordinance.
      (6)   Placement, design, and heights of structures. When more than one
setback applies to a site, structures and facilities must be located to meet
all setbacks. Where structures exist on the adjoining lots on both sides of a
proposed building site, structure setbacks may be altered without a variance to
conform to the adjoining setbacks from the OHW, provided the proposed building
site is not located in a Shore Impact Zone or in a Bluff Impact Zone.
Structures may not be located closer than 30 feet to the top of any bluff.
      (7)   Steep slopes. The Building Official must evaluate possible soil
erosion impacts and development visibility from public waters before issuing a
permit for construction of sewage treatment systems, roads, driveways,
structures, or other improvements on steep slopes. When determined necessary,
conditions must be attached to issued permits to prevent erosion, significant
viewscape impact, and to preserve existing vegetative screening from
structures, vehicles and other facilities as viewed to and from the surface of
public waters, assuming summer, leaf-on vegetation.
      (8)   Impervious surface. No lot shall be covered by more than 25%
impervious surface. This standard shall not apply for uses in the CBD, B-1, B-
2, or I-1 Districts if the proposed use either causes no increase in surface
water discharge or if all discharges are accommodated by a surface water
management system or program approved by the city.
   (G)   Certification upon completion.
      (1)   Upon completion of any structure which was constructed or cited in
a designated flood hazard area, the permittee shall provide the Zoning
Administrator with certification of the as-built first floor elevation data and
maintain an on-going record thereof.
      (2)   All A-zones as shown on the flood insurance rate map of the city
are hereby designated as the flood hazard areas of the city.
(Ord. 20220120-01, passed 1-20-22; Am. Ord. 20220421-01, passed 4-21-22)
§ 151.03.23 SHORELAND ALTERATIONS.
   (A)   Vegetative alterations. Alterations of vegetation and topography must
be controlled by local governments to prevent erosion into public waters, fix
nutrients, preserve shoreland aesthetics, preserve historic values, prevent
bank slumping and protect fish and wildlife habitat.
      (1)   Exemptions. Vegetative alterations and excavations or grading and
filling necessary for the construction of structures and sewage treatment
systems under validly issued permits for these facilities are exempt from the
vegetative alteration standards in this section and separate permit
requirements for grading and filling. However, the grading and filling
conditions of this section must be met for issuance of permits for structures
and sewage treatment systems. Public roads and parking areas, as regulated
hereby are exempt from the provisions of this section.
      (2)   Removal or alterations of vegetation. Except for forest management
or agricultural uses as provided for herein, removal or alterations of
vegetation is allowed according to the following standards:
         (a)   Intensive vegetation clearing within the Shore and Bluff Impact
Zones and on steep slopes is not allowed. Intensive vegetation clearing outside
of these areas is allowed if the activity is consistent with the forest
management standards herein.
         (b)   Limited clearing of trees and shrubs and cutting, pruning, and
trimming of trees to accommodate the placement of stairways and landings,
picnic areas, access paths, livestock watering areas, beach and watercraft
access areas and permitted water-oriented accessory structures or facilities,
as well as providing a view to the water from the principal dwelling site, in
Shore and Bluff Impact Zones and on steep slopes is allowed, provided that:
            1.   The screening of structures, vehicles or other facilities as
viewed from the water, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions, is not
substantially reduced;
            2.   Along rivers, existing shading of water surfaces is preserved;
            3.   The above provisions are not applicable to the removal of
trees, limbs or branches that are dead, diseased or pose safety hazards; and
            4.   The city's tree preservation regulations in Part 151.03.5 must
be followed.
         (c)   Use of fertilizer and pesticides in the Shoreland Overlay
District must be done in a way as to minimize runoff into the Shore Impact Zone
or public water by the use of earth, vegetation or both.
   (B)   Grading or filling. Before grading or filling on steep slopes or
within Shore or Bluff Impact Zones involving the movement of more than ten
cubic yards of material or anywhere else in a shoreland area involving movement
of more than 50 cubic yards of material, it must be established by local
official permit issuance that all of the following conditions will be met. The
following conditions must also be considered during land use, subdivision, and
building permit reviews.
      (1)   Before authorizing any grading or filling activity in any Type 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 wetland, local officials must consider how extensively the
proposed activity would affect the following functional qualities of the
wetland:
         (a)   Sediment and pollutant trapping and retention;
         (b)   Storage of surface runoff to prevent or reduce flood damage;
         (c)   Fish and wildlife habitat;
         (d)   Recreational use;
         (e)   Shoreline or bank stabilization; or
         (f)   Noteworthiness, including special qualities such as historic
significance, critical habitat for endangered plants and animals or others.
      (2)   This evaluation must also include a determination of whether the
wetland alteration being proposed requires permits, reviews or approvals by
other local, state or federal agencies such as a watershed district, Chisago
County, Minnesota Department of Natural Resources or the United States Army
Corps of Engineers.
      (3)   Alterations must be designed and conducted in a manner that ensures
only the smallest amount of bare ground is exposed for the shortest time
possible.
      (4)   Mulches or similar materials must be used, where necessary, for
temporary bare soil coverage and a permanent vegetation cover must be
established as soon as possible.
      (5)   Methods to minimize soil erosion and to trap sediments before they
reach any surface water feature must be used.
      (6)   Areas must be stabilized to acceptable erosion control standards
consistent with the field office technical guides of the local soil and water
conservation districts and the U.S. Soil Conservation Service.
      (7)   Fill or excavated material must not be placed in a manner that
creates an unstable slope.
      (8)   Plans to place fill or excavated material on steep slopes must be
reviewed by qualified professionals for continued slope stability and must not
create finished slopes of 30% or greater.
      (9)   Fill or excavated material must not be placed in Bluff Impact
Zones.
      (10)    Any alterations below the OHW of public waters must first be
authorized by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.
      (11)   Alterations of topography must only be allowed if they are
accessory to permitted or conditional uses and do not adversely affect adjacent
or nearby properties.
      (12)   Placement of natural rock riprap, including associated grading of
the shoreline and placement of a filter blanket is permitted if the finished
slope does not exceed three feet horizontal to one foot vertical, the landward
extent of the riprap is within ten feet of the OHW, and the height of the
riprap above the OHW does not exceed three feet.
      (13)   All activity must also comply with
Division 152.04 Stormwater Management.
   (C)   Connections to public waters. Excavations where the intended purpose
is connection to a public water, such as boat slips, canals, lagoons and
harbors, must be controlled by local shoreland controls. Permission for
excavations may be given only after the Minnesota Department of Natural
Resources has approved the proposed connection to public waters.
(Ord. 20220120-01, passed 1-20-22)
§ 151.03.24 ROADS, DRIVEWAYS, AND PARKING AREAS.
   (A)   Placement and design of roads, driveways, and parking areas. Public
and private roads, driveways, and parking areas must be designed to take
advantage of natural vegetation and topography to achieve maximum screening
from view from public waters. They must be designed and constructed to minimize
and control erosion to public waters consistent with the field office technical
guides of the local soil and water conservation district or other applicable
technical materials.
   (B)   Roads, driveways, and parking areas must meet structure setbacks and
must not be placed within Bluff and Shore Impact Zones, when other reasonable
and feasible placement alternatives exist. If no alternatives exist, they may
be placed within these areas and must be designed to minimize adverse impacts.
   (C)   Public and private watercraft access ramps, approach roads and access-
related parking areas may be placed within Shore Impact Zones provided the
vegetation, screenings and erosion control conditions of this section are met.
For private facilities, the grading and filling provisions hereof must also be
met.
   (D)   Paving permit required.
      (1)   Purpose. In order to facilitate this section, the city shall
require an impervious surface permit demonstrating that projects involving the
installation of impervious materials are in compliance with the provisions of
the impervious surface requirements as stated in §
151.02.31 General Provisions.
      (2)   Permit required. No person, firm, corporation, company or other
entity (public or private) shall cause the placement of asphalt, concrete or
other impervious material within the city without first obtaining a paving
permit and/or all other required permits from the city and other appropriate
entities.
      (3)   Application. Unless otherwise regulated herein, any person, firm,
corporation, company or public entity shall fill out an application, provided
by the city, for a permit to place impervious materials for driveways,
sidewalks, pathways, parking areas and other uses within the city. The
application shall be reviewed by the city. If the project is found to be in
compliance with the impervious surface requirements, the city may issue a
permit allowing the work to be accomplished.
      (4)   Liability. Any project approved should be constructed as to have
minimal impact on adjacent property. Efforts shall be taken to keep all runoff
from the project area on the subject property until it can outflow to a public
drainageway.
      (5)   Fees. The fee for the application shall be set by motion of the
City Council. For minor projects, the fee may be waived.
      (6)   Projects not covered. A permit is not required for the normal care
and maintenance of an existing impervious surface so long as the square footage
of the surface is not increased.
   (E)   Parking lots, excluding entrance/exit drives, may not be constructed
closer than three feet from the property line.
(Ord. 20220120-01, passed 1-20-22)
§ 151.03.25 DOCKS, LIFTS, AND OTHER MOORING STRUCTURES OR FACILITIES.
   Docks, lifts, other mooring structures or facilities, and marinas other than
those owned or operated by the state or a political subdivision, may be
constructed or placed when allowed in accordance with state law, other
provisions of this Code and the following provisions:
   (A)   Single-family lots. Docks, lifts, or other mooring structures located
on single-family lots do not need a permit from the city, but must meet the
following requirements:
      (1)   Only one dock, lift, or other mooring structure is permitted on
each lot;
      (2)   Structures may be no wider than six feet, which shall be measured
at the width of the major running length of the dock;

than one may be registered to other than a family member);
      (6)   Rental of slips is not allowed;
      (7)   Must be removed before freeze-up;
      (8)   In no case shall easements be allowed for docks or mooring
structures. Docks or mooring facilities are allowed only on approved single-
family lots;
      (9)   It is not the intent of this section to discontinue use of docks
after they have been removed for the winter. However, the landowner shall make
every effort to comply with the requirements of this section. In no case shall
a landowner not be allowed to place his or her dock back in the water; and
      (10)   Except as modified by the above requirements, all other provisions
of Minn. Admin. Rules 6115.0210 shall apply.
   (B)   PUDs.
      (1)   The number of allowable dwelling sites in the first tier as
determined by §
151.03.14(C) shall be used as a basis for determining the number of mooring
slips allowed as follows:
         (a)   If the number of dwelling sites allowed in the first tier is
four or fewer, the PUD is allowed one centralized dock, lift, or mooring
structure with a maximum of four mooring slips.
         (b)   If the number of dwelling sites allowed in the first tier is
more than four, the PUD is allowed to have up to the same number of mooring
slips as the maximum number of dwelling sites allowed in the first tier. These
mooring slips shall be centralized into common docks.
      (2)   All docks, lifts, and mooring structures in a PUD are subject to
the following:
         (a)   Docks shall be located so that moored watercraft and equipment
are at least five feet from the extended property line as shown in
Figure 151.03.01;
         (b)   Must be no wider than six feet, which shall be measured at the
width of the major running length of the dock;
         (c)   Must not impede navigation or create a hazard;
         (d)   Must be removed before freeze-up. For extenuating circumstances
or difficult terrain, a dock may be moved as close to the lakeshore as

apply. Considerations of a conditional use permit must include considerations
of lot width, lot depth, land slope, water depth, vegetation, soils, depth to
ground water and bedrock, compatibility with adjacent land uses and/or other
relevant factors.
      (8)   It is not the intent of this section to discontinue use of docks
after they have been removed for the winter. However, the landowner shall make
every effort to comply with the requirements of this section. In no case shall
a landowner not be allowed to place his or her dock back in the water.
   (C)   Non single-family lots.
      (1)   One dock, lift, or mooring structure may be located on lots other
than single-family residential lots and PUDs with a permit and subject to the
following:
         (a)   Docks shall be located so that moored watercraft and equipment
are at least five feet from the extended property line as shown in
Figure 151.03.01;
         (b)   Must be no wider than six feet, which shall be measured at the
width of the major running length of the dock;
         (c)   Must not be used for more than six restricted watercrafts;
         (d)   Must not impede navigation or create a hazard;
         (e)   Must be removed before freeze-up. For extenuating circumstances
or difficult terrain, a dock may be moved as close to the lakeshore as
possible. Any dock left in the water over the winter must be marked with a
reflective material and orange fence for visibility on each side. The
reflective material must measure a total of not less than nine square inches
every six feet on each side of the dock; and
         (f)   Except as modified by the above requirements, all other
provisions of Minn. Rules Part 6115.0210, as may be amended from time to time,
shall apply.
      (2)    Provided the requirements in subsection (C)(1) of this section can
be met, an applicant may apply for an additional dock, lift, or mooring
structures at the time of initial platting or subsequent to plat approval. If
owners apply for additional docks, lifts, or other mooring structures after
initial platting, the conditional use permit process outlined in this chapter
shall apply. It is at the discretion of the Planning Commission and City
Council as to whether to approve additional docks, lifts, or other mooring
structures, and the City Council may place additional conditions on such
facilities as they deem appropriate.
      (3)    Marinas are allowed with a conditional use permit and Minnesota
Department of Natural Resources (DNR) Public Waters Permit and are subject to
the requirements in subsection (C)(1) of this section.
      (4)   Overnight beaching, docking, or continuous mooring of watercraft

§ 151.03.26 USE STANDARDS.
   (A)   Agricultural, forest, and extractive uses. To the extent that these
uses are allowed or permitted within shoreland areas, the following standards
or conditions apply for the particular use.
      (1)   Agriculture.
         (a)   The Shore Impact Zone for parcels with permitted agricultural
land uses is equal to a line parallel to and 50 feet from the ordinary high
water level (OHW).
         (b)   General cultivation farming, grazing, nurseries, horticulture,
truck farming, sod farming and wild crop harvesting, if allowed by this
chapter, must be conducted in a manner to ensure that steep slopes and Shore
and Bluff Impact Zones are maintained in permanent vegetation or operated under
an approved conservation plan consistent with the field office technical guides
of the local soil and water conservation districts or the U.S. Soil
Conservation Service.
         (c)   Animal feedlots, as defined by the State Pollution Control
Agency, where allowed by zoning district designations, must be reviewed as
conditional uses and must meet the following standards:
            1.   New feedlots must not be located in the shoreland of
watercourses or in Bluff Impact Zones and must meet a minimum setback of 300
feet from the OHW of all public waters basins;
            2.   Modifications or expansions to existing feedlots that are
located within 300 feet of the OHW or within a Bluff Impact Zone are allowed if
they do not further encroach into the existing OHW setback or encroach on Bluff
Impact Zones; and
            3.   A certificate of compliance, interim permit or animal feedlot
permit, when required by state law, must be obtained by the owner or operator
of an animal feedlot.
         (d)   Use of fertilizer, pesticides or animal wastes within shorelands
must be done in a way as to minimize impact on the Shore Impact Zone or public
water by proper application or use of earth or vegetation.
      (2)   Forest management. The harvesting of timber and associated
reforestation or conversion of forested use to a non-forested use must be
conducted consistent with the following standards:
         (a)   Timber harvesting and associated reforestation must be conducted
consistent with the provisions of the State Nonpoint Source Pollution
Assessment Forestry and the provisions of Water Quality in Forest Management
Best Management Practices in Minnesota.
         (b)   To the extent permitted by this part or state law, forest land
which is converted to another use requires issuance of a conditional use permit
and adherence to the following standards:
            1.   A Shore or Bluff Impact Zone must not be intensively cleared
of vegetation; and
            2.   An erosion and sediment control plan is developed and approved
by the local soil and water conservation district before issuance of a
conditional use permit for the conversion.
         (c)   Use of fertilizer, pesticides, or animal wastes within
shorelands must be done in a way as to minimize impact on the Shore Impact Zone
or public water by proper application or use of earth or vegetation.
      (3)   Extractive uses. Processing machinery must be located consistent
with setback standards for structures from OHW of public waters and from
bluffs. An extractive use site development and restoration plan must be
developed and approved by the city, and followed over the course of operation
of the site. The plan must address dust, noise, possible pollutant discharges,
hours and duration of operation, and anticipated vegetation and topographic
alterations. It must also identify actions to be taken during operation to
mitigate adverse environmental impacts, particularly erosion and must clearly
explain how the site will be rehabilitated after extractive activities end.
   (B)   Commercial, industrial, public, and semi-public uses.
      (1)   Surface water-oriented commercial uses and industrial, public, or
semipublic uses with similar needs to have access to and use of public waters
may be located on parcels or lots with frontage on public waters. Uses without
water-oriented needs must be located on lots or parcels without public waters
frontage or, if located on lots or parcels with public waters frontage, must
either be set back double the normal OHW setback or be substantially screened
from view from the water by vegetation or topography, assuming summer, leaf-on
conditions.
      (2)   Those with water-oriented needs must meet the following standards:

centralize these facilities and design them to avoid obstructions of navigation
and to be the minimum size necessary to meet the need.
         (c)   Uses that depend on patrons arriving by watercraft may use signs
and lighting to convey needed information to the public, subject to the
following general standards:
            1.   No advertising signs or supporting facilities for signs may be
placed in or upon public waters. Signs conveying information or safety messages
may be placed in or on public waters by a public authority or under a permit
issued by the County Sheriff.
            2.   Signs may be placed, when necessary, within the Shore Impact
Zone if they are designed and sized to be the minimum necessary to convey
needed information. They must only convey the location and name of the
establishment and the general types of goods or services available. The signs
must not contain other detailed information such as product brands and prices,
must not be located higher than ten feet above the ground, and must not exceed
32 square feet in size. If illuminated by artificial lights, the lights must be
shielded or directed to prevent illumination out across public waters.
            3.   Other outside lighting may be located within the Shore Impact
Zone or over public waters if it is used primarily to illuminate potential
safety hazards and is shielded or otherwise directed to prevent direct
illumination out across public waters. This does not preclude use of
navigational lights.

§ 151.03.27 PUBLIC AND PRIVATE UTILITIES.
   (A)   Water supply and sewage treatment.
      (1)   Regulation required. In order to ensure safe and healthful
conditions, to prevent pollution and contamination of surface and ground water
and to guide development compatible with the natural characteristics of
shorelands and related water resources, individual private water supply and
private waste treatment systems and all waste disposal systems and sites shall
be regulated by the provisions of this section and applicable state and federal
regulations.
      (2)   Permit required. No person, firm, or corporation shall install,
alter, repair or extend any private well or sewage treatment system without
first obtaining a permit from the city Zoning Administrator for the specific
installation, alteration, repair or extension.
      (3)   Water supply. Any public or private supply of water for domestic
purposes must meet or exceed standards for water quality of the Minnesota
Department of Health, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, and the city’s
Public Works Design Manual.
      (4)   Sewage treatment. Any premises used for human occupancy must be
provided with an adequate method of sewage treatment, as follows:
         (a)   The city sewer system must be used where available.
         (b)   All private sewage treatment systems must meet or exceed the
latest Minnesota Pollution Control Agency’s standards for individual sewage
treatment systems. Individual Subsurface Sewage Treatment Systems, Minn. Rules
Chapter 7080, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be included in
this part.
         (c)   On-site sewage treatment systems must be set back from the OHW
of any riparian waterbody in accordance with §
151.03.22.
         (d)   Suitability:
            1.   All proposed sites for individual sewage treatment systems
shall be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria listed below.
            2.   If the determination of a site’s suitability cannot be made
with the publicly available existing information, it shall then be the
responsibility of the applicant to provide sufficient soil borings and
percolation tests from on-site field investigations.
               a.   Depth to the highest known or calculated ground water table
or bedrock;
               b.   Soil conditions, properties and permeability;
               c.   Slope; and
               d.   Existence of lowlands, local surface depressions, and rock
outcrops.
      (5)   Nonconforming sanitary systems. All nonconforming water supply,
sewage disposal, and waste disposal facilities and systems shall be brought
into conformance with the provisions of this section as a condition of
receiving any permit, variance, or approval required by state law or local
ordinance.
   (B)   Stormwater management. Stormwater management, as regulated by
Division 152.04, must be considered with all reviews, approvals, and permit
issuances tendered under this part.
      (1)   The following are general standards:
         (a)   When possible, existing natural drainage ways, wetlands and
vegetated soil surfaces must be used to convey, store, filter, and retain
stormwater runoff before discharge to public waters.
         (b)   Development must be planned and conducted in a manner that will
minimize the extent of disturbed areas, runoff velocities erosion potential and
reduce and delay runoff volumes. Disturbed areas must be stabilized and
protected as soon as possible and facilities or methods used to retain sediment
on the site.
         (c)   When development density, topographic features and soil and
vegetation conditions are not sufficient to adequately handle stormwater runoff
using natural features and vegetation, various types of constructed facilities
such as diversions, settling basins, skimming devices, dikes, waterways, and
ponds may be used. Preference must be given to designs using surface drainage,
vegetation, and infiltration rather than buried pipes and manmade materials and
facilities.
      (2)   The following are specific standards:
         (a)   When constructed facilities are used for stormwater management,
they must be designed and installed consistent with the field office technical
guide of the local soil and water conservation districts.
         (b)   New construction of stormwater outfalls to public waters must
provide for filtering or settling of suspended solids and skimming of surface
debris before discharge.

the Shoreland Overlay District of the city shall comply with the following
provisions:
   (A)   Land suitability. Each lot created through subdivision must be
suitable in its natural state for the proposed use with minimal alteration.
Suitability analysis by the city shall consider susceptibility to flooding,
existence of wetlands, soil and rock formations with severe limitations for
development, severe erosion potential, steep topography, inadequate water
supply or sewage treatment capabilities, near shore aquatic conditions
unsuitable for water-based recreation important fish and wildlife habitat,
presence of significant historic sites or any other feature of the natural land
likely to be harmful to the health, safety or welfare of future residents of
the proposed subdivision or of the community.
   (B)   Platting. All subdivisions that create five or more lots or parcels
that are two and one-half acres or less in size must be platted in accordance
with M.S. Chapter 505. No person may record parcels or receive building,
sewage, or other permits for lots that are not part of an officially platted
subdivision.
   (C)   Consistency with other controls. Subdivisions must conform to all
other official controls adopted by the city. In areas not served by publicly-
owned sewer and water systems, subdivisions may not be created unless domestic
water supply is available and soil absorption sewage treatment can be provided
for every lot. A lot shall meet the minimum lot size and must include at least
a minimum contiguous lawn area, that is free of limiting factors (location and
type of water supply, soil type, depth to groundwater or impervious layer,
slope, flooding potential and other limiting factors), sufficient for the
construction of two standard soil treatment systems. Lots that would require
use of holding tanks may not be approved.
   (D)   Information requirements. Developers must provide adequate information
to make a determination of land suitability. The information shall include at
least the following:
      (1)   Topographic contours at ten foot intervals or less from U.S.
Geological Survey maps or more accurate sources, showing limiting site

and on-site sewage treatment capabilities for every lot from the most current
existing sources or from field investigations such as soil borings, percolation
tests or other methods;
      (4)   Information regarding adequacy of domestic water supply, extent of
anticipated vegetation and topographic alterations, near-shore aquatic
conditions, including depths, (types of bottom sediments and aquatic vegetation
and proposed methods for controlling stormwater runoff and erosion, both during
and after construction activities);
      (5)   The location of regional floodplain areas from existing maps or
data; and
      (6)    A line or contour representing the ordinary high water level
(OHW), the “toe” and the “top” of the bluffs, and the minimum building setback
distances from the top of the bluff and the lake.
   (E)   Dedications. The developer shall provide, where required by the city,
the fee transfer or easement dedication for natural drainage or ponding areas
for management of stormwater and wetlands.

§ 151.03.29 ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   The city shall administer and enforce shoreland management controls as
provided in the Zoning Chapter.
   (B)   In addition to other standards and criteria for variances provided in
§
151.06.13 Variance or state law, the city will apply the following criteria:
      (1)   Variances for properties within the Shoreland Overlay District will
only be granted in accordance with M.S. § 462.357, Subd. 6 and may not
circumvent the general purposes and intent of the official controls.
      (2)   No variance may be granted that would allow any use that is
prohibited in the zoning district in which the subject property is located.
      (3)   The city must also consider:
         (a)   Whether property owners have reasonable use of the land without
the variance(s);
         (b)   Whether any existing sewage treatment systems on the property
need upgrading before additional development is approved;
         (c)   Whether the property is used seasonally or year-round;
         (d)   Whether the variance is being requested solely on the basis of
economic considerations; and the characteristics of development on adjacent
properties.
      (4)   Conditions may be imposed in the granting of variances to ensure
compliance and to protect adjacent properties and the public interest.
   (C)   In addition to any existing standards the city has for reviewing
conditional uses as listed in §
151.06.14 Conditional Use Permit, the following standards must be used for
reviewing conditional uses located in shoreland areas:
      (1)   A thorough evaluation of the topographic, vegetation and soils
conditions on the site to ensure:
         (a)   Prevention of soil erosion or other possible pollution of public
waters, both during and after construction;
         (b)   Limiting visibility of structures and other facilities as viewed
from public waters; and
         (c)   Adequacy of the site for water supply and on-site sewage
treatment.
      (2)   An assessment of the types, uses and numbers of watercraft that the
development or use will generate in relation to the suitability of public
waters to safely accommodate these watercraft.
      (3)   The city may impose conditions when granting conditional use
permits that specify increased setbacks from public waters; vegetation allowed
to be removed or required to be established; sewage treatment system location;
design; the use's location and design; and use requirements for watercraft
launching or docking, and for vehicular parking, structure or other facility
design, use and location; phasing of construction; and other conditions
considered necessary.
   (D)   In addition to other standards and criteria for nonconformities
provided in this chapter or state law, the city will apply the following
criteria:
      (1)   The city will require the upgrading or replacement of any existing,
on-site sewage treatment system identified as a nonconformity under a program
established under state law as Minn. Rules Part 6120.3400. Systems installed
according to all applicable local shoreland management standards in effect at
the time of installation may be considered as conforming unless they are
determined to be failing, except that systems using cesspools, leaching pits,
seepage pits or other deep disposal methods or systems with less soil treatment
area separation above groundwater than required by Minn. Rules Chapter 7080,
shall be considered nonconforming.
      (2)   All nonconformities other than on-site sewage treatment systems
must be managed according to applicable state statutes and local government
official controls.

PART 3. FLOODPLAIN OVERLAY DISTRICT
§ 151.03.31 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Statutory authorization.
   (B)   This floodplain ordinance is adopted pursuant to the authorization and
policies contained in M.S. Chapter 103F; Minn. Rules, Parts 6120.5000 –
6120.6200; the rules and regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program
codified as 44 Code of Federal Regulations Parts 59 - 78; and the planning and
zoning enabling legislation in M.S. Chapter 462.
   (C)   Purpose.
      (1)   This part regulates development in the flood hazard areas of the
city. The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation
that results in potential loss of life, loss of property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures or flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
      (2)   This part is adopted to maintain the community's eligibility in the
National Flood Insurance Program.
      (3)   This part is also intended to preserve the natural characteristics
and functions of watercourses and floodplains in order to moderate flood and
stormwater impacts, improve water quality, reduce soil erosion, protect aquatic
and riparian habitat, provide recreational opportunities, provide aesthetic
benefits, and enhance community and economic development.
   (D)   Lands to which this part applies. This part shall apply to all lands
within the jurisdiction of the city shown on the official zoning map, and/or
the attachments thereto, as being located within the boundaries of the
Floodway, Flood Fringe, or General Floodplain Overlay Districts.

Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (3)   The official zoning map shall be on file in the Office of the
County Auditor and the Zoning Administrator.
   (F)   Regulatory flood protection elevation. The regulatory flood protection
elevation shall be an elevation no lower than one foot above the elevation of
the regional flood, plus any increases in flood elevation caused by
encroachments on the floodplain that result from designation of a floodway.
   (G)   Interpretation.
      (1)   The Floodway, Flood Fringe, and General Floodplain Overlay
Districts are overlay districts superimposed over existing zoning districts.
The standards imposed in the overlay districts are in addition to any other
requirements in this chapter. In case of a conflict, the more restrictive
standards shall apply.
      (2)   Where a conflict exists between the floodplain limits illustrated
on the official floodplain maps and actual field conditions, the regional flood
elevations shall be the governing factor in locating the outer boundaries of
the regional flood floodplain.
      (3)   The regulatory limits of the district boundaries shall be further
extended outward based on the horizontal extension of the regulatory flood
protection elevation.

restrictions. However, where this part imposes greater restrictions, the
provisions of this part shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with
this part are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
   (I)   Warning and disclaimer of liability. This part does not imply that
areas outside the Floodplain Overlay Districts or land uses permitted within
the districts will be free from flooding or flood damages. This part shall not
create liability on the part of the city, or any officer or employee thereof,
for any flood damages that result from reliance on this part or any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (J)   Severability. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this
part is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the remainder of this part shall not be affected thereby.
   (K)   Definitions. See
Chapter 154.
   (L)   Annexations. The flood insurance rate map panels adopted by reference
may include floodplain areas that lie outside of the corporate boundaries of
the city at the time of adoption of this part. If any of these floodplain land
areas are annexed into the city after the date of adoption of this part, the
newly annexed floodplain lands shall be subject to the provisions of this part
immediately upon the date of annexation into the city.

a water to accommodate internal flooding. To allow for the equalization of
hydrostatic pressure, there shall be a minimum of two openings on at least two
sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings shall be no higher than
one foot above grade. The openings shall have a minimum net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding, have a net area of not less than one square inch for every square
foot of enclosed area subject to flooding, and shall allow automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters without human intervention. A floodproofing certification
consistent with §
151.03.39 shall be required.
   (C)   Conditional uses. The conditional uses listed below are only allowable
in the floodway if not prohibited by any other underlying zoning district
classifications of the city, and if not prohibited by any applicable state or
federal law.
      (1)   Grading, extraction, fill, and storage of sand, gravel and other
materials for purposes other than stabilization projects;
      (2)   Marinas, boat rentals, permanent docks, piers, wharves,
navigational facilities, and water-control structures;
      (3)   Railroads, streets, bridges, utility transmission lines and
pipelines;
      (4)   Storage yards for equipment, machinery, or materials; and
      (5)   Fences that have the potential to obstruct flood flows.
   (D)   Standards for conditional uses.
      (1)   All uses. No fill (including fill for roads and levees), deposit,
obstruction or other use may be allowed as a conditional use that will cause
any increase in the stage of the regional flood, or cause an increase in flood
damages in the reach or reaches affected.
      (2)   All floodway conditional uses shall be subject to the procedures
and standards contained in §
151.06.14.
      (3)   The conditional use shall be permissible in the underlying zoning
district if one exists.
      (4)   Fill; storage of materials and equipment.
         (a)   Fill, dredge, spoil and all other similar materials deposited or
stored in the floodplain shall be protected from erosion by vegetative cover,
mulching, riprap or other acceptable method.
         (b)   Dredge spoil sites and sand and gravel operations shall not be
allowed in the floodway unless a long-term site development plan is submitted
which includes an erosion/sedimentation prevention element to the plan.
         (c)    As an alternative, and consistent with subsection (D)(2) of
this section, dredge spoil disposal and sand and gravel operations may allow
temporary, on-site storage of fill or other materials that would have caused an
increase to the stage of the regional flood, but only after the city has
received an appropriate plan that assures the removal of the materials from the
floodway, based upon the flood-warning time available.
         (d)   Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if
readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood
warning, and in accordance with a plan approved by the governing body. The
storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, flammable,
explosive or potentially injurious to human, animal or plant life is
prohibited.
      (5)   The conditional use permit must be title-registered with the
property in the Office of the County Recorder.

§ 151.03.33 FLOOD FRINGE OVERLAY DISTRICT (FF).
   (A)   Permitted uses.
      (1)   Permitted uses shall be those uses of land or structures listed as
permitted uses in the underlying zoning district(s). If no preexisting,
underlying zoning districts exist, then any residential or nonresidential
structure or use of a structure or land shall be a permitted use in the Flood
Fringe District, provided the use does not constitute a public nuisance.
      (2)    All permitted uses shall comply with the standards for flood
fringe permitted uses listed in subsection (B) of this section and the
standards for all flood fringe uses listed in subsection (E) of this section.
   (B)   Standards for flood fringe permitted uses.
      (1)    All structures, including accessory structures, must be elevated
on fill so that the lowest floor, including the basement floor, is at or above
the regulatory flood protection elevation or must adhere to the alternative
listed in subsection (B)(2) of this section.
         (a)   The finished fill elevation for structures shall be no lower
than one foot below the regulatory flood protection elevation. The fill for
residential structures shall extend at the same elevation at least 15 feet
beyond the outside limits of the structure erected thereon.

Figure 151.03.03. Overview of Fill Standards for Residential Structures
      (2)   As an alternative to elevation on fill, enclosed accessory
structures that constitute a minimal investment and that do not exceed 576
square feet in size may be floodproofed in accordance with the following
standards:
         (a)   Accessory structures shall only be used for parking and storage.
         (b)   Accessory structures must allow for the equalization of
hydrostatic pressure by accommodating for the inundation of floodwaters. There
must be a minimum of two openings in the outside walls of the structure, having
a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of
enclosed area subject to flooding. There must be openings on at least two sides
of the structure, and the bottom of all openings must be no higher than one
foot above the lowest adjacent grade to the structure. The openings shall allow
automatic entry and exit of floodwaters without human intervention.
      (3)    The cumulative placement of fill where at any one time in excess
of 1,000 cubic yards of fill is located on the parcel shall be allowable only
as a conditional use, unless the fill is specifically intended to elevate a
structure in accordance with subsection (B)(1) of this section.
      (4)   All fill must be properly compacted and the slopes must be properly
protected by the use of riprap, vegetative cover, or other acceptable method.
      (5)   All new principal structures must have vehicular access at or above
an elevation no more than two feet below the regulatory flood protection
elevation, or must have a flood warning/emergency evacuation plan acceptable to
the city.
      (6)   Accessory uses such as yards, railroad tracks, and parking lots may
be at an elevation lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation.
However, any facilities used by employees or the general public must be
designed with a flood warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation
if the area is inundated to a depth and velocity such that the depth multiplied
by the velocity would exceed a product of four upon occurrence of the regional
flood.
      (7)    The provisions of subsection (E) of this section shall apply.
   (C)   Conditional uses.
      (1)   The placement of floodproofed nonresidential basements below the
regulatory flood protection elevation.
      (2)   The cumulative placement of more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill
when the fill is not being used to elevate a structure in accordance with
subsection (B)(1) of this section.
      (3)   The use of methods other than the fill standards in subsection (B)
(1) of this section to elevate the lowest floor above the regulatory flood
protection elevation.
   (D)   Standards for flood fringe conditional uses.
      (1)   Alternative elevation methods. Alternative elevation methods other
than the use of fill may be utilized to elevate a structure’s lowest floor
above the regulatory flood protection elevation. These alternative methods may
include the use of stilts, pilings, filled stem walls, parallel walls and the
like, or internally-flooded, enclosed areas such as crawl spaces, attached
garages, or tuck-under garages. The base or floor of an enclosed area shall be
considered above-grade, and not a structure’s basement or lowest floor, if:
         (a)   The enclosed area is above-grade on at least one side of the
structure;
         (b)   It is designed to internally flood; and
         (c)   It is used solely for parking of vehicles, building access or
storage. The above-noted alternative elevation methods are subject to the
following additional standards:
            1.   Internally-flooded, fully enclosed areas, such as crawl spaces
or tuck-under garages, must be designed to internally flood and include a
minimum of two openings on at least two sides of the structure. The bottom of
all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade, and have a minimum
net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed
area subject to flooding unless a registered professional engineer or architect
certifies that a smaller net area would suffice.
            2.   Floodproofing certifications consistent with §
151.03.39 shall be required. The structure shall be subject to a deed-
restricted nonconversion agreement with the issuance of any permit.
      (2)   Basements. Basements, as defined in
Chapter 154 Definitions, shall be subject to the following:
         (a)   Residential basement construction shall not be allowed below the
regulatory flood protection elevation.
         (b)   Nonresidential basements may be allowed below the regulatory
flood protection elevation, provided the basement is structurally dry
floodproofed in accordance with this part.
      (3)   Dry floodproofing. All areas of nonresidential structures,
including basements, to be placed below the regulatory flood protection
elevation shall be floodproofed in accordance with the structurally dry
floodproofing classifications in the State Building Code. Structurally dry
floodproofing must meet the FP-1 or FP-2 floodproofing classification in the
State Building Code, and this shall require making the structure watertight,
with the walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and with
structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. Structures floodproofed to the
FP-3 or FP-4 classification shall not be permitted.
      (4)   Erosion/sedimentation control plan. When at any one time more than
1,000 cubic yards of fill or other similar material is located on a parcel for
the activities as on-site storage, landscaping, sand and gravel operations,
landfills, roads, dredge spoil disposal or construction of flood control works,
an erosion/sedimentation control plan must be submitted unless the community is
enforcing a state-approved shoreland management ordinance.
      (5)   Storage of materials and equipment.
         (a)   The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of
flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal or
plant life is prohibited.
         (b)   Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if
readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning
and in accordance with a plan approved by the governing body.
      (6)    The provisions of subsection (E) of this section shall also apply.
   (E)   Standards for all flood fringe uses.
      (1)   Vehicular access. All new principal structures must have vehicular
access at or above an elevation not more than two feet below the regulatory
flood protection elevation. If a variance to this requirement is granted, the
Planning Commission must specify limitations on the period of use or occupancy
of the structure for times of flooding, and only after determining that
adequate flood warning time and local flood emergency response procedures
exist.
      (2)   Commercial uses. Accessory land uses, such as yards, railroad
tracks and parking lots, may be at elevations lower than the regulatory flood
protection elevation. However, a permit for the facilities to be used by the
employees or the general public shall not be granted in the absence of a flood
warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area would be
inundated to a depth and velocity such that, when multiplying the depth (in
feet) times velocity (in feet per second), the product number exceeds four upon
occurrence of the regional flood.
      (3)   Manufacturing and industrial uses. Measures shall be taken to
minimize interference with normal plant operations, especially along streams
having protracted flood durations. Certain accessory land uses, such as yards
and parking lots, may be at lower elevations subject to requirements set out in
subsection (B) of this section. In considering permit applications, due
consideration shall be given to needs of an industry whose business requires
that it be located in floodplain areas.
      (4)   Fill compaction and side slope protection standards. Fill shall be
properly compacted and the slopes shall be properly protected by the use of
riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable method. The Federal Emergency
Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for removing the special flood hazard
area designation for certain structures properly elevated on fill above the
regional flood elevation. FEMA’s requirements incorporate specific fill
compaction and side slope protection standards for multi-structure or multi-lot
developments. These standards should be investigated prior to the initiation of
site preparation if a change of special flood hazard area designation will be
requested.
      (5)   Recreational vehicles. Standards for recreational vehicles are
contained in §
151.03.37.
      (6)   Manufactured homes. Standards for manufactured homes are contained
in §
151.03.37.
(Ord. 20220120-01, passed 1-20-22)
§ 151.03.34 GENERAL FLOODPLAIN OVERLAY DISTRICT (GF).
   (A)   Permitted uses. 
      (1)   The uses listed in §
151.03.32 Floodway Overlay District are allowed with a permit.
      (2)   All other uses are subject to the floodway/flood fringe criteria
specified below. Section
151.03.32 applies if the proposed use is determined to be in the Floodway
District. Section
151.03.33 applies if the proposed use is determined to be in the Flood Fringe
District.
   (B)   Procedures for determining floodway boundaries and base flood
elevations.
      (1)   Requirements for detailed studies. Developments greater than 50
lots or five acres, or as requested by the Zoning Administrator, shall be
subject to a detailed study to determine the regulatory flood protection
elevation and the limits of the Floodway District. The determination of the
floodway and flood fringe must be consistent with accepted hydrological and
hydraulic engineering standards, and must include the following components, as
applicable:
         (a)   Estimate the peak discharge of the regional flood.
         (b)   Calculate the water surface profile of the regional flood based
upon a hydraulic analysis of the stream channel and overbank areas.
         (c)   Compute the floodway necessary to convey or store the base flood
without increasing flood stages more than one-half foot. A lesser stage
increase than one-half foot is required if, as a result of the stage increase,
increased flood damages would result. An equal degree of encroachment on both
sides of the stream within the reach must be assumed in computing floodway
boundaries, unless development or geographic features warrant other analysis,
as approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
      (2)   Alternative methods. For areas where a detailed study is not
available or required, the regional flood elevation must be determined using
best available data. Until a floodway determination can be completed, the
entire floodplain must be treated as floodway, with allowable activities
restricted to those identified in §
151.03.32.
         (a)   Development allowed in floodways (e.g. bridges, culverts,
grading, filling, stabilization projects) must not cumulatively increase flood
stages more than one-half foot during a base flood event, as determined by a
professional engineer or by using accepted engineering practices approved by
the Department of Natural Resources. A stage increase less than one-half foot
must be used if increased flood damages would result.
         (b)   Development prohibited in floodways (e.g. buildings) require a
floodway/flood fringe determination to verify the development is within the
flood fringe. The floodway/flood fringe determination must be done by a
professional engineer or utilize other accepted engineering practices approved
by the Department of Natural Resources. Any such proposal must assume a one-
half foot stage increase for the purposes of determining the regulatory flood
protection elevation to accommodate for future cumulative impacts.
      (3)    For areas in and along lakes, wetlands, and other basins that are
not affected by velocities, where the floodway has not been determined, an
alternative to subsections (B)(1) and (B)(2) of this section is:
         (a)   All areas that are at or below the ordinary high water level
(OHW) will be considered floodway, and all areas below the base flood elevation
but above the OHW will be considered flood fringe, provided that within 25 feet
of the OHW, or within the Shore Impact Zone as identified in the community’s
shoreland ordinance, whichever distance is greater, land alterations shall be
restricted to:
            1.   The minimum required to accommodate beach and access areas,
and accessory structures as permitted, not to exceed a volume greater than ten
cubic yards; projects involving volumes exceeding ten cubic yards require
engineering analysis as provided in subsections (B)(1) and (B)(2) of this
section, whichever is applicable; and
            2.   The minimum required to accommodate shoreline stabilization
projects to correct an identified erosion problem as identified by the Chisago
Soil & Water Conservation District.
   (C)   The Zoning Administrator will review the submitted information and
assess the technical evaluation and the recommended Floodway and/or Flood
Fringe District boundary. The assessment must include the cumulative effects of
previous floodway encroachments. The Zoning Administrator may seek technical
assistance from an engineer or other expert person, or agency, including the
Department of Natural Resources.
   (D)   Once the Floodway and Flood Fringe District boundaries have been
determined, the Zoning Administrator must process the permit application
consistent with the applicable provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 20220120-01, passed 1-20-22)
§ 151.03.35 SUBDIVISIONS.
   No land shall be subdivided that is unsuitable for the reason of flooding,
inadequate drainage, water supply, or sewage treatment facilities. Manufactured
home parks and recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds are considered
subdivisions under this division.
   (A)   All lots within the Floodplain Overlay Districts shall be able to
contain a building site outside of the Floodway District at or above the
regulatory flood protection elevation.
   (B)   All subdivisions shall have water and sewage treatment facilities that
comply with the provisions of this part and have road access, both to the
subdivision and to the individual building sites, no lower than two feet below
the regulatory flood protection elevation unless a flood warning emergency plan
for the safe evacuation of all vehicles and people during the regional flood
prepared by a registered engineer or other qualified individual has been
approved by the city.
   (C)   For all subdivisions in the floodplain, the Floodway and Flood Fringe
District boundaries, the regulatory flood protection elevation and the required
elevation of all access roads shall be clearly labeled on all required
subdivision drawings and platting documents.
(Ord. 20220120-01, passed 1-20-22)
§ 151.03.36 UTILITIES, RAILROADS, ROADS, AND BRIDGES.
   (A)   Utilities. All utilities and facilities, such as gas, electrical,
sewer and water supply systems, to be located in the floodplain shall be
elevated to above the regulatory flood protection elevation or located and
constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage.
   (B)   Public transportation facilities. Railroad tracks, roads, and bridges
to be located within the floodplain shall comply with this part. These
facilities must be elevated to the regulatory flood protection elevation where
failure or interruption of these transportation facilities would result in
danger to the public health or safety, or where the facilities are essential to
the orderly functioning of the area. Minor or auxiliary roads or railroads may
be constructed at a lower elevation where failure or interruption of
transportation services would not endanger the public health or safety.
   (C)   On-site sewage treatment and water supply systems. Where public
utilities are not provided:
      (1)   On-site water supply systems must be designed to minimize or
eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and are subject to the
provisions in Minn. Rules, Part 4725.4350, as amended; and
      (2)   New or replacement on-site sewage treatment systems must be
designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the
systems, and discharges from the systems into flood waters, and shall not be
subject to impairment or contamination during times of flooding, and are
subject to the provisions in Minn. Rules, Part 7080.2270, as amended.
(Ord. 20220120-01, passed 1-20-22)
§ 151.03.37 MANUFACTURED HOMES AND RECREATIONAL VEHICLES.
   (A)   Manufactured homes.
      (1)   New and replacement manufactured homes must be elevated in
compliance with §
151.03.33 and must be securely anchored to a system that resists flotation,
collapse, and lateral movement. Methods of anchoring include, but are not
limited to, use of the over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This
requirement is in addition to applicable state or local anchoring requirements
for resisting wind forces.
      (2)   New manufactured home parks and expansion of existing manufactured
home parks shall be subject to the provisions placed on subdivisions by this
part.
      (3)   The placement of new or replacement manufactured homes in existing
manufactured home parks or on individual lots of record that are located in
Floodplain Overlay Districts will be treated as a new structure, and may be
placed only if elevated in compliance with this part. If vehicular road access
for existing manufactured home parks is not provided in accordance with this
part, then replacement manufactured homes will not be allowed until the
property owner(s) develops a flood warning emergency plan acceptable to the
governing body.
   (B)   Recreational vehicles. New recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds
and expansions to existing recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds are
prohibited in any Floodplain Overlay District. Recreational vehicles placed in
existing recreational vehicle parks, campgrounds, or lots of record must
either:
      (1)   Meet the requirements for manufactured homes above; or
      (2)   Be travel ready, meeting the following criteria:
         (a)   Have current licenses required for highway use.
         (b)   Are highway-ready, meaning they:
            1.   Are on wheels or the internal jacking system;
            2.   Are attached to the site only by quick, disconnect-type
utilities commonly used in campgrounds and recreational vehicle parks; and
            3.   Have no permanent, structural-type additions attached.
         (c)   The recreational vehicle and associated use must be permissible
in any preexisting, underlying zoning use district.
(Ord. 20220120-01, passed 1-20-22)
§ 151.03.38 NONCONFORMING USES.
   (A)   Conformity; unlawful repair or existence. A structure or the use of a
structure or premises that was lawful before the passage or amendment of this
part, but which is not in conformity with the provisions of this part, may be
continued subject to the following conditions. Historic structures, as defined
in
Chapter 154 Definitions, shall be subject to the provisions of this section.
   (B)   Expansion, changes, and the like prohibited. No use or structure shall
be expanded, changed, enlarged or altered in a way that increases its flood
damage potential or degree of obstruction to flood flows except as provided
below. Expansion or enlargement of uses, structure, or occupancies within the
Floodway District is prohibited.
   (C)   Alterations and additions. Any alteration or addition to a
nonconforming structure or nonconforming use that would result in increasing
the flood damage potential of that structure or use shall be protected to the
regulatory flood protection elevation in accordance with any of the elevation
on fill or floodproofing techniques allowable in the State Building Code (i.e.,
FP-1 through FP-4 floodproofing classifications), except as further restricted
below.
   (D)   Discontinuance of structure or use. If any nonconforming use is
discontinued for more than 12 consecutive months, any future use of the
building premises shall conform to this part. The assessor shall notify the
Zoning Administrator, in writing, of instances of nonconforming uses that have
been discontinued for a period of 12 months.
   (E)   Destruction; reconstruction prohibited.
      (1)   If any nonconforming use or structure is substantially damaged, as
defined in
Chapter 154 Definitions, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity
with the provisions of this part. The applicable provisions for establishing
new uses or new structures will apply depending upon whether the use or
structure is in the Floodway or Flood Fringe District, respectively.
      (2)   If any nonconforming use or structure experiences a repetitive
loss, it shall be considered substantially damaged and must not be
reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this part.
   (F)   Conformity. If a substantial improvement occurs, as defined in
Chapter 154 Definitions, then the entire structure must meet the requirements
of this part for new structures, depending upon whether the structure is in the
Floodway or Flood Fringe District, respectively. If the proposed development,
including maintenance and repair during the previous 365 days, plus the costs
of any previous alterations and additions since the first flood insurance rate
map exceeds 50% of the market value of any nonconforming structure, the entire
structure must meet the requirements of this part for new structures.
   (G)   Structures within the regulatory floodplain, as identified in §
151.03.31(G)(3), but outside of the 1% annual chance floodplain, are exempt
from  subsections  (E) and (F) of this section.
(Ord. 20220120-01, passed 1-20-22)
§ 151.03.39 ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Administration.
      (1)   Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator or other official
designated by the governing body shall administer and enforce this part. If the
Zoning Administrator finds a violation of the provisions of this part, the
Zoning Administrator shall notify the person responsible for the violation in
accordance with the procedures stated in §§
10.90 and
10.98  of this Code of Ordinances.
      (2)   Permit, certification, and record-keeping requirements.
         (a)   Permit required. A permit issued by the Zoning Administrator in
conformity with the provisions of this part shall be secured prior to the
erection, addition or alteration of any building, structure or portion thereof;
prior to the use or change of use of a building, structure or land; prior to
the construction of a dam, fence or on-site septic system; prior to the change
or extension of a nonconforming use; prior to the repair of a structure that
has been damaged by flood, fire, tornado or any other source; and prior to the
placement of fill, excavation of materials or the storage of materials or
equipment within the floodplain.
         (b)   Application for permit. Application for a permit shall be
submitted to the Zoning Administrator, on forms furnished by the Zoning
Administrator, and shall include the following where applicable:
            1.   A site plan showing all pertinent dimensions, existing or
proposed buildings, structures, and significant natural features having an
influence on the permit.
            2.   Location of fill or storage of materials in relation to the
stream channel.
            3.   Copies of any required municipal, county, state, or federal
permits or approvals.
            4.   Other relevant information requested by the Zoning
Administrator as necessary to properly evaluate the permit application.
         (c)   State and federal permits. Prior to granting a permit or
processing an application for a conditional use permit or variance, the Zoning
Administrator shall determine that the applicant has obtained all necessary
state and federal permits.
         (d)   Certificate of zoning compliance for a new, altered or
nonconforming use. It shall be unlawful to use, occupy or permit the use or
occupancy of any building or premises or part thereof hereafter created,
erected, changed, converted, altered or enlarged in its use or structure, until
a certificate of zoning compliance shall have been issued by the Zoning
Administrator, stating that the use of the building or land conforms to the
requirements of this part.
         (e)   Certification. The applicant shall be required to submit
certification by a registered professional engineer, registered architect or
registered land surveyor that the finished fill and building elevations were
accomplished in compliance with the provisions of this part. Floodproofing
measures shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or registered
architect as being in compliance with applicable floodproofing standards in the
State Building Code. Accessory structures designed in accordance with §
151.03.33 are exempt from certification, provided sufficient assurances are
documented. A registered professional engineer is required to certify that any
development in established floodways must not cause any increase in flood
elevations, and development in the general Floodplain Overlay District will not
cumulatively increase flood stages more than one-half foot, or less if
increased damages would result.
         (f)   Recordkeeping.
            1.   The Zoning Administrator shall maintain records in perpetuity
documenting all certifications referenced in  subsection  (A)(2)(e) of this
section as applicable.
            2.   The Zoning Administrator shall maintain records in perpetuity
documenting elevations complying with §
151.03.33. The Zoning Administrator shall also maintain a record of the
elevation to which structures and alterations to structures are constructed or
floodproofed.
         (g)   Notifications for watercourse alterations. In riverine
situations, the Zoning Administrator shall notify adjacent communities prior to
the community authorizing any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. If the
applicant has applied for a permit to work in the beds of public waters
pursuant to M.S. Chapter 103G, as amended, this shall suffice as adequate
notice. A copy of the notification shall also be submitted to the Chicago
Regional Office of FEMA.
         (h)   Notification to FEMA when physical changes increase or decrease
the regional flood elevation. As soon as is practicable, but not later than six
months after the date such supporting information becomes available, the Zoning
Administrator shall notify the Chicago Regional Office of FEMA of the changes
by submitting a copy of the technical or scientific data.
      (3)   Amendments.
         (a)   Floodplain designation. The floodplain designation on the
official zoning map shall not be removed from floodplain areas, unless it can
be shown that the designation is in error, or that the area has been filled to
or above the elevation of the regulatory flood protection elevation and is
contiguous to lands outside the floodplain. Special exceptions to this rule may
be permitted by the Department of Natural Resources if it is determined that,
through other measures, lands are adequately protected for the intended use.
         (b)   Required approval. All amendments to this part, including
amendments to the official zoning map, must be submitted to and approved by the
Department of Natural Resources prior to adoption.
         (c)   Map revisions. The Floodplain Overlay District regulations must
be amended to incorporate any revisions by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency to the floodplain maps adopted in this part.
      (4)   Appeals and variances; duties of the Board of Adjustment.
         (a)   Application. An application for a variance to the provisions of
this part shall be processed and reviewed in accordance with applicable state
statutes and §
151.06.13.
         (b)   Submittal of hearing notices. The Zoning Administrator shall
submit hearing notices for proposed variances to the Department of Natural
Resources sufficiently in advance to provide at least ten days’ notice of the
hearing. The notice may be sent by electronic mail or U.S. Mail to the area
hydrologist.
         (c)   Adherence to state floodplain management standards. A variance
shall not allow a use that is now allowed in that district, permit a lower
degree of flood protection than the regulatory flood protection elevation for
the particular area, or permit standards lower than those required by state
law.
         (d)   Additional criteria. The following additional variance criteria
of FEMA must be satisfied:
            1.   Variances shall not be issued by a community within any
designated regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the
regional flood discharge would result.
            2.   Variances shall only be issued by a community upon:
               a.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
               b.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
               c.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
            3.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
         (e)   Flood insurance notice.
            1.   The Zoning Administrator shall notify the applicant for a
variance that:
               a.   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below
the regional flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance; and
               b.   Such construction below the regional flood level increases
risks to life and property.
            2.   Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all
variance actions.
         (f)   General considerations. The community may consider the following
variables, and consider imposing conditions on variances and conditional uses:
            1.   The potential danger to life and property due to increased
flood heights or velocities caused by encroachments;
            2.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands or
downstream to the injury of others;
            3.   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems, if any, and
the ability of these systems to minimize the potential for disease,
contamination, and unsanitary conditions;
            4.   The susceptibility of any proposed use and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
            5.   The importance of the services to be provided by the proposed
use to the community;
            6.   The requirements of the facility for a waterfront location;
            7.   The availability of viable alternative locations for the
proposed use that are not subject to flooding;
            8.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing
development and development anticipated in the foreseeable future;
            9.   The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Land
Use Plan and floodplain management program for the area;
            10.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
            11.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site.
         (g)   Submittal of final decision. A copy of all decisions granting
variances shall be forwarded to the Department of Natural Resources within ten
days of such action. The notice may be sent by electronic mail or U.S. mail to
the area hydrologist.
         (h)   Recordkeeping. The Zoning Administrator shall maintain a record
of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report
such variances issued in its annual or biennial report submitted to the
Administrator of the National Flood Insurance Program when requested by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (5)   Conditional uses.
         (a)   Review. An application for a conditional use permit under the
provisions of this part shall be processed and reviewed in accordance with §
151.06.14.
         (b)   Factors used in decision-making. In passing upon conditional use
applications, the city shall consider all relevant factors specified in other
sections of this chapter, and those factors specified in  subsection  (A)(3)(b)
of this section.
         (c)   Conditions attached to conditional use permits. In addition to
the standards identified in §
151.06.14, the City Council shall attach conditions to the granting of
conditional use permits as it deems necessary to fulfill the purpose of this
part. The conditions may include, but are not limited to, the following:
            1.   Limitations on period of use, occupancy and operation;
            2.   Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed
restrictions; and
            3.   Requirements for construction of channel modifications,
compensatory storage, dikes, levees, and other protective measures.
         (d)   Submittal of hearing notices. The Zoning Administrator shall
submit hearing notices for proposed conditional uses to the Department of
Natural Resources sufficiently in advance to provide at least ten days’ notice
of the hearing. The notice may be sent by electronic mail or U.S. mail to the
area hydrologist.
         (e)   Submittal of final decisions. A copy of all decisions granting
conditional uses shall be forwarded to the Department of Natural Resources
within ten days of such action. The notice may be sent by electronic mail or
U.S. mail to the area hydrologist.
   (B)   Violations and penalties.
      (1)   Penalties for violation. Violation of the provisions of this part
or failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of
conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variances or
conditional uses) shall constitute a misdemeanor and shall be punishable as
defined by law.
      (2)   Other remedies. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city
from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any
violation. If the responsible party does not appropriately respond to the
Zoning Administrator within the specified period of time, each additional day
that lapses will constitute an additional violation of this chapter and will be
prosecuted accordingly.
      (3)   Enforcement. Violations of the provisions of this chapter will be
investigated and resolved in accordance with the provisions of §§ 10.90 and
10.98 of the Zoning Ordinance. In responding to a suspected ordinance
violation, the city may utilize the full array of enforcement actions available
to it including but not limited to prosecution and fines, injunctions, after-
the-fact permits, orders for corrective measures, or a request to the National
Flood Insurance Program for denial of flood insurance availability to the
guilty party. The city must act in good faith to enforce these official
controls and to correct ordinance violations to the extent possible so as not
to jeopardize its eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program.

patios or storage must be landscaped with a combination of canopy trees,
ornamental trees, evergreen trees, shrubs, flowers, gardens, sod, ground cover,
natural drainage features, and other site design features to ensure soil
stabilization. This requirement shall not apply to undisturbed areas retained
in a natural state.
   (B)   Landscape plans shall be submitted for all site and subdivision
related applications where exterior construction and development activity will
occur, except for the construction of an individual one- or two-family
dwelling. Where there is greater than one acre of site disturbance, the
landscape plan shall be prepared by a registered landscape architect.
   (C)   The following minimum number of plant materials shall be provided:
      (1)   All residential one- and two-family developments shall require two
canopy trees per dwelling unit.
      (2)   All multi-family, mixed-use, and non-residential uses shall

      (1)   Meet the minimum standards set by the American National Standards
Institute in ANSI Z60.1 American Standard for Nursery Stock.
      (2)   Landscape species shall be indigenous or proven adaptable to the
climate, but shall not be invasive species.
      (3)   Landscape materials shall be tolerant of specific site conditions,
including but not limited to heat, drought, and salt.
      (4)   Existing healthy plant material may be utilized to satisfy
landscaping requirements, provided it meets the minimum plant size specified in
this division.
   (E)   Not more than 30% of the required number of trees shall be of the same
genus.
   (F)   Trees and shrubs may be clustered and do not need to be evenly spaced.
For residential properties, it is preferable that new trees be located on the
lot itself and not within the right-of-way.
   (G)   The minimum size of plantings shall be as follows:
      (1)   Canopy trees: two and a half-inch caliper;
      (2)   Ornamental trees: one and a half-inch caliper;
      (3)   Evergreen trees: six-foot height; and
      (4)   Deciduous or evergreen shrubs: five gallon pot.
   (H)   Mulch shall consist of shredded bark, chipped wood, or stone installed

approval of a landscape plan, the developer, contractor, or property owner
shall deposit a security with the city to guarantee compliance with and to
indemnify the city for any expenses incurred in enforcing the requirements of
this section. The landscaping security for all uses, which does not include
one- or two-family dwellings, shall be in a form approved by the Zoning
Administrator and shall be equal to 125% of the estimated cost necessary to
furnish and plant the required landscaping and any ancillary screening
improvements such as fencing. The estimated cost shall be subject to approval
by the Zoning Administrator.
   (J)   All required plant materials shall be planted prior to issuing a
certificate of occupancy. In the event that the project is completed during a
time of year when planting is impractical, a security meeting the requirements
of and in the amount of the remaining improvements will be required. In such
case that a performance guarantee is required, all landscaping shall be
completed within one year after the certificate of occupancy has been issued.
   (K)   The continued maintenance of all required landscaping materials in a
live and healthy state is a required responsibility of the owner and tenant of
the property. Plantings which have died shall be promptly replaced in
accordance with the landscape plan approved for the site. This requirement
shall run with the land and be binding upon all future property owners. Failure
to comply with this maintenance requirement shall be a violation of this
section.
(Ord. 20220120-01, passed 1-20-22)

   (A)   Landscaping shall be required along the perimeter and within the
interior of the lot for all new, redevelopment, or retrofit projects. No
additional landscaping shall be required for striping or restriping of existing
parking lots.
      (1)   New parking and driveway areas that accommodate more than 40 cars,
and parking lot expansions that add more than 40 parking spaces, shall be

parking spaces, a minimum of 10% of the parking and driveway surface area shall
be designed with landscaping features. Landscaping features may include linear
parking lot landscaped islands, divider medians, parking lot rain gardens, and
depressed infiltration curb islands. Where the city determines that the parking
lot design cannot reasonably accommodate curb islands, divider medians, or
other landscaping features or cannot accommodate that amount of landscaping
cited herein, plant materials shall be moved to the outside perimeter of the
parking lot.
   (B)   Landscape island design.
      (1)   Landscape islands shall be sized and designed to support plant
health and shall be no smaller than 324 square feet in area. It is strongly
encouraged to use these areas for infiltration purposes.
      (2)   Landscaped islands may contain:
         (a)   Rain gardens;
         (b)   Depressed infiltration areas; or
         (c)   Trees, shrubs, perennials, and/or native grasses.
   (C)   Any divider median shall be at least eight feet in width and extend
the full length of the parking stalls. The divider median shall be covered in
grass, ground cover, mulch, shrubs, trees, or other landscape treatment other
than concrete and pavement.
   (D)   Shade trees shall be used for the perimeter of the parking area and
island landscaping at a minimum rate of one shade tree per ten parking stalls.
Shade trees shall be setback a minimum of eight feet from curbs and/or
pavement.
   (E)   The preservation of existing trees, shrubs, and other natural
vegetation in the parking area may be included in the calculation of the
required minimum landscape area.
   (F)   Modifications from the requirements of this section may be permitted
through the site plan permit review process.

   (A)   It is the policy of the city to recognize and protect the integrity of
the natural environment of the community through the preservation, protection,
and planting of trees.
   (B)   The city has found it necessary and desirable to establish
requirements for the preservation and replanting of trees in order to maintain
a healthy and desirable community and to ultimately provide a long term
environmental and economic benefit.
   (C)   In establishing tree preservation requirements, the city intends to:
      (1)   Prevent clear cutting;
      (2)   Preserve the existing tree canopy through root protection by
eliminating or reducing compaction, filling or excavation;
      (3)   Preserve a continuous tree canopy throughout the site and extending
into adjoining properties whenever possible;
      (4)   Preserve mix of tree ages, sizes, and species;
      (5)   Preserve the existing under-story and forest floor vegetation;
      (6)   Preserve both front and backyard trees in residential developments
with custom lot development and site specific roadway alignments;
      (7)   Prevent soil erosion and sedimentation;
      (8)   Control the spread of tree diseases from affected trees to healthy
trees;
      (9)   Protect privacy by establishing and maintaining buffers between
land uses;
      (10)   Providing habitat for wildlife, including birds that help in the
control of insects; and
      (11)   Support energy conservation through natural insulation and
shading.

§ 151.04.52 SCOPE.
   This section shall apply to the following in the city:
   (A)   Any major subdivision or planned unit development application for a
residential development;
   (B)   Any land use or subdivision application for a commercial or industrial
use which will involve site grading and/or principal structure construction;
   (C)   Any building permit that involves the new construction of a principal
structure, the reconstruction of a principal structure, or construction that
more than doubles the building footprint of a principal structure;
   (D)   Any pre-emptive cutting of forests or woodland within one year of any
formal land use application;
   (E)   Grading permits that are not associated with a development or
redevelopment;
   (F)   Removal of more than 30% of the diameter inches of significant trees
on any parcels; and
   (G)   Tree preservation requirements for planned unit developments shall be
determined as part of the development review process.
(Ord. 20220120-01, passed 1-20-22)
§ 151.04.53 PROCESS.
   (A)   A tree preservation plan shall be prepared and submitted concurrently
with land use, subdivision and building permit applications for a project
except that a tree preservation plan shall not be required for:
      (1)   The construction or reconstruction of an individual single-family
home as long as any significant trees removed are within the footprints and 20
feet around buildings with frost footings; within the footprints and ten feet
around structures with post footings; and within the areas and within ten feet
of reasonably-sized driveways.
      (2)   The removal of significant trees resulting from the expansion of an
existing single-family home as long as the home has been in existence and not
expanded for at least two years after the final certificate of occupancy was
issued and all of its final landscaping and ground cover was installed.
   (B)   The tree preservation plan must be approved by the Zoning
Administrator prior to grading or construction commencing.
   (C)   For subdivisions with mass grading, the following process shall be
followed:
      (1)   A tree preservation plan shall be prepared and superimposed on the
grading plan;
      (2)   During preliminary plat review, the tree preservation plan will be
reviewed according to the best available layout to preserve significant trees
and the efforts of the subdivider to mitigate damage to significant trees.
      (3)   The applicant shall provide a financial guarantee as part of the
development contract to guarantee replacement of all significant trees which
were to have been saved but were actually destroyed or damaged. A financial
security for each mass graded lot with at least one significant tree to be
saved and a financial security for each custom graded lot with at least one
significant tree shall be provided as part of the development contract to
ensure tree protection. The financial security, generally $1,000 per lot, will
be determined by the Zoning Administrator based on the number and size of trees
to be saved.
      (4)   All sites shall be staked, as depicted in the approved grading
plan, before grading is to commence. No encroaching, grading, trenching,
filling, compaction, or change in soil chemistry shall occur within the fenced
areas protecting the root zone of the trees to be saved.
      (5)   After mass grading has been completed and streets and utilities
installed, the forester or landscape architect shall submit a tree
certification to the city, which shall include:
         (a)   Certify in writing to the city the status of all trees indicated
as saved trees in the approved plan;
         (b)   Certify in writing to the city whether tree protection measures
were installed;
         (c)   Certify the status of any designated trees that were saved; ande
         (d)   Certify how the city’s tree replacement policy will be met if a
significant tree designated to be saved on the tree preservation plan is
destroyed or damaged.
      (6)   Removal of tree preservation measures shall require written
approval from the Zoning Administrator. Tree preservation measures shall not be
removed from the site until the Zoning Administrator has approved the grading
as built plans for a mass graded site and not prior to the release of financial
securities held by the city.
      (7)   The financial security will be released upon:
         (a)   Approval of the city and a certification in writing by the
forester or landscape architect indicating the tree protection measures were
installed on mass graded lots and tree replacement is completed, if necessary;
and/or
         (b)   The builders have posted security for the custom graded lots.
   (D)   For subdivisions with custom graded lots, the applicant submitting a
building permit for the lot shall:
      (1)   Submit a tree preservation plan prepared and incorporated on the
required site survey for the custom graded lot.
      (2)   Provide the financial security, generally $1,000 per lot, as
determined by the Zoning Administrator based on the number and size of trees to
be saved.
      (3)   Ensure that the tree preservation plan is consistent with the
original tree preservation plan for the plat. The placement of the home and
driveway should be where the fewest significant trees would be destroyed or
damaged.
      (4)   The applicant will be responsible for ensuring the tree
preservation plan is followed during building construction.
      (5)   Prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy and release of
tree preservation security, the applicant shall submit a tree certification to
certify to the city in writing the final disposition of safe trees on the lot
and that all the tree protection measures identified on the tree preservation
plan were installed from the start of construction to the end of construction
and tree replacement is completed, if necessary.
   (E)   Zoning and grading permits.
      (1)   At the time of building permit application, applicants will be
required to furnish the following items for tree preservation for all lots with
at least one significant tree:
         (a)   Security of $1,000 per lot for tree protection requirements;
         (b)   Tree preservation plan;
         (c)   Builders are liable for subcontractors that destroy or damage
significant trees that were indicated to be saved on the individual lot tree
preservation plan;
      (2)   Inspectors will monitor the tree protection measures at the time of
routine inspections; and
      (3)   Prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy and release of
tree preservation security, the applicant shall submit a tree certification to
certify to the city in writing the final disposition of safe trees on the lot
and that all the tree protection measures identified on the tree preservation
plan were installed from the start of construction to the end of construction

destroyed or damaged during construction. Significant trees destroyed or
damaged shall be replaced by trees equivalent in caliper inches lost.
Replacement trees must consist of nursery stock and be no less than the
following sizes:
      (1)   Deciduous trees: no less than two and one-half inches in diameter;
and
      (2)   Coniferous trees: no less than six feet high.
   (B)   Replacement trees shall be covered by a minimum two year guarantee.
Species shall be similar to the trees which were destroyed or damaged and can
include those native species shown on the approved list of trees in Lindstrom.
   (C)   Replacement trees shall not be placed on easements or street rights-
of-way. The city shall determine the locations of tree replacement for
subdivision tree replanting plans. If tree replacement is required on the
individual lot because the builder destroyed or damaged a tree which was to be

values, and policies.
   (F)   Effect of development stage PUD plan decision.
      (1)   Approval of the development stage PUD plan by the Council shall
constitute rezoning of the property to PUD and conceptual approval of the
elements of the plan. While approval of the development stage PUD plan shall
establish the basic right of use for the area in conformity with the plan as
approved, such plan shall be conditioned upon approval of a final stage PUD
plan and shall not make permissible any of the uses as proposed until a final
stage PUD plan is submitted and approved for all or a portion of the
development stage PUD plan.
      (2)   The applicant shall submit the final stage PUD plan to the City
Council within one year after the approval of the development stage PUD plan or
approval of the development stage PUD plan shall be considered void.
   (G)   Recording of final stage PUD plan.
      (1)   All approved PUD districts shall be designated on the city’s zoning
map as it is revised from time to time.
      (2)   No building permit shall be issued or development shall occur on
land for which a PUD district has been approved which does not conform to the
approved final plan.
      (3)   After the final stage PUD plan has been approved by the City
Council, all conditions of approval have been met, and required improvements
are either installed or a contract and sureties insuring their installation is
filed, the city shall file the final plan with the County Recorder. Recording
of the final stage PUD plan and all associated conditions of approval must be
completed within one year of final approval. Failure to do so shall result in
the requiring of a new development stage PUD plan which must be reviewed in
accordance with the procedure set out in this part to ensure compliance with
any new requirements.
      (4)   If, within one year following City Council approval of the final
stage PUD plan, no building permits have been obtained or, if within one year
after the issuance of building permits, no construction has commenced on the
subject property approved for the PUD district, the zoning for the parcel(s)
shall revert back to the original zoning and the PUD designation shall be
declared null and void.
   Prior to the expiration of any timeframe, the City Council may, upon request
of the property owner and by resolution and findings of fact, approve
extensions of any timeframe in up to 12 month increments.

or rock formation, inadequate water supply or sewage disposal capabilities, or
any other feature likely to be harmful to the health, safety, or welfare of the
future residents of the proposed subdivision or of the community.
   (B)   Land subject to hazards to life, health, or property shall not be
subdivided for residential purposes until all hazards have been eliminated or
unless adequate safeguards against the hazards are provided by the subdivision
plan.

other public use;
      (2)   Carried in a private easement in the individual deeds affected with
no allowance for building construction therein; or

disposal capabilities or any other feature likely to be harmful to the health,
safety or welfare of future residents of the proposed subdivision or of the
city.

be used, they shall be platted at least five feet wider than the average width
of interior lots in the block.
         (c)   Lots abutting upon a water course, drainage way, channel, or
stream shall have an additional depth or width, as required to assure house
sites that are not subject to flooding.
         (d)   Irregular shaped lots are discouraged. Where such lots are
proposed the development shall demonstrate to the city an ability to properly
place principal buildings and accessory structures on the site in a manner that
is compatible in size and character to the surrounding area.
      (4)   Lots with lakeshore frontage shall be designed so that the lot
lines extended shall maintain the closest approximation to riparian rights.
      (5)   In the subdividing of any land, regard shall be shown for all
natural features, such as tree growth, water courses, historic spots, or
similar conditions, which if preserved will add attractiveness and stability to
the proposed development.
      (6)   All remnants of lots below minimum size left over after subdividing
of a larger tract must be added to adjacent lots, dedicated to the public,
owned with specified restrictions by a homeowner association or comparable
association as allowed by M.S. Chapter 515B, or dedicated as an outlot with
specific restrictions.
      (7)   In case a tract is divided, and the subdivision results in parcels
of more than twice the minimum lot size provided for by
Chapter 151 Zoning for the zoning district in which the land is located, then a
build out plan may be required showing potential and feasible ways in which the
lot or lots may be re-subdivided in future years for more intensive use of the
land. The placement of buildings or structures upon these lots must allow for
potential subdivision.
   (B)   Lot size.
      (1)   Lots served with a central sewer system shall have a minimum lot
size, as outlined within
Chapter 151 Zoning.
      (2)   Lots with individual or private sewage disposal system shall have a
minimum lot size as recommended by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency in
accordance with state regulations, as amended.
      (3)   Lots abutting upon a water course, drainage way, channel, or stream
shall have an additional depth or width, as required to assure house sites that
are not subject to flooding.
      (4)   All lots fronting or abutting on arterials and collectors shall be
platted with additional depth necessary to provide for larger setbacks from
such traffic ways.
      (5)   Excessive depth in relation to lot width shall be avoided. (A
proportion of three to one shall normally be considered as appropriate, except
in the case of narrow lots).
      (6)   Corner lots shall be platted at least 15 feet wider than interior
lots.
      (7)   Butt lots shall be platted at least five feet wider than the
average width of interior lots in the block. Their use shall be avoided when
possible.
   (C)   Frontage.
      (1)   Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or straight
road lines or radial to curved road lines or radial to lake or stream shores
unless topographic conditions necessitate a different arrangement.
      (2)   Each lot shall front upon a public right-of-way or ingress
easement.
      (3)   Through lots or double frontage lots shall be avoided when
possible. When such lots cannot be avoided, an additional 20 feet shall be
required to allow for screen planting along the rear lot line.

presently available, the City Council may require that the lots in the
subdivision be consistent with the requirements for lots with central sewer, as
set forth in §
152.02.22(B), and that the developer convey two or more lots for the purpose of
transfer of ownership or building development, and further that any building
development be confined to one of the multiple lots conveyed. At the time as
municipal sewer service becomes immediately available, and upon connection of
the existing building development to same, the undeveloped lots may be conveyed
to other persons or entities and building development may be permitted on same.
   (H)   All utility service lines shall be placed underground and within
easements or dedicated rights-of-way. All drainage and other utility
installations which traverse privately owned property shall be protected by and
subject to proper easements and/or legal agreements.
(Ord. 20220120-01, passed 1-20-22)
PART 4. STREET DESIGN
§ 152.02.41 ROAD SYSTEM.
   (A)   Streets shall be designed to comply with the standards set forth in
the city’s Public Works Design Manual, standard specifications, and details.
   (B)   Proposed roads shall conform to the state, county and/or city plans as
have been prepared, adopted and/or filed as prescribed by law.
   (C)   Roads shall be logically related to the topography so as to produce
usable lots and reasonable grades. Access shall be given to all lots and
portions of the tract in the subdivision, and to adjacent unsubdivided
territory unless the topography clearly indicates that the connection is not
feasible. Reserved strips and land-locked areas shall not be created. Wherever
a tract to be subdivided borders an existing half or partial road, the other
part of the road shall be platted within the tract.
   (D)   If adjoining areas are not subdivided, but may be subdivided in the
future, the arrangement of streets must make provision for the proper
projection of streets into adjoining areas by carrying the new streets to the
boundaries of the new subdivision at appropriate locations.
   (E)   Streets shall not be arranged in a way that will cause undue hardship
to owners of adjoining property.
   (F)   Local roads shall be laid out to discourage their use by through
traffic.
   (G)   Where possible, arterials shall be protected for use by service roads
or marginal access roads.

Cul-de-sac streets shall be no longer than 500 feet, unless otherwise approved
by the City Council at the recommendation of the City Engineer due to
topography, water, or other circumstances.
   (I)   In those instances where a street is terminated pending future
extension in conjunction with future subdivision, and there is more than 200
feet or two dwelling units accessed between the dead end and the nearest
intersection, a temporary turnaround that meets the following requirements
shall be placed at the closed end:
      (1)   The temporary cul-de-sac must be placed inside a temporary roadway
easement if it is located outside of street right-of-way.
      (2)   The temporary cul-de-sac shall be paved with bituminous within one
year of construction. Other surfaces may be considered and allowed by the
Zoning Administrator on a case by case basis.
      (3)   The developer shall submit a cash escrow in an amount determined by
the City Engineer for the removal of the temporary cul-de-sac and restoration
of the area, limited to placement of sod and asphalt driveway within the
temporary roadway easement.
      (4)   Temporary “dead-end” public streets associated with providing
access for future extension to and through adjacent undeveloped property
require concrete curb and gutter installation. Temporary dead-end streets that
will be extended as part of a future phase of a development shown on an
approved preliminary plat do not require concrete curb and gutter along the
radius of the cul-de-sac.
   (J)   In the platting of small tracts of land fronting on limited access
highways or arterials where there is no other alternative, a temporary entrance
may be granted with an interim use permit. As neighboring land becomes
subdivided and more preferable access arrangements become possible, the interim
use permit shall become void.

utilize, to the greatest extent possible, existing natural overland flows, open
channel and drainage routes.
   (D)   The drainage system shall be constructed and operational during the
initial phase of construction.
   (E)   Roads and lots shall be graded to secure proper drainage.
   (F)   Surface water drainage shall be provided by storm sewers or drainage
courses adequate to drain surface water from the subdivision and protect
roadway pavements.
   (G)   Drainage courses. Where stormwater from adjacent areas naturally
passes through a subdivision, adequate provision shall be included in the
subdivision for facilities to safely route the stormwater through the
subdivision to its natural outlet or to maintain or replace the natural water
course.
(Ord. 20220120-01, passed 1-20-22)
§ 152.02.62 SOIL EROSION AND STEEP SLOPES.
   (A)   A minimum of four inches of topsoil shall be placed and vegetation
shall be re-established to minimize soil erosion.
   (B)   No construction or grading shall be allowed on slopes greater than
20%. The subdivider may dedicate steep slopes to an officially recognized
homeowner association or comparable association.
   (C)   During and after construction, slopes shall be protected from erosion
by quick establishment of vegetative cover, benches, terraces, mulches, or
other proper protection devices or practices. Stands of existing vegetation
adequate to control erosion should be preserved wherever possible.
   (D)   The City Council may require that a sufficient bond be posted and
payable to the city for use in correcting problems on public or private lands
caused by erosion and runoff from the development during the construction
phase. The bonds shall be maintained until completion of the development or
until the City Engineer shall certify that sufficient vegetative cover has been
re-established and other measures have been taken to protect the development
site to the approximate extent existing before vegetation removal, land
shaping, and improvement construction were commenced.
(Ord. 20220120-01, passed 1-20-22)
PART 7. DEDICATIONS
§ 152.02.71 GENERAL STANDARDS.
   (A)   As authorized by law, the City Council shall require as a condition of
subdivision approval for all tracts, lots or parcels created within the
jurisdictional boundaries of this chapter that a reasonable percentage of the
final gross area of the subdivision be dedicated to the public for public use
as parks, playgrounds, trails and public open space or, at the City Council’s
discretion, that the subdivider contribute an equivalent amount in cash in lieu
of the dedication of land, or combinations thereof. The final form and amount
of the dedication or contribution shall be determined solely by the city based
upon the conditions outlined below.
   (B)   In single-family and multiple-family residential subdivisions, the
subdivider shall:
      (1)   Pay the city a fee equal to the number of residential units
available in the subdivision times the per lot charge set by resolution of the
City Council;
      (2)   Dedicate land selected solely by the city as to its location and
configuration, in an amount equal to 7% of the total gross acreage of the land
proposed to be subdivided; or
      (3)   Any combination of  subsections  (B)(1) and (B)(2) of this section
as determined by City Council.
   (C)   In nonresidential subdivisions, the subdivider shall dedicate an
amount equal to the quotient arrived at by making the following calculations:
      (1)   Divide the total square footage of the non-public portion of the
subdivision by the minimum square footage for a standard residential lot within
the city as set by ordinance; and
      (2)   Multiply that amount by the per lot charge referred to in
subsection  (A) of this section.
   (D)   It shall be deemed to be in the public interest to require said
contribution for public sites and open space when the Council, after review and
recommendation, makes one or more of the following findings of fact:
      (1)   In establishing the reasonable portion of each proposed subdivision
to be dedicated to the public for public use as provided above, the City
Council may take into consideration the open spaces, parks, recreational or
common areas and facilities which the subdivider has proposed for the exclusive
use of the residents or occupants of the subdivision.
      (2)   The contribution is necessary in order to protect adjacent land
uses from potential conflicting land uses which could exist on the land to be
subdivided.
      (3)   The increased number of residents to reside or to be employed
within the subdivision will increase the recreational demands upon the city.
      (4)   The contribution is necessary to provide proper surface water
runoff generated by the uses proposed within the subdivision.
      (5)   The land proposed to be subdivided contains or borders upon
existing unique topographical features including, but not limited to ponds,
lakes, streams, timber stands, water holding areas, hills, steep slopes,
drainage areas, or bluffs which should be preserved to prevent foreseeable
safety, pollution or erosion hazards.
      (6)   The contribution furthers the goals policies and programs of the
city.
   (E)   In subdivisions which include outlots, the subdivider shall pay a fee
equal to the fee charges for a buildable lot, as described in  subsection  (A)
of this section. When the outlot is then subsequently subdivided, the charges
applicable at the time of subdivision approval shall apply, less the amount
earlier tendered.
   (F)   All monies collected under this section shall be placed in a special
fund. The funds may only be used to purchase park property and park
infrastructure improvements.
   (G)   Upon petition by the subdivider, the Council may approve a delay in
the actual contribution of the cash required in lieu of land until the time as
development occurs on the property being subdivided provided that a proper
legal agreement is executed guaranteeing the contribution. Delayed contribution
payment shall include 8% interest per year. In such cases where the subdivider
is required to dedicate land area, the city shall have the right to determine
the geographic location and configuration of the dedication. The suitability of
the land proposed to be dedicated shall be determined by reference to the
following criteria:
      (1)   Whether the land is reasonably located and suited for its intended
use;
      (2)   Whether land has frontage on public streets;
      (3)   Size, shape, topography, geology, hydrology, tree cover, access,
and location; and
      (4)   Consistency with the Comprehensive Plan.
   (H)   As part of the subdivision approval, the applicant shall be
responsible for making certain improvements to land dedicated for park, trail,
and public open space purposes, including, but not limited to, finish grading,
ground cover, construction of trails, and clearly identifying park and trail
boundaries with city-approved markers.

PART 2. DESIGN STANDARDS
§ 152.04.21 DESIGN CRITERIA.
   (A)   Site design process.
      (1)   Whenever possible, new development projects shall be designed using
the “better site design techniques” of the current version of the Minnesota
Stormwater Manual available at: http://stormwater.pca.state.mn.us/index.php/
Better_site_design.
      (2)   Better site design involves techniques applied early in the design
process to preserve natural areas, reduce impervious cover, distribute runoff
and use pervious areas to more effectively treat stormwater runoff. Site design
should address open space protection, impervious cover minimization, runoff
distribution and minimization, and runoff utilization through considerations
such as:
         (a)   Open space protection and restoration:
            1.   Conservation of existing natural areas (upland and wetland);
            2.   Reforestation;
            3.   Re-establishment of prairies;
            4.   Restoration of wetlands;
            5.   Establishment or protection of stream, shoreline and wetland
buffers; and
            6.   Re-establishment of native vegetation into the landscape.
         (b)   Reduction of impervious cover:
            1.   Reduce new impervious cover through redevelopment of existing
sites and use of existing roadways, trails, etc.;
            2.   Minimize street width, parking space size, driveway length,
sidewalk width; and
            3.   Reduce impervious surface footprint (e.g. two-story buildings,
parking ramp).
         (c)   Distribution and minimization of runoff:
            1.   Utilize vegetated areas for stormwater treatment (e.g. parking
lot islands, vegetated areas along property boundaries, front and rear yards);
            2.   Direct impervious surface runoff to vegetated areas or to
designed treatment areas (roofs, parking, driveways drain to pervious areas,
not directly to storm sewer or other conveyances);
            3.   Encourage infiltration and soil storage of runoff through
grass channels, soil compost amendment, vegetated swales, rain gardens, etc.;
and
            4.   Plant vegetation that does not require irrigation beyond
natural rainfall and runoff from the site.
         (d)   Runoff utilization. Capture and store runoff for use for
irrigation in areas where irrigation is necessary.
      (3)   Stormwater criteria. The following general criteria shall be
incorporated in site design for stormwater runoff to protect surface and ground
water and other natural resources by maintaining pre-development hydrological
conditions:
         (a)   Reduce impacts on water;
         (b)   Protect soils;
         (c)   Preserve vegetation;
         (d)   Decrease runoff volume;
         (e)   Decrease erosion and sedimentation;
         (f)   Decrease flow frequency, duration, and peak runoff rates;
         (g)   Increase infiltration (groundwater recharge);
         (h)   Maintain existing flow patterns;
         (i)   Reduce peak flows;
         (j)   Store stormwater runoff on-site; and
         (k)   Avoid channel erosion.
      (4)   Erosion and sediment control criteria. The following general
criteria shall be incorporated in site design for erosion and sediment control:
         (a)   Minimize disturbance of natural soil cover and vegetation;
         (b)   Minimize, in area and duration, exposed soil and unstable soil
conditions;
         (c)   Protect receiving water bodies, wetlands, and storm sewer
inlets;
         (d)   Protect adjacent properties from sediment deposition;
         (e)   Minimize off-site sediment transport on trucks and equipment;
         (f)   Minimize work in and adjacent to water bodies and wetlands;
         (g)   Maintain stable slopes;
         (h)   Avoid steep slopes and the need for high cuts and fills;
         (i)   Minimize disturbance to the surrounding soils, root systems and
trunks of trees adjacent to site activity that are intended to be left
standing; and
         (j)   Minimize the compaction of site soils.
   (B)   Other design standards.
      (1)    All volume control for water quality and quantity and site design
specifications shall conform to the current version of the Minnesota Stormwater
Manual.
      (2)   All erosion and sediment control requirements shall conform to the
current requirements of NPDES/SDS construction stormwater general permit.
      (3)   Public stormwater detention facilities must be located on public
property or contained within an easement that provides sufficient access for
maintenance. Such lots or easements shall be adjacent to a public right-of-way
or accessed by an easement at least 30 feet wide.
      (4)   It is the responsibility of the applicant to obtain from adjacent
property owners any necessary easements or other property interests concerning
flowage of water.

§ 152.04.22 PERFORMANCE GOALS.
   (A)   Stormwater volume reduction performance goals. Any applicant for a
permit resulting in site disturbance that creates one or more acres of new
impervious surface or fully reconstructs one or more acres of impervious
surface must meet all of the following stormwater performance goals:
      (1)   New development volume control. For new, nonlinear developments
that create more than one acre of new impervious surface on sites without
restrictions, stormwater runoff volumes will be controlled and the post-
construction runoff volume shall be retained on site for one inch of runoff
from all impervious surfaces on the site.
      (2)   Redevelopment volume control. Nonlinear redevelopment projects on
sites without restrictions that create one or more acres of new and/or fully
reconstructed impervious surfaces shall capture and retain on site one inch of
runoff from the new and/or fully reconstructed impervious surfaces.
      (3)   Linear development volume control. Linear projects on sites without
restrictions that create one acre or greater of new and/or fully reconstructed
impervious surfaces, shall capture and retain the larger of the following:
         (a)   0.55 inch of runoff from the new and fully reconstructed
impervious surfaces on the site; or
         (b)   One inch of runoff from the net increase in impervious area on
the site.
         (c)   Mill and overlay and other resurfacing activities are not
considered fully reconstructed.
      (4)   Stormwater management rate control. For all development sites (new
development, redevelopment and linear developments), site design shall provide
on-site treatment during construction and post-construction to ensure no
increase in offsite peak discharge for the one year, 24-hour storm event (2.42
inches); two-year, 24-hour storm event (2.81 inches); the ten-year, 24-hour
storm event (4.12 inches); and the 100-year, 24-hour storm event (6.72 inches)
or as defined by the NOAA Atlas 14 Precipitation Frequency Estimates for
Minnesota.
      (5)   All detention facilities shall be designed with a minimum of 24
inches of freeboard measured to the lowest opening of adjacent structures. A
spillway and overflow route must be able to safely pass overflows through the
structure without creating damaging conditions downstream of the facility nor
inhibit stormwater runoff from upstream development.
   (B)   Flexible treatment options for sites with restrictions (as found in
the MIDS design sequence flowchart). The MIDS design sequence flowchart can be
found in the Minnesota Stormwater Manual: http://stormwater.pca.state.mn.us/
index.php/Flexible_treatment_options. Applicant shall fully attempt to comply
with the appropriate performance goals described above. Options considered and
presented shall examine the merits of relocating project elements to address
varying soil conditions and other constraints across the site. If full
compliance is not possible due to any of the factors listed below, the
applicant must document the reason. If site constraints or restrictions limit
the full treatment goal, the following flexible treatment options shall be
used:
      (1)   Alternative #1. Applicant attempts to comply with the following
conditions:
         (a)   Achieve at least 0.55-inch volume reduction from all impervious
surfaces if the site is new development or from the new and/or fully
reconstructed impervious surfaces for a redevelopment site;
         (b)   Remove 65% of the annual total phosphorous (TP) load from all
impervious surfaces if the site is new development or from the new and/or fully
reconstructed impervious surfaces for a redevelopment site; and
         (c)   Options considered and presented shall examine the merits of
relocating project elements to address varying soil conditions and other
constraints across the site.
      (2)   Alternative #2. Applicant attempts to comply with the following
conditions:
         (a)   Achieve volume reduction to the maximum extent practicable;
         (b)   Remove 60% of the annual total phosphorous (TP) load from all
impervious surfaces if the site is new development or from the new and/or fully
reconstructed impervious surfaces for a redevelopment site; and
         (c)   Options considered and presented shall examine the merits of
relocating project elements to address varying soil conditions and other
constraints across the site.
      (3)   Alternative #3: off-site treatment. Mitigation equivalent to the
performance of 1.1 inches of volume reduction for new development or
redevelopment as described above in this section (including banking or cash)
can be performed off-site to protect the receiving water body. Off-site
treatment shall be achieved in areas selected in the following order of
preference:
         (a)   Locations that yield benefits to the same receiving water that
receives runoff from the original construction activity;
         (b)   Locations within the same Department of Natural Resource (DNR)
catchment area (Hydrologic Unit 08) as the original construction activity;
         (c)   Locations within the next adjacent DNR catchment area upstream;
and
         (d)   Locations anywhere within the city's jurisdiction.
      (4)   Applicant shall document the flexible treatment options sequence
starting with Alternative #1. If Alternative #1 cannot be met, then Alternative
#2 shall be analyzed. Applicants must document the specific reasons why
Alternative #1 cannot be met based on the factors listed below. If Alternative
#2 cannot be met then Alternative #3 shall be met. Applicants must document the
specific reasons why Alternative #2 cannot be met based on the factors listed
below. When all of the conditions are fulfilled within an alternative, this
sequence is completed.
      (5)   Volume reduction techniques considered shall include infiltration,
reuse and rainwater harvesting, and canopy interception and evapotranspiration
and/or additional techniques included in the MIDS Calculator and the Minnesota
Stormwater Manual.
      (6)   Higher priority shall be given to BMPs that include volume
reduction. Secondary preference is to employ filtration techniques, followed by
rate control BMPs.
      (7)   Factors to be considered for each alternative will include:
         (a)   Karst geology;
         (b)   Shallow bedrock;
         (c)   High groundwater;
         (d)   Hotspots or contaminated soils;
         (e)   Drinking water source management areas or within 200 feet of
drinking water well;
         (f)   Zoning, setbacks or other land use requirements;
         (g)   Excessive cost; and
         (h)   Poor soils (infiltration rates that are too low or too high,
problematic urban soils).
(Ord. 20220120-01, passed 1-20-22)
§ 152.04.23 METHODOLOGIES AND COMPUTATIONS.
   (A)   Final site design and choice of permanent stormwater volume reduction
practices shall be based on outcomes of the MIDS calculator (or other model
that shows the performance goal can be met) and shall meet the performance
goals of this Division. The MIDS calculator is available at: http://
stormwater.pca.state.mn.us/index.php/Calculator.
   (B)   Rate control calculations shall be modeled in HydroCAD, SWMM, or
equivalent as approved by the city.
(Ord. 20220120-01, passed 1-20-22)
§ 152.04.24 SITE STANDARDS.
   (A)   Wetlands. The Wetland Conservation Act, as administered by the city's
designated wetland authority, must be followed when encountering any wetlands.
   (B)   Storage piles. Any soil or dirt storage piles containing more than ten
cubic yards of material should not be located with a down-slope drainage length
of less than 25 feet from the toe of the storage pile to a roadway or drainage
channel. If remaining for more than seven days, it must be stabilized by
mulching, vegetative cover, tarps or other means. Soil deposit piles that will
be in existence for less than seven days must be controlled by placing straw
bales or silt barriers around the storage pile. In-street utility repair or
construction soil or dirt storage piles located closer than 25 feet of a
roadway or drainage channel must be covered with tarps or suitable alternative
control, if exposed for more than seven days the storm drain inlets must be
protected with straw bales or other appropriate filtering barriers.
   (C)   Permanent stabilization. A uniform perennial vegetative cover (e.g.,
evenly distributed, without large bare areas) with a density of 70% of the
native background vegetative cover for the area must be established on all
unpaved areas and areas not covered by permanent structures, or equivalent
permanent stabilization measures.
   (D)   Site dewatering.
      (1)   Water may not be discharged in a manner that causes erosion or
flooding of the site or receiving channels of a wetland.
      (2)   Dewatering may require a Minnesota Department of Natural Resources
(DNR) water appropriation permit. If dewatering water is contaminated,
discharge of such water may require an individual MPCA NPDES/SES permit.
   (E)   Waste and material disposal. All waste and unused building materials,
including garbage, debris, cleaning wastes, wastewater, toxic materials or
hazardous materials, shall be properly disposed of off-site and not allowed to
be carried by runoff into a receiving channel or storm sewer system.
   (F)   Tracking. Graveled roads, access drives and parking areas must be of
sufficient width and length to prevent sediment from being tracked onto public
or private roadways. Any sediment reaching a public or private road shall be
removed by street cleaning, not flushing, before the end of each workday.
   (G)   Drains.
      (1)   All storm drain inlets must be protected during construction with a
barrier approved by the city until control measures are in place which meets
accepted design criteria, standards and specifications.
      (2)   All drain leaders must be routed to storm sewer facilities or
pervious areas wherein the runoff can be allowed to infiltrate.
      (3)   The flow rate of water from the leaders must be controlled so no
erosion occurs in the previous areas.

(Ord. 20220120-01, passed 1-20-22)
§ 152.04.52 ENFORCEMENT TOOLS/STOP WORK ORDERS.
   The city shall reserve the right to issue construction stop work orders when
cooperation on inspections is withheld or when a violation has been identified
that needs immediate attention to protect human health and/or the environment.
If stormwater and/or erosion and sediment control management measures
malfunction and breach the perimeter of the site, enter streets, other public
areas, or waterbodies the city will assess the need for issuing a stop work
order. The applicant shall immediately develop a cleanup and restoration plan,
obtain the right of entry from the adjoining property owner if necessary, and
implement the cleanup and restoration plan within 48 hours. If in the
discretion of the city, the applicant does not repair the damage caused by the
stormwater runoff, the city can complete the remedial work required and charge
the cost to the applicant. If payment is not made within 30 days, payment will
be made from the applicant's financial securities. An inspection by the city
must follow before the construction project work can resume.
   (A)   Construction stop work order. The city may issue construction stop
work orders until stormwater management measures meet specifications and the
applicant repairs any damage caused by stormwater runoff. An inspection by the
city must follow before the construction project work can resume.
   (B)   Other actions to ensure compliance. The city can take any combination
of the following actions in the event of a failure by applicant to meet the
terms of this Division:
      (1)   Withhold inspections or issuance of certificates or approvals;
      (2)   Revoke any permit issued by the city to the applicant;
      (3)   Conduct remedial or corrective action on the development site or
adjacent site affected by the failure;
      (4)   Charge applicant for all costs associated with correcting the
failure or remediating damage from the failure; if payment is not made within
30 days, payment will be made from the applicant's financial securities; or
      (5)   Bring other actions against the applicant to recover costs of
remediation or meeting the terms of this Division.
   (C)   Any person, firm or corporation failing to comply with or violating
any of these regulations, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor.
(Ord. 20220120-01, passed 1-20-22)
§ 152.04.53 NOTIFICATION OF FAILURE OF THE PERMIT.
   The city shall notify the permit holder of the failure of the permit's
measures.
   (A)   Initial contact. The initial contact will be to the party or parties
listed on the application and/or the SWPPP as contacts. Except during an
emergency action, 48 hours after notification by the city or 72 hours after the
failure of erosion and sediment control measures, whichever is less, the city
at its discretion, may begin corrective work. Such notification should be in
writing, but if it is verbal, a written notification should follow as quickly
as practical. If after making a good faith effort to notify the responsible
party or parties, the city has been unable to establish a contact, the city may
proceed with corrective work. There are conditions when time is of the essence
in controlling erosion. During such a condition the city may take immediate
action, and then notify the applicant as soon as possible.
   (B)   Erosion off-site. If erosion breaches the perimeter of the site, the
applicant shall immediately develop a cleanup and restoration plan, obtain the
right-of-entry from the adjoining property owner, and implement the cleanup and
restoration plan within 48 hours of obtaining the adjoining property owner's
permission. In no case, unless written approval is received from the city, may
more than seven calendar days go by without corrective action being taken. If
in the discretion of the city, the permit holder does not repair the damage
caused by the erosion, the city may do the remedial work required. When
restoration to wetlands and other resources is required, the applicant should
be required to work with the appropriate agency to ensure that the work is done
properly.
   (C)   Erosion into streets, storm sewers, wetlands or water bodies. If
eroded soils (including tracked soils from construction activities) enter or
appear likely to enter streets, storm sewers, wetlands, or other water bodies,
prevention strategies, cleanup and repair shall be immediate. The applicant
shall provide all traffic control and flagging required to protect the
traveling public during the cleanup operations.
   (D)   Failure to do corrective work. When an applicant fails to conform to
any provision of this Division within the time stipulated, the city may take
the following actions:
      (1)   Issue a stop work order, withhold the scheduling of inspections,
and/or the issuance of a certificate of occupancy;
      (2)   Revoke any permit issued by the city to the applicant for the site
in question or any other of the applicant's sites within the city's
jurisdiction; and
      (3)   Correct the deficiency or hire a contractor to correct the
deficiency.
         (a)   The applicant will be required to reimburse the city for all
costs incurred in correcting stormwater pollution control deficiencies. If
payment is not made within 30 days after costs are incurred by the city,
payment will be made from the applicant's financial securities as described in
§
152.04.42.
         (b)   If there is an insufficient financial amount in the applicant's
financial securities as described in §
152.04.42, the city may certify the remaining amount to the County Auditor to
be collected with property taxes levied against the property, pursuant to M.S.
§§ 366.012 and 415.01.
