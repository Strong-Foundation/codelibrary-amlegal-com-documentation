Section 1.01 INCORPORATION; NAME OF CITY; GENERAL POWERS; CONSTRUCTION.
   A.   Incorporation and Name of the City. All that part of the County of
Mower, State of Minnesota, within the limits and boundaries hereinafter
described, shall be a city, and the inhabitants thereof shall be and form a
municipal corporation under the name and style of the City of Austin.
   B.   General Powers. The City shall have all powers which it may now or
hereafter be possible for a municipal corporation in this State to exercise in
harmony with the constitutions of this state and of the United States. It is
the intention of this Charter that every power which the people of the city
might lawfully confer upon themselves as a municipal corporation, by specific
enumeration in this Charter, shall be deemed to have been so conferred by the
provisions of this section.
   C.   Construction. The powers of the City under this Charter shall be
construed liberally in favor of the City, and the specific mention of
particular powers in this Charter, or an amendment thereof, shall not be
construed as limiting in any way the general powers stated in this article.
Section 1.02 BOUNDARIES OF CITY.
   The City of Austin, Minnesota shall continue to be a municipal corporation
under that name and with the same boundaries as now are or hereafter may be
established.
Section 1.03 WARDS.
   A.   The city is divided into three separately numbered wards. Review of the
ward boundaries must be made by the council, and the wards reapportioned by
ordinance, no later than two years after the year in which a federal census is
taken so that the populations of the wards are as equal as practicable. A ward
must be composed of compact and contiguous territory. A change in ward
boundaries does not disqualify a ward council member from serving the remainder
of a term. If the council does not reapportion the wards within the period
prescribed, the mayor and council members may not be paid salary or other
benefits until the wards of the city are reapportioned. The wards of the city
are those described by ordinance on the effective date of this Charter.
   B.   All officers of the city whose appointment is required by the
provisions of this Charter may serve out the term for which they are appointed
or elected despite the change in ward boundaries above set forth.

they shall automatically qualify to be placed on the ballot for the regular
municipal election.
Section 2.02 REGULAR MUNICIPAL ELECTION.
   A regular municipal election shall be held on the first Tuesday after the
first Monday in November of each even-numbered year commencing in 2010 at such
place or places as the city council may designate. The city clerk shall give
published notice as required by state statute.
Section 2.03 SPECIAL ELECTIONS.

qualified under the state constitution for elective office may, by filing an
affidavit and paying a filing fee of $25.00 to the city clerk, have his/her
name placed on the municipal primary ballot or, if there is no primary
election, on the municipal election ballot.
Section 2.05 PROCEDURE OF ELECTIONS.
   Subject to this Charter and applicable state laws, the council may by
ordinance further regulate the conduct of municipal elections. Except as
otherwise provided by this Charter and supplementary ordinances, general state
laws on elections shall apply to municipal elections.
Section 2.06 EFFECT OF FAILURE TO HOLD ELECTION, ETC.
   Should there be a failure by the people, for any cause, to hold any city
election at the time or in the manner hereinbefore prescribed, or to elect any
officer herein required to be elected on the day designated, the city council
may order a new election to be held, fourteen days notice of the time and place
being given, by publishing the notice thereof in the official city paper, and
by posting thereof in three of the most public places in the city; provided,
that no failure of the city clerk to give the notice of election specified
herein shall in any manner invalidate any general election.
Section 2.07 INITIATIVE, REFERENDUM AND RECALL.
   A.   POWERS RESERVED BY THE PEOPLE. The people of Austin reserve to
themselves the powers, in accordance with the provisions of this Charter, to
initiate and adopt any ordinance, except an ordinance appropriating money or
authorizing the levy of taxes; to require any ordinance when passed by the
council to be referred to the electorate for approval or disapproval; and to
recall elected municipal officers. These powers shall be called the initiative,
the referendum, and the recall, respectively.
   B.   EXPENDITURES BY PETITIONERS. No member of any initiative, referendum,
or recall committee, no circulator of a signature paper, and no signer of any
such paper, or any other person, shall accept or offer any reward, pecuniary or
otherwise, for service rendered in connection with the circulation thereof, but
this shall not prevent any such committee from incurring an expense for legal
advice, stationery, copying, printing, and notaries' fees. Any violation of the
provisions of this section shall constitute a misdemeanor.
   INITIATIVE
   C.   INITIATION OF MEASURES. Any five electors may form themselves into a
committee for the initiation of any ordinance except an ordinance appropriating
money or authorizing the levy of taxes. Before circulating the petition
referred to in Section
2.07, D, such electors shall file a copy of the proposed ordinance with the
city clerk together with their names and addresses of such committee. Such
electors shall also attach a copy of the proposed ordinance to each of the
signature papers herein described, together with their names and addresses as
sponsors thereof.
   D.   FORM OF PETITION AND OF SIGNATURE PAPERS. The petition for the adoption
of any ordinance shall consist of the ordinance, together with all signature
papers and affidavits thereto attached. Such petition shall not be complete
unless the signature papers have been signed by a number of voters equal to at
least 10 percent of the total number of electors who cast their votes at the
last preceding regular municipal election. The signatures need not be on one
signature paper, but the circulator of every signature paper shall make an
affidavit that each signature appended to the paper is the genuine signature of
the person whose name it purports to be. Each signature paper shall be in
substantially the following form:
   Initiative Petition
proposing an ordinance to _______________________ (stating the purpose of the
ordinance), a copy of which ordinance is hereto attached. This ordinance is
sponsored by the following committee of electors:
NAME                           ADDRESS
1. _______________________             _______________________
2. _______________________             _______________________
3. _______________________             _______________________
4. _______________________             _______________________
5. _______________________             _______________________
The undersigned electors, understanding the terms and nature of the ordinance
hereto attached, petition the city council for its adoption, or in lieu
thereof, for its submission to the electors for their approval.
NAME                           ADDRESS
1. _______________________             _______________________
2. _______________________             _______________________
3. _______________________             _______________________
4. _______________________             _______________________
5. _______________________             _______________________
   At the end of the list of signatures shall be appended the affidavit of the
circulator that each signature appended to the petition is the genuine
signature of the person whose name it purports to be.
   E.   FILING OF PETITIONS AND ACTION THEREON. The petition shall be filed in
the office of the city clerk as one instrument. Within 20 days after the filing
of the petition, the city clerk shall ascertain by examination the number of
electors whose signatures are appended thereto and whether this number is at
least 10 percent of the total number of electors who cast their votes at the
last preceding regular municipal election. If the city clerk finds the number
of such signatures is less than 10 percent of the total number of electors who
cast their votes at the last preceding regular election, he/she shall at once
notify one or more of the committee of electors of that fact, certifying the
reasons for his/her finding. The committee shall then be given 30 days in which
to file additional signature papers. If at the end of that period the petition
is found to still lack the required signatures, the clerk shall file it in his/
her office and shall notify each member of the committee of electors of that
fact. The final finding by the clerk of the insufficiency of the required
number of signatures shall not prevent judicial review of the clerk's
determination, shall not prejudice the filing of a new petition for the same
purpose, nor shall it prevent the council from referring the ordinance to the
electors at the next regular or any special election at its option.
   F.   ACTION OF COUNCIL ON PETITION. When the petition is found to be
sufficient, the city clerk shall submit it to the council at its next meeting,
stating the number of petitioners and the percentage of the total number of
voters which they constitute, and the council shall at once read the ordinance
and refer it to an appropriate committee, which may be a committee of the
whole. The committee or council shall thereupon provide for public hearings
upon the ordinance after the holding of which the ordinance shall be finally
acted upon by the council not later than 65 days after the date upon which it
was first submitted to the council by the city clerk. If the council fails to
pass the proposed ordinance or passes it in a form different from that set
forth in the petition and unsatisfactory to the committee of electors, the
proposed ordinance shall be submitted by the council to the vote of the
electors at the next regular municipal election; but if the number of signers
of the petition is equal to at least 25 percent of the total number of voters
voting at the last preceding regular municipal election, the council shall call
a special election upon the measure. Such special election shall be held not
less than 30 nor more than 120 days from the date of final action on the
ordinance by the council or after the expiration of 65 days from the date the
ordinance was first submitted to the council by the clerk when there has been
no final action; but if a regular election is to occur within 120 days, the
council may submit the ordinance at that election. If the council passes the
proposed ordinance with amendments and at least four-fifths of the committee of
electors do not express their dissatisfaction with such amended form by a
statement filed with the city clerk within 10 days of the passage thereof by
the council, the ordinance need not be submitted to the electors.
   G.   INITIATIVE BALLOTS. The ballots used when voting upon any such proposed
ordinance shall state the substance of the ordinance and shall give the voters
the opportunity to vote either yes or no on the question of adoption. If a
majority of the electors actually voting on any such ordinance vote in favor of
it, it shall thereupon become an ordinance of the city. Any number of proposed
ordinances may be voted upon at the same election but the voter shall be
allowed to vote for or against each separately. In case of inconsistency
between two initiated ordinances approved at one election, the one approved by
the higher percentage of electors voting on the question shall prevail to the
extent of the inconsistency.
   H.   REPEAL OF ORDINANCE ADOPTED THROUGH INITIATIVE PROCESS. Any ordinance
adopted by the electorate may be repealed only by vote of the electorate at a
regular or special election in accordance with a resolution adopted by a two-
thirds vote of the council or in accordance with petitions duly filed as
required herein for the adoption of such ordinance.
   I.   INITIATION OF CHARTER AMENDMENTS. Nothing in this charter shall be
construed as in any way affecting the right of the electors under the
Constitution and statutes of Minnesota to propose amendments to this Charter.
   REFERENDUM
   J.   THE REFERENDUM. Except for emergency ordinances as defined in Section
2.07 N, no ordinance passed by the city council shall take effect until seven
days after such ordinance is published as provided in Section
4.02 of the City Charter. During such seven-day period, a statement signed by
any 30 electors of "Intent to Petition for Referendum" may be filed with the
city clerk. The effect of filing such statement shall be to prevent such
ordinance from becoming effective until 30 days after such ordinance would
otherwise have become effective. If such a statement of "Intent to Petition for
Referendum" is filed, and if before the date when the ordinance takes effect, a
petition signed by qualified electors of the city equal in number to 10 percent
of the total number of electors who cast their votes at the last preceding
regular municipal election is filed with the city clerk requesting that such
ordinance be repealed or be submitted to a vote of the electors, the ordinance
shall thereby be prevented from going into operation. The council shall
thereupon reconsider the ordinance at its next regular meeting, and by yea and
nay vote either repeal it or reaffirm its adherence to the ordinance as passed.
In the latter case, the council shall submit the ordinance at the next regular
municipal election, pending which the effectiveness of the ordinance shall
remain suspended. Provided, however, the council may, in its discretion, order
that a special election be held on the ordinance.
   K.   REFERENDUM PETITIONS. The requirements laid down in Section
2.07 C and D above as to the formation of committees for the initiation of
ordinances and as to the form of petitions and signature papers shall apply to
the referendum as close as possible, but with such verbal changes as may be
necessary. Each signature paper shall be in substantially the following form:
   Referendum Petition
proposing the repeal of an ordinance to _______________________ (stating the
purpose of the ordinance), a copy of which ordinance is hereto attached. The
proposed repeal is sponsored by the following committee of electors:
NAME                           ADDRESS
1. _______________________             _______________________
2. _______________________             _______________________
3. _______________________             _______________________
4. _______________________             _______________________
5. _______________________             _______________________
The undersigned petitioners, understanding the nature of the ordinance hereto
attached and believing it to be detrimental to the welfare of the city,
petition the council for its repeal or submission to a vote of the electors for
their approval or disapproval.
NAME                         ADDRESS
1. _______________________             _______________________
2. _______________________             _______________________
3. _______________________             _______________________
4. _______________________             _______________________
5. _______________________             _______________________
   L.   FILING OF PETITIONS AND ACTIONS THEREON. The referendum petition shall
be filed in the office of the city clerk as one instrument. Within 20 days
after the filing of the petition, the city clerk shall ascertain by examination
the number of electors whose signatures are appended thereto and whether this
number is at least 10 percent of the total number of electors who cast their
votes at the last preceding municipal election. If he/she finds the number of
such signatures is less than 10 percent of the total number of electors who
cast their votes at the last preceding regular municipal election, he/she shall
at once notify one or more members of the committee of electors of that fact,
certifying the reasons for his/her finding. The committee shall then be given
30 days in which to file additional signature papers, and during such 30-day
period, the effectiveness of the ordinance shall continue to be suspended. If
at the end of that 30-day period the petition is found to still lack the
required signatures, the clerk shall file it in his/her office, notify each
member of the committee of electors of that fact, and the ordinance shall
forthwith become effective. The final finding of the insufficiency of the
required number of signatures shall not prevent judicial review of the clerk's
determination.
   M.   REFERENDUM BALLOTS. The ballots used when voting upon any such
ordinance shall state the substance of the ordinance and shall give the voters
the opportunity to vote either yes or no on the question of whether the
ordinance shall become effective. If a majority of the electors actually voting
on the question favor the ordinance becoming effective, it shall go into effect
immediately or on the date therein specified. If a majority of the electors
actually voting on the question is opposed to the ordinance becoming effective,
it shall not become effective.
   N.   EMERGENCY ORDINANCE. As used in Section
2.07 J above, the term "emergency ordinance" means an ordinance which is named
as such and is adopted in response to an emergency situation which shall be
described in detail in a preamble to the ordinance. An emergency ordinance is
effective upon publication and shall remain in effect for the period set forth
in the ordinance; provided, however, in no event shall an emergency ordinance
remain in effect for more than 60 days. Pursuant to an emergency ordinance, the
council may not obligate the city, under contract or otherwise, for a period
extending beyond the effective period of the ordinance.
   O.   ADOPTION OF AN ORDINANCE REJECTED THROUGH THE REFERENDUM PROCESS. Any
ordinance so rejected by the electorate may be subsequently adopted only by a
vote of the electorate at a regular or special election in accordance with a
resolution adopted by a two-thirds vote of the city council or in accordance
with the initiative process set forth in this section of the City Charter.
   RECALL
   P.   THE RECALL. Any five electors of a ward may form themselves into a
committee for the purpose of bringing about the recall of any elected council
member for that specific ward. In the case of any other municipal officer who
is elected by the people, any five electors within the city may form themselves
into a committee for the purpose of bringing about the recall of such official.
The committee shall certify to the city clerk the name of the officer whose
removal is sought, a statement of the grounds for removal in not more than 250
words and their intention to bring about this recall. The grounds for removal
shall be limited to malfeasance or nonfeasance in the performance of official
duties. A copy of this certificate shall be attached to each signature paper
and no signature paper shall be put into circulation previous to such
certification.
   Q.   RECALL PETITIONS. The petition for the recall of any official shall
consist of a certificate identical with that filed with the city clerk together
with all the signature papers and affidavits thereto attached. All the
signatures need not be on one signature paper, but the circulator of every
signature paper shall make an affidavit that each signature appended to the
paper is the genuine signature of that person whose name it purports to be.
Each signature paper shall be in substantially the following form:
   Recall Petition
proposing the recall of ____________________ from his/her office, which recall
is sought for the reasons set forth in the attached certificate. This recall is
sponsored by the following committee of electors:
NAME                           ADDRESS
1. _______________________             _______________________
2. _______________________             _______________________
3. _______________________             _______________________
4. _______________________             _______________________
5. _______________________             _______________________
The undersigned electors, understanding the nature of the charges against the
officer herein sought to be recalled, desire the holding of a recall election
for that purpose.
NAME                           ADDRESS
1. _______________________             _______________________
2. _______________________             _______________________
3. _______________________             _______________________
4. _______________________             _______________________
5. _______________________             _______________________
At the end of the list of signatures shall be appended the affidavit of the
circulator, mentioned above.
   R.   FILING OF PETITION. Within thirty days after the filing of the original
certificate, the committee shall file the completed petition in the office of
the city clerk. The city clerk shall examine the same within the next 20 days,
and if he/she finds that the number of signers is less than 25 percent of the
total number of electors who cast their votes in the last preceding regular
municipal election, he/she shall so notify one or more members of the
committee, certifying the reasons for his/her finding. The committee shall then
be given ten days in which to file additional signature papers. If at the end
of that time the city clerk finds the petition still lacks the required
signatures, he/she shall notify all the members of the committee to that effect
and shall file the petition in his/her office. The final finding by the clerk
of the insufficiency of the required number of signatures shall not prevent
judicial review of the clerk's determination. Under this Section
2.07 R, the authority of the city clerk is limited to determining whether
sufficient signatures are appended to the petition. The city clerk shall have
no authority to determine the truthfulness of the statement of the grounds for
removal submitted by the committee of electors or whether such grounds
constitute malfeasance or nonfeasance in the performance of official duties.
   S. RECALL ELECTION. If the petition or supplemented petition be found to
contain a sufficient number of signatures, the city clerk shall transmit it to
the council without delay, and shall also officially notify the person sought
to be recalled of the sufficiency of the petition and of the pending action.
The council shall at its next meeting, by motion, provide for the holding of a
special recall election throughout the city or in the ward in question, not
less than 30 nor more than 45 days thereafter, provided that if any other
regular municipal election is to occur within 60 days after such meeting, the
council may in its discretion provide for the holding of the recall election at
that time.
   T.   PROCEDURE AT RECALL ELECTION. In the published call for the election,
whether posted on bulletin boards or printed in the official paper, there shall
be given the statement of the grounds for removal and also, in not more than
500 words, the answer of the officer concerned in justification of his/her
course in office. Candidates to succeed the officer to be recalled shall be
nominated in the usual way, and the election shall be conducted as far as
possible, in accordance with the usual procedure in municipal elections.
   U.   FORM OF RECALL BALLOT. Unless the officer whose removal is sought shall
have resigned within 10 days after the receipt by the council of the completed
recall petition, the form of the ballot at such election shall be as near as
may be: "Shall _____________________ (insert name of the official whose recall
is sought) be recalled from the office of ________________ ?" The electors
shall be permitted to vote separately yes or no upon this question. The ballot
shall also contain the names of the candidates to be voted upon to fill the
vacancy in case the recall is successful, under the caption: "Candidates to
fill the place of ____________________ (insert name of the official whose
recall is sought) if recalled." But the officer whose recall is sought shall
not himself be a candidate upon such ballot. If a majority of those actually
voting on the question shall vote in favor of recalling such official, he/she
shall be thereby removed from office, and in that event, the candidate who
receives the highest number of votes for his/her place shall be elected thereto
for the remainder of the unexpired term. If the officer sought to be recalled
shall have resigned within 10 days after the receipt by the council of the
completed recall petition, the form of ballot for the election of a replacement
for such resigned official at the election shall be the same, as nearly as may
be, as the form in use at a regular municipal election.
   V.   WITHDRAWAL OF PETITIONS. An initiative, referendum, or recall petition
may be withdrawn at any time prior to the fifteenth day preceding the day
scheduled for a vote of the city by filing with the city clerk a request for
withdrawal signed by at least two-thirds of the petitioners' committee. Upon
the filing of such request, the petition shall have no further force or effect
and all proceedings thereon shall be terminated.

   Subd. 2.   No suit, proceedings, right, fine, forfeiture or penalty
instituted, created, given, secured or accrued under any ordinance previous to

prosecuted, enjoyed and recovered as fully as if the ordinance had continued in
force unless it is otherwise expressly provided.
   Subd. 3.   When any ordinance repealing a former ordinance, clause or
provision shall be itself repealed, the repeal shall not be construed to revive
the former ordinance, clause or provision unless it is expressly provided.

   Subd. 3.   In particular, any agreement granting permission to utilize
highway rights-of-way, contracts entered into or franchises granted, the

been enacted.
§ 1.18 COPIES OF CODE.
   Subd. 1.   The official copy of this code shall be kept in the office of the
City Administrator for public inspection.
   Subd. 2.   The Administrator shall provide a copy for sale for a reasonable

§ 1.19 ADOPTION OF STATUTES AND RULES BY REFERENCE.
   It is the intention of the City Council that, when adopting this code, all
future amendments to any state or federal rules and statutes adopted by
reference in this code or referenced in this code are hereby adopted by
reference or referenced as if they had been in existence at the time this code
was adopted unless there is clear intention expressed in the code to the
contrary.
§ 1.98 CIVIL PENALTIES.
   Subd. 1.   Purpose.
      A.   The City Council seeks to offer an alternative method of enforcement
for city code violations rather than relying on the criminal court system. The
formal criminal prosecution process does not provide an environment to
adequately address the unique and sensitive issues that are involved in city
code violations, including, but not limited to, neighborhood concerns,
livability issues, economic impact, physical limitations of the offenders and
the stigma and unintended consequences of being charged with or convicted of a
misdemeanor offense. In addition, the court system is a slow, overburdened and
methodical process that is not conducive to dealing with the violations in a
prompt and timely manner. Finally, the penalties afforded the criminal court
system are restricted to fines or physical confinement, which are not always
effective solutions to address city code violations.
      B.   In order to provide more flexibility in addressing city code
violations on an individualized basis that will be more efficient and
effective, the City Council finds that an alternative enforcement process is
necessary. Therefore, to protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens
of the city, it is the City Council's intent to create a process for the use
and imposition of administrative civil penalties that will provide the public
and the city with a more effective alternative method for addressing city code
violations.
   Subd. 2.   Alternative methods of enforcement. A violation of the city code
is a misdemeanor pursuant to §
1.99; however, this section seeks to gain compliance with the city code as an
alternative to the commencement of any formal civil or criminal court action.
The administrative civil penalties proceedings are in addition to any other
legal or equitable remedy available to the city for city code violations. The
city may, in its discretion, choose to issue an administrative citation
pursuant to other civil remedies or may initiate criminal charges instead.
   Subd. 3.   Authority to issue compliance letters and administrative
citations. The city employees and agents identified below are authorized to
issue compliance letters and administrative citations for violations of the
city code:
      A.   Any licensed peace officer of the city's Police Department, or the
County Sheriff, or any Deputy Sheriff, shall have the authority to enforce any
provision of this code.
      B.   The following individuals designated in this section or by the City
Council shall have the authority to administer and enforce the provisions
specified:
         1.   City Building Official;
         2.   City Clerk;
         3.   Public Works Director or designated agent;
         4.   City Administrator;
         5.   City Planner and/or Zoning Administrator;
         6.   Code Enforcement Officer (a/k/a housing, building and zoning
inspectors);
         7.   Community Service Officer;
         8.   Fire Chief;
         9.   Fire Inspector; and
         10.   Park and Recreation Director or designated agent.
      C.   Any city official or employee designated by this code who has the
responsibility to perform a duty under this code may, with the permission of a
licensee of a business or owner of any property or resident of a dwelling, or
other person in control of any premises, inspect or otherwise enter any
property to enforce compliance with this code.
      D.   Inspection of buildings and premises - general rule. For the purpose
of safeguarding the health and safety of the general public and of the
occupants of all buildings or to determine compliance with the code, an order
or a permit or license, it is the duty of any authorized officer to conduct
inspections to determine the condition of the buildings and premises located
within the city. For the purpose of making the inspection, the authorized
officer is authorized to enter, examine and survey the building or premises at
all reasonable times.
         1.   Notice. Prior to making the inspection, the authorized officer
will inform the occupants of the building or premises to be inspected of the
date and time of the inspection by personal service or regular mail postmarked
not less than 48 hours prior to the time the inspection is made. The occupants
may also be notified by text message or email if they provide said information
for notification purposes.
         2.   Access. After the written notice has been given, the owner,
occupant or operator of the building will give the authorized officer free
access to the building and its premises, for the purpose of the inspection,
examination or survey, provided that the inspection, examination or survey must
not have for its purpose the harassment of the owner or occupant and the
inspection, examination or survey is made so as to cause the least amount of
inconvenience to the owner or occupant. If access is refused, the reason for
refusal of access will be given in writing.
         3.   Emergency access. The authorized officer must be allowed
immediate entry:
            a.    At any time when in the opinion of the authorized officer an
actual emergency tending to create an immediate danger to public health and
safety exists; or
            b.   At any time when the inspection, examination or survey may be
requested by the owner or occupant.
      E.   Application for search warrant. Upon a refusal of any owner or
occupant to permit the authorized officer access to a dwelling, dwelling unit
or premises to make an inspection, and upon a belief of probable cause that the
dwelling, dwelling unit or premises does not conform to the requirements of
this code, the authorized officer may make application to the appropriate court
for an order or warrant directing the inspection and search of the dwelling,
dwelling unit or premises for its conformity to the requirements of this code,
and any evidence or information from the inspection or search may be used in
any court proceedings.
      F.   Interference with official duties. It may be a crime to prevent,
delay or interfere with representatives of the city while they are engaged in
the performance of his or her duties.
   Subd. 4.   Compliance letter.
      A.   Contents of compliance letter. If a city employee or agent
determines that a city code violation has occurred, when appropriate, a
compliance letter shall be issued. The compliance letter shall contain the
following information:
         1.   A description or address of the property on which the city code
violation has occurred;
         2.   The nature of the violation, including a reference to the
appropriate city code section;
         3.   A compliance deadline, providing a reasonable time for compliance
based on the nature of the violation; and
         4.   A statement that failure to correct the violation may result in
the imposition of an administrative citation, including a civil penalty and
stating the amount of the penalty as provided in the fee schedule.
      B.   Service of compliance letter. The compliance letter may be served on
the offender by any one of the following methods: certified mail, regular mail
sent to the last known legal address, by personal service or by posting a copy
in a conspicuous place in or about the building or property affected by the
letter.
      C.   Exceptions to issuance of a compliance letter. For violations of any
of the following sections, the city shall not be required to issue a compliance
letter and may proceed directly to issuance of an administrative citation as
provided in division (E) below.
         1.   Repeat offender. If the same offender commits a subsequent
violation within 24 months after a compliance letter has been issued for a same
or similar offense.
         2.    License violations. For any license violations, including, but
not limited to, not having a license.
         3.   Fire prevention violations. For violations of Minnesota State
Fire Code.
         4.   Emergency situations. When a condition exists that requires
immediate action to protect the public health, safety and welfare.
         5.   Disorderly conduct or other similar behavior that tends to
disrupt, injure or annoy a reasonable person for which a compliance letter
would be moot, as the conduct or behavior has terminated.
   Subd. 5.   Administrative citation.
      A.   Generally.
         1.   Upon the failure to correct the violation specified in the
compliance letter within the time frame established in the compliance letter or
any extension thereof granted by the city, or for any offense for which a
compliance letter is not required, an administrative citation may be issued.
         2.   The administrative citation shall be served as required in Subd.
4, Subpar. B. of this section and shall contain the following information:
            a.   A description or address of the property on which the city
code violation has occurred;
            b.   Reference to the city code that is alleged to be violated;
            c.   The amount of the administrative civil penalty for the
specific city code violation, which shall be due and payable to the city within
30 days of the date the citation is mailed or personally served;
            d.   A statement that the violation must be corrected or a
subsequent administrative or criminal citation may be issued;
            e.   A statement that the city code violation and the amount of the
administrative civil penalty may be contested in the manner set forth in
Subd.4, Subpar. E.2. of this section; and
            f.   A statement that failure to pay the administrative civil
penalty may result in it being assessed against the property as provided in
M.S. Ch. 429, as it may be amended from time to time.
      B.   Payment of penalty and correction of violation. If the offender pays
the administrative civil penalty and corrects the city code violation, no
further action will be taken for that same violation. Subsequent (new)
violations within a 24 month period will be considered repeat offenses and
fines will be increased as follows:
         1.   Subsequent violations. If a second citation for a code offense is
issued by the city to the alleged violator and/or the owner of the property
upon which the violation has occurred within 24 months of the issuance of a
previous citation or the same code offense, the civil penalty shall increase by
25% over the scheduled civil penalty amount. If a third citation for a code
offense is issued by the city to the alleged violator and/or the owner of the
property upon which the violation has occurred within 24 months of the issuance
of a previous citation for the same code offense, the civil penalty shall
increase by 50% over the scheduled civil penalty amount. If a fourth citation
for a code offense is issued by the city to the alleged violator and/or the
owner of the property upon which the violation has occurred within 24 months of
the issuance of a previous citation for the same code offense, the civil
penalty shall increase by 100% over the scheduled civil penalty amount and
double thereafter to a maximum of $2,000.
         2.   Example. First offense is $100; Second offense is $125; Third
offense is $150, Fourth offense is $200; Fifth offense is $400; Sixth offense
is $800.
      C.   Payment of penalty without correction of violation. If the offender
pays the administrative civil penalty but fails to correct the city code
violation, the city may issue a subsequent administrative citation, initiate
criminal proceedings or initiate any other proceedings or remedies available in
order to enforce correction of the city code violation.
      D.   No payment of penalty and no correction of violation. The imposition
of one penalty for any violation shall not excuse the violation or permit it to
continue, and any person responsible for the violation shall correct or remedy
the violation or defect within the time required. If the offender fails to pay
the administrative civil penalty and fails to correct the city code violation,
the city may do any of the following, or any combination thereof:
         1.   Assess the administrative civil penalty against the property
pursuant to M.S. Ch. 429, as it may be amended from time to time;
         2.   Issue a subsequent administrative citation, thereby commencing a
new administrative penalties process. When not otherwise specified, each ten
days that prohibited conditions are maintained shall constitute a separate
offense;
         3.   Initiate criminal proceedings; and/or
         4.   Initiate other enforcement action authorized by law, including,
but not limited to, the enforced removal of prohibited conditions.
         5.   Failure to pay an administrative citation for which the costs
cannot be assessed shall be a misdemeanor.
      E.   Contesting the administrative citation.
         1.   An offender receiving an administrative citation may contest the
alleged city code violation.
         2.   In order to contest the administrative citation, the offender
must notify the City Clerk in writing within ten calendar days after the
citation is mailed or otherwise served, complete a hearing application stating
that the offender contests the alleged violation, and pay a $75 non-refundable
filing fee.
      F.   Administrative citation hearing.
         1.   Scheduling and notice of the hearing. After receipt of the
written notice to contest the citation as provided in Subpar. E. above, a
hearing before an independent hearing officer shall be scheduled to be held
within 60 days, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the parties. Notice of
the hearing must be served in person or by first class mail to the hearing
applicant at the address provided by the applicant, no less than 20 days in
advance of the scheduled hearing, unless a shorter timeline is a accepted by
both parties. Service shall be deemed complete upon deposition the notice of
hearing in the U.S. Mail properly addressed to the provided by the offender or
the last know legal address with postage prepaid.
         2.   Independent hearing officer. An independent hearing officer,
licensed to practice law in the State of Minnesota, shall preside over the
administrative citation hearing. The City Council will periodically approve a
list of individuals from which the City Administrator will randomly select a
hearing officer to hear and determine a matter for which the hearing is
requested. The person who has requested the hearing has a right to request, no
later than 15 days before the date of the hearing, that the assigned Hearing
Officer be removed from the case. One such request for each case will be
granted by the City Administrator. A subsequent request must be directed to the
assigned hearing officer who will decide whether the hearing officer can fairly
and objectively review the case. If such a finding is made, the Hearing Officer
shall assign another Hearing Officer. The Hearing Officer is not a judicial
officer, but is a public officer as defined by M.S. § 609.415. The Hearing
Officer shall not be a current or former employee of the city.
         3.   Conduct of the administrative citation hearing.
            a.   At the hearing, both parties may be represented by counsel,
shall have the opportunity to present testimony, shall be able to call and
question witnesses and introduce any exhibits; however, strict rules of
evidence shall not apply.
            b.   The hearing officer shall receive and give weight to the
evidence, including hearsay evidence.
            c.   The hearing shall be recorded and a full record of the
proceedings shall be maintained by the city according to its data retention
schedule.
         4.   Authority of hearing officer. The independent hearing officer has
the authority to do any of the following, or a combination thereof:
            a.   Make a finding that a violation has occurred;
            b.   Require compliance with the city code within a specified time
frame; and/or
            c.   Make a finding that no violation has occurred and dismiss the
administrative citation.
         5.   Decision and order.
            a.   The Hearing Officer may announce a decision at the conclusion
of the hearing or may take the matter under advisement.
            b.   The hearing officer shall issue a decision in the form of an
order and shall serve a written copy of the order upon the parties no later
than ten days after the hearing.
            c.   Any administrative civil penalty that the independent hearing
officer imposes must be paid to the city within the time frame established in
the order. If no date is specified, it must be paid within 30 days of the
hearing officer's order.
            d.   If the administrative civil penalty is not paid, the city may
assess the civil penalty against the owner's property pursuant to M.S. Ch. 429,
as it may be amended from time to time.
            e.   If the hearing officer determines that no violation occurred,
then the city may not proceed with criminal prosecution for the same act or
conduct.
         6.   Finding of violation and payment of costs of hearing. If the
violation is upheld, then the offender must pay for the cost of the hearing,
not to exceed $1,000.
         7.   Failure to appear. Failure to appear at the hearing shall result
in a default judgment against the party who fails to appear. If the offender
fails to appear, the administrative citation shall be sustained and the fee for
the cost of the hearing shall be imposed. If the city fails to appear, the
administrative citation shall be dismissed and the filing fee shall be
refunded.
      G.   Appeal. The hearing officer's decision is final and may only be
appealed to the Minnesota Court of Appeals.
      H.   Schedule of administrative civil penalties.
         1.   The city shall adopt a fee schedule of administrative civil
penalties for city code violations by resolution.
         2.   A violation of any provision of the city code is an
administrative offense which may be subject to an administrative citation and
civil penalties pursuant to this section.
         3.   The maximum amount of an administrative civil penalty, for each
separate offense, may not exceed twice the maximum fine authorized by state law
for misdemeanor offenses; or the maximum fine authorized by state law for an
administrative process.
      I.   Applicable laws. Where differences occur between provisions of this
chapter and other applicable code sections, this chapter applies.
(Ord. 642, passed 10-17-16)
§ 1.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Subd. 1.   Any person, firm or corporation who violates any provision of

interest of justice or to comply with the time requirements and on his or her
own motion or the motion of the appellant, the City Administrator or a member

§ 2.06 INTERIM EMERGENCY SUCCESSION.
   Subd. 1.   Purpose. Due to the existing possibility of a nuclear attack or a
natural disaster requiring a declaration of a state of emergency, it is found
urgent and necessary to insure the continuity of duly elected and lawful
leadership of the city to provide for the continuity of the government and the
emergency interim succession of key government officials by providing a method
for temporary emergency appointments to their offices.
   Subd. 2.   Succession to local offices.
      A.   In the event of a nuclear attack upon the United States or a natural
disaster affecting the vicinity of the city, the Mayor, Council and City
Administrator shall be forthwith notified by any one of the persons and by any
means available to gather at the City Hall. In the event that safety or
convenience dictate, an alternative place of meeting may be designated.
      B.   Those gathered shall proceed as follows:
         1.   By majority vote of those persons present, regardless of number,
they shall elect a Chairperson and Secretary to preside and keep minutes,
respectively.
         2.   They shall review and record the specific facts relating to the
nuclear attack or natural disaster and injuries to persons or damage to
property already done or the imminence thereof.
         3.   They may, based on such facts, declare a state of emergency.
         4.   By majority vote of those persons present, regardless of number,
they shall fill all positions on the Council, including the Office of Mayor, of
those persons upon whom notice could not be served or who are unable to be
present.
         5.   Such interim successors shall serve until such time as the duly
elected official is again available and returns to his or her position, or the
state of emergency has passed and a successor is designated and qualifies as
required by law, whichever shall occur first.
   Subd. 3.   Duties of the Interim Emergency Council. The Interim Emergency
Council shall exercise the powers and duties of their offices and appoint other
key government officials to serve during the emergency.
(`80 Code, § 2.06)
§ 2.07 ACCOUNTS, CLAIMS OR DEMANDS.
   Subd. 1.   Generally. Except as to an annual salary, fees of jurors or
witnesses fixed by law or wages or salaries of employees which have been fixed
on an hourly, daily, weekly or monthly basis by the Council and which, by law,
are authorized to be paid on a payroll basis, any account, claim or demand
against the city which can be itemized in the ordinary course of business, the
Council shall not audit or allow the claim until the person claiming payment,
or his or her agent, reduces it to writing, in items, and signs a declaration
to the effect that such account, claim or demand is just and correct and that
no part of it has been paid.
   Subd. 2.   Discretionary exception. The Council may, in its discretion,
allow a claim prepared by the City Administrator, prior to the declaration by
the claimant if the declaration is made on the check by which the claim is
paid.
   Subd. 3.   Form of declaration. The declaration provided for in Subd. 1
hereof is sufficient in the following form: “I declare under the penalties of
law that this account, claim or demand is just and correct and that no part of
it has been paid.                                  Signature of Claimant.”
   Subd. 4.   Form and effect of declaration on check.
      A.   The declaration provided for in Subd. 2 hereof shall be printed on
the reverse side of the check, above the space for endorsement thereof by the
payee, as follows: “The undersigned payee, in endorsing this check, declares

      E.   Sale; waiting periods.
         1.   Sale after 15 days. An impounded vehicle is eligible for disposal
or sale under subdivision 1.I., 15 days after notice to the owner, if the

subdivision; or
            b.   An abandoned vehicle.
         2.   Sale after 45 days. An impounded vehicle is eligible for disposal
or sale under subdivision 1.I., 45 days after notice to the owner, if the
vehicle is determined to be an unauthorized vehicle.
      F.   Notice of taking and sale.
         1.   Contents; notice given within five days. When an impounded
vehicle is taken into custody, the city or impound lot operator taking it into
custody shall give notice of the taking within five days. The notice shall:
            a.   Set forth the date and place of the taking; the year, make,
model and serial number of the impounded motor vehicle if the information can
be reasonably obtained; and the place where the vehicle is being held;
            b.   Inform the owner and any lienholders of their right to reclaim
the vehicle under subdivision 1.G.; and
            c.   State that failure of the owner or lienholders to exercise

title and interest in the vehicle and contents and a consent to the transfer of
title to and disposal or sale of the vehicle and contents pursuant to
subdivision 1.I.
         2.   Notice by mail or publication. The notice shall be sent by mail
to the registered owner, if any, of an impounded vehicle and to all readily
identifiable lienholders of record. The Department makes this information
available to impound lot operators for notification purposes. If it is
impossible to determine with reasonable certainty the identity and address of
the registered owner and all lienholders, the notice shall be published once in
a newspaper of general circulation in the area where the motor vehicle was
towed from or abandoned. Published notices may be grouped together for
convenience and economy.
         3.   Unauthorized vehicles; notice. If an unauthorized vehicle remains
unclaimed after 30 days from the date the notice was sent under subdivision

resulting from taking the vehicle into custody within 15 or 45 days, as
applicable under subdivision 1.E., after the date of the notice required by
subdivision 1.F.
         2.   Lienholders. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to impair
any lien of a garagekeeper under the laws of this state, or the right of a
lienholder to foreclose. For the purposes of this section, GARAGEKEEPER is an
operator of a parking place or establishment, an operator of a motor vehicle
storage facility, or an operator of an establishment for the servicing, repair

exceed the costs of:
            a.   Twenty-five days storage for a vehicle described in
subdivision 1.E.1.; and
            b.   Fifty-five days storage for a vehicle described in subdivision
1.E.2.
         2.   Implied consent to sale. A registered owner who fails to claim

to subdivisions 1.F. and 1.G.
            b.   The purchaser shall be given a receipt in a form prescribed by
the Registrar of Motor Vehicles which shall be sufficient title to dispose of
the vehicle. The receipt shall also entitle the purchaser to register the
vehicle and receive a certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
claims of ownership. Before a vehicle is issued a new certificate of title, it
must receive a motor vehicle safety check.
         2.   Unsold vehicles. Abandoned or junk vehicles not sold by the city
or public impound lots pursuant to subdivision 1.I.1. above shall be disposed
of in accordance with subdivision J.
         3.   Sale proceeds; public entities. From the proceeds of a sale under
this section by the city or public impound lot of an abandoned or unauthorized
motor vehicle, the city shall reimburse itself for the cost of towing,
preserving and storing the vehicle, and all administrative, notice and
publication costs incurred in handling the vehicle pursuant to this chapter.
Any remainder from the proceeds of a sale shall be held for the owner of the
vehicle or entitled lienholder for 90 days and then shall be deposited in the
treasury of the city.
         4.   Sale proceeds; nonpublic impound lots. The operator of a
nonpublic impound lot may retain any proceeds derived from a sale conducted
under the authority of subdivision 1.I.1. of this section. The operator may
retain all proceeds from sale of any personal belongings and contents in the
vehicle that were not claimed by the owner or the owner’s agent before the
sale, except that any suspected contraband or other items that likely would be
subject to forfeiture in a criminal trial must be turned over to the
appropriate law enforcement agency.
      J.   Disposal authority. The city may contract with others or may utilize
its own equipment and personnel for the inventory of impounded motor vehicles
and abandoned scrap metal and may utilize its own equipment and personnel for
the collection, storage and transportation of these vehicles and abandoned
scrap metal. The city may utilize its own equipment and personnel only for the
collection and storage of not more than five abandoned or unauthorized vehicles
without advertising for or receiving bids in any 120-day period.
      K.   Contracts; reimbursement by MPCA.
         1.   MPCA review and approval. If the city proposes to enter into a
contract with a person licensed by the MPCA pursuant to this section or a
contract pursuant to subdivision 1.J., the MPCA may review the proposed
contract before it is entered into by the city, to determine whether it
conforms to the MPCA’s plan for solid waste management and is in compliance
with MPCA rules. A contract that does so conform may be approved by the MPCA
and entered into by the city. Where a contract has been approved, the MPCA may
reimburse the city for the costs incurred under the contract that have not been
reimbursed under subdivision 1.I. Except as otherwise provided in subdivision
1.J., the MPCA shall not approve any contract that has been entered into
without prior notice to and request for bids from all persons duly licensed by
the MPCA to be a party to a disposal contract pursuant to M.S. § 116.07, as it
may be amended from time to time; does not provide for a full performance bond;
or does not provide for total collection and transportation of abandoned motor
vehicles, except that the MPCA may approve a contract covering solely
collection or transportation of abandoned motor vehicles where the MPCA
determines total collection and transportation to be impracticable and where
all other requirements herein have been met and the unit of government, after
proper notice and request for bids, has not received any bid for total
collection and transportation of abandoned motor vehicles.
         2.   The city may perform work. If the city utilizes its own equipment
and personnel pursuant to its authority under subdivision 1.J., and the use of
the equipment and personnel conforms to the MPCA’s plan for solid waste
management and is in compliance with MPCA rules, the city may be reimbursed by
the MPCA for reasonable costs incurred which are not reimbursed under
subdivision 1.I.
         3.   The city required to contract work. The MPCA may demand that the
city contract for the disposal of abandoned motor vehicles and other scrap
metal pursuant to the MPCA’s plan for solid waste disposal. If the city fails
to contract within 180 days of the demand, the MPCA, through the Department of
Administration and on behalf of the city, may contract with any person duly
licensed by the MPCA for the disposal.
   Subd. 2.   Disposal of unclaimed property.
      A.   Definition. For the purpose of this subdivision, the following
definition shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
         1.   ABANDONED PROPERTY. Tangible or intangible property that has
lawfully come into the possession of the city in the course of municipal
operations, remains unclaimed by the owner and has been in the possession of
the city for at least 60 days and has been declared such by a resolution of the
Council.
      B.   Preliminary notice. If the City Administrator knows the identity and
whereabouts of the owner, he or she shall serve written notice upon him or her
at least 30 days prior to a declaration of abandonment by the Council. If the
city acquired possession from a prior holder, the identity and whereabouts of
whom are known by the City Administrator notice shall also be served upon him
or her. The notice shall describe the property and state that, unless it is
claimed and proof of ownership or entitlement to possession established, the
matter of declaring it abandoned property will be brought to the attention of
the Council after the expiration of 30 days from the date of the notice.
      C.   Notice and sale. Upon adoption of a resolution declaring certain
property to be abandoned property, the City Administrator shall publish a
notice thereof describing the same, together with the names (if known) and
addresses (if known) of prior owners and holders thereof, and including a brief
description of the property. The text of the notice shall also state the time,
place and manner of sale of all such property, except cash and negotiables. The
notice shall be published once at least three weeks prior to sale. Sale shall
be made to the highest bidder at public auction or sale conducted in the manner
directed by the Council in its resolution declaring property abandoned and
stated in the notice.
      D.   Fund and claims thereon. All proceeds from such sale shall be paid
into the General Fund of the city and expenses thereof paid therefrom. The
former owner, if he or she makes claim within eight months from the date of
publication of the notice herein provided, and upon application and
satisfactory proof of ownership, may be paid the amount of cash or negotiables
or, in the case of property sold, the amount received therefor, less a pro rata
share of the expenses of storage, publication of notice and sale expenses, but
without interest. The payment shall be also made from the General Fund.
   Subd. 3.   Disposal of excess personal property.
      A. Declaration of surplus and authorizing sale of property. The City
Administrator may, from time to time, declare that certain personal property
(chattels) owned by the city is no longer needed for a municipal purpose and
should be sold. Upon such declaration, the following process should be
followed:
         1.   Surplus property with an estimated value of less than $5,000.
Upon declaration of property with an estimated value of less than $5,000 as no
longer needed for municipal purpose, the City Administrator may sell such item
by any means reasonably designed to maximize the sale price and minimize the
costs of sale, including a sale by negotiated price.
         2.   Surplus property with an estimated value between $5,000 and
$25,000.  Upon action of the Council authorizing the sale of the property with
an estimated value between $5,000 and $25,000, the City Administrator shall
offer for public sale, at auction, to the highest bidder. Notice of the public
sale shall be given stating the time and place of sale at least ten days prior
to the date of sale either by publication once in the official newspaper or by
posting in a conspicuous place in the City Hall at the City Administrator's
option. Such auction may be conducted in person, by sealed written bids, by
electronic means, or otherwise so long as the public has reasonable access to
such process and ability to bid. Such auction may be subject to a minimum price
or reserve price at the discretion of the City Administrator.
         3.   Surplus property with a total estimated value over $25,000.  Upon
action of the Council authorizing the sale of the property, the City
Administrator shall offer, for public sale at auction, to the highest bidder.
Notice of the public sale shall be given stating the time and the place of sale
and generally describing property to be sold at least ten days prior to the
date of the sale by publication once in the official newspaper. Such auction
shall be conducted either in person or by sealed written bids. Such auction may
be subject to a minimum price or reserve price at the discretion of the City
Administrator. Payment shall be due immediately after determination of the
winning bidder. If such payment is not received within 24 hours of
notification, the City Administrator may notify the next highest bidder or hold
a new auction at the discretion of the City Administrator.
      B.   In determining the estimated value of the property for purposes of
determining the proper method for sale, the City Administrator shall consider
reasonably available information having a bearing on value including condition,
age, and market conditions, and the City Administrator shall value such items
in lots consistent with how such property is customarily sold or purchased in
the prevailing market. For example, if the property is a set of items normally
bought and sold as a set, the estimated value shall be the value of the set and
the property shall be sold as a set. In contrast, if the property consists of
items customarily bought and sold separately, then the estimated value shall be
of each separate item, and each such item shall be sold individually.
      C.   Receipts from sales of surplus property. All receipts from sales of
surplus property under this section shall be placed in the General Fund.
      D.   Library Materials.  This section shall not apply to materials
formerly offered for check out by the Austin Public Library. Determinations
over both whether such items are no longer needed for library purposes and the
means for disposition of such items shall remain with the Library Board.

      A. No employee of the city, who is a member of the administrative staff,
a department head, a member of the Council or an advisor serving the city in a
professional capacity may be purchasers if they are not directly involved in
the sale, if they are the highest responsible bidder and if at least one week’s
published or posted notice of the sale is given.
      B. It is unlawful for any person to be a purchaser of property under this
section if the purchase is prohibited by the terms of this section.

§ 2.74 DEFERMENT OF SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS.
   Subd. 1.   The Council may defer the payment of any special assessment on
homestead property owned by a person who is 65 years of age or older or who is
retired by virtue of permanent and total disability and the City Administrator

as used in determining the eligibility for Section VIII housing.
   Subd. 2.   The deferment shall be granted for as long a period of time as

year and the total amount of principal and interest shall be certified to the
County Auditor for collection with taxes the following year. Should the
applicant plead and prove, to the satisfaction of the Council, that full
repayment of the deferred special assessment would cause the applicant
particular undue financial hardship, the Council may order that the applicant
pay, within 60 days, a sum equal to the number of installments of deferred
special assessments outstanding and unpaid to date, including principal and
interest, with the balance thereafter paid according to the terms and
conditions of the original special assessment.

      B.   The sale, transfer or subdivision of all or any part of the
property;

§ 2.75 ON-CALL PART-TIME FIREFIGHTERS.
   Preamble.  
Chapter 9 of the City Charter relating to the Fire Department authorizes the
City Council to create and maintain a Fire Department, employ such personnel as
may be needed and provide for the compensation and regulation of the personnel
to do all things necessary to operate the Fire Department. The Council has
determined that, in order to provide for the more efficient fighting of fires
in the city on a cost-effective basis and on a basis that provides adequate
personnel in order to fight fires within the city and vicinity and provide fire
protection to its citizens, it is advisable to employ as a supplement to the
full-time paid Firefighting Department of the city, on-call part-time
firefighters. The purpose of this section is to implement the establishment of
on-call part-time firefighters service as a part of the fire protection service
to be furnished in the city.
   Subd. 1.   There is hereby established, as an adjunct to the full-time
firefighters of the city, the employment of on-call part-time firefighters
service for the purpose of assisting the full-time firefighters in providing
fire protection in the city.
   Subd. 2.   The Austin Fire Commission is hereby requested to amend their
rules and regulations in order to provide for an additional classification
entitled “on-call part-time firefighter.” The city administration staff shall
cooperate with the Austin Fire Civil Service Commission in generating interest
in securing applications for such positions; the testing for such positions and
the presentation of those candidates highest on the eligibility list for
consideration for appointment by the Council as is currently provided in the
rules of the Austin Civil Service Commission and state statutes. The Fire Civil
Service Commission shall test a sufficient number of applicants so as to
provide currently 20 on-call part-time firefighters. The Chief of the Fire
Department shall provide requirements for the proper training of the personnel
as are finally selected and along with the Austin Fire Commission establish
minimal standards of training and a reasonable probationary period after
completing training in order to assure that such candidates are suitable and
qualified to assist the full-time Fire Department in fighting fires and
providing other fire protection services as needed by the citizens of the city
and surrounding vicinity from time to time.
   Subd. 3.   The City Administrator shall establish certain time schedules for
the completion of testing and presentation of candidates to the Council for
final selection. After the original 20 have been hired as on-call part-time
firefighters, thereafter the Fire Commission shall test candidates as may be
required from time to time in order to have available to the city eligible
candidates for serving as on-call part-time firefighters.
   Subd. 4.   The compensation to be paid to such on-call part-time
firefighters shall be established by resolution of the Council from time to
time as needed. The Fire Department shall be responsible for continued training
of the on-call firefighters as may be necessary in order to maintain their
fire-fighting skills so as to continue to be efficient and qualified
firefighters to provide the necessary fire protection for the citizens of the
city and surrounding vicinity.
   Subd. 5.   The City Administrator, together with the Chief of the Fire
Department, shall cause to be developed for the on-call part-time firefighters,
a volunteer fire relief association for which the members would be eligible to
join or develop such other suitable deferred compensation plan as may be
authorized by law. No such plan shall be effected until approved by the
Council. The on-call part-time firefighters shall not be eligible to join the
Fire Relief Association presently established for certain firefighters not
covered by P.E.R.A. for public safety employees.
   Subd. 6.   Persons who are employed as full-time firefighters by the city or
as full-time officers of the Fire Department shall not be eligible to serve as
on-call part-time firefighters. All other full-time city employees are eligible
to serve as part-time on-call firefighters providing they are certified as
eligible for appointment pursuant to the rules of the Austin Fire Civil Service
Commission and state law.

hereby required at the owner’s expense to install suitable service connection
to the public sewer in accordance with the provisions of this section, within
90 days after date of official notice to do so.
      E.   In the event an owner shall fail to connect to a public sewer in
compliance with a notice given under Subpar. D above, the city may undertake to
have the connection made and shall assess the cost thereof against the
benefitted property. The assessment shall be a lien against the property. The
assessment, when levied, shall bear interest at the rate determined by the
Council and shall be certified to the Auditor of the county and shall be
collected and remitted to the city in the same manner as assessments for local
improvements. The rights of the city shall be in addition to any remedial or
enforcement provisions of this section.
   Subd. 3.   Private wastewater disposal.
      A.   Where a public sanitary sewer is not available under the provisions
of Subd. 2, Subpar. D, the building sewer shall be connected to a private
wastewater disposal system complying with the provisions of the City/County
Sanitation Code.
      B.   The owner(s) shall operate and maintain the private wastewater
disposal facilities in a sanitary manner at all times, at no expense to the
city.
      C.   No statement contained in this section shall be construed to
interfere with any additional requirements that may be imposed by the City
Sanitarian or the state.
   Subd. 4.   Building sewers and connections.
      A.   It is unlawful for any unauthorized person to uncover, make any
connections with or opening into, use, alter or disturb any public sewer or
appurtenance thereof without first obtaining a written permit from the
approving authority.
      B.   All costs and expenses incidental to the installation and connection
of the building sewer shall be borne by the owner(s). The owner(s) shall
indemnify the city from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be
occasioned by the installation of the building sewer.
      C.   A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for
every building unless written permission for an alternative is obtained from
the city. The city does not and will not assume any obligation or
responsibility for damage caused by or resulting from any such single
connection aforementioned.
      D.   Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings
only when they are found, on examination and test by the approving authority,
to meet all requirements of this section. Old building sewers shall be free of
the following: joint degradation, as evidence by root intrusions and mineral
staining, scaling and deposits; prohibited discharges or connections as defined
in Subpar. G below, misaligned joints obstructing the flow of wastewater
causing blockages, exfiltration of the intrusion of roots or minerals; or
holes, cracks or fractures, collapses or other structural defects.
Additionally, sections defined as “building drain” which are from the inner
wall to outside of the building shall meet the criteria above and all
connections to the public collection system.
      E.   The size, slope, alignment, materials of construction of a building
sewer and the methods to be used in excavating, placing of the pipe, jointing,
testing and backfilling the trench shall all conform to the requirements of the
Building and Plumbing Codes or other applicable rules and regulations of the
city.
      F.   Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the
building at an elevation below the basement floor. In all buildings in which
any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer,
sanitary wastewater carried by the building drain shall be lifted by an
approved means and discharged to the building sewer.
      G. No person(s) shall make connection of roof downspouts, foundation
drains, areaway drains, sump pumps or other sources of surface runoff or ground
water to a building sewer or building drain which in turn is connected directly
or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer unless the connection is approved by
the approving authority. Where a sump pit exists in any such building, it shall
have a pump installed; no empty pits shall be permitted. The sump shall have a
permanently- installed discharge line which provides for a year-round discharge
connection to the city subdrain/storm sewer system or exterior surface
discharge point, or as otherwise approved by the city. Such discharge line
shall consist of a rigid pipe (PVC, copper, or galvanized) discharge line
inside the structure, without valving or quick connections for altering the
path of discharge and, if connected to the city subdrain/storm sewer system,
shall include a check valve. No discharge shall be directed so as to impact
neighboring properties or any city street, sidewalk or right-of-way. The city
may allow installation of a locked “winter/summer” valve in individual
circumstances to abate nuisance icing where no subdrain/storm sewer and other
reasonable alternative exists, only with review and express permission of the
city.
      H.   The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall
conform to the requirements of the Building and Plumbing Codes or other
applicable rules and regulations of the city. All such connections shall be
made gastight and watertight and verified by proper testing. Any deviation from
the prescribed procedures and materials must be approved by the approving
authority before installation.
      I.   The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the
approving authority when the building sewer is ready for inspection and
connection to the public sewer. The connection and testing shall be made under
the supervision of the approving authority.
      J.   All excavations for building sewer installation shall be adequately
guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard.
Streets, sidewalks, parkways and other public property disturbed in the course
of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the approving
authority.
      K.   A portion of the construction cost, as well as the cost of
maintaining (in the form of construction and replacement) the municipal
sanitary sewer system shall be recovered by the imposition of special
assessments pursuant to M.S. Chapter 429; a sewer connection or availability
charge, as described herein, and as authorized under M.S. Chapter 444; through
a general expenditure of city funds; or a combination of all three.
         1.   Sanitary sewer permit fee. A sanitary sewer permit fee, as
determined from time to time by the City Council, shall be collected when a
user connects to the existing infrastructure and receives the benefit of the
downstream sanitary sewer system, lift stations and waste water treatment
plant. The fee structure will be based on a residential equivalent unit (REU).
The City Engineer shall determine the appropriate REU’s of the user based upon
factors that may include the property’s classification as an industrial,
commercial, nonresidential or residential property, or similar factors.
         2.   Sewer lateral development charges. A sewer lateral development
charge, as determined from time to time by the City Council, shall be collected
when a user connects to that portion of a public sewer system that has been
extended from a point on the existing sanitary sewer collection system where
the extension has not been paid for by a private developer or through prior
assessments. Before a permit shall be issued, the city shall determine that one
of the following conditions exists:
            a.   The lot or tract of land to be served by such connection has
been assessed for the cost of construction of the sanitary sewer main with
which the connection is made;
            b.   If no special assessment has been levied for such construction
costs, the proceedings for levying the special assessment will be completed in
due course;
            c.   If no special assessment has been levied, and no special
assessment proceedings will be completed in due course, a sum equal to the
portion of cost of construction of the sanitary sewer main which would be
assessable against said lot or tract has been paid to the city;
            d.   The cost of construction of the sanitary sewer main with which
the connection is made has been paid for by the owner of the lot or tract of
land to be served by the connection, or by any developer as part of the
creation of said lot or tract; or
            e.   If none of the above conditions are met, no permit to connect
to any sanitary sewer main shall be issued unless the applicant shall pay a
sewer lateral development charge, determined from time to time by the City
Council, to be the just and equitable charges for the use and availability of
the sewer facilities and connections with them, such charges to be determined
by the City Engineer and the City Council to be as nearly as possible
proportionate to the cost of furnishing the service.
         3.   Sewer service charge. A sewer service charge, as determined from
time to time by the City Council, shall be collected when a user connects to
the dedicated sewer service that has been extended from the sewer main to
within ten feet of his or her property line of a designated lot. Before a
permit shall be issued, the city shall determine that one of the conditions
identified in K(2)(a) through K(2)(e) above exists.
(Ord. 620, passed 7-21-14)
   Subd. 5.   Use of the public sewers.
      A.   It is unlawful for any person to discharge or cause to be discharged
any unpolluted waters such as stormwater, ground water, roof runoff, subsurface
drainage or cooling water to any sewer. Stormwater runoff from limited areas,
which may be polluted at times, may be discharged to the sanitary sewer by
permission of the approving authority.
      B.   Stormwater other than that exempted under Subpar. A above and all
other unpolluted drainage shall be discharged to sewers as are specifically
designated storm sewers or to a natural outlet approved by the approving

facilities including but not limited to waste streams with a closed cup
flashpoint of less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit or 60 degrees Celsius using the
test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21;
         5.   Pollutants that result in the presence of toxic solids, liquids,
gases, vapors or fumes in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction
with other wastes, to injure or interfere with any waste treatment process,
constitute a hazard to humans or animals, create a public nuisance, result in a
violation of state of federal water quality standards or create any hazard in
the collection system, wastewater treatment facilities or the receiving waters;
         6.   Any waters or wastes having a pH lower than 5.5, or higher than
9.5, or having any other corrosive property, capable of causing damage or
hazard to structures, equipment and personnel of the collection system or
wastewater treatment facilities (exceptions may be granted by the approving
authority for short duration flows where it has been or can be shown that high
or low pH would not cause any significant wastewater process problems);
         7.    Solid or viscous pollutants in amounts or of a size causing
obstruction to the flow in sewers or interference with the operation of the
wastewater treatment facilities such as, but not limited to ashes, bones,
cinders, sand, mud, straw, shavings, metal, glass, rags, feathers, tar,
plastics, wood, unground garbage, whole blood, paunch manure, hair and
fleshings, entrails, paper dishes, cups, milk containers and the like, either
whole or after passage through garbage grinders;
         8.   Wastewater having a temperature higher than 105 degrees
Fahrenheit or 65 degrees Celsius or heat in amounts that will inhibit
biological activity at the wastewater treatment facilities resulting in
interference but in no case heat in such quantities that the temperature at the
headworks of the wastewater treatment facilities exceeds 104 degrees Fahrenheit
or 40 degrees Celsius unless the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency upon
request of the approving authority approves alternative temperature limits;
         9.   Petroleum oil, non-biodegradable cutting oil or products of
mineral oil origin in amounts that will cause interference with the collection
system, or interference or pass through at the wastewater treatment facilities
or in concentrations greater than 25 milligrams per liter;
         10.   Any pollutant including oxygen demanding pollutants such as
biochemical oxygen demand released in a discharge at a flow rate or pollutant
concentration that will cause pass through or interference at the wastewater
treatment facilities;
         11.   Any garbage that has not been properly shredded (garbage
grinders may be connected to sanitary sewers from homes, hotels, institutions,
restaurants, hospitals, catering establishments or similar places where garbage
originates from the preparation of food in kitchens for the purpose of
consumption on the premises or consumption elsewhere when served by caterers);
and
         12.   Any water or wastes which, by interaction with other water or
wastes in the public sewer system, release obnoxious gases, form suspended
solids which interfere with the collection system or create a condition
deleterious to structures and treatment processes.
      D.   The following described substances, materials, waters, or wastes
shall be limited in discharges to municipal systems to concentrations or
quantities which will not harm either the sewers, wastewater treatment process
or equipment, will not have an adverse effect on the receiving stream or will
not otherwise endanger lives, limb, public property or constitute a nuisance.
The approving authority may set limitations lower than the limitations
established in the regulations below if, in its opinion, the more severe
limitations are necessary to meet the above objectives. In forming the opinion
as to the acceptability, the approving authority will give consideration to the
factors as the quantity of subject waste in relation to flows and velocities in
the sewers, materials of construction of the sewers, the wastewater treatment
process employed, capacity of the wastewater treatment plant, degree of
treatability of the waste in the wastewater treatment plant and other pertinent
factors. The limitations or restrictions on materials or characteristics of
waste or wastewater discharged to the sanitary sewer which shall not be
violated without approval of the approving authority are as follows:
         1.   Wastewater from industrial plants containing oil, fat or grease
(FOG), in excess of concentrations permitted by the approving authority;
discharges of FOG from food service establishments (FSEs) are regulated per
Subd. 15 below.
         2.   Any waters or wastes containing iron, chromium, copper, zinc and
similar objectionable or toxic substances to a degree that any such material
received in the composite wastewater at the wastewater treatment works exceeds
the limits established by the approving authority for the materials;
         3.   Any waters or wastes containing odor-producing substances
exceeding limits which may be established by the approving authority;
         4.   Any radioactive material of a half-life or concentration as may
exceed limits established by the approving authority or applicable state and
federal regulations;
         5.   Quantities of flow, concentration or both, which constitute a
slug, as defined herein; and
         6.   Waters or waste containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the wastewater treatment processes employed, or are
amenable to treatment only to a degree that the wastewater treatment facilities
effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction
over discharge to the receiving waters.
      E.   If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be
discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess
the characteristics enumerated in Subpar. D of this subdivision, and which in
the judgment of the approving authority may have a deleterious effect upon the
wastewater facilities, processes, equipment or receiving waters or which
otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the
approving authority may:
         1.   Reject the wastes;
         2.   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
the public sewer;
         3.   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/
or
         4.   Require payment to cover added cost of handling and treating the
wastes not covered by existing taxes or service changes. If the approving
authority permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the design
and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the review and
approval of the approving authority.
      F.   For industrial users. FOG and sand interceptors shall be provided
when, in the opinion of the approving authority, they are necessary for the
proper handling of liquid wastes containing FOG in excessive amounts, as
specified in Subpar. D, Item 1 hereof, or any flammable wastes, sand or other
harmful ingredients, except that the interceptors shall not be required for
private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type
and capacity approved by the approving authority and shall be located as to be
readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. In the maintaining
of these interceptors, the owner(s) shall be responsible for the proper removal
and disposal by appropriate means of the captured material and shall maintain
records of the dates and means of disposal which are subject to review by the
approving authority. Any removal and hauling of the collected materials not
performed by owner’s personnel must be performed by currently licensed waste
disposal firms.
      G.   Where pretreatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided or
required for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in
satisfactory and effective operation by the owner, at his or her expense.
      H.   When required by the approving authority, the owner of any property
serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial or domestic wastewater shall
install a suitable structure together with the necessary meters and other
appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and
measurement of the wastes. The structure, when required, shall be accessibly
and safely located and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved
by the approving authority. The structure shall be installed by the owner, at
his or her expense, and shall be maintained by him or her so as to be safe and
accessible at all times.
      I.   All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of
waters and wastes to which reference is made in this section shall be
determined in accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the
Examination of Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health
Association. Sampling methods, location times, durations and frequencies are to
be determined on an individual basis subject to approval by the approving
authority.
      J.   New connections to the sanitary sewer system shall be prohibited
unless sufficient capacity is available in all downstream facilities,
including, but not limited to capacity for flow, BOD and suspended solids.
      K.   It is unlawful for any person, unless authorized, to uncover, make
any connection with or opening into, use, alter or disturb any sanitary or
storm sewer within the city or any part of the city wastewater facilities.
      L.   No sanitary or storm sewers shall be constructed in the city, except
house or building service sewers, except by the city or by others in accordance
with plans and specifications approved by a professional engineer. No sewers
shall be constructed or considered to be part of the public sewer system unless
accepted by the city.
      M.   The size, slope, alignment, material of construction, methods to be
used in excavation, placing of pipe, jointing, testing, backfilling and other
work connected with the construction of sewers shall conform to the
requirements of the city.
      N.   Individual control mechanism agreement.
         1.   The city may require industrial users discharging waste water
into the city wastewater treatment system to enter into an individual control
mechanism agreement. The city shall not require an agreement if the Director
determines that the waste water has an insignificant impact to the city’s
system. Entering into an individual control mechanism agreement shall not
relieve the industrial user from any obligation to obtain any hazardous waste
license required by other authorities or to comply with any other local, state,
or federal requirements regarding waste disposal. The criteria utilized by the
Director to determine if an individual control mechanism agreement will be
required include:
            a.   An average flow loading greater than 25,000 gallons per
operating day;
            b.   Has prohibitive discharge properties;
            c.   Has been pretreated or passed through an equalization tank
before discharge;
            d.   A hydraulic or organic loading greater than 5% of the average
dry weather capacity of the WWTF;
            e.   An industrial process regulated by EPA categorical standards;
or
            f.   Others as designated by the city as defined in 40 CFR 402.12
(a).
         2.   Among other things, the individual control mechanism agreement
shall include those requirements provided for in Subd. 5, Subpar. E above as
may be required by the approving authority.
         3.   The city may require that the industrial user provide compliance
schedules and reports as the Director deems necessary to determine that the
industrial user has complied with this subdivision and any requirements set
forth in the individual control mechanism agreement.
         4.   Outlying jurisdictions entering into individual control mechanism
agreements with the city shall be responsible for implementing a pretreatment
program that complies with the requirements of Chapter 3 of the City Code.
         5.   At a minimum each individual control mechanism agreement shall
contain the following conditions:
            a.   A statement of duration, which must be no more than five
years;
            b.   A statement of non-transferability without, at a minimum,
prior notification to the POTW authority and provisions of a copy of the
existing control mechanism to the new owner or operator;
            c.   Effluent limits, including best management practices, based on
applicable required pretreatment standards in Minnesota Rules, part 7049.0650;
            d.   Self-monitoring, sampling, reporting, notification, and record
keeping requirements, including an identification of the pollutants to be
monitored, including the process for seeking a waiver for a pollutant neither
present nor expected to be present in the discharge according to Minnesota
Rules, part 7049.0570, subpart 3, or a specific waived pollutant in the case of
an individual control mechanism; sampling location; sampling frequency; and
sample type, based on the applicable required pretreatment standards as
specified in Minnesota Rules, part 7049.0650;
            e.   A statement of applicable civil and criminal penalties for
violation of required pretreatment standards and requirements and any
applicable compliance schedule. The schedule may not extend the compliance date
beyond applicable federal deadlines; and
            f.   Requirements to control slug discharges, if determined by the
POTW to be necessary.
         6.   The individual control mechanism agreement shall require that
categorical industrial users must comply with the national categorical
standards of the Environmental Protection Agency of the U.S.; further must
require that industrial users must comply with all federal and state
pretreatment rules and regulations.
(Ord. 597, passed 9-17-12)
   Subd. 6.   Protection from damage.
      A.   It is unlawful for any person to maliciously, willfully or
negligently break, damage, destroy, uncover, deface or tamper with any
structure, appurtenance or equipment which is a part of the wastewater
facilities.
      B.   Any person violating this provision shall be subject to immediate
arrest under charge of disorderly conduct.
   Subd. 7.   Powers and authority of inspectors.
      A.   Duly authorized employees of the city bearing proper credentials and
identification shall be permitted to enter all properties for the purposes of
inspection, observation, measurement, sampling and testing pertinent to
discharge to any public sewer or natural outlet in accordance with the
provisions of this section. Sampling pertaining to industry will reflect the
number of days an industry is not operating as well as the days in operation
and discharging waste to a public sewer. The owner of any dwelling, building,
or other structure shall have a period of 30 days from the date the city sends
a written notice to the owner requesting admittance to the owner’s property for
an inspection, to either allow a city inspection of the property, or to
contract with a licensed plumber to perform the inspection, and notify the city
of the results thereof. Such inspection, whether performed by the city
inspector, or by the licensed plumber hired by the property owner, shall be
completed within said 30-day period. Upon completion of a city inspection of a
property, or upon the city’s receipt of an inspection form from the licensed
plumber hired by the owner of the property. If the city has determined that any
such property is improperly discharging storm water into the city sanitary
sewer system, or the building sewer condition shall be compliant as defined in
§
3.30, Subd. 4, Subpar. D, then the owner shall have a period of 90 days from
the date the city sends such written notice to the owner, to obtain a plumbing
permit, and to disconnect the owner’s sump pump or other prohibited discharge
into the city sanitary sewer system, and to request re-inspection, certifying
that all work necessary to disconnect the owner’s sump pump or other prohibited
discharge from said property into the city sanitary sewer system has been
completed. All work that is necessary to comply with the provisions of this
subdivision which requires the issuance of any plumbing, building, or other
permit under this code shall be inspected by the city inspection services
division for compliance with all applicable city code requirements. If owner
leases the subject property, owner has a duty to provide these notices to every
tenant of the property. No lease or other contract purporting to shift
maintenance or repair obligations to a tenant shall relieve owner’s obligations
to the city to comply with these regulations. Tenants in any property within
the city have an obligation to cooperate with the owner and the city, utilities
and their designees with respect to the completion of any required inspections
or necessary modifications.
      B.   The approving authority or other duly authorized employees are
authorized to obtain information concerning industrial processes which have a
direct bearing on the kind and source of discharge to the wastewater collection
system.
      C.   While performing the necessary work on private properties referred
to in Subpar. A above, duly authorized employees of the city shall observe
safety rules applicable to the premises established by the company, the company
shall be held harmless for injury or death to the city employees and the city
shall indemnify the company against loss or damage to its property by city
employees and against liability claims or demands for personal injury or
property damage asserted against the company and growing out of the gauging and
sampling operations, except as such may be caused by negligence or failure of
the company to maintain safe conditions, as required in Subd. 5, Subpar. H.
      D.   Duly authorized employees of the city bearing proper credentials and
identification shall be permitted to enter all private properties through which
the city holds a duly negotiated easement for the purposes of, but not limited
to inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, repair and maintenance of
any portion of the wastewater facilities lying within the easement. All entry
and subsequent work, if any, on the easement, shall be done in full accordance
with the terms of the duly negotiated easement pertaining to the private
property involved.
      E.   Confidential information.
         1.   User information obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit
applications, permits, monitoring programs, and from inspections shall be
available to the public or other governmental agencies without restriction
unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate that the
release of the information would divulge information, processes, or methods of
production entitled to protection as trade secrets.
         2.   When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of
a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be
made available for inspection by the public but shall be made available upon
written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this subdivision,
the NPDES permit, state disposal system permit, and/or the pretreatment
programs, provided that the portions of a report shall for available for use by
the state or any state agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings
involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and
characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information.
         3.   Information accepted by the city as confidential shall not be
transmitted to any governmental agency or to the general public by the Director
until and unless a ten day notification is given to the user.
(Ord. 597, passed 9-17-12)
   Subd. 8.   Penalties. 
      A.   Administrative fines. Notwithstanding any other subdivision of this
section, any user who is found to have violated any provision of this section,
individual control mechanism agreements, or permits and orders issued
hereunder, shall be fined in an amount not to exceed $1,000 per violation. Each
day on which noncompliance shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate
and distinct violation. Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall constitute a
lien against the individual user’s property. Industrial users desiring to
dispute the fines must file a request for the City Finance Director to
reconsider the fine within ten days of being notified of the fine. When the
City Finance Director believes a request has merit, the Finance Director shall
convene a hearing on the matter within 30 days of receiving the request from
the industrial user.
      B.   Criminal penalties. Any person violating any of the provisions of
this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall
be furnished by a fine of not more than $1,000, or by imprisonment for not to
exceed 90 days, or both.
      C.   Costs. In addition to the penalties provided herein, the city may
recover court costs, court reporter’s fees and other expenses of litigation by
an appropriate action against the person found to have violated this section or
the orders, rules, regulations, and permits issued hereunder.
      D.   Costs of damage. Any person violating any of the provisions of this
section shall become liable to the city for any expense, loss, or damage. The
Director may add to the user’s charges and fees the costs assessed for any
cleaning, repair, or replacement work caused by the violation or discharge. Any
refusal to pay the assessed costs shall constitute a violation of this section.
      E.   Falsifying information. Any person who knowingly makes false
statements, representation or certification in any application, record, report,
plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this
section, or an individual control mechanism agreement, or who falsifies,
tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method
required under this section, shall upon conviction, be punished by a fine of
not more than $1,000 or by imprisonment for not more that 90 days, or both.
(Ord. 597, passed 9-17-12)
   Subd. 9.   Sewer service charges.
      A.   Persons discharging wastewater to the city sanitary sewer system in
accordance with the provisions of this section shall be charged monthly on the
basis of the volume and strength of wastewater discharged. The monthly service
charge will include a user charge component (to meet all costs associated with
operation, maintenance and replacement of the wastewater collection and
treatment facilities) and a debt retirement component (to meet facility
construction costs). The actual service charge shall be based upon four cost
causative elements: flow, BOD, suspended solids and administration.
Administration costs shall include all costs (such as billing costs, insurance
costs and infiltration/inflow related costs) that are judged to be equitably
recovered on a uniform monthly minimum or connection type charge. That is,
administration costs are not a variable among various users since these costs
are not a function of the amount of wastewater discharged by a particular user.
      B.   As an equitable share of the expenses incurred by the city in the
construction, administration, operation, maintenance and replacement of the
sewerage works, each user will pay to the city a monthly amount based upon the
following formula:
A = M + (f)(F) + (b)(B) + (ss)(S) + R + I/I Surcharge
         1.   A = Service charge to user, with units of $/month.
         2.   M = Average city per connection cost for administration.
         3.   f = Average city unit cost of wastewater collection and
treatment, with units of $/100 cubic feet.
         4.   F = Volume of wastewater from user with units of 100 cubic feet
per month (often assumed equal to metered water usage).
         5.   b = Average city unit cost of wastewater treatment chargeable to
BOD, with units of $/lb of BOD.
         6.   B = Weight of BOD contributed by user, with units of lb BOD per
month.
         7.   SS = Average city unit cost of wastewater treatment chargeable to
suspended solids, with units of $/lb suspended solids.
         8.   S = Weight of suspended solids contributed by user, with units of
pound of SS per month.
         9.   R = Monthly amount of required federal grant repayments, in
accordance with regulations applying to grant funds received by the city. R =
zero for non-industrial users and may also equal zero for industrial users,
depending upon applicable federal regulations.
         10.   I/I Surcharge = Any owner who fails to comply with the
requirements of this code relating to prohibited clear water discharge to
sanitary sewer shall pay a monthly surcharge on the property owner’s city sewer
bill in the amount set by City Council annually. Said surcharge shall commence
on the first day of the month following the expiration of the 30-day period set
forth for inspections, or the 90-day period set forth for correction of
deficiencies, as applicable, when either the property owner has failed to
timely allow a city inspection or has failed to timely correct any illegal
connections to the city sanitary sewer system. Such surcharge shall continue to
be imposed on the owner’s city sanitary sewer bill for as long as the property
owner continues to own the property without complying with the requirements of
this code. This monthly surcharge is intended to offset the added cost to the
city associated with having the city wastewater collection, conveyance, and
treatment system process clear or clean water (inflow/infiltration)
unnecessarily, when the status of the property owner’s connection or non-
connection to the city sanitary sewer system cannot be ascertained, or when the
owner has failed to timely disconnect any discharge of storm water to the city
sanitary sewer system.
      C.   Average city unit costs shall be computed annually and shall include
operation and maintenance costs, including replacement costs, and annual
construction costs. Costs shall be distributed initially as follows:
 
Cost Causative Element Debt or Construction Operation and Maintenance
Flow                   40%                  34%
BOD                    25%                  16%
Suspended solids       35%                  35%
Administration         Zero                 15%
Total                  100%                 100%
 
         1.   This distribution will be applied annually until changes in the
actual cost revenue pattern render another distribution more equitable.
         2.   Initial unit cost figures for the service charge will be
established by Council resolution. Computations supporting unit cost figures
(f, b and SS) and service charges shall be revised annually.
         3.   Industrial cost recovery figures are not applicable at the date
of enactment of this section.
         4.   All users discharging normal strength domestic wastewater shall
be billed a fixed amount “M” per month per sewer connection (to cover
administrative and infiltration/inflow related costs), plus a fixed rate per
100 cubic feet of metered water used. Minimum billing shall be “M” per month,
per sewer connection. The value of “M” will be established by Council
resolution.
         5.   All users discharging wastewater with a strength lower than that
of normal strength domestic wastewater shall be billed for a normal strength
domestic wastewater discharge. That is, no allowances will be made in billing
users that discharge a diluted or low strength wastewater.
         6.   All users which discharge wastewater above the normal strength of
domestic wastewater shall be billed at the rates shown in the unit cost figures
established by Council resolution. Industrial users that discharge above normal
strength domestic wastewater shall be billed monthly based upon the volume of
wastewater, the pounds of BOD and the pounds of suspended solids discharged.
Monthly bills shall be computed as follows:
Service Charge = “M” + f(Monthly flow) + b(lb BOD/month)(lb SS/month)
            a.   f, b and SS have the meaning noted in Subpar. B and values as
established by Council resolution.
         7.   Each user of the city sewer system that does not have a metered
source of water must install an accurate water or wastewater flow metering
device (at user’s expense) that will serve as a basis for estimating the volume
of wastewater discharged and determining the sewer service charge.
         8.   All users of city water that is not discharged to the city
sanitary sewer system may install a separate water system and meter (one only
in the same building as the main meter) to isolate and meter non-sewered water
for which no service charge is required. If, at any time after this independent
system is installed, water from this system enters the sanitary sewer system,
the user shall be subject to the penalties of Subd. 8 and shall be ordered to
eliminate the independent system if this violation is continued.
         9.   If necessary, the federal grant funds received by the city for
purposes of treating industrial wastewater shall be recovered by the city
during the treatment facility service life. Cost recovery amounts shall be
shown as a specific portion of the regular sewer service billing received by
the industry, when and if the amounts are required by federal grant
regulations.
         10.   In no case will an industrial user’s monthly bill be less than
“M,” per sewer connection, plus the fixed normal strength domestic wastewater
rate/100 cubic feet of wastewater discharged. Computations used in the
development and subsequent adjustments of all of the above mentioned rates are
on file in the City Engineer’s office and are available for review.
      D.   To insure the required financial surveillance, the City
Administrator shall annually review the cash flows associated with providing
wastewater treatment service for the city and shall report the findings to the
Council at the first April meeting of each year. Any inequities and/or
shortages of revenue caused by unforeseen changes in the cost revenue pattern
of the wastewater treatment facilities shall be remedied immediately by a
Council resolution adjusting the unit cost figures. Adjusted unit figures shall
be computed in accordance with the principals of this subdivision.
      E.   Wastewater service charges provided for in this section shall be
included as a separate item on the regular bill for water. Charges shall be
paid at the same time that the water charges of the person become due. The city
shall annually notify all users what portion of the service charge is necessary
to meet the operation, maintenance and replacement costs (user charge) and what
portion is necessary to meet long term debt (debt service charge).
      F.   
Chapter 3, §§
3.01 through
3.05, shall apply for failure of any person to pay monthly bills for the
established sewer service charge when due or repeated discharge of prohibited
waste to the city sanitary sewer system.
      G.   The Council may, by resolution, adopt a policy for excluding summer
season non-sewered water usage (residential lawn and garden irrigation water)
from the volume utilized in computing the residential sewer service charge.
(Ord. 19, Second Series, passed 1-1-82)
   Subd. 10.   Applicability. This section shall apply to the city and to
persons outside the city who are, by contract or agreement with the city, users
of the city wastewater treatment facility.
(Ord. 597, passed 9-17-12)
   Subd. 11.   Remedies.
      A.   Remedies available. The Director may suspend the sewer system when
the suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the Director, in order to stop
an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, the environment,
or the city wastewater treatment system, or would cause the city to violate any
condition of the NPDES or state disposal system permit. Any user notified of a
suspension of the sewer system service shall immediately stop the discharge. In
the event of a failure of the user to comply voluntarily with the suspension
order, the Director shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including
immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to
the city wastewater treatment system or endangerment to any individuals. The
Director shall reinstate the sewer system service upon proof of the elimination
of the noncomplying discharge.
      B.   Notification of violation. Whenever the Director finds that any
person has violated or is violating this section, has breached an individual
control mechanism agreement or any prohibition, limitation or requirement
contained herein, the Director may serve upon such person a written notice
stating the nature of the violation. Within ten days of the date of the notice,
a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted to the city
by the user.
      C.   Show cause hearing; notice of hearing. If the violation is not
corrected by timely compliance, the Director may order any user which causes or
allows any unauthorized discharge to show cause before the City Council why the
proposed enforcement action should not be taken. A notice shall be served on
the user specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the City
Council regarding the violation, the reasons why the action is to be taken, the
proposed enforcement action, and directing the user to show cause before the
City Council why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The
notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified
mail (return receipt requested) at least 14 days before the hearing. Service
may be made on any agent or officer of a corporation.
         1.   Hearing officials. The City Council may itself conduct the
hearing and take the evidence, or may designate any of its members,
administrative law judges, or any officer or employee of the (assigned
department) to:
            a.   Issue in the name of the city notices of hearing requesting
the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence
relevant to any matter involved in the hearings;
            b.   Take the evidence; and
            c.   Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including
transcripts and other evidence, together with recommendations to the City
Council for action thereon.
         2.   Transcripts. At any hearing held pursuant to this subdivision,
testimony taken must be under oath and recorded. The transcript, so recorded,
will be made available to any member of the public or any party to the hearing
upon payment of the usual charges therefor.
         3.   Issuance of orders. After the City Council has reviewed the
evidence, it may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge
directing that, following a specified time period, the sewer service be
discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related
appurtenances shall have been installed or existing treatment facilities,
devices or other related appurtenances are property operated. Further orders
and directives as are necessary and appropriate may be issued.
      D.   Legal action. If any person discharges wastewater, industrial
wastes, or other wastes into the city’s wastewater disposal system contrary to
the provisions of this section, federal or state pretreatment requirement or
any order of the city, the City Attorney may commence an action for appropriate
legal and/or equitable relief.
(Ord. 597, passed 9-17-12)
   Subd. 12.   Publication of significant violations. Public notification will
occur at least annually in a newspaper(s) of general circulation that provides
meaningful public notice within the jurisdiction(s) served by the WWTF of
industrial users which, at any time during the previous 12 months, were in
significant violation of applicable pretreatment standards or pretreatment
requirements. For the purpose of this provision, an industrial user is in
significant violation if its violations meet one or more of the following:
      A.   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which 66% or more of all of the measurements taken during a six month
period exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or
requirement, including instantaneous limits;
      B.   Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in
which 33% or more of all the measurements taken for the same pollutant
parameter during a six month period equal or exceed the product of a number
pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits times the
applicable TRC (TRC = 1.4 for CBOD, SS, fats, oil and grease and TRC = 1.2 for
all other pollutants except pH);
      C.   Any other violation of a pretreatment (daily maximum or longer term
average, instantaneous limit or narrative standard) that the Director
determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges,
interference or pass through (including endangering the health of city
employees or the general public);
      D.   Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment
to human health, welfare or to the environment and has resulted in the
necessity for the city to exercise its emergency authority under 40 CFR 403.8
(F)(1)(vii)(b) to halt or prevent such a discharge;
      E.   Violation, by 90 days or more after the schedule date, or a
compliance schedule milestone contained in a local control mechanism or
enforcement order, for starting construction, completing construction, or
attaining final compliance;
      F.   Failure to provide required reports such as baseline monitoring
reports, self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance
schedules, within 45 days of the due date;
      G.   Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
      H.   Any other violation or group of violations, which may include a
violation of best management practices which the Director determines will
adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment
program.
   Subd. 13 Regulating dental amalgam.
      A. Purpose.
         1. The purpose of this subdivision is to prevent and control mercury
discharges into the City wastewater treatment facilities, water supply and
surrounding watersheds. The City of Austin Minnesota is under regulatory
obligation to reduce mercury emissions from its wastewater treatment facility
to a level at or below that is required by the Minnesota Pollution Control
Agency.
         2. In 2012, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency developed criteria
for state approval of acceptable amalgam separators, increasing the required
amalgam particulate recovery rate to 99% as certified by applicable ANSI
standards.
         3. In June of 2017, the Environmental Protection Agency issued rules
for nationwide installation of amalgam separators, 40 CFR Part 441. In those
rules, the EPA created a dental office category of pretreatment standards which
include requirements for installation, inspection, reporting, and maintenance
of amalgam separators.
         4. This subdivision is developed consistent with state and federal
standards for dental amalgam removal and to meet the City of Austin standards
on mercury elimination. Thus, the subdivision requires dental facilities to
install, inspect, and maintain dental amalgam separators that are on the list
of MPCA approved devices.
      B. Definitions.
         1. AMALGAM PROCESS WASTEWATER. Any wastewater generated and discharged
by a dental discharger through the practice of dentistry that may contain
dental amalgam.
         2. AMALGAM SEPARATOR. An MPCA approved collection device designed to
capture and remove 99% of dental amalgam from the amalgam process wastewater of
a dental discharger.
         3. DENTAL AMALGAM. Any alloy of elemental mercury and other metals
that are used in the practice of dentistry.
         4. DENTAL DISCHARGER. A facility where the practice of dentistry is
performed, including, but not limited to, institutions, permanent or temporary
offices, and home offices, as well as facilities owned and operated by federal,
state, and local government that discharge wastewater to the Austin Wastewater
Treatment System.
      C. Applicability. This subdivision does not apply to a dental discharger
that exclusively practices in one or more of the following dental specialties:
oral pathology, oral and maxillofacial radiology, oral and macillofacial
surgery, periodontics, prosthodontics and orthodontics. This subdivision
further does not apply to wastewater discharges from a mobile unit operated by
a dental discharger, to any dental discharger that collects all dental amalgam
process wastewater for transfer to a Centralized Waste Treatment facility as
defined in 40 CFR part 437, or to any dental discharger that does not place
dental amalgam and does not remove dental amalgam except in limited emergency
or unplanned, unanticipated circumstances and certify such to the City of
Austin.
      D. Requirements. Effective July 1st, 2020 a dental discharger subject to
this subdivision must achieve the pretreatment standard of removal of dental
amalgam solids from all amalgam process wastewater by one of the following
methods:

a test sample of dental amalgam that meets the particle size distribution
specifications of 40 CFR part 441.30(a)(2)(ii).
            c. The device(s) must be sized to accommodate the maximum discharge
rate of amalgam process wastewater.
            d. The device(s) must be accompanied by the manufacturer's manual
providing instructions for use including the frequency for inspection and
collecting container replacement such that the unit is replaced once it has
reached the maximum filling level at which the device can perform to the
specified efficiency.
            e. The device(s) must be inspected in accordance with the
manufacturer's operation manual to ensure proper operation and maintenance,
including confirmation that amalgam process wastewater is flowing through the
amalgam separating portion of the device(s).
            f. In the event the device is not functioning properly, it must be
repaired consistent with manufacturer instructions or replaced with a unit that
meets the requirements of this section 2 as soon as possible, but no later than
ten business days after the malfunction is discovered by the dental discharger,

this subdivision.
      H.   Enforcement. A violation of this subdivision is subject to a civil
penalty determined in the discretion of the city engineer in an amount of up to
$500.00 per violation. Each day that a violation continues is a separate
violation under this division.
      I.   Appeals. Any person affected by any decision or order made by the
city engineer in interpreting or administering the provisions of this
subdivision may file with the environmental technician a written notice of
appeal within ten days after receipt of the decision or action of the city
engineer. Notice of a scheduled hearing before the city council shall be mailed
to the appealing dental facility, by the environmental technician. The decision
by the city council on such appeal shall be the final administrative
determination of the City of Austin.
   Subd. 14.   Point of sale inflow/infiltration compliance.
      A.   No person shall sell, give or transact a change in title or property
ownership of real property with one or more buildings or structures that is
connected to the public sewer, without first obtaining a Certificate of Inflow/
Infiltration (I/I) Compliance from the city.
      B.   The applicant for a Certificate of I/I Compliance is responsible for
completing an inspection of the property after making application and payment
of fees. The inspection shall determine if the property has any prohibited
discharges and if a sump pump exists that is it properly installed as stated in
§
3.30, Subd. 4, Subpar. G. The existing building sewer shall be inspected to
determine if it is in accordance with §
3.30, Subd. 4, Subpar. D.
      C.   A licensed plumber shall complete the inspection requirement. The
plumber must inspect the property's sump pump and building sewer, and upon
completion, return an inspection form provided by the city documenting the
results of the inspection. The building sewer inspection shall also include the
portion of the building drain which is from inner face of the building wall to
the connection. The date-stamped video record shall be submitted to the city
and reviewed and approved by the city for assessment of compliance with this
section. All costs associated with an inspection by a privately retained
plumber shall be the responsibility of the property owner.
      D.   Compliance and expiration.
         1.   Upon inspection, when the property use is in accordance with city
sanitary sewer services regulations, a Certificate of I/I Compliance will be
issued by the city.
         2.   A Certificate of I/I Compliance is valid to be used for the
transfer of property. A new certificate is required for every transfer of
property. The building sewer inspection portion is valid for ten years from the
date of issuance and may be reused.
      E.   Corrections.
         1.   Upon written notification that the property is not in compliance
with this subdivision, the property owner shall have a period of 90 days to
complete all work that is necessary to comply with the provisions of this
section which requires the issuance of any plumbing, building, or other permit
under this code shall be inspected by the city inspection services division for
compliance with all applicable city code requirements.
         2.   The city may issue a correction notice, as requested, permitting
the transfer of the property without completing the corrections providing:
            a.   An agreement by the new owner or new owner's representative
has been executed with the city, whereby the new owner or new owner's
representative agrees to complete corrections to the property necessary to
bring it within compliance of this subdivision within 180 days of the transfer
of property.
            b.   The seller shall provide proof to the city that funds were
placed in an escrow account at closing to cover the required repairs. The
security shall be placed in an escrow with a licensed real estate closer,
licensed attorney-at-law or a federal or state chartered financial institution.
The amount escrowed shall be equal to 110% of a written estimate to correct the
building sewer, drain, and/or connection by a licensed and certified installer.
This escrow requirement may be waived if the property contains a principal
structure that will be demolished and the agreement referenced in Subpar. E.,
Item 2.a. above includes an acknowledgment by the new owner that the demolition
and reconstruction will result in the requirement for a new building sewer.
            c.   The owner (or seller) or owner's representative involved in
the transaction are responsible for disclosing the correction notice to the
buyer and all other persons or entities involved in the transaction. The
responsibility for repairing any nonconformance with the building sewer, drain
and/or connection regulations runs with the land and not only rests with the
owner or seller but is also an obligation of the buyer of the property. If
repairs are not completed within one year of the first inspection, the
inspection becomes invalid and the process starts again, which includes paying
the applicable inspection fee.
         3.   Penalties. A monthly I/I surcharge as listed in § 3.30, Subd. 9,
will be issued to any owner who fails to comply with the section.
   Subd. 15.   Discharges of fats, oil and grease.
      A.   Purpose and scope. The purpose of this Subd. 15 shall be to aid in
the prevention of sanitary sewer blockages and obstructions from contribution
and accumulation of fats, oil and grease (FOG) into the sanitary sewer system.
Such discharges from licensed food service establishments (FSEs), where FOG of
vegetable or animal origin are discharged directly or indirectly into the
public sewer can contribute to line blockages and/or backups. This subdivision
shall apply to all FSEs that are located within the limits of the city. FSEs
located outside the city limits that receive sanitary sewer service from the
wastewater utility or that discharge any liquids or solids into the public
sewer shall be required to comply with this subdivision as a condition of
continuing service. Industrial users shall be regulated per Subd. 5, Subpar. D
of this section.
      B.   Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in
this subdivision, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this Subpar. B,
except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
         1.   BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES (BMPS). The schedules of activities,
prohibitions of practices, maintenance procedures, and other management
practices to prevent or reduce the pollution of waters of the state. For
purposes of this subdivision, BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES include procedures and
practices that reduce the discharge of fat, oil, and grease (FOG) to the
building sewer and to the POTW.
         2.   EFFECTIVE DATE. The date set forth in the ordinance creating and
enacting this subdivision upon which the regulatory provisions of this
subdivision take effect.
         3.   FOOD SERVICE ESTABLISHMENT (FSE). An operation or enterprise
subject to licensure by the Minnesota Department of Health, Minnesota
Department of Agriculture, or other state-licensed agencies, or an

         4.   Any permitted construction shall be deemed compliant upon
issuance of a certificate of compliance or certificate of occupancy for such
construction by the city Building Official or designee.
         5.   Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, existing FSEs
that are not equipped with a grease interceptor or that are equipped with a
grease interceptor that does not comply with the most recent plumbing code as
adopted by the state, shall install a compliant grease interceptor on a date
deemed appropriate by the manager after initial inspection of the FSE, when any
of the following applies:
            a.   An FSE within a building or facility that exists on the
effective date and application is thereafter made for a building or plumbing
permit at the FSE;
            b.   There is a change of ownership of an FSE within a building or
facility that exists on the effective date;
            c.   The FSE discharges necessitate increased maintenance on the
POTW to keep stoppages from occurring therein as determined by the manager; or
            d.   An FSE is not adequately retaining FOG when quantities above
FOG discharge limits of 100 milligrams per liter are found by use of an EPA-
approved method for testing oil and grease in wastewater.
         6.   Existing FSEs that are not equipped with a grease interceptor
shall pay a monthly surcharge fee as set by City Council annually for
additional services required to remove and treat the addition of excessive FOG
to the POTW. FSEs that have obtained an exemption for grease interceptor
installation; excluding exemptions granted under exemption Subpar. D, Item 4,
are not subject to the surcharge fee until there is a change in operations that
affects FOG discharge or until from Subpar. C, Item 5 applies. FSEs that have
obtained an exemption under exemption Subpar. D, Item 4 are subject to the
surcharge fee.
      D.   Exemption from grease interceptor installation requirement. Any FSE
that wishes to be exempt from a grease interceptor installation requirement,
must file an exemption form with the manager who has the authority to approve
the exemption if:
         1.   The FSE is in a building or facility that operates multiple FSEs
and a common gravity grease interceptor may be installed for the entirety of
the building in which the building property owner is therein responsible and
liable along with the owner of each FSE served by a grease interceptor for the
servicing and maintenance of that grease interceptor;
         2.   Only catered meals are distributed and consumed and all dishes,
pans, utensils, etc., are removed and cleaned at an approved facility with
properly operating and sized grease interceptors;
         3.   Only pre-packaged foods are served and no oil, grease, or other
products containing grease are washed down sinks or drains; or
         4.   The FSE demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the
manager that installation of a grease interceptor is not feasible due to
physical constraints. The manager may grant an exemption allowing the FSE to
install alternative treatment technology determined by the manager to be
effective at adequately controlling the release of FOG into the public sanitary
sewer system. The FSE bears the burden of demonstrating that the installation
of a grease interceptor is not feasible.
      E.   Installation of grease interceptors. Grease interceptors required by
this subdivision shall be installed in accordance with the plumbing code as
adopted by the State of Minnesota and as follows:
         1.   Grease interceptors shall be installed at the expense of the
building owner or operator of the FSE which is contributing wastewater to the
POTW.
         2.   All wastewater streams containing FOG within FSEs shall be
directed into an appropriately sized grease interceptor before discharge to the
POTW.
         3.   Grease interceptors shall be designed, constructed, and installed
in accordance with the plumbing code as adopted by the state and in compliance
with this subdivision.
         4.   A plumbing permit and inspection are required for each grease
interceptor installation made pursuant to this subdivision. The plumbing
inspector shall review all relevant information regarding the rated performance
of the grease interceptor and the building plan and facility site plan for the
building and site where the grease interceptor has been installed and shall
approve such grease interceptor installation upon determination that the grease
interceptor meets all requirements of the plumbing code, as adopted by the
state.
         5.   Gravity grease interceptor installation is preferred over
hydromechanical grease interceptors due to lower maintenance costs and better
FOG removal as seen through installations at other municipalities with FOG
programs. However, the FSE has the option to install the compliant grease
interceptor of their choosing and will be required to maintain such as
specified in this subdivision.
         6.   Hydromechanical grease interceptors shall be sized and installed
in compliance with the requirements of the plumbing code as adopted by the
state and in accordance with this subdivision.
         7.   Gravity grease interceptors shall be sized and installed in
accordance with the requirements of the plumbing code as adopted by the state
and in accordance with this subdivision. Gravity grease interceptors shall have
a minimum capacity of 1,000 gallons and shall not exceed 3,000 gallons for a
single unit. Where a capacity greater than 3,000 gallons is required, several
smaller units shall be installed in series. If an FSE wishes to install a
gravity grease interceptor smaller than 1,000 gallons or larger than 3,000
gallons, the owner of the FSE must file an exemption form with the manager with
sufficient evidence that the interceptor can be cleaned and maintained
properly.
         8.   Gravity grease interceptors shall have access manholes with a
minimum diameter of 24 inches over each chamber and sanitary tee. Access
manholes shall extend from the gravity grease interceptor to at least the
finished surface grade and be designed and maintained to prevent stormwater or
surface water inflow and groundwater infiltration. The manholes shall also have
readily removable covers to facilitate inspection and grease removal. If an FSE
wishes to install a gravity grease interceptor with manhole lids smaller than
24 inches, the owner of the FSE must file an exemption form with the manager
with sufficient evidence that the interceptor can be cleaned and maintained
properly.
         9.   Gravity grease interceptors shall be installed on private
property and shall not be installed within a public right-of-way or public
easement unless an application for a revocable encroachment permit is presented
to and approved by the City Council.
         10.   Gravity grease interceptors shall be designed and manufactured
in accordance with the plumbing code as adopted by the state and this section.
Concrete tank gravity grease interceptors shall be approved by building safety
officials and constructed out of concrete with admixtures and/or coatings to
decrease problems associated with corrosion or decaying of poured concrete in
sanitary sewer applications.
         11.   Gravity grease interceptors shall be designed, constructed, and
installed for adequate AASHTO H-20 vehicle traffic load bearing capacity or
greater regardless of installed location for safety purposes.
         12.   Where gravity grease interceptors are shared by more than one
FSE, the building owner shall be the responsible party for record keeping and
maintaining of the interceptor.
         13.   Sewer lines that are not grease-laden, that are not likely to
contain FOG, or that contain sanitary wastes shall not be connected to a grease
interceptor.
      F.   Operation, maintenance, and cleaning of grease interceptors.
         1.   The building owner or operator of an FSE that is required to pass
wastewater through a grease interceptor shall operate and maintain the grease
interceptor so that wastewater exiting the grease interceptor shall not exceed
the discharge limit of 100 milligrams per liter of FOG or cause POTW buildup of
FOG.
         2.   The building owner or operator of the FSE shall cause the grease
interceptor to be cleaned as hereinafter required when FOG and solids reach 25%
of the design liquid depth of the grease interceptor, or sooner if necessary to
prevent carry-over of grease from the grease interceptor into the POTW. If,
prior to cleaning, FOG and solids have exceeded 25% of the design liquid depth
in the grease interceptor, cleaning frequency must be increased. At a minimum,
all grease interceptors shall be cleaned and inspected at three-month
intervals.
         3.   FSEs that have an extended shutdown of operations or have a
minimal discharge of grease may submit to the manager for an exception to clean
their grease interceptor at a frequency less often than every three months.
         4.   All personnel cleaning a grease interceptor must be trained in
proper cleaning procedures.
         5.   Any person who cleans a grease interceptor shall do so in
accordance with the following procedures and requirements. The person cleaning
the grease interceptor shall:
            a.   Measure and record the depths of solids on the bottom and FOG
on the top of the grease interceptor. Also, record the total percent of FOG and
solids compared to the design liquid depth.
            b.   Completely empty and remove the contents (liquids and solids)
of all vaults of the grease interceptor and remove the grease mat and scrapings
from the interior walls.
            c.   Dispose of waste and wastewater removed from a grease
interceptor at the wastewater utility or at a facility approved for disposal of
such waste. Waste and wastewater removed from a grease interceptor shall not be

interceptor back into the grease interceptor from which the waste or wastewater
was removed or into any other grease interceptor for the purpose of reducing
the volume of waste and wastewater to be disposed of.
            e.   Not introduce enzymes, emulsifying chemicals, hot water or
other agents into a grease interceptor to dissolve or emulsify grease or as a
grease abatement method. Introduction of bacteria as a grease degradation agent
is permitted with prior written approval by the manager.
            f.   Not use an automatic grease removal system to clean a grease
interceptor without prior written approval of the manager, and if, the use of
an automatic grease removal system is approved, shall operate same in a manner
that the grease wastewater discharge limit, as measured from the system's
outlet, is consistently achieved.
         6.   As part of each cleaning of a grease interceptor, the building
owner or operator of the FSE, or the licensed waste hauler employed by the
building owner or operator, shall perform the following maintenance activities:
            a.   Check that the sanitary tees on the inlet and outlet sides of
the grease interceptor are not obstructed, loose, or missing.
            b.   Verify that the baffle is secure and in place.
            c.   Inspect the grease interceptor for any cracks or other

approve alternative operational requirements or cleaning and maintenance
methods, provided that such exceptions or approvals shall be made in writing by
the manager.
      G.   Records and record keeping.
         1.   Required records. The building owner or operator of an FSE which
is required to pass wastewater through a grease interceptor shall maintain a
written record of grease interceptor maintenance, including a log containing
the dates upon which the grease interceptor was inspected and the dates upon
which FOG waste and wastewater was removed from the grease interceptor and
disposed of along with the percentage of FOG and solids of the design liquid
depth. The log shall also contain the location and means of such disposal of
waste and wastewater, the name and employer or the person performing each of
said tasks and any maintenance issues that required correction. FSE owners
shall also record inspection of the grease interceptor to check for maintenance
and cleaning issues and keep records in the same log.
         2.   Record keeping. The log shall always be kept and maintained to
show a record of inspections and waste and wastewater removal and disposal for
a continuous period of three years. All such records shall be kept secure at
the premises of the FSE for a continuous period of three years and shall be
made available for nonroutine inspection by the city, the wastewater utility
and its operating contractor, or the employees and agents of any of them at any
time during normal business hours.

RESIDENTIAL RENTAL PROPERTY
§ 4.26 VACANT BUILDING IDENTIFICATION AND REGULATION.
   Subd. 1. Purposes and findings.
      A. The purpose of this section is to protect the public health, safety
and welfare by establishing a program for the identification and regulation of
vacant and abandoned buildings within the city. This section also determines
the responsibilities of owners of vacant buildings and provides for
administration, enforcement and penalties associated with the same.
      B. The City Council finds that vacant buildings are a major cause and
source of blight in residential and non-residential neighborhoods, especially
when the owner or party responsible for a building fails to maintain and manage
the building to ensure it does not become a liability to the neighborhood.
Vacant buildings often attract transients, trespassers and criminals. Neglect
of vacant buildings and the use of vacant buildings by transients and criminals
creates a risk of fire, and other structural damage of the vacant building and
adjacent properties. Vacant properties are often used as dumping grounds for
junk and debris and are frequently overgrown with weeds and tall grass. Vacant
buildings that are boarded to prevent entry by transients and other long-term
vacancies are unsightly, discourage economic development and inhibit the
increase of property values. There is a substantial cost to the city in
monitoring vacant buildings. This cost should not be borne by the general
taxpayers but should be borne by those who leave their buildings vacant.
      C. Pursuant to authority provided in M.S. § 463.26, permitting cities to
enact and enforce ordinances regarding hazardous buildings, and in order to
enhance livability and preserve the tax base and property values of buildings
within the city, and because of the need to assure that buildings which are
capable of rehabilitation are promptly rehabilitated and buildings which are
not capable of rehabilitation be promptly demolished, the city hereby declares
that it is the policy of the city to promote rehabilitation of vacant and
unoccupied buildings, and to assure a prompt process for demolition of
hazardous buildings through a procedure fixing appropriate responsibility in
accordance with due process requirements.
   Subd. 2. Definitions. For the purposes of this chapter, the following words
and phrases shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them by this
section:
      A.  ABANDONED PROPERTY. Property that: (1) has been substantially
unoccupied or unused for any commercial or residential purpose for at least one
year by a person with a legal or equitable right to occupy the property; (2)
has not been maintained; and (3) for which taxes have not been paid for at
least two previous years.
      B.  BUILDING. A roofed structure used or intended for supporting or
sheltering any use or occupancy.
      C. CITY. The City of Austin, State of Minnesota.
      D. COMPLIANCE OFFICIAL. The City Administrator or the City Administrators
designee authorized to administer and enforce this section.
      E. OWNER OF RECORD. The fee owner, contract for deed vendee, mortgagee in
foreclosure, holder of sheriff's certificate, and taxpayer as shown on the real
property records of Mower County, or the authorized agent of any of the
preceding persons.
      F. RESPONSIBLE PARTY. An owner, entity or person acting as an agent for
the owner who has direct or indirect control or authority over the building or
real property upon which the building is located or any party having a legal or
equitable interest in the property, including but not limited to a realtor,
service provider, mortgagor, leasing agent, management company or similar
person or entity.

neighborhood and/or city code.
      H.   UNOCCUPIED BUILDING. Any building not occupied consistent with its
primary intended use for a period of 120 days or more.
   Subd. 3. Securing vacant buildings. Any building which becomes unsecured or
vacant may be deemed hazardous. If the hazardous condition could be abated by
securing the building, the City Council may order the building secured and
shall cause notice of the order to be served by United States Mail on the
record owner at its last known address. The notice must be in writing and must
include, at a minimum, a statement that:
      A. Informs the owner of record that it has ten days, from the date of the
notice, to secure the building or provide the council with a reasonable plan
and schedule to comply with the order and that costs may be assessed against
the property if the person does not secure the building.
      B. Provides the owner of record with a copy of right of entry by holder
of mortgage or sheriff's certificate to protect the premises from waste and
trespass.
      Service by mail is complete upon mailing.
   Subd. 4. Emergency securing of vacant buildings. When the City Council or
the Compliance Official determines that a vacant or unsecured building poses an
immediate threat to the health or safety of persons in the community and the
immediate securing of a building is required to protect health and safety, all
notice requirements herein are waived and the building may be secured by the
city, provided that:

an unoccupied building with the city no later than 120 days after the building
becomes vacant. The registration shall be submitted on a form provided by the
city and shall include the following information supplied by the owner:
            a. The name, address, telephone number and email address of each
owner and each owner's representative;
            b. The tax parcel identification number and street address of the
premises on which the building is situated;
            c. The names, addresses, telephone numbers and email addresses of
all known lien holders and all other parties with any legal interest in the
building;
            d. The name, address, telephone number and email address of a local
agent or person responsible for managing or maintaining the property;
            e. The status of water, sewer, natural gas and electric utilities;
and
            f. The date the building became vacant, the period of time the
building is expected to remain vacant, and a property plan and timetable for
returning the building to appropriate occupancy or use and correcting code
violations and nuisances or for demolition of the building.
         2. The owner shall notify the Inspector within 30 days of changes in
any of the information supplied as part of the vacant building registration and
shall continue to do so on an ongoing basis during vacancy.
      B. Property plan. The property plan shall meet the following
requirements:
         1. General provisions. The plan shall comply with all applicable
regulations and meet the approval of the Inspector. It shall contain a
timetable regarding use or demolition of the property. The plan shall be
completed within 30 days after the building is registered.
         2. Maintenance of building.  The plan shall identify the means and
timetable for addressing all maintenance and nuisance-related items identified
in the application. Any repairs, improvements or alterations to the property
shall comply with building code provisions and applicable city regulations.
         3. Plan changes. If the property plan or timetable for the vacant
building is revised in any way for any purpose, the revisions shall meet the
approval of the Inspector.
         4. Demolition required. If a building has remained a vacant building
for a period of 365 consecutive days or more, and the Inspector has not
approved an alternative schedule in the property plan, the city may declare the
building to be a nuisance and direct the owner to demolish the building and
restore the grounds. If the owner does not demolish the building and thereby
eliminate the nuisance conditions, the city may commence abatement and cost
recovery proceedings for the abatement of the violation.
      C. Noncompliance and notification. If the owner does not comply with the
property plan, or maintain or correct nuisance violations, the city may
commence abatement and recover its costs for correction of those items. In the
case of an absent owner and ongoing nuisance issues, the city need not provide
notice of each abatement act to the owner. A single notice by the city to the
owner is determined to be sufficient notice that it intends to provide ongoing
abatement until the owner corrects the violations.
      D. Exemptions.
         1. Casualty damage. A building that has suffered casualty damage is
exempt for the registration requirement for a period of 180 days after the date

registration requirement.
      E. Fees. The owner shall pay an annual registration fee. The registration
fee will be an amount adopted by ordinance by the City Council. The amount of
the registration fee shall be reasonably related to the administrative costs
for registering and processing the registration form and for the costs of the
city in monitoring the vacant building site. The fee shall be paid in full
prior to the issuance of any building permits or licenses, with the exception
of a demolition permit.
      F. Assessment. If the registration fee or any portion thereof is not paid
within 60 days after billing or within 60 days after any appeal becomes final,
the City Council may certify the unpaid fees against the property.
      G. Issuance of registration. Upon completion of the registration process
and payment of the fee, the city will issue a vacant building registration to
the owner. The owner shall securely post the registration on the vacant
building on a side entrance door, where possible, that is not generally visible
from the public street. If no side entrance door is available, the registration
shall be securely posted on another available entrance door.
      H. Failure to register. If the property is abandoned or the owner or
responsible party fails to complete the registration process, the property will
be registered administratively as a vacant property and the registration fee
shall be assessed against the property.
   Subd. 6. Change of ownership. A new owner shall register or re-register a
vacant building or an unoccupied building within ten days of any transfer of an
ownership interest in a vacant building. The new owner shall comply with the
approved property plan and timetable submitted by the previous owner or shall
submit a revised or amended property plan to the Inspector for review and
approval. For the purposes of this section, the new owner is an owner as
defined in this section if the new owner has purchased the vacant building
since its registration by the previous owner or has otherwise succeeded to all
rights of the previous owner.
   Subd. 7. Inspections. The Compliance Official, also known as the Inspector,
may conduct inspections on any vacant building or unoccupied building in the
city for the purpose of enforcing and ensuring compliance with this section and
other applicable regulations. Upon the request of the Inspector, an owner or
responsible party shall provide access to all interior portions of the building
and the exterior of the property in order to complete an inspection. If the
owner or responsible party is not available, is unresponsive, or refuses to
provide access to the interior of the building, the city may use any legal
means to gain entrance to the building for inspection purposes. Prior to any
re-occupancy, the owner or responsible party shall request an inspection of the
vacant building by the Inspector to determine compliance with this chapter and
all other applicable regulations. All application and re-inspection fees also
shall be paid prior to building occupancy.
   Subd. 8. Maintenance of vacant buildings and unoccupied buildings. The owner
of a vacant building or an unoccupied building shall comply with and address
the following items in the property plan:

Medium Density Overlaid plywood (MDO) that is painted to match the building
exterior or covered with a reflective material such as plexiglass to simulate
windows.
         2. Temporary securing. Untreated, exterior grade (CDX) plywood or

owners, agents, and property managers are responsible to take necessary
reasonable actions to ensure that the persons who occupy such rental units, as

full and accompanied by the appropriate license fee as established by the City
Council. Every licensee shall give notice in writing to the city within ten
business days after any change of information on the application or if the
licensed premises is sold or otherwise conveyed in any way. Depending on the
nature of changes, the city may require a new inspection of the licensed
premises. Each license issued by the city under this chapter will expire one
year after the date of issuance unless otherwise suspended or revoked. An
application for renewal of a license and the appropriate fee must be filed with
the issuing authority at least 30 days prior to the expiration date of an
existing license. Any renewal license application and fee not received before
the expiration date shall be assessed a late fee as established by the City
Council for processing of the application. 
         2.   Within 30 days of receipt of a completed application and of the

inspection. No license shall be granted or renewed until the inspector has
determined that all life, health, safety violations, or application
inconsistencies have been corrected. In cases where a weather deferral for
repairs has been granted by the inspector, the license may be granted on
conditions of the repairs being completed before a specific date in the future.
If the license application is incomplete, or the applicant does not meet the
requirements of this section during the term of a provisional license issued
under section Subd. 5, the application shall be canceled.
      D.   License and inspection fees. License fees, as set forth by City
Council resolution, shall be due 30 days prior to the license expiration date;

         1.   License fees, delinquent payments. A delinquency penalty of 20%
of the amount of the license fee may be charged to the operators of the
dwelling unit. Once issued, a license is nontransferable and the licensee shall
not be entitled to a refund of any license fee. Upon revocation or modification
of a license, or if the applicant withdraws an application, or in the case of
an incomplete application or process, or if an application is canceled, the fee
shall be nonrefundable.
         2.   Inspection/reinspection fees. Fees for annual inspections of a

notice to the inspector. All reinspection fees are set by City Council
resolution. If the reinspection is being performed as part of the licensing
process, fees must be paid prior to the time of license issuance or renewal. If

amount or validity of taxes, the city may upon request of the licensee or
applicant waive strict compliance with this provision; no waiver may be
granted, however, for taxes or any portion thereof that remain unpaid for a
period exceeding one year after becoming due; and
         4.   The rental dwelling must be in compliance with all federal, state

dwellings during the first 12 months following the effective date of the
chapter will be provisional pending inspection. Newly established rental
dwellings and properties or property owners with code or other violations
within 12 months preceding the license application will be prioritized.
Following the initial 12 month implementation period, the city may issue a
provisional license to the owner of a rental dwelling who has submitted an
application, paid the license fee and the compliance official or designee has
conducted an initial inspection resulting in written orders to correct
violations that do not prevent occupancy. All other inspections will be
scheduled within 12 months of license issuance. In all other instances,
provisional licenses authorize the continued occupancy of the rental dwelling
unit(s) in actual existence, pending issuance of a rental license. This
provisional license is valid the earliest of the following: up to 180 days, or
the date upon which a non-provisional license is issued, or the date upon which
notice is given that the city has determined that license requirements have not
been met and the provisional license has been rescinded.

liability companies or other recognized business associations that own a rental

license application. No transfer of a license is permitted from place to place
or from the owner to another person or entity without complying with the
requirements of an original application, except in the case in which an

licensed premises occurred during the pendency of eviction proceedings
(unlawful detainer) or within 30 days of notice given by the licensee to a
tenant to vacate the premises where the disorderly use was related to conduct
by that tenant or by other occupants or guests of the tenant's unit. Eviction
proceedings shall not be a bar to adverse license action, however, unless they
are diligently pursued by the licensee. Further, an action to deny, revoke,
suspend, or not renew a rental license based on violations of this chapter may
be postponed or discontinued at any time if it appears that the licensee has
taken appropriate measures which will prevent further instances of disorderly
use.
      H.   Enforcement. Enforcement actions provided in this chapter shall not
be exclusive, and the city may take any action with respect to a licensee, a
tenant, guests, or the licensed premises as is authorized by this code or state
law.
      I.   No retaliation.
         1.   For purposes of verifying instances of disorderly conduct in
violation of this section, the following are exceptions:
            a.   An EMERGENCY CALL within the definition of Minn. Stat. §
609.78, Subd. 3, as it may be amended from time to time, will not be considered
an instance of disorderly behavior for purposes of this section where the
victim and suspect are FAMILY OR HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS as defined in the Domestic
Abuse Act (Minn. Stat. § 518B.01, Subd. 2(b)) and where there is a report of
DOMESTIC ABUSE as defined therein.
            b.   An EMERGENCY CALL within the definition of Minn. Stat. §
609.78, Subd. 3, as it may be amended from time to time, will not be considered
an instance of disorderly behavior for purposes of this section where the call
is the result of a tenant, or a member of the tenant's household, or guest
taking action to seek emergency assistance that is protected by Minn. Stat. §
504B.205, relating to a residential tenant's right to seek police and emergency
assistance.
            c.   An EMERGENCY CALL within the definition of Minn. Stat. §
609.78, Subd. 3, as it may be amended from time to time, will not be considered
an instance of disorderly behavior for purposes of this section where the call
is the result of an emergency assistance that is protected by Minn. Stat. §
604A.04, relating to a person who is not a health care professional who acts in
good faith in administering an opiate antagonist to another person whom the
person believes in good faith to be suffering a drug overdose.
         2.   A tenant may not waive, and a license holder may not require the
tenant to waive, the tenant's right under law to call for police or emergency
assistance. This section shall not prohibit the eviction of tenants from a
dwelling unit for unlawful conduct of a tenant or invitee or violation of any
rules, regulations, or lease terms other than a prohibition against contacting
law enforcement agencies.
      J.   Falsely reporting violations. No person shall report a violation of
this section or city ordinance knowing or having reason to know that the report
is false with the intent to affect the licensing status or inspection schedule
of the licensed premises.
      K.   Tenant responsibilities.
         1.   Access to licensed premises. When required by Minnesota Statutes,
each tenant or occupant of a rental dwelling must give the owner, agent, or
authorized city official access to any part of such rental dwelling unit at
reasonable times for the purpose of inspection, maintenance, repairs, or
alterations as are necessary to comply with the provisions of this section.
         2.   Compliance with regulations. A tenant must comply with applicable
city codes and all applicable local, state, and federal regulations. A tenant
is responsible for compliance with all applicable city code, nuisance, and
violations of disorderly conduct as specified in this section that occur in the
dwelling unit, including violations committed by household members or guests.
   Subd. 8.   Crime-free housing program.
      A.   Purpose. The City Council finds that repeated police calls to rental
dwelling units in the city related to disturbances or criminal activity have
taxed law enforcement resources. The City Council also finds that persons
residing in rental dwelling units who engage in disorderly conduct or cause
nuisance conditions create an unacceptable environment for others living in
close proximity, thereby threatening the public safety and welfare of the
community. In order to preserve and protect the city's neighborhoods and to
promote public safety, the City Council enacts this section. For the purpose of
this section of the city code, the crime-free housing program shall refer to
the Minnesota Crime Prevention Association's Crime-Free Multi Housing Program,
unless otherwise indicated or amended by this section. The phases of the
program include, but are not limited to, the conditions set forth below.
      B.   Crime-free housing program overview. An owner, agent or property
manager of a rental dwelling in the city must comply with the following
components of the city's crime-free housing program:
         1.   Attend a certified eight-hour crime-free housing course presented
by police, fire, public housing and others;
         2.   Use a written lease which includes the crime-free/drug free
housing lease addendum;
         3.   Conduct a criminal background of all prospective tenants 18 years
and older and, upon request, provide a copy of third-party background check
procedures for tenants; and
         4.   Actively pursue the eviction of the tenants or termination of the
lease with the tenants who violate the terms of the lease and/or the crime-
free/drug free housing lease addendum.
      C.   Crime-free housing program training.
         1.   Every owner, agent, or property manager of a rental dwelling must
attend a crime-free housing training program that is either offered by the city
or another municipality within the state. Each owner, agent, or property
manager will be charged a fee to attend the crime-free housing training if
attended in the city. The owner, agent, or property manager will provide the
city with proof of having received such training to the Police Department if it
is obtained from another city or other source.
         2.   All new rental licenses applied for and issued after the
effective date of this section have two years from the day of license issuance
for the owner, agent or property manager to attend and provide proof of
completion of the crime-free housing training. Licenses may be considered for
revocation, suspension or nonrenewal for failure to attend the crime-free
housing training and provide proof to the Police Department within the
deadlines proscribed herein.
      D.   Tenant background checks. All licensees will conduct criminal
background checks on all prospective tenants 18 years and older. The criminal
background check must include the following:
         1.   A statewide (Minnesota) criminal history check of all tenants who
are 18 years of age or older and persons subsequently residing in the dwelling
unit who are 18 years of age or older (collectively referred to in this section
as "tenants") covering at least the last three years; the check must be done
"in person" or by utilizing the most recent update of the state criminal
history files;
         2.   A statewide criminal history check from the tenants' previous
state of residence if the tenant is moving directly from the previous state;
         3.   A criminal history check of any tenant in his or her previous
states of residence covering the last three years if they have not resided in
Minnesota for three years or longer;
         4.   Licensees will retain criminal history check information for at
least one year after the date of the check or, if the subject of the check
becomes a tenant of the licensed premises, one year after the subject of the
check has ceased to be a tenant. Such information shall be available for
inspection upon request by the city; and
         5.   Licensees should have written screening criteria that is provided
to the applicant prior to accepting the application or application fee.
      E.   Crime-free/drug-free housing lease addendum requirements. All tenant
leases for rental units governed by this chapter shall contain the crime-free/
drug-free housing lease addendum. The crime-free/drug-free housing lease
addendum provisions are in addition to all other terms of the lease and do not
limit or replace any other provisions. These lease provisions shall be
incorporated into every new and renewed lease for a tenancy. The lease addendum
shall contain the following "crime-free/drug-free" language or language that is
contractual and legal equivalent as follows:
         1.   Resident, any members of the resident's household or a guest or
other person under the resident's control shall not engage in illegal activity,
including drug-related illegal activity, on or near the said premises. DRUG-
RELATED ILLEGAL ACTIVITY means the illegal manufacture, sale, distribution,
purchase, use or possession with intent to manufacture, sell, distribute, or
use of a controlled substance (as defined in § 102 of the Controlled Substance
Act, 21 U.S.C. 802) or possession of drug paraphernalia.
         2.   Resident, any members of the resident's household or a guest or
other person under the resident's control shall not engage in any act intended
to facilitate illegal activity, including drug-related illegal activity or the
storage of stolen property, on or near the said premises.
         3.   Resident, any members of the resident's household or a guest or
any other person under the resident's control household will not permit the
dwelling to be used for, or to facilitate illegal activity, including drug-
related illegal activity, regardless of whether the individual engaging in such
activity is a member of the household.
         4.   Resident, any members of the resident's household or a guest or
any other person under the resident's control household will not engage in the
manufacture, sale, felony possession or distribution of illegal drugs at any
locations, whether on or near the dwelling unit premises or otherwise.
         5.   Resident, any members of the resident's household or a guest or
any other person under the resident's control household shall not engage in
acts of violence or threats of violence, including but not limited to the
unlawful discharge of firearms, prostitution, criminal street gang activity,
intimidation, or any other breach of the rental agreement that otherwise
jeopardizes the health, safety or welfare of the landlord, his or her agents or
tenants.
         6.   Violation of the above provisions shall be a material violation
of the lease and good cause for termination of tenancy. A single violation of
any of the provisions of this agreement shall be deemed a serious violation and
material noncompliance with the lease.
         7.   Non-exclusive remedies. The crime-free/drug free provisions are
in addition to all other terms of the lease and do not limit or replace any
other provisions.
      F.   Crime-free housing violations.
         1.   Upon determination by the Police Department by a preponderance of
the evidence that a licensed premises or dwelling unit within a licensed
premises was used in violation of the crime-free/drug-free lease provisions of
this subsection, the Police Department shall cause notice to be made to the
owner, agent, or property manager of the violation. If the violation of the
crime-free/drug-free lease addendum committed on the licensed premises would
rise to the level of a felony charge under state or federal law, the Police
Department shall cause notice to be made to the owner, agent, or property
manager to proceed with termination of the tenancy of all tenants occupying the
unit. If the violation of the crime-free/drug-free lease addendum committed on
the licensed premises would rise to the level of a misdemeanor or gross
misdemeanor charge under applicable law, the Police Department may cause notice
to be made to the owner, agent, or property manager to proceed with termination
of the tenancy of all tenants occupying the unit if the violation threatens the
peaceful enjoyment or safety of any other resident or neighbor to the premises.
         2.   Written notice, hearing.
            a.   Any determination by the Police Department for the termination
of tenant's lease based on a violation of the crime-free/drug-free lease
provisions shall be preceded by written notice to the licensee of the grounds
therefore and the licensee will be given an opportunity to challenge the
determination at a hearing conducted before the City Council prior to
termination of the tenancy by the licensee. The licensee shall request the
hearing within ten days after receipt of the Police Department's notification
of the termination of the tenancy.
            b.   In the event a hearing is requested by the licensee, a
determination that a licensed premises or any particular dwelling unit has been
the location of a violation of the crime-free/drug-free lease addendum shall be
made upon a finding of fact by the City Council by a preponderance of the
evidence. It shall not be necessary that criminal charges be brought in order
to support such finding, nor shall the dismissal or acquittal of such criminal
charge operate as a bar to any action under this section. Upon completion of
the hearing, the City Council shall issue a decision to either uphold or
reverse the determination of the Police Department to terminate the tenancy
only upon written findings and notice to the licensee.
            c.   In the event a hearing is not requested by the licensee, the
licensee, agent, or property manager shall notify the tenant or tenants within
20 days of the notice of violation of the crime-free/drug-free lease language
and advise the tenant(s) of the termination of the tenancy as directed by the
Police Department.
         3.   The licensee shall not enter into a new lease with an evicted
tenant (or with a tenant whose tenancy was otherwise terminated for violating
the crime-free/drug-free lease language) for a period of one year after the
eviction or lease termination for a rental dwelling unit that is owned or
operated by the licensee in the city.
         4.   If the Police Department determines that the licensee or agent
has proceeded in good faith to secure termination of the tenancy in accordance
with this subsection, but was unsuccessful for reasons beyond the owner or
agent's reasonable control, then the licensee shall not be subject to the
penalties.
         5.   Any person who violates any part of this chapter, upon conviction
thereof shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable in accordance with state
law which may include up to 90 days in jail. Nothing in this chapter however is
deemed to limit other remedies or civil penalties available to the city under
city code or state law. Each day that a violation continues is deemed a
separate punishable offense.
   Subd. 9.   Enforcement and inspections. The compliance official or designee
(s) administers and enforces the provisions of this chapter and is hereby
authorized to cause inspections on an annual basis for all licensed rental
dwellings and also when reasonable grounds exist to believe that a violation of
this chapter has been or is being committed. Inspections shall be conducted
during reasonable times, and the compliance official or designee(s) shall
present evidence of official capacity to the tenant, owner, or agent at the
time of inspection of the rental dwelling. Inspections shall include all common
areas, utility and mechanical rooms, accessory structures, interiors of each
dwelling unit, exteriors of all structures and exterior property areas.
      A.   Inspection access. Pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 504B.211, the owner or
agent shall provide proper notification of an inspection to the tenants after
receiving notice of the time and date of the inspection from the compliance
officer or designee(s). Each tenant of a dwelling unit shall give the owner or
agent access to any part of such dwelling unit at reasonable times for the
purpose of effecting inspection, maintenance, repairs or alterations as are
necessary to comply with the provisions of this subsection. If any owner, agent
or tenant of a dwelling unit fails to provide the tenant with requisite notice
of the inspection or otherwise refuses to permit entry to the dwelling unit
under its control for an inspection pursuant to this subsection, the compliance
official may seek a court order authorizing such inspection.
      B.   Official order. Whenever the compliance official or designee(s)
determines that any rental dwelling or portion thereof, or the premises
surrounding any of these, fails to meet the provisions of this section or city
code, an official order setting forth the violations and ordering the owner or
agent to correct such violations shall be issued. This official order shall:
         1.   Be in writing;
         2.   Describe the location and nature of the violations of this
section;
         3.   Establish a reasonable time for the correction of such violation
and right to appeal; and
         4.   Identify the implications of noncompliance with the official
order, including but not limited to being cited by the city and prosecuted,
administrative fines, as well as the possible revocation, suspension or
nonrenewal of the rental license for the dwelling unit or licensed premises.
Actions limiting the owner's ability to rent will be brought to City Council;
         5.   Be provided to the owner or agent as the case may require. Such
notice shall be deemed to be properly provided upon the owner or agent if a
copy thereof is:
            a.   Served upon owner or agent personally;
            b.   Sent by first class mail to his/her last known address on file
with the city;
            c.   Upon failure to effect notice through subsections 1. or 2. as
set out in Subd.9, posted at a conspicuous place in or about the rental
dwelling, or portion thereof, that is affected by the notice; and
            d.   Communications with the owner or agent may also be made by
electronic mail; and
         6.   Be provided to the tenant(s) residing in the licensed premises
that is the subject of the official order. Such notice shall be deemed to be
properly provided to the tenant(s) if a copy is properly posted on the dwelling
unit or at a conspicuous place in or about the rental dwelling.
      C.   Action plan. The compliance official or designee(s) may require an
action plan to be completed by the licensee or agent in a designated time frame
that indicates the steps taken to correct identified violations and the
measures to be taken to ensure ongoing compliance with city ordinances and all
applicable codes.
      D.   Unfit for human habitation.
         1.   Any rental dwelling or portion thereof that is damaged, decayed,
dilapidated, unsanitary, unsafe, vermin or rodent infested, or that lacks
provision for basic illumination, ventilation or sanitary facilities to the
extent that the defects create a hazard to the health, safety or welfare of the
tenants or of the public may be declared unfit for human habitation. Whenever
any rental dwelling or licensed premises has been declared unfit for human
habitation, the compliance official or designee(s) shall order the same vacated
within a reasonable time and shall post a placard on same indicating that it is
unfit for human habitation as adopted by City Council Chapter 4, § 4.01
(Minnesota State Building Code), and any license previously issued for such
rental dwelling units shall be revoked or modified pursuant to Subd. 10 herein.
         2.   It shall be unlawful for such rental dwelling or portion thereof
to be used for human habitation until the defective conditions have been
corrected and written approval has been issued by the city. It shall be
unlawful for any person to deface or remove the declaration placard from any
such rental dwelling.
      E.   Hazardous building declaration. In the event that a rental dwelling
has been declared unfit for human habitation and the owner or agent has not
remedied the defects within a prescribed reasonable time, the rental dwelling
may be declared a hazardous building and treated consistent with the provisions
of Minnesota Statutes.
      F.   Right of appeal. When it is alleged by any person to whom an
official order is directed that such official order is based upon erroneous
interpretation of this section, such person may appeal the official order to
the City Council sitting as a Board of Appeals. Such appeals must be in
writing, must specify the ground for the appeal, must be accompanied by a
filing fee as set forth per City Council resolution, in cash or cashier's
check, and must be filed with the city within ten business days after issuance
of the compliance order. The filing of an appeal shall stay all proceedings in
furtherance of the action appealed from, unless such a stay would cause
imminent peril to life, health, or property.
      G.   Board of Appeals decision. Upon at least ten business days' notice
to the appellant of the time and place for hearing the appeal, and within 30
calendar days after said appeal is filed, the Board of Appeals shall hold a
hearing thereon, receive evidence, and consider any advice and recommendation
from the compliance officer. The Board of Appeals may reverse, modify, or
affirm, in whole or in part, the compliance order and may order return of all
or part of the filing fee if the appeal is upheld.
      H.   Restrictions on transfer of ownership. It shall be unlawful for the
owner of any rental dwelling, or portion thereof, upon whom a pending
compliance order has been served to sell, transfer, mortgage, lease, or
otherwise dispose thereof to another person until the provisions of the
compliance order have been complied with, unless such owner shall furnish to
the grantee, lessee, or mortgagee a true copy of any notice of violation or
compliance order and shall obtain and possess a receipt of acknowledgment of
notice and file a copy of the same with the city within ten days of receipt.
Anyone securing an interest in the rental dwelling, or portion thereof, who has
received notice of the existence of a violation tag or compliance order shall
be bound by same without further service of notice and shall be liable to all
penalties and procedures provided by this chapter.
      I.   Failure to correct official orders. Any person who fails to comply
with an official order and any person who fails to comply with a modified
compliance order within the time set therein, upon conviction thereof shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable in accordance with state law. Nothing in
this chapter however is deemed to limit other remedies or civil penalties
available to the city under this code or state law. Each day of such failure to
comply may constitute a separate punishable offense.
      J.   Execution of official orders. Upon failure to comply with an
official order within the time set therein and no appeal having been taken, or
upon failure to comply with a modified compliance order within the time set
therein, the criminal penalty established hereunder notwithstanding, the City
Council may, by resolution, following a hearing upon not less than ten days'
notice to the owner and/or agent, cause the cited deficiency to be remedied as
set forth in the compliance order. The cost of such remedy shall be a lien
against the subject real estate and may be levied and collected as a special
assessment in the manner provided by Minn. Stat. Chapter 429, (the assessment
shall be payable in a single installment) and the owner and agent hereby
consent to the levy of such special assessments without notice or hearing and
waive their rights to appeal such assessments pursuant to Minnesota Statutes,
provided the amount levied does not exceed the expenses actually incurred by
the city. Further, the city may, at its option, as an additional remedy,
recover expenses actually incurred by the city, in the manner provided by Minn.
Stat. §§ 415.01, 366.011 and 366.012, and the owner and agent hereby consent to
the levy of such assessments without notice or hearing and waive their rights
to appeal such assessments pursuant to such Minnesota Statutes, provided the
amount levied does not exceed the expenses actually incurred by the city.
      K.   Alternative sanctions. Notwithstanding the availability of the
foregoing compliance procedures and penalties, whenever the city determines
that any rental dwelling, or portion thereof, or the premises surrounding any
of these fails to meet the requirements set forth in this chapter, the city may
request the issuance of a criminal complaint and arrest warrant.
   Subd. 10.   License denial, suspension, nonrenewal or revocation.
      A.   Applicability. Every application for a license, renewal for a
license or an existing license issued under the provisions of this chapter are
subject to denial, suspension, nonrenewal, or revocation by the compliance
official or designee(s).
      B.   Unoccupied or vacated rental units. In the event that a license is
revoked, or not renewed by the compliance official or designee(s), it shall be
unlawful for the owner or agent to rent the rental dwelling.
      C.   Grounds for license action. The compliance official or designee(s)
may revoke, suspend, decline to renew or impose reasonable conditions or
restrictions upon any license issued under this section upon any of the
following criteria:
         1.   False statements, misrepresentations, or fraudulent statements on
any application or other information or report required by this section to be
given by the applicant or licensee;
         2.   Failure to pay any fee, fine or penalty, special assessments,
real estate taxes, or other financial claims due to the city as required by
this chapter and City Council resolution;
         3.   Failure to continuously comply with any property maintenance,
zoning, health, building, nuisance, or other city codes; or failure to correct
deficiencies noted in an official order in the time specified in the order;
         4.   Failure to comply with the provisions of an approved mitigation
plan or failure to submit a required action plan;
         5.   Excessive police calls for service, based on the number and
nature of the calls when, after owner notification, the owner fails to submit
an appropriate written action plan to reduce the police calls for service;
         6.   Failure to actively pursue the eviction of a tenant or otherwise
terminate the lease with a tenant who has violated the provisions of this
chapter or crime-free/drug-free lease addendum or has otherwise created a
public nuisance in violation of city, state, or applicable laws;
         7.   The failure to eliminate imminent health and life safety hazards
as determined by the city compliance official or designee(s), or its authorized
representatives after issuance of the compliance order;
         8.   The abandonment of the licensed premises by the owner as
determined by the inability to make contact with the owner or his/her agent due
to inaccurate contact information;
         9.   Failure to operate or maintain the licensed premises in
conformity with all applicable federal, state and local laws, rules,
regulations, and ordinances; and
         10.   Any person(s) who has had an interest in two or more licensed
properties that have been revoked, suspended or denied pursuant to this
section, shall be ineligible to hold or have any interest in a rental dwelling
license or provisional license for a period of three years.
      D.   License action sections. A license revocation, suspension,
nonrenewal or imposition of reasonable conditions or restrictions on a license
may be brought under any applicable provision of this section.
      E.   Notification, hearing, and decision basis.
         1.   Written notice, hearing. A recommendation to revoke, deny,
suspend, not renew or impose reasonable conditions or restrictions on a license
shall be preceded by written notice to the applicant or licensee of the grounds
therefore and the applicant or licensee will be given an opportunity to
challenge the recommendation at a hearing conducted before the City Council
before final action to revoke, deny, not renew or impose reasonable conditions
or restrictions on a license.
         2.   Decision basis. The City Council shall give due regard to the
frequency and seriousness of violations, the ease with which such violations
could have been cured or avoided and good faith efforts to comply. The City
Council shall issue a decision to deny, suspend, not renew, revoke or impose
reasonable conditions or restrictions on a license only upon written findings.
      F.   Written decision, compliance. Written decisions to revoke, deny, not
renew or impose reasonable conditions or restrictions on a license or
application shall specify the part or parts of the rental dwelling to which it
applies. Thereafter, and until a license is reissued or reinstated, no rental
units becoming vacant in such part or parts of the rental dwelling may be re-
let or occupied. Revocation or non-renewal of a license shall not excuse the
owner from compliance with all terms of state laws and codes and this city code
for as long as any units in the rental dwelling are occupied. Failure to comply
with all terms of this section during the term of revocation, or nonrenewal is
a misdemeanor and grounds for extension of the term of such revocation, or
nonrenewal and as otherwise set forth in this section. Further license action
such as revoking a license may also be taken for failure to comply.
      G.   Notification of decision. The city shall provide notice of the City
Council's decision of a revocation, suspension, nonrenewal or the imposition of
reasonable conditions or restrictions on a rental license to the licensee or
applicant either by personal delivery or by first class mail. In addition,
notice of the City Council's decision calling for the revocation, suspension or
nonrenewal of a rental license shall also be mailed to each tenant in the
licensed premises and shall be prominently posted on the rental dwelling. The
notice provided to the tenant(s) shall indicate the date upon which the tenants
must vacate the licensed premises and clearly indicate which dwelling units are
impacted by the City Council's decision. Tenants of an unlicensed rental unit
will be provided a reasonable time to arrange for alternative housing and
remove their possessions.
      H.   License actions, reapplication.
         1.   Revocation, denial, nonrenewal. Licenses that are revoked will
not be reinstated until the owner has applied for and secured a new license and
complied with all conditions imposed at the time of revocation, denial, or
nonrenewal. Upon a decision to revoke, deny or not renew a license, no approval
of any application for a new license for the same rental dwelling is effective
until after the period of time specified in the City Council's written
decision, which shall not exceed one year. The City Council shall specify in
its written decision the date when an application for a new license will be
accepted. A decision not to renew a license may take the form of a revocation.
A decision to deny an initial application shall state conditions of
reapplication.
         2.   Reinstatement fees. All reapplications must be accompanied by a
reinstatement fee, as specified by City Council resolution, in addition to all
other fees required by this chapter.
      I.   New licenses prohibited. A person who has a rental license revoked
may not receive a rental license for another rental dwelling within the city
for a period of one year from the date of revocation. The person may continue
to operate other currently licensed rental dwellings if maintained in
compliance with city codes and other applicable laws, rules, and regulations.
      J.   Misdemeanor. Any person who violates any part of this chapter, upon
conviction thereof shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable in accordance
with state law. Nothing in this section however is deemed to limit other
remedies or civil penalties available to the city under city code or state law.
Each day that a violation continues is deemed a separate punishable offense.
      K.   Severability. Every section, provision, or part of this section is
declared severable from every other section, provision, or part to the extent
that if any section, provision or part of the section shall be held invalid, it
shall not invalidate any other section, provision or part thereof.
      L.   No warranty by city. By enacting and undertaking to enforce this
section, the city, City Council, its agents, and employees do not warrant or
guaranty the safety, fitness or suitability of any rental dwelling in the city.
Owners, agents, and tenants of rental dwellings should take whatever steps they
deem appropriate to protect their interests, health, safety and welfare.
      M.   Applicable laws. Licenses are subject to all of the ordinances of
the city and the laws, rules, and regulations of the State of Minnesota and the
United States relating to rental dwellings; this section shall not be construed
or interpreted to supersede or limit any other such applicable law.

   Subd. 1. Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public
health, safety, and welfare of the community at large, and the residents of
residential properties in the city. The purpose of this chapter is also to

   Subd. 12.   Non-conforming signs.
      A.   Within the districts established by the Zoning Chapter, there exist
signs and sign structures which were lawful before this section was passed or
amended, but which would be prohibited under the terms of this section or
future amendment. It is the intent of this section to permit these non-
conformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their
survival. It is further the intent of this section that non-conformities shall
not be enlarged upon, expanded nor extended, nor be used as a basis for
allowing additional signs or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
      B.   Any sign or sign structure which does not conform to the use
regulations contained in this section at the time it becomes applicable may be
continued subject to the following provisions:
         1.   Non-conforming use; damage. Any non-conforming sign or sign
structure which has been damaged such that its value has been reduced to less
than 50% of its fair market value shall be required to conform to the use
regulations of this section, except that the Board of Adjustment and Appeals
may grant authority to continue a non-conforming sign when damaged to a greater
extent than 50% of its fair market value, when such is in the best interest of
the public welfare or when undue hardship would otherwise result to the owners
or occupants.
         2.   Non-conforming use; repairs. The repairs and maintenance work, as
required to keep a non-conforming sign or sign structure in sound condition,
may be made, provided that no additions shall be made, except as authorized by
the Board of Adjustment and Appeals.
   Subd. 13.   Administration, permits and inspections.
      A.   Administration. This section shall be administered by a Sign Code
Administrator appointed by the Council.
      B.   Permits.
         1.   No sign shall be erected, altered or relocated without a permit
issued by the Administrator, except as otherwise provided in this Code. Any
permit or license issued in conflict with this Code shall be null and void and
of no effect whatever.
         2.   The permit application shall contain the names and addresses of
the sign owner, sign erector and property owner, a drawing showing the
location, size and design of the sign and other pertinent information as the
Administrator may require to insure compliance with this Code and other
provisions of the City Code. Forms will be provided by the city.
         3.   The following operations shall not be considered as creating a
sign and shall not require a sign permit:

sign shall be valid for a period of 12 months from the date of issuance. The
Administrator may extend the time, at his or her discretion, but not exceeding
an additional six months.
         5.   A sign permit fee shall be paid on each sign in accordance with a
schedule adopted by resolution of the Council.
      C.   Inspection. Signs for which a permit is required may be inspected
periodically by the Administrator for compliance with this Code and other
provisions of the City Code.
      D.   Comprehensive sign plan. A comprehensive sign plan may be prepared
for shopping centers, planned unit developments and other comprehensive
developments. Such a plan, which shall include the location, size, height,
lighting and orientation of all signs, shall be submitted for preliminary plan
approval to the Administrator; provided that such a comprehensive plan is
presented, exceptions to the sign schedule regulations of this section may be
permitted, if the sign areas and densities of the plan as whole are in
conformity with the intent of this section, and if the exception results in an
improved relationship between the various parts of the plan.
      E.   Maintenance. All signs, together with all of their supports, braces,
guys and anchors, shall be kept in repair and in a proper state of
preservation. The display surfaces of all signs shall be kept neatly painted or

violation of its provisions. The person responsible for the violations shall be
given 15 days to correct the violation.
      G.   Danger to public. If a sign is found to be an immediate and serious
danger to the public because of its unsafe condition, it may be removed without
notice and written notice of removal and reasons for such shall be served as
soon as possible under the terms of this section. The owner of the sign shall
be liable for cost of removal of the sign.
      H.   Appeals.
         1.   When a permit is denied, the Administrator shall give notice, in
writing, to the applicant of denial, together with a brief resume of the
reasons for the denial. In order to provide for reasonable interpretation of

CONSTRUCTION SITE EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL
§ 4.80 ESTABLISHED.
   This subchapter shall be known as the "Construction Site Erosion and
Sediment Control Ordinance" of the city and may be so cited.
(Ord. 553, passed 8-6-07)
§ 4.81 INTRODUCTION; PURPOSE.
   Subd. 1.   During the construction process, soil is highly vulnerable to
erosion by wind and water. Eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing
water quality and causing the siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other
desirable species. Eroded soil also necessitates repair of sewers and ditches
and the dredging of lakes. In addition, clearing and grading during
construction cause the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and
aquatic habitat.
   Subd. 2.   As a result, the purpose of this local regulation is to safeguard
persons, protect property, and prevent damage to the environment in the city.
This subchapter will also promote the public welfare by guiding, regulating,
and controlling the design, construction, use, and maintenance of any
development or other activity that disturbs or breaks the topsoil or results in
the movement of earth on land in the city.
   Subd. 3.   This subchapter is not to serve as a replacement for the
regulations set forth by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) or US
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regarding construction activity storm
water permitting. In the event that any regulation contained in this subchapter
conflicts with a corresponding MPCA and/or EPA regulation, the more stringent
or restrictive regulation will be upheld.
(Ord. 553, passed 8-6-07)

questions asked or information required by the application forms shall be
answered fully and completely by the applicant.
   Subd. 2.   False statements. It is unlawful for any applicant to
intentionally make a false statement or omission upon any application form. Any
false statement in the application, or any willful omission to state any
information called for on the application form shall, upon discovery of the

an automatic refusal of license or, if already issued, shall render any license
issued pursuant thereto void and of no effect to protect the applicant from
prosecution for violation of this chapter or any part thereof.
   Subd. 3.   Application and investigation fees. At the time of the initial
application, an applicant for an on-sale or off-sale 3.2% malt liquor or liquor
license or on-sale wine license shall pay to the city the sum of $100 if a
natural person, $200 if a partnership or $300 if a corporation, which fee shall
be considered an application and investigation fee, not refundable to
applicant, to cover the costs of the city in processing the application and the
investigation thereof. No fee shall be required of an applicant for a temporary
3.2% malt liquor license.
   Subd. 4.   Action.
      A.   Granting. The Council may approve any application for the period of
the remainder of the then current license year or for the entire ensuing
license year. All applications including proposed license periods must be
consistent with this chapter.
      B.   Issuing.
         1.   If an application is approved, the city shall forthwith issue a
license pursuant thereto in the form prescribed by the city or the proper
department of the state, as the case may be, and upon payment of the license
fee. All licenses shall be on a calendar year basis unless otherwise specified
herein. For licenses issued and which are to become effective other than on the
first day of the licensed calendar year, the fee to be paid with the
application shall be a pro rata share of the annual license fee on a monthly
basis. Licenses shall be valid only at one location and on the premises therein
described.
         2.   For the purpose of this subparagraph, the following definition
shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning.
            a. CONTIGUOUS PROPERTIES. Included in the definition of “one
location.”
      C.   License refund in certain cases. In the event that, during the
license year, the licensed premises shall be destroyed or so damaged by fire,
or otherwise, that the licensee shall cease to carry on the licensed business,
or in case the business of the licensee shall cease by reason of his or her
illness or death, or if it shall become unlawful for the licensee to carry on
the licensed business under his or her license, except when the license is
revoked, the city shall, upon the happening of any such event, refund to the
licensee or to his or her estate the part of the license fee paid by him or her
as corresponds to the time the license had yet to run. In the event of death of
the licensee, his or her personal representative is hereby authorized to
continue operation of the business for not more than 90 days after the death of
the licensee.
      D.   Transfer. It is unlawful to transfer a license between persons or to
a different location without prior consent of the Council and filing an initial
application; provided that, the license fee for that portion of the unexpired
license term shall be transferable, but an investigation fee shall be
chargeable.
      E.   Refusal and termination. The Council may, in its sole discretion and
for any reasonable cause, refuse to grant any application. No license shall be
granted to a person of questionable moral character or business reputation.
Licenses shall terminate only by expiration or revocation.
      F.   Corporate applicants and licensees.
         1.   A corporate applicant, at the time of application, shall furnish
the city with a list of all persons that have an interest in the corporation
and the extent of the interest. The list shall name all shareholders and show
the number of shares held by each, either individually or beneficially for
others. It is the duty of each corporate licensee to notify the City
Administrator of any change in legal ownership or beneficial interest in the
corporation or in the shares.
         2.   Any change in the ownership or beneficial interest in the shares
entitled to be voted at a meeting of the shareholders of a corporate licensee,
which results in the change of voting control of the corporation by the persons
owning the shares therein, shall be deemed equivalent to a transfer of the
license issued to the corporation, and any such license shall be revoked 30
days after any change in ownership or beneficial interest of shares unless the
Council has been notified of the changes in writing and has approved it by
appropriate action. The Council, or any officer of the city designated by it,
may, at any reasonable time, examine the stock transfer records and minute
books of any corporate licensee in order to verify and identify the
shareholders, and the Council or its designated officer may examine the
business records of any other licensee to the extent necessary to disclose the
interest which persons other than the licensee have in the licensed business.
         3.   The Council may revoke any license issued upon its determination
that a change of ownership of shares in a corporate licensee or any change of
ownership of any interest in the business of any other licensee has actually
resulted in the change of control of the licensed business so as materially to
affect the integrity and character of its management and its operation, but no
such action shall be taken until after a hearing by the Council on notice to
the licensee.
      G.   Revocation or suspension of license. The Council may suspend or
revoke any license for the sale of intoxicating or 3.2% malt liquor for any of
the following reasons:
         1.   False or misleading statements made on a license application or
renewal, or failure to abide by the commitments, promises or representations
made to the Council.
         2. Violation of any special conditions under which the license was
granted, including, but not limited to, the timely payment of real estate
taxes, and all other charges.
         3.   Violation of any federal, state, or local law regulating the sale
of intoxicating liquor, 3.2% malt liquor, or controlled substance.
         4.   Creation of a reoccurring nuisance on the premises or creation of
a reoccurring nuisance in the surrounding area.
         5.   That the licensee allowed or permitted illegal acts upon the
licensed premises or on property owned or controlled by the licensee adjacent
to the licensed premises, unrelated to the sale of intoxicating liquor or 3.2%
malt liquor.
         6.   That the licensee had knowledge of illegal acts upon or
attributable to the licensed premises, but failed to report the same to the
police.
         7. Expiration or cancellation of any required insurance, or failure to
notify the city within a reasonable time of changes in the term of the
insurance or the carriers.
      H.   Act of licensee. Illegal acts performed or conducted by an employee
of the licensee on the licensed premises shall be deemed to be the act of the
licensee for the purpose of this chapter.
(Ord. 114, Second Series, passed 5-21-85)
      I.   Hearing Notice. Revocation or suspension of a license by the Council
shall be preceded by public hearing conducted in accordance with M.S. §§ 14.57
through 14.70. The Council may appoint a hearing examiner or may conduct a
hearing itself. The hearing notice shall be given at least ten days prior to
the hearing, include notice of the time and place of the hearing, and state the
nature of the charges against the licensee.
      J.   Minimum period of operation required.
         1.   It is deemed to be in the public interest because of the limited
number of on-sale and off-sale licenses that are issued, that licensees be in
operation for a majority of the year.
         2.   Failure of the off-sale or on-sale liquor licensee to be in
operation for not less than six months, plus one day during any calendar year,
shall be grounds for non-renewal of the license or revocation of the license
unless:
            a. The failure to be in operation is the result of fire, wind or
other casualty that causes the premises to be substantially unusable for the
operation of the on-sale or off-sale liquor business;
            b. Construction, reconstruction or remodeling of the business
premises which are the licensed premises or are to be the licensed premises,
reasonably delays the operation of the on-sale or off-sale liquor business;
            c. The Council grants to the licensee permission for non-operation
of the business so that it may be in operation for less than the six month,
plus one day of any calendar year; and
            d. The full license fee for the calendar year is paid by the
licensee.
(Ord. 142, Second Series, passed 12-20-86)

(`80 Code, § 5.90) Penalty, see §
1.99
§ 5.99 PENALTY.
   Subd. 1.   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish a standard
by which the Council determines the length of license suspensions and the
propriety of revocations, and shall apply to all premises licensed under this
chapter. These penalties are presumed to be appropriate for every case;
however, the Council may deviate in an individual case where the Council finds
that there exist substantial reasons making it more appropriate to deviate,
such as, but not limited to, a licensee's efforts in combination with the state
or city to prevent the sale of alcohol to minors. When deviating from these
standards, the Council will provide written findings that support the penalty
selected.
   Subd. 2.    Minimum penalties for violations. For the purposes of this
subdivision, a violation is a violation that occurs after the effective date of
§
5.02. The minimum penalties for violations must be presumed as follows (unless
specified, numbers below indicate consecutive days' suspension):
      A.   The following violations require revocation of the license on the
first violation:
         1.   Commission of a felony related to the licensed activity;
         2.   Sale of alcoholic beverages while license is under suspension;
         3.   Sale of intoxicating liquor where only license is for 3.2% malt
liquor.
      B.   The following violations fall under this violation grid broken down
by type of license:
   Violation Grid
 
1st Violation 2nd Violation            3rd Violation              4th Violation
$500          $750 and 3 business days $1,000 and 7 business days Revocation
              suspension               suspension
 
         1.   Sale of alcoholic beverages to under-age persons;
         2.   Sale of alcoholic beverages to obviously intoxicated person;
         3.   After hours sale/display/consumption of alcoholic beverage;
         4.   Illegal gambling on premises; and
         5.   Failure to take reasonable steps to stop person from leaving
premises with alcoholic beverage (on-sale allowing off-sale).
      C.   Any violation not listed in the previous information would be heard
by the Council and they would review all information and circumstances and
determine a penalty with the maximum fine of $2,000 and/or 60-day suspension or
determine the license should be revoked.
      D.   First violations would be handled by an administrative hearing with
the Chief of Police or his/her designee with the presumptive penalty given to
license holders. License holders have the right to request a hearing before the
Council if not in agreement with the presumptive penalty. The Chief of Police
also has the right to request a hearing before the Council if he/she believes
there exists substantial reason making it appropriate to deviate from the
presumptive penalty. If the Chief of Police and licensee agree on the
presumptive penalty, these will be reported to the Council in a staff report.
   Subd. 3.   Multiple violations. At a licensee's first appearance before the
Council, the Council must act upon all of the violations that have been alleged
in the notice sent to the licensee. The Council in that case must consider the
presumptive penalty for each violation under the first violation column in
Subd. 2.B. above. The occurrence of multiple violations is grounds for
deviation from the presumed penalties in the Council's discretion.
   Subd. 4.   Subsequent violations. Violations occurring after the notice of
hearing has been mailed, but prior to the hearing, must be treated as a
separate violation and dealt with as a second appearance before the Council,
unless the Chief of Police and licensee agree in writing to add the violation
to the first appearance. The same procedure applies to a second, third, or
fourth appearance before the Council.
   Subd. 5.  Subsequent appearances. Upon a second, third, or fourth appearance
before the Council by the same licensee, the Council shall impose the
presumptive penalty for the violation or violations giving rise to the
subsequent appearance without regard to the particular violation or violations
that were the subject of the first or prior appearance. However, the Council
may consider the amount of time elapsed between appearances as a basis for
deviating from the presumptive penalty imposed by this section.
   Subd. 6.  Computation of violations. Multiple violations are computed by
checking the time period of the two years immediately prior to the date of the
most current violation.
   Subd. 7.   Other Penalties. Nothing in this section shall restrict or limit
the authority of the Council to suspend up to 60 days, revoke the license,
impose a civil fine not to exceed $2,000, to impose conditions, or take any
other action in accordance with law; provided, that the license holder has been
afforded an opportunity for a hearing in the manner provided in this chapter.

§ 6.34 TOBACCO AND EDIBLE CANNABINOID PRODUCTS.
   Subd. 1. Purpose and intent.
      A.   Tobacco. Because the city recognizes that many retailers sell
tobacco, tobacco products, tobacco related devices, electronic delivery
devices, and nicotine and lobelia delivery products to persons under the age of
21; and because sales to persons under the age of 18 are violations of both
state and federal laws; and because studies, which the city hereby accepts and
adopts, have shown that youth use of any commercial tobacco product has
increased to 26.4% in Minnesota; and because nearly 90% of cigarette users
begin smoking before they have reached the age of 18 years, and that almost no
one starts smoking after age 25; and because commercial tobacco use has been
shown to be the cause of several serious health problems which subsequently
place a financial burden on all levels of government; this section shall be
intended to regulate the sale of tobacco, tobacco products, tobacco related
devices, electronic delivery devices, and nicotine and lobelia delivery devices
for the purpose of enforcing and furthering existing laws, to protect youth and
young adults against the serious effects associated with the use and initiation
of commercial tobacco products and to further the official public policy of the
state in regard to preventing young people from starting to smoke as stated in
M.S. § 144.391, as it may be amended from time to time.
      B.   Edible cannabinoid products. The rapid introduction of newly
legalized edible cannabinoid products (defined below), presents a significant
potential threat to the public health, safety, and welfare of the residents of
the City of Austin, and particularly to youth. It is vital to take reasonable
steps to mitigate this threat and reduce exposure of young people to the
products and the marketing of the products. The United States Surgeon General
has issued an advisory to alert the public to the known and potential harms to
developing brains posed by the increasing availability of highly potent
tetrahydrocannabinol in multiple, concentrated forms, and the reasons for
concerns with the increasing use of such chemicals by pregnant women,
adolescents, and youth. The National Academies of Science, Engineering and
Medicine notes that the growing acceptance, accessibility, and use of
tetrahydrocannabinol and its derivatives have raised important public health
concerns, while the lack of aggregated knowledge of tetrahydrocannabinol health
effects has led to uncertainty about the impact of its use. Nearly 33-million
Americans ages 12 and older reported using cannabis in the past 30 days, and
nearly 50-million Americans reported use in the past year. Ninety percent of
adult use is recreational. These statistics are increasing. Cannabis use during
adolescence, especially products high in tetrahydrocannabinol, or heavy use in
lower doses, is associated with suicide attempts, high school drop-outs, and a
higher likelihood of use of other illicit drugs and experiencing mental health
impairment. The perception of risk from cannabis consumption has been falling
steadily increasing the likelihood of first-time use. Vaping of marijuana by
youth age 18-22 doubled between 2017 and 2018. In 2018, national marijuana use
among full-time college students reached a 35-year high. Nationally, there have
been significant increases in cannabis use among those age 12 and older, but
especially among those age 18-22, and cannabis use rates by youth age 18-22 are
higher in states with legal adult-use cannabis than in non-legal states. Use
during pregnancy has risen substantially between 2000 and 2014, increasing the
risk of low birth weight. In 2016, far more 11th grade students in Minnesota
reported using marijuana in the past 30 days than those reporting cigarette
smoking.
         (1)   In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and
Medicine reviewed the available scientific evidence on the health effects of
cannabis and cannabis-derived products, and while noting substantial evidence
of therapeutic effectiveness of medicinal cannabis for a limited number of
indications, noted evidence of association of cannabis use with harm in a wide
range of areas.
            (a)   This study found “substantial evidence” to support the
following conclusions:
               1.   Initiation of use at an earlier age or more frequent use is
a risk factor for the development of problem cannabis use;
               2.   Maternal cannabis smoking during pregnancy is associated
with low birth weight in offspring;
               3.   Cannabis use is associated with increased risk of motor
vehicle crashes;
               4.   Cannabis use increases the risk of development of
schizophrenia and other psychoses, with the highest risk among the most
frequent users;
               5.   Long-term cannabis smoking is associated with worse
respiratory symptoms and more frequent chronic bronchitis episodes; and
               6.   Increases in cannabis use frequency are associated with
developing problem cannabis use.
            (b)   This study found less conclusive, but still worrisome,
emerging evidence for a wide range of other harms, including impaired academic
achievement and educational outcomes, development of substance use disorders,
suicide completion, high blood pressure and increased unemployment, among
others.
            (c)   The findings of this study and other research lead us to
conclude that:
               1.   Legalization of adult-use cannabis/tetrahydrocannabinol
should be carried out cautiously, in such a way as to prevent undue exposure of
youth and expansion of problem use;
               2.   That unfettered expansion and diversification of products
and of marketing are not prudent; and that
               3.   Like tobacco and alcohol, cannabis/ tetrahydrocannabinol
use may pose significant risks to public health, especially when initiated
early in life.
         (2)   Minnesota has recognized the danger of cannabis use among youth
by prohibiting the sale of edible cannabinoid products to those under age 21
(M.S.§ 151.72, subd. 3(c)) and by requiring that edibles be packaged without
appeal to children and in child-resistant containers (M.S.§ 151.72, subd. 5a
(b)).
         (3)   Many years of alcohol and tobacco retailing, which are likely to
have parallels in edible cannabinoid product retailing, have demonstrated that
Minnesota retailers continue to sell alcohol and tobacco to underage consumers,
as evidenced by the following:
            (a)   Among minors nationwide who smoked cigarettes in 2011, 14%
percent had obtained their own cigarettes by buying them in a store or gas
station; and
            (b)   14.5% of minors nationwide who used alcohol in the past 30
days in 2012 had obtained the alcohol themselves in an alcohol retail outlet.
         (4)   The density of tobacco retailers, particularly in neighborhoods
surrounding schools, has been associated with increased youth smoking rates.
Multiple studies have found that the density of tobacco retailers near schools
was positively associated with the prevalence of students reporting smoking. A
recent study found that higher dispensary density in states with legal cannabis
laws was associated with higher likelihood of youth ages 14-18 experimenting
with cannabis vaping and edibles.
         (5)   Home delivery of alcohol products has been associated with
increased rates of purchase by minors. Unintentional exposure to marijuana by
children under age 10 resulting in seeking care at poison centers in Colorado
increased by 34% between 2009 and 2016, including increases from the two years
before to the two years after legalization.
         (6)   Children and young people are particularly influenced by cues
suggesting tobacco smoking is acceptable, which holds relevance for
tetrahydrocannabinol consumption once legalized. Young people are much more
likely to use candy - and fruit-flavored tobacco and alcohol products than
similar non-flavored products. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the
U.S. Surgeon General have stated that flavored tobacco products are considered
to be “starter” products that help establish smoking habits that can lead to
long-term addiction and similar findings are expected for tetrahydrocannabinol
consumption once legalized. The federal Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco
Control Act (FSPTCA), enacted in 2009, prohibited candy and fruit-flavored
cigarettes, and in 2020 FDA guidance prioritized enforcement against flavored
e-cigarettes largely because these flavored products were marketed to youth and
young adults, and younger smokers were more likely to have tried these products
than older smokers; and similar findings are expected for flavored
tetrahydrocannabinol products. Edible Cannabinoid Products have become
increasingly common and are available in a variety of flavors and forms that
appeal to children and young adults, including cotton candy, lollipops, gummy
bears, brownies, chocolate chip cookies, “pot” tarts, Rice Krispies™ bars, and
bubble gum, apple, cherry, chocolate, grape, peach, strawberry, and vanilla
flavors.
         (7)   The potency of cannabis and cannabis products has increased
dramatically over the past decades from 4% tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to 15-
30+% THC in flower and up to 90% or more in extracted products, and growing
evidence clearly supports greater risk from these products. Daily use of
cannabis products over 10% THC has been associated with fivefold higher odds of
developing psychosis, and such daily use has greatly increased in the past
decade amongst youth. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has
reported that electronic cigarette use among middle and high school students
dramatically increased from 2017 to 2018, up 78% among high schoolers and 48%
among middle schoolers. Use of similar devices for consumption of cannabis by
youth has been rapidly increasing in Minnesota with 18.2% of high school
students reporting they have used an e-cigarette device to vape marijuana.
While the sale of edible cannabinoid products has been legalized in Minnesota,
it continues to be a Schedule I prohibited substance federally and therefore
presents special challenges in multiple federally regulated spheres including
banking, broadcasting and immigration. Youth exposure to advertising of
products such as alcohol, tobacco and food has been shown to create positive
attitudes, brand identification, and an increased likelihood of initiation and
use of these products.
         (8)   The City Council finds that a local regulatory system for edible
cannabinoid product retailers is appropriate to ensure that retailers comply
with the cannabis laws and business standards of the City of Austin to protect
the health, safety, and welfare of our youth and most vulnerable residents. The
City of Austin has the opportunity to be proactive and make decisions that
improve compliance among edible cannabinoid retailers with laws prohibiting the
sale or marketing of cannabis products to underage persons. Research has
demonstrated that local tobacco retail ordinances dramatically reduce youth
access to cigarettes, and therefore provide a useful model for preventing sales
to youth of cannabis products. A review of U.S. jurisdictions with strong
tobacco retailer licensing ordinances showed that youth cigarette and e-
cigarette use was lower than in jurisdictions with weaker tobacco retailer
licensing ordinances. A requirement for an edible cannabinoid product retailer
permit will not unduly burden legitimate business activities of retailers who
sell or distribute edible cannabinoid products to adults, but will allow the
City of Austin to regulate the operation of lawful businesses to discourage
violations of state and local cannabis-related laws. The City of Austin has a
substantial interest in promoting compliance with state and local laws intended
to regulate sales and use of edible cannabinoid products and promoting
compliance with laws prohibiting sales of such products to underage persons.
Low prices are known to facilitate use of tobacco by minors and while prices of
edible cannabinoid products should not be so high as to promote illicit sales,
they should also not be artificially lowered through discounting or depressed
by overproduction. Research demonstrates that youth are particularly price
sensitive and responsive to changes in price, and in the case of tobacco, when
cigarettes cost more, fewer adolescents start smoking, and similar findings are
expected for edible cannabinoid products. It is the intent of the City Council,
in enacting this section, to ensure responsible edible cannabinoid product
retailing, allowing legal sale and access, without promoting increases in use,
and to discourage violations of cannabis-related laws, especially those which
prohibit or discourage the marketing, sale or distribution of cannabis and
cannabis products to youth under 21 years of age.

Penalty, see Subd. 13.
   Subd. 9. Responsibility. All licensees under this section shall be
responsible for the actions of their employees in regard to the sale of
licensed products on the licensed premises, and the sale of an item by an

section shall be construed as prohibiting the city from also subjecting the
clerk to whatever penalties are appropriate under this section, state or
Federal law, or other applicable law or regulation.
Penalty, see Subd. 13.

Recorder’s office on forms furnished for that purpose. The forms shall be filed
not later than ten days following the end of each month as to the waste
collected and deposited at the Transfer Station during the immediately

Recorder agreeing to pay the interest as a condition to issuance, renewal or
continuance of a garbage or refuse hauler’s license.
         7.   Failure of a licensed hauler to complete the report forms
required herein or to make payment of the fees or charges and interest thereon,
if any, as required herein for the use of the Transfer Station or for
availability of the Transfer Station when due shall be grounds for revocation
of the license or grounds for refusal to renew the license.
         8.   In the event a licensed hauler residential or commercial becomes
more than 45 days delinquent from date of billing in payment of charges, the
city may require a payment bond in a form approved by the City Attorney to
secure and provide for payment of charges. The bond to be in an amount
sufficient to cover estimated charges for three months or amount of delinquency
whichever is greater as a condition of holding or renewing the license. In lieu
of a payment bond, the licensed hauler may furnish to the city a letter of
credit in a form prescribed by the City Attorney in an amount sufficient to
cover estimated charges for three months or the amount of delinquency whichever
is greater as a condition of holding or renewing the license.

charges to a designated agent of the city at the ultimate place of deposit in
respect to waste bypassing the Transfer Station.

charge in the amount as set by resolution of the Council for waste delivered to
a site other than the City Transfer Station. The generator of waste shall be
required to make monthly reports of all waste to a site other than the City
Transfer Station on forms furnished by the City Recorder for that purpose.
      N.   All fees or charges imposed by resolution of the Council pursuant to
this section shall be paid within ten days after the month in which the waste
was hauled to a site other than the City Transfer Station and, in any event,
not less than ten days after being billed for the same.
      O.   Failure of a licensed hauler to complete the forms accurately or

ten days after receipt of a notice thereof given either personally or sent by
registered mail to the address shown on the return. If the tax paid is greater
than the tax found to be due, the excess shall be refunded to the person who
paid the tax to the city within ten days after determination of the refund.

City Recorder shall make a return or corrected return, for the person from the
knowledge and information as the City Recorder can obtain, and assess a tax on
the basis thereof, which tax (less any payments theretofore made on account of
the tax for the taxable period covered by the return) shall be paid upon within

aggregate. If the penalty, as computed, does not exceed $10, a minimum penalty
of $10 shall be assessed. The amount so added to any tax shall be collected at
the same time and the same manner and as a part of the tax unless the tax has
been paid before the discovery of the negligence, in which case the amount so
added shall be collected in the same manner as the tax.
      C.   If any person willfully fails to file any return or make any payment
required by this section, or willfully files a false or fraudulent return or
willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat a tax or payment thereof,
there shall also be imposed as a penalty an amount equal to 50% of any tax

§ 6.56 PAWN SHOPS; LICENSING AND REGULATING PAWNBROKERS.
   Subd. 1.   Purpose.
      A.   The City Council finds that use of services provided by pawnbrokers
provides an opportunity for the commission of crimes and their concealment
because pawn businesses have the ability to receive and transfer property
stolen by others easily and quickly. The City Council also finds that consumer
protection regulation is warranted in transactions involving pawnbrokers. The
purpose of this section is to prevent pawn businesses from being used as
facilities for the commission of crimes and to assure that such businesses
comply with basic consumer protection standards, thereby protecting the public
health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the city.
      B.   To help the City of Austin Police better regulate current and future
pawn businesses, decrease and stabilize costs associated with the regulation of
the pawn industry, and increase identification of criminal activities in the
pawn industry through the timely collection and sharing of pawn transaction
information, this section also implements and establishes the required use of
the Automated Pawn System (APS).
   Subd. 2.   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      A.   PAWNBROKER. Any natural person, partnership or corporation, either
as principal, or agent or employee thereof, who loans money on deposit or
pledge of personal property or other valuable thing; or who deals in the
purchasing of personal property, or other valuable thing on condition of
selling the same back again at a stipulated price within a fixed period of
time; or who loans money secured by chattel mortgage on personal property,
taking possession of the property or any part thereof so mortgaged. To the
extent that a pawnbroker's business also includes buying personal property
previously used, rented or leased, or selling it on consignment, the provisions
of this chapter shall be applicable.
   The following are expressly exempt from the definition of pawnbroker: any
bank regulated by the State of Minnesota, the comptroller of the currency of
the United States, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the board of
governors of the Federal Reserve System, or any other federal or state
authority and their affiliates; any bank or savings association whose deposits
or accounts are eligible for insurance by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation or any successor to it and all affiliates of those banks and
savings associations; any state or federally chartered credit union; any
industrial loan and thrift company or regulated lender subject to licensing and
regulation by the Department of Commerce; and antique and second hand goods
dealers, so long as they do not engage in the activities of a pawnbroker as
defined herein.
      B.   REPORTABLE TRANSACTION. Every transaction conducted by a pawnbroker
in which merchandise is received through a pawn, purchase, consignment or
trade, or in which a pawn is renewed, extended or redeemed, is reportable
except:
         1.   The bulk purchase or consignment of new or used merchandise from
a merchant, manufacturer or wholesaler having an established permanent place of
business, and the retail sale of said merchandise, provided the pawnbroker must
maintain a record of such purchase or consignment which describes each item,
and must mark each item in a manner which relates it to that transaction
record.
         2.   Retail and wholesale sales of merchandise originally received by
pawn or purchase, and for which all applicable hold and/or redemption periods
have expired.
      C.   BILLABLE TRANSACTION. Every reportable transaction conducted by a
pawnbroker except renewals, redemptions or extensions of existing pawns on
items previously reported and continuously in the licensee's possession is a
billable transaction.
   Subd. 3.   License required. No person shall engage in the business of
pawnbroker at any location without a pawnbroker license for that location. No
pawnbroker license may be transferred to a different location or a different
person. Issuance of a license under this chapter shall not relieve the licensee
from obtaining any other licenses required to conduct business at the same or
any other locations.
   Subd. 4.   License fees.
      A.   The annual license fees for licenses issued under this chapter shall
be established by City Council resolution within the following parameters. The
billable transaction license fee shall reflect the cost of processing
transactions electronically and manually and other related regulatory expenses
as determined by the City Council, and shall be reviewed and adjusted, if
necessary, at least annually. Licensees shall be notified in writing 30 days
before any adjustment is implemented.
      B.   Billable transaction fees shall be billed monthly and are due and
payable within 30 days. Failure to do so is a violation of this chapter.
   Subd. 5.   Investigation fee. An applicant for a new license under this
chapter, or for the renewal of an existing license that is more than six months
past due, shall deposit an investigation fee deposit with the City Clerk at the

Council.

         1. A small wireless facility shall only be collocated on the
particular wireless support structure, under those attachment specifications,
and at the height indicated in the applicable permit application.
         2. No new wireless support structure installed within the right-of-way
shall exceed 50 feet in height without the city's written authorization,
provided that the city may impose a lower height limit in the applicable permit
to protect the public health, safety and welfare or to protect the right-of-way
and its current use, and further provided that a registrant may replace an
existing wireless support structure exceeding 50 feet in height with a
structure of the same height subject to such conditions or requirements as may
be imposed in the applicable permit.
         3. No wireless facility may extend more than ten feet above its
wireless support structure.
         4. Where an applicant proposes to install a new wireless support
structure in the right-of-way, the city may impose separation requirements
between such structure and any existing wireless support structure or other
facilities in and around the right-of-way.
         5. Where an applicant proposes collocation on a decorative wireless
support structure, sign or other structure not intended to support small
wireless facilities, such equipment shall be consistent with the city's
aesthetic standards regarding wireless equipment as adopted by the City
Engineer. Such standards shall ensure that wireless equipment is installed with
a stealth design and that equipment does not detract from the character of the
area in which it is installed. In addition, the City Engineer shall adopt
standards that ensure city assets can continue to effectively perform their
intended function. Standards shall be made available with the application
required for a small cell permit.
         6. Where an applicant proposes to replace a wireless support
structure, the city may impose reasonable restocking, replacement, or
relocation requirements on the replacement of such structure.

         1. Up to $150 per year for rent to collocate on the city structure.
         2. $25 per year for maintenance associated with the collocation;
         3. A monthly fee for electrical service as follows:
            a. $73 per radio node less than or equal to 100 maximum watts;
            b. $182 per radio node over 100 maximum watts; or
            c. The actual costs of electricity, if the actual cost exceeds the
foregoing.
         The standard collocation agreement shall be in addition to, and not in
lieu of, the required small wireless facility permit, provided, however, that
the applicant shall not be additionally required to obtain a license or
franchise in order to collocate. Issuance of a small wireless facility permit
does not supersede, alter or affect any then-existing agreement between the
city and applicant.
   Subd. 11. Action on small wireless facility permit applications.
      A. Deadline for action. The city shall approve or deny a small wireless
facility permit application within 90 days after filing of such application or
within any timeline established by state law. The small wireless facility
permit, and any associated building permit application, shall be deemed
approved if the city fails to approve or deny the application within the review
periods established in this Subd. 11.
      B. Consolidated applications. An applicant may file a consolidated small
wireless facility permit application addressing the proposed collocation of up
to 15 small wireless facilities, or a greater number if agreed to by a local

application:
         1. Are located within a two-mile radius;
         2. Consist of substantially similar equipment; and
         3. Are to be placed on similar types of wireless support structures.
      In rendering a decision on a consolidated permit application, the city
may approve some small wireless facilities and deny others, but may not use
denial of one or more permits as a basis to deny all small wireless facilities
in the application.
      C. Tolling of deadline. The 90-day deadline for action on a small
wireless facility permit application may be tolled if:
         1. The city receives applications from one or more applicants seeking
approval of permits for more than 30 small wireless facilities within a seven-
day period. In such case, the city may extend the deadline for all such
applications by 30 days by informing the affected applicants in writing of such
extension.
         2. The applicant fails to submit all required documents or information
and the city provides written notice of incompleteness to the applicant within
30 days of receipt of the application. Upon submission of additional documents
or information, the city shall have ten days to notify the applicant in writing
of any still-missing information.
         3. The city and a small wireless facility applicant agree in writing
to toll the review period.
   Subd. 12. Permit fees.
      A. Excavation permit fee. The city shall impose an excavation permit fee
in an amount sufficient to recover the following costs:
         1. The city management costs;
         2. Degradation costs, if applicable.
      B. Obstruction permit fee. The city shall impose an obstruction permit
fee in an amount sufficient to recover the city management costs.

has revoked for a breach as stated in Subd. 22 are not refundable.
      F. Application to franchises. Unless otherwise agreed to in a franchise,
management costs may be charged separately from and in addition to the
franchise fees imposed on a right-of-way user in the franchise.
   Subd. 13. Right-of-way patching and restoration.
      A. Timing. The work to be done under the excavation permit, and the
patching and restoration of the right-of-way as required herein, must be
completed within the dates specified in the permit, increased by as many days
as work could not be done because of circumstances beyond the control of the
permittee or when work was prohibited as unseasonal or unreasonable under Subd.
16.
      B. Patch and restoration. Permittee shall patch its own work. The city
may choose either to have the permittee restore the right-of-way or to restore
the right-of-way itself.
         1. Permittee restoration. If the permittee restores the right-of-way
itself, it shall at the time of application for an excavation permit post a
construction performance bond in accordance with the provisions of Minn. Rules,
part 7819.3000.
         2. City restoration. If the city restores any part of the right-of-
way, permittee shall pay the costs thereof within 30 days of billing. If,
within 24 months following such restoration, the pavement settles due to
permittee's improper backfilling, the permittee shall pay to the city, within
30 days of billing, all costs associated with correcting the defective work.
      C. Standards. The permittee shall perform excavation, backfilling,
patching, and restoration according to the standards and with the materials
specified by the city and shall comply with Minn. Rules, part 7819.1100.
      D. Duty to correct defects. The permittee guarantees its work for 24
months following its completion. During this time the permittee shall correct
defects in patching or restoration performed by permittee or its agents. The
permittee upon notification from the city, shall correct all restoration work
to the extent necessary, using the method required by the city. Said work shall
be completed within five calendar days of the receipt of the notice from the
city, not including days during which work cannot be done because of
circumstances constituting force majeure or days when work is prohibited as
unseasonable or unreasonable under Subd. 16.
      E. Failure to restore. If the permittee fails to restore the right-of-way
in the manner and to the condition required by the city, or fails to
satisfactorily and timely complete all restoration required by the city, the
city at its option may do such work. In that event the permittee shall pay to
the city, within 30 days of billing, the cost of restoring the right-of-way. If
permittee fails to pay as required, the city may exercise its rights under the
construction performance bond.
   Subd. 14. Joint applications.
      A. Joint application. Registrants may jointly apply for permits to
excavate or obstruct the right-of-way at the same place and time.
      B. Shared fees. Registrants who apply for permits for the same
obstruction or excavation, which the city does not perform, may share in the
payment of the obstruction or excavation permit fee. In order to obtain a joint
permit, registrants must agree among themselves as to the portion each will pay
and indicate the same on their applications.
      C. With city projects. Registrants who join in a scheduled obstruction or
excavation performed by the city, whether or not it is a joint application by
two or more registrants or a single application, are not required to pay the
excavation or obstruction and degradation portions of the permit fee, but a
permit would still be required.
   Subd. 15. Supplementary applications.
      A. Limitation on area. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the area
of the right-of-way specified in the permit. No permittee may do any work
outside the area specified in the permit, except as provided herein. Any
permittee which determines that an area greater than that specified in the
permit must be obstructed or excavated must before working in that greater
area: (i) make application for a permit extension and pay any additional fees
required thereby; and (ii) be granted a new permit or permit extension.
      B. Limitation on dates. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the dates
specified in the permit. No permittee may begin its work before the permit
start date or, except as provided herein, continue working after the end date.
If a permittee does not finish the work by the permit end date, it must apply
for a new permit for the additional time it needs, and receive the new permit
or an extension of the old permit before working after the end date of the
previous permit. This supplementary application must be submitted before the
permit end date.
   Subd. 16. Other obligations.
      A. Compliance with other laws. Obtaining a right-of-way permit does not
relieve permittee of its duty to obtain all other necessary permits, licenses,
and authority and to pay all fees required by the city or other applicable
rule, law or regulation. A permittee shall comply with all requirements of
local, state and federal laws, including but not limited to M.S. §§ 216D.01-.09
(Gopher One Call Excavation Notice System) and Minn. Rules, Chapter 7560. A
permittee shall perform all work in conformance with all applicable codes and
established rules and regulations, and is responsible for all work done in the
right-of-way pursuant to its permit, regardless of who does the work.
      B. Prohibited work. Except in an emergency, and with the approval of the
city, no right-of-way obstruction or excavation may be done when seasonally
prohibited from December 1 through March 15 or when conditions are unreasonable
for such work.
      C. Interference with right-of-way.
         1. A permittee shall not so obstruct a right-of-way that the natural
free and clear passage of water through the gutters or other waterways shall be
interfered with. Private vehicles of those doing work in the right-of-way may
not be parked within or next to a permit area, unless parked in conformance
with city parking regulations. The loading or unloading of trucks must be done
solely within the defined permit area unless specifically authorized by the
permit.
         2. Traffic control shall conform to the Minnesota Manual on Uniform
Traffic-Control Devices, including the Temporary Traffic-Control Zones Field
Manual and any directions of the City Engineer.
      D. Trenchless excavation. As a condition of all applicable permits,
permittees employing trenchless excavation methods, including but not limited
to horizontal directional drilling, shall follow all requirements set forth in
M.S. Chapter 216D and Minn. Rules, Chapter 7560 and shall require potholing or
open cutting over existing underground utilities before excavating, as
determined by the Director.
      E. Verify location of facility.
         1. At the written request of the city, a person shall determine the
exact location of their facility, both vertically and horizontally, by means of
"potholing" or some other acceptable method, to expose the facility. Reasons to
verify shall include, but are not limited to, the following:
            a. To verify that the facility was installed at the proper depth
and horizontal location per the permit; and
            b. To verify actual depth and location for:
               i. A present or future city use of the right-of-way;
               ii. A public improvement undertaken by the city or by the county
or town under a cooperative agreement with the city;
               iii. A public improvement undertaken by a private landowner, as
authorized or required by the city;
               iv. When the public health, safety and welfare require it; or
               v. When necessary to prevent interference with the safety and
convenience of ordinary travel over the right-of-way.
         2. All costs to expose the facility shall be done at the permittee's
expense or the city may upon written notice to the permittee, expose the
facility, at the permittee's expense.
         3. Verification of facilities, both vertical and horizontal, shall be
completed within seven calendar days of written notification.
   Subd. 17. Denial or revocation of permit.
      A. Reasons for denial. The city may deny a permit for failure to meet the
requirements and conditions of this section or if the city determines that the
denial is necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public or
when necessary to protect the right-of-way and its current use and any city
asset or facility.
      B. Procedural requirements. The denial or revocation of a permit must be
made in writing and must document the basis for the denial. The city must
notify the applicant or right-of-way user in writing within three business days
of the decision to deny or revoke a permit. If an application is denied, the
right-of-way user may address the reasons for denial identified by the city and
resubmit its application. If the application is resubmitted within 30 days of
receipt of the notice of denial, no additional application fee shall be
imposed. The city must approve or deny the resubmitted application within 30
days after submission.
   Subd. 18. Installation requirements. The excavation, backfilling, patching
and restoration, and all other work performed in the right-of-way shall be done
in conformance with Minn. Rules, parts 7819.1100 and 7819.5000 and other
applicable local requirements, insofar as they are not inconsistent with the
M.S. §§ 237.162 and 237.163. Installation of service laterals shall be
performed in accordance with Minn. Rules, Chapter 7560 and these ordinances.
Service lateral installation is further subject to those requirements and
conditions set forth by the city in the applicable permits and/or agreements
referenced in Subd. 22(B) of this section.
   Subd. 19. Inspection.
      A. Notice of completion. When the work under any permit hereunder is
completed, the permittee shall furnish a completion certificate in accordance
Minn. Rules, part 7819.1300 or other as built documentation as deemed necessary
by the City Engineer.
      B. Site inspection. Permittee shall make the work site available to the
city and to all others as authorized by law for inspection at all reasonable
times during the execution of and upon completion of the work.
      C. Authority of Director.

cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the life, health, safety,
or well-being of the public.
         2. The Director may issue an order to the permittee for any work that
does not conform to the terms of the permit or other applicable standards,
conditions, or codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the
violation will be cause for revocation of the permit. Within ten days after
issuance of the order, the permittee shall present proof to the Director that
the violation has been corrected. If such proof has not been presented within
the required time, the Director may revoke the permit pursuant to Subd. 22.
   Subd. 20. Work done without a permit.
      A. Emergency situations. Each registrant shall immediately notify the
Director of any event regarding its facilities that it considers to be an
emergency. The registrant may proceed to take whatever actions are necessary to
respond to the emergency. Excavators' notification to Gopher State One Call
regarding an emergency situation does not fulfill this requirement. Within two
business days after the occurrence of the emergency, the registrant shall apply
for the necessary permits, pay the fees associated therewith, and fulfill the
rest of the requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with this
section for the actions it took in response to the emergency.
      If the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding a registrant's
facilities, the city will attempt to contact the local representative of each
registrant affected, or potentially affected, by the emergency. In any event,
the city may take whatever action it deems necessary to respond to the
emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the registrant whose facilities
occasioned the emergency.
      B. Non-emergency situations. Except in an emergency, any person who,
without first having obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or excavates a
right-of-way must subsequently obtain a permit and, as a penalty, pay double
the normal fee for said permit, pay double all the other fees required by the
city code, deposit with the city the fees necessary to correct any damage to
the right-of-way, and comply with all of the requirements of this section.
   Subd. 21. Supplementary notification.  If the obstruction or excavation of
the right-of-way begins later or ends sooner than the date given on the permit,
permittee shall notify the city of the accurate information as soon as this
information is known.
   Subd. 22. Revocation of permits.
      A. Substantial breach. The city reserves its right, as provided herein,
to revoke any right-of-way permit without a fee refund, if there is a
substantial breach of the terms and conditions of any statute, ordinance, rule
or regulation, or any material condition of the permit. A substantial breach by
permittee shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following:
         1. The violation of any material provision of the right-of-way permit.
         2. An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the right-
of-way permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit
upon the city or its citizens.
         3. Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a
right-of-way permit.
         4. The failure to complete the work in a timely manner, unless a
permit extension is obtained or unless the failure to complete work is due to
reasons beyond the permittee's control.
         5. The failure to correct, in a timely manner, work that does not
conform to a condition indicated on an order issued pursuant to Subd. 19.
      B. Written notice of breach. If the city determines that the permittee
has committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any statute,
ordinance, rule, regulation, or any condition of the permit, the city shall
make a written demand upon the permittee to remedy such violation. The demand
shall state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the
permit. A substantial breach, as stated above, will allow the city, at its
discretion, to place additional or revised conditions on the permit to mitigate
and remedy the breach.
      C. Response to notice of breach. Within 24 hours of receiving
notification of the breach, permittee shall provide the city with a plan,
acceptable to the city, that will cure the breach. Permittee's failure to so
contact the city, or permittee's failure to timely submit an acceptable plan,
or permittee's failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be
cause for immediate revocation of the permit. Further, permittee's failure to
so contact the city, or permittee's failure to submit an acceptable plan, or
permittee's failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall
automatically place the permittee on probation for one full year.
      D. Cause for probation. From time to time, the city may establish a list
of conditions of the permit, which if breached will automatically place the
permittee on probation for one full year, such as, but not limited to, working
out of the allotted time period, working on right-of-way grossly outside of the
permit authorization, improper technique (including, but not limited to,
improper compaction) leading to surface failure, violations of M. S. Chapter
216D, negligently hitting or damaging infrastructure, etc.
      E. Automatic revocation. If a permittee, while on probation, commits a
breach as outlined above, permittee's permit will automatically be revoked and
permittee will not be allowed further permits for one full year, except for
emergency repairs.
      F. Reimbursement of city costs. If a permit is revoked, the permittee
shall also reimburse the city for the city's reasonable costs, including
restoration costs and the costs of collection and reasonable attorneys' fees
incurred in connection with such revocation.
   Subd. 23. Mapping data.
      A. Information required. Each registrant and permittee shall provide
mapping information required by the city in accordance with Minn. Rules, parts
7819.4000 and 7819.4100. Within 90 days following completion of any work
pursuant to a permit, the permittee shall provide the Director accurate maps
and drawings certifying the "as-built" location of all equipment installed,
owned, and maintained by the permittee. Such maps and drawings shall include
the horizontal and vertical location of all facilities and equipment and shall
be provided consistent with the city's electronic mapping system, when
practical or as a condition imposed by the Director. Failure to provide maps
and drawings pursuant to this subsection shall be grounds for revoking the
permit holder's registration. Information shall be submitted in AutoCAD (or a
format compatible with AutoCAD or readily convertible to AutoCAD) or GIS format
with survey grade accuracy.
      B. Service laterals. All permits issued for the installation or repair of
service laterals, other than minor repairs as defined in Minn. Rules, part
7560.0150, Subp. 2, shall require the permittee's use of appropriate means of
establishing the horizontal locations of installed service laterals and the
service lateral vertical locations in those cases where the Director reasonably
requires it. Permittees or their subcontractors shall submit to the Director
evidence satisfactory to the Director of the installed service lateral
locations. Compliance with this Subd. 23(B) and with applicable Gopher State
One Call law and Minnesota Rules governing service laterals installed after
Dec. 31, 2005, shall be a condition of any city approval necessary for:
      1. Payments to contractors working on a public improvement project,
including those under M.S. Chapter 429; and
      2. City approval under development agreements or other subdivision or
site plan approval under M.S. Chapter 462. The Director shall reasonably
determine the appropriate method of providing such information to the city.
Failure to provide prompt and accurate information on the service laterals
installed may result in the revocation of the permit issued for the work or
future permits to the offending permittee or its subcontractors.
   Subd. 24. Location and relocation of facilities.
      A. Placement, location, and relocation of facilities must comply with the
Act, with other applicable law, with other applicable standards adopted by the
City Engineer, and with Minn. Rules, parts 7819.3100, 7819.5000, and 7819.5100,
to the extent the rules do not limit authority otherwise available to cities.
      B. Corridors. The city may assign a specific area within the right-of-
way, or any particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of
facility that is or, pursuant to current technology, the city expects will
someday be located within the right-of-way. All excavation, obstruction, or
other permits issued by the city involving the installation or replacement of
facilities shall designate the proper corridor for the facilities at issue.
      Any registrant who has facilities in the right-of-way in a position at
variance with the corridors established by the city shall, no later than at the
time of the next reconstruction or excavation of the area where the facilities
are located, move the facilities to the assigned position within the right-of-
way, unless this requirement is waived by the city for good cause shown, upon
consideration of such factors as the remaining economic life of the facilities,
public safety, customer service needs, and hardship to the registrant.
      C. Nuisance. One year after the passage of this section, any facilities
found in a right-of-way that have not been registered shall be deemed to be a
nuisance. The city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in
equity, including, but not limited to, abating the nuisance or taking
possession of the facilities and restoring the right-of-way to a useable
condition.
      D. Limitation of space. To protect the health, safety, and welfare of the
public, or when necessary to protect the right-of-way and its current use, the
city shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or
additional facilities within the right-of-way. In making such decisions, the
city shall strive to the extent possible to accommodate all existing and
potential users of the right-of-way, but shall be guided primarily by
considerations of the public interest, the public's needs for the particular
utility service, the condition of the right-of-way, the time of year with
respect to essential utilities, the protection of existing facilities in the
right-of-way, and future city plans for public improvements and development
projects which have been determined to be in the public interest.
      E. Relocation of facilities. A registrant must, promptly and at its own
expense, with due regard for seasonal working conditions, permanently remove
and relocate its facilities in the right-of-way whenever the Director for good
cause requests such removal and relocation, and shall restore the right-of-way
consistent with city standards and regulations and MN/DOT standard
specifications. The Director may make such request to prevent interference by
the company's equipment or facilities with:
         1. A present or future city use of the right-of-way;
         2. A public improvement undertaken by the city or county under a
cooperative agreement;
         3. A public improvement undertaken by a private landowner, as
authorized or required by the city;
         4. When the public health, safety and welfare require it; or
         5. When necessary to prevent interference with the safety and
convenience of ordinary travel over the right-of-way.
      F. Relocation notification procedure.
         1. The Director shall notify the utility owner when possible at least
four months in advance of the need to relocate existing facilities so the owner
can plan the relocation. The Director shall provide a second notification to
the owner two weeks before the owner needs to begin the relocation. The utility
owner shall begin relocation of the facilities within one week of the second
notification. All utilities shall be relocated within one month. The Director
may allow a different schedule if it does not interfere with the city's
project. The utility owner shall diligently work to relocate the facilities
within the above schedule.
         2. In the event that emergency work by the city or other municipality
in the city right-of-way requires relocation of a utility, the notification
requirements above are waived. The city and utility shall coordinate efforts to
minimize delay.
      G. Delay to city project.
         1. The Director shall notify the utility owner if the owner's progress
will not meet the relocation schedule. If the owner does not take action to
ensure the relocation will be completed in accordance with the above schedule
and the Director feels this delay will have an adverse impact to a city
project, then the Director may hire a competent contractor to perform the
relocation. In that event, the city may charge the utility owner all costs
incurred to relocate the facility.
         2. The city may charge the utility owner for all costs incurred and
requested by a contractor working for the city who is delayed because the
relocation is not completed in the scheduled time frame and for all costs
incurred by the city due to the delay.
         3. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a person shall not be required to
remove or relocate its facilities from any right-of-way which has been vacated
in favor of a non-governmental entity unless and until the reasonable costs
thereof are first paid to the person.
         4. However, this does not exempt the utility company from paying for
the value of any taking of said property by occupation without compensation.
   Subd. 25. Pre-excavation facilities location. In addition to complying with
the requirements of M.S. §§ 216D.01-.09 ("One Call Excavation Notice System")
before the start date of any right-of-way excavation, each registrant who has
facilities or equipment in the area to be excavated shall mark the horizontal
and vertical placement of all said facilities. Any registrant whose facilities
are less than 20 inches below a concrete or asphalt surface shall notify and
work closely with the excavation contractor to establish the exact location of
its facilities and the best procedure for excavation.
   Subd. 26. Damage to other facilities.
      A. When the city does work in the right-of-way and finds it necessary to
maintain, support, or move a registrant's facilities to protect it, the city
shall notify the local representative as early as is reasonably possible. Any
costs incurred by the city in maintaining, supporting, or moving registrant's
facilities under this paragraph will be billed to that registrant and must be
paid within 30 days from the date of billing.
      B. Each registrant shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any
facilities in the right-of-way which it or its facilities damage. Each
registrant shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any damage to the
facilities of another registrant caused during the city's response to an
emergency occasioned by that registrant's facilities.
   Subd. 27. Right-of-way vacation.
      A. Reservation of right. If the city vacates a right-of-way that contains
the facilities of a registrant, the registrant's rights in the vacated right-
of-way are governed by Minn. Rules, part 7819.3200.
   Subd. 28. Indemnification and liability. By registering with the city, or by
accepting a permit under this section, a registrant or permittee agrees to
defend and indemnify the city in accordance with the provisions of Minn. Rules,
part 7819.1250.
   Subd. 29. Abandoned and unusable facilities.
      A. Discontinued operations. A registrant who has determined to
discontinue all or a portion of its operations in the city must provide
information satisfactory to the city that the registrant's obligations for its
facilities in the right-of-way under this section have been lawfully assumed by
another registrant.
      B. Removal. Any registrant who has abandoned facilities in any right-of-
way shall remove it from that right-of-way promptly upon notice that the area
has been opened in conjunction with other right-of-way repair, excavation, or
construction, unless this requirement is waived by the city. Unreasonable delay
will result in abandoned facilities being removed by the city at the expense of
the registrant. For spot excavations, the city may proceed to remove abandoned
facilities within the excavation and charge the registrant for any costs
incurred as part of the removal. Any charges under this Subd. 29 must be paid
within 30 days from the date of billing.
   Subd. 30. Appeal.  A right-of-way user that: (1) has been denied
registration; (2) has been denied a permit; (3) has had a permit revoked; (4)
believes that the fees imposed are not in conformity with Minn. Stat. §
237.163, Subd. 6; or (5) disputes a determination of the Director regarding
Subd. 23(B) of this section may have the denial, revocation, fee imposition, or
decision reviewed, upon written request, by the City Council. The City Council
shall act on a timely written request at its next regularly scheduled meeting,
provided the right-of-way user has submitted its appeal with sufficient time to
include the appeal as a regular agenda item. A decision by the City Council
affirming the denial, revocation, or fee imposition will be in writing and
supported by written findings establishing the reasonableness of the decision.
   Subd. 31. Reservation of regulatory and police powers.  A permittee's rights
are subject to the regulatory and police powers of the city to adopt and
enforce general ordinances as necessary to protect the health, safety, and
welfare of the public.
   Subd. 32. Severability.  If any portion of this section is for any reason
held invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be
deemed a separate, distinct, and independent provision and such holding shall
not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof. Nothing in this
section precludes the city from requiring a franchise agreement with the
applicant, as allowed by law, in addition to requirements set forth herein.

or discontinue public grounds, streets, alleys and highways within said city.
No such vacation or discontinuance shall be granted or ordered by the City
Council, except upon the petition of one or more residents and freeholders in
said city; such petition shall set forth the facts and reasons for such
vacation, accompanied by a plat of such public grounds, streets, alleys or
highways proposed to be vacated, verified by the oath of the petitioner. The
Council shall thereupon, if it deems it expedient that the matter shall be
proceeded with, order the petition to be filed of record with the City
Recorder, who shall give public notice by publication in the official paper of
the city for four successive weeks, at least once in each week, to the effect
that such petition has been filed as aforesaid, stating, in brief, its object
and that said petition will be heard and considered by the Council, or a
committee appointed by it, at a certain time and place specified, not less than
ten days after the expiration of such notice.
      B.   The Council, or such committee as may be appointed by it for the
purpose, at the time and place appointed, shall be present and shall
investigate and consider the matter, and shall hear the testimony and evidence,
together with the objections on the part of the parties interested. If, after
having heard the testimony, evidence and objections, the Council shall
determine in favor of such vacation, it shall then appoint three freeholders of
said city, no two of whom shall reside in the same ward, as commissioners to
view the premises and to ascertain carefully the amount of damages and
compensation to be paid to the owners or property which may be injured by such
vacation, and to assess the benefits which may accrue to the lands and property
which may be benefitted by such vacation, and in proportion to the benefits to
be received and without regard to its cash valuation. Two of such commissioners
shall constitute a quorum and be competent to perform any duty required of such
commissioners; they shall be notified of their appointment, and vacancies in
their number be filled in the same manner. They shall give notice by two
publications, in the official paper of said city, that such survey and plat is
on file in the office of the City Recorder for the examination of all persons
interested, and that they will, on a day designated in such notice, which shall
be at least ten days after the first publication of such notice, meet at a
place, designated in said notice, on or near the proposed improvements, and
view that portion of the street proposed to be vacated, and ascertain and award
therefor the damages and compensation, and assess thereon the benefits actually
accruing to such property as may be benefitted by reason of such vacation; and
that they will then hear such evidence and proof as interested parties may
offer. And such commissioners shall meet and view the premises pursuant to such
notice, and may adjourn from time to time, and after having viewed the
premises, may, for the hearing of evidence and preparation of their award and
assessment, adjourn or go to any other convenient place in said city, and may
have the aid and advice of the City Engineer and of the other officers of the
city.
      C.   After viewing the premises and hearing evidence offered, such
commissioners shall prepare and make a true and impartial appraisement and
award of the compensation and damages to be paid to each person whose property
may be injured by reason of such contemplated vacation, and of the amount of
benefits, if any, which may accrue to property by reason thereof, and may
offset the amount of benefits thus accruing against the damages which may be
sustained by reason of such vacation. In each case they shall award only the
excess of the compensation and damages over and above such benefits.
      D.   The said commissioners shall then report to the City Council an
assessment list containing their appraisement of such compensation and damages,
or such charges thereon as shall not exceed the actual benefits to the property
so assessed, which list shall contain a brief description of each tract or
parcel of property assessed, the name or names of the owners thereof, if known,
and the amount assessed, of the excess of such compensation and damages as
aforesaid which they shall return unassessed. Such report shall lie over until
the next regular meeting of the Council, which shall occur one week after the
reception thereof, at which time, or at any other meeting, the City Council may
act on such report and hear any complaint touching such award or assessment, or
it may refer the matter to a committee of the Council to hear such complaint,
and report thereon.
      E.   The Council may confirm such award and assessment of either, or
annul the same, or send the same back to the same commission for further
consideration, and the commissioners may, in either case, again, upon giving a
like notice as herein provided, meet at a time and place to be designated in
such notice, which shall be given as provided for the first notice, meet and
hear any further evidence that same to the City Council, who may thereupon
confirm or annul the same.
      F.   Whenever the City Council shall confirm any such award and
assessment, such confirmation shall make such award and assessment final and
conclusive upon all parties interested, except as hereinbefore provided, and
the Council shall proceed at the same or any subsequent meeting, to levy such
assessment upon the several parcels of land described in the assessment list
reported to the commissioners in accordance with the assessment so confirmed,
and cause to be made and adopted an assessment roll of the same, which may be
in such form as the Council may adopt.
      G.   When damages are awarded to any person or persons as provided in
this section, in excess of benefits, the Council shall order the same to be
paid, out of the general fund of the City Treasury, on warrants to be drawn in
the usual form; said warrants to be issued to the person or persons entitled
thereto, at the expiration of the time for appeal, as hereinafter provided.
      H.   The Council, upon the confirmation of such award and assessment,
may, by an order passed by a two-thirds vote of all the members elect, declare
such public grounds, streets, alleys or highways, vacated, which said order,
after the same go into effect, shall be published as in the case of ordinances,
and thereupon a transcript of such order, duly certified by the City Recorder,
shall be filed for record and duly recorded in the office of the County
Register of Deeds.
   Subd. 2.   Appeals from vacating of streets.
      A.   Any person feeling aggrieved by any such vacation or discontinuance,
or by any such assessment of damages therefor as herein provided, shall have
the right at any time, within ten days after the publication of the order
vacating such street, alley or highway, to appeal to the County District Court
from such confirmation of such assessment or from such order declaring such
vacation, where such appeal shall be tried by the court and jury as ordinary
cases, and the judgment of which court shall be final. It shall be the duty of
the City Recorder, as soon as any appeal is taken to transmit to the proper
court a certified copy of the record of all proceedings in the case at the
expense of appellant. Such appeal shall be entered and brought on for trial and
be governed by the same rules in all respects as appeals from justices of the
peace in civil suits, except that no pleadings shall be required.
   Subd. 3.   Plats to be filed with County Recorder. Whenever any highway,
street, alley, or public ground is laid out, widened, narrowed, enlarged or any
of the same are vacated or discontinued under the provisions hereof, the City
Council shall cause an accurate survey and plat thereof to be made and filed in
the office of the County Recorder.

   Subd. 1.   Policy and purpose. The city has determined that the health of
oak, elm and ash trees is threatened by fatal diseases and pests known as Oak
Wilt, Dutch Elm Disease, and Emerald Ash Borer. It has further determined that
the loss of trees located on public and private property would substantially
depreciate the value of property and impair the safety, good order, general
welfare and convenience of the public. It is declared to be the intention of
the Council to control and prevent the spread of these diseases and provide for
the removal of dead or diseased trees, as nuisances.
   Subd. 2.   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a

or wood on any public or private property, he or she shall proceed as follows:
         1.   If the Tree Inspector finds that the danger of infection of other
trees is not imminent because of dormancy of shade tree disease, he or she
shall make a written report of his or her finding to the Council, which shall
proceed by:
            a.   Abating the nuisance as a public improvement under M.S.
Chapter 429, as it may be amended from time to time; or
            b.   Abating the nuisance as provided in Subpar. B of this

action is taken on the resolution, the Council shall publish notice of its
intention to meet to consider taking action to abate the nuisance. This notice
shall be mailed to affected property owners and published once no less than one
week prior to the meeting. The notice shall state the time and place of the
meeting, the streets affected, action proposed, the estimated cost of the
abatement and the proposed basis of assessment, if any, of costs. At the

shall, thereafter, adopt a resolution confirming the original resolution with
the modifications as it considers desirable and provide for the doing of the
work by day labor or by contract.
      C.   The Tree Inspector shall keep a record of the costs of abatements
done under this subdivision and shall report monthly to the City Administrator

description of the land, lots, parcels involved and the amount chargeable to
each.
      D.   On or before September 1 of each year, the City Administrator shall
list the total unpaid charges for each abatement against each separate lot or
parcel to which they are attributable under this section. The Council may then

under the supervision of the Commissioner and his or her agents whenever
possible.
      B.   The Tree Inspector will provide residents available information on
Emerald Ash Borer pesticides when requested, but will remain neutral on whether
or not to use pesticides. Residents may use state approved pesticides only and
chemical treatment does not preclude future removal of the ash tree if deemed
necessary by the city.
      C.   The notice and assessment provisions of Subd. 7 apply to spraying
and treatment operations conducted under this subdivision.
   Subd. 9.   Transporting wood prohibited. It is unlawful for any person to

intended destination lying outside the city and “disease control area.”

or private property;
            b.   Engaged in any attack on any person under circumstances which
would indicate danger to personal safety;
            c.   Exhibited unusually aggressive behavior, such as an attack on
another animal;
            d.   Bitten one or more persons on two or more occasions; or
            e.   Been found to be potentially dangerous and/or the owner has
personal knowledge of the same, the animal aggressively bites, attacks, or
endangers the safety of humans or domestic animals.
         2.   POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS ANIMAL.  An animal which has:
            a.   Bitten a human or a domestic animal on public or private
property;
            b.   When unprovoked, chased or approached a person upon the
streets, sidewalks, or any public property in an apparent attitude of attack;

threatening the safety of humans or domestic animals.
         3.   PROPER ENCLOSURE.  Securely confined indoors or in a securely
locked pen or structure suitable to prevent the animal from escaping and to
provide protection for the animal from the elements. A PROPER ENCLOSURE does
not include a porch, patio, or any part of a house, garage, or other structure
that would allow the animal to exit of its own volition, or any house or
structure in which windows are open or in which door or window screens are the
only barriers which prevent the animal from exiting. The enclosure shall not
allow the egress of the animal in any manner without human assistance. A pen or
kennel shall meet the following minimum specifications:
            a.   Have a minimum overall floor size of 32 square feet.
            b.   Sidewalls shall have a minimum height of five feet and be

cover shall be constructed of the same gauge wire or heavier as the sidewalls
and shall also have no openings in the wire greater than two inches.
            d.   An entrance/exit gate shall be provided and be constructed of
the same material as the sidewalls and shall also have no openings in the wire
greater than two inches. The gate shall be equipped with a device capable of
being locked and shall be locked at all times when the animal is in the pen or
kennel.
         4.   UNPROVOKED. The condition in which the animal is not purposely
excited, stimulated, agitated or disturbed.
      D. Designation as potentially dangerous animal. The Animal Control
Officer shall designate any animal as a potentially dangerous animal upon
receiving evidence that the potentially dangerous animal has, when unprovoked,
then bitten, attacked, or threatened the safety of a person or a domestic
animal as stated in Subd. 20.C.2. When an animal is declared potentially
dangerous, the Animal Control Officer shall cause one owner of the potentially
dangerous animal to be notified in writing that the animal is potentially
dangerous, and shall be given 14 days to appeal this designation by requesting
a hearing before the City Council for a review of said determination.
         1. If an owner requests a hearing for determination as to the
potentially dangerous nature of the animal, the hearing shall be held before
the City Council, which shall set a date for hearing not more than three weeks
after demand for the hearing. The records of the Animal Control or City Clerk's
office shall be admissible for consideration by the Animal Control Officer
without further foundation. After considering all evidence pertaining to the
temperament of the animal, the City Council shall make an order as it deems
proper, including when circumstances warrant an Order determining the animal is
dangerous at which time the provisions of Austin Code § 10.10, Subd. 20.G,
Subd. 21, and Subd. 21 shall apply to the disposition of said animal.
         2. A form for requesting a hearing shall be provided to the owner at

dangerous, or the owner may obtain such a form from the City Clerk's office
upon request during regular business hours. When submitting a request for
hearing, the owner must pay a non-refundable Hearing Fee of $75. No hearing
shall be scheduled absent the payment in full of the Hearing Fee.
         3. The form for requesting a hearing shall clearly describe the
required Hearing Fee described above.
(Am. Ord. 679, passed 2-18-20)
      E.   Evidence justifying designation. The Animal Control Officer shall
have the authority to designate any animal as a dangerous animal upon receiving
evidence of the following:
         1.   That the animal has, when unprovoked, bitten, attacked, or
threatened the safety of a person or domestic animal as stated in Subd. 20.C.1.
         2.   That the animal has been declared potentially dangerous and the
animal has then bitten, attacked, or threatened the safety of a person or
domestic animal as stated in Subd. 20.C.1.
      F.   Authority to order destruction. The Animal Control Officer, upon
finding that an animal is dangerous hereunder, is authorized to order, as part
of the disposition of the case, that the animal be destroyed based on a written
order containing one or more of the following findings of fact:
         1.   The animal is dangerous as demonstrated by a vicious attack, an
unprovoked attack, an attack without warning or multiple attacks; or
         2.   The owner of the animal has demonstrated an inability or
unwillingness to control the animal in order to prevent injury to persons or
other animals.
      G. Procedure. The Animal Control Officer, after having determined that an
animal is dangerous, may proceed in the following manner: The Animal Control
Officer shall cause one owner of the animal to be notified in writing or in
person that the animal is dangerous and may order the animal seized or make
orders as deemed proper. The owner shall be notified as to dates, times, places
and parties bitten, and shall be given 14 days to appeal this order by
requesting a hearing before the City Council for a review of this
determination.
         1. If no appeal is filed, the Animal Control Officer shall obtain an
order or warrant authorizing the seizure and the destruction of the animal from
a court of competent jurisdiction, unless the animal is already in custody or
the owner consents to the seizure and destruction of the animal.
         2. If an owner requests a hearing for determination as to the
dangerous nature of the animal, the hearing shall be held before the City
Council, which shall set a date for hearing not more than three weeks after
demand for the hearing. The records of the Animal Control or City Clerk's
office shall be admissible for consideration by the Animal Control Officer
without further foundation. After considering all evidence pertaining to the
temperament of the animal, the City Council shall make an order as it deems
proper. The City Council may order that the Animal Control Officer take the
animal into custody for destruction, if the animal is not currently in custody.
If the animal is ordered into custody for destruction, the owner shall
immediately make the animal available to the Animal Control Officer. If the
owner does not immediately make the animal available, the Animal Control
Officer shall obtain an order or warrant authorizing the seizure and the
destruction of the animal from a court of competent jurisdiction.
         3. No person shall harbor an animal after it has been found by to be
dangerous and ordered into custody for destruction.
         4. A form for requesting a hearing shall be provided to the owner at
the time the owner is advised of the designation of the animal as either
dangerous or potentially dangerous, or the owner may obtain such a form from
the City Clerk's office upon request during regular business hours. When
submitting a request for hearing, the owner must pay a non-refundable Hearing
Fee of $75, and a "Hearing Deposit" equal to the city's established impounding
fee for animals calculated based on 21 days of potential impounding pending the
hearing. No hearing shall be scheduled absent the payment in full of the
Hearing Fee and Hearing Deposit. The Hearing Deposit shall be applied to the
owner's responsibility to pay the impounding fee for all days the animal is
impounded, and absent an appeal of an adverse determination at the hearing, the
Hearing Deposit shall constitute payment in full of such impounding fees. If
the hearing results in a determination that either the designation of the
animal was not substantially justified by law or that the animal should not be
destroyed, the Hearing Deposit shall be refunded to the owner and all costs of
impounding the animal shall be paid by the city.
         5. In the event an aggrieved owner appeals an order for destruction
made following a hearing to the Court of Appeals, the owner may provide an
Appeal Deposit which shall operate to stay the order for destruction pending
the outcome of the appeal to the Court of Appeals. Absent such Appeal Deposit,
the Order for Destruction shall not be stayed. The Appeal Deposit shall be
equal to the city's established impounding fee for animals calculated based on
180 days of potential impounding pending the outcome of the appeal to the Court
of Appeals. This Appeal Deposit shall be applied to the owner's responsibility
to pay the impounding fee for all days the animal is impounded not already
covered by the Hearing Deposit. If such Appeal Deposit is insufficient to fully
cover such impounding fees, the owner remains responsible for any deficiency.
If the appeal results in a determination that the disposition following hearing
was not substantially justified by law, the hearing deposit shall be refunded
to the owner and all costs of impounding the animal shall be paid by the city.
If the owner disputes the amount of said appeal deposit, the owner shall follow
the process governing appellate review of the form and amount of security
pending appeal (currently found in Minnesota Rules of Appellate Procedure
108.02, subd. 6).
         6. The form for requesting a hearing shall clearly describe the
required Hearing Fee, Hearing Deposit, and Appeal Deposit described above.
(Am. Ord. 679, passed 2-18-20)
      H.   Stopping an attack. If any police officer or Animal Control Officer
is witness to an attack by an animal upon a person or another animal, the
officer may take whatever means the officer deems appropriate to bring the
attack to an end and prevent further injury to the victim.
      I.   Notification of new address. The owner of an animal which has been
identified as dangerous or potentially dangerous shall notify the Animal
Control Officer in writing if the animal is to be relocated from its current
address or given or sold to another person. The notification shall be given in
writing at least 14 days prior to the relocation or transfer of ownership. The
notification shall include the current owner’s name and address, the relocation
address, and the name of the new owner, if any.
Penalty, see §
1.99
   Subd. 21.   Dangerous animal requirements.
      A.   Requirements. If the City Council does not order the destruction of
an animal that has been declared dangerous, the City Council may, as an
alternative, order any or all of the following:
         1.   That the owner provide and maintain a proper enclosure for the
dangerous animal as specified in Subd. 20 above;
         2.   Post the front and the rear of the premises with clearly visible
warning signs, including a warning symbol to inform children, that there is a
dangerous animal on the property as specified in M.S. § 347.51 as may be
amended from time to time;
         3.   Provide and show proof annually of public liability insurance in
the minimum amount of $300,000;
         4.   If the animal is a dog and is outside the proper enclosure, the
dog must be muzzled and restrained by a substantial chain or leash (not to
exceed six feet in length) and under the physical restraint of a person 16
years of age or older. The muzzle must be of a design as to prevent the dog
from biting any person or animal, but will not cause injury to the dog or
interfere with its vision or respiration;
         5.   If the animal is a dog, it must have an easily identifiable,
standardized tag identifying the dog as dangerous affixed to its collar at all
times as specified in M.S. § 347.51 as it may be amended from time to time, and
shall have a microchip implant as provided by M.S. § 347.151, as it may be
amended from time to time;
         6.   All animals deemed dangerous by the Animal Control Officer shall
be registered with the county in which this city is located within 14 days
after the date the animal was so deemed and provide satisfactory proof thereof
to the Animal Control Officer.
         7.   If the animal is a dog, the dog must be licensed and up to date
on rabies vaccination. If the animal is a cat or ferret, it must be up to date
with rabies vaccination.
      B.   Seizure. As authorized by M.S. § 347.54, as it may be amended from
time to time, the Animal Control Officer shall immediately seize any dangerous
animal if the owner does not meet each of the above requirements within 14 days
after the date notice is sent to the owner that the animal is dangerous.
Seizure may be appealed to district court by serving a summons and petition
upon the city and filing it with the district court.
      C.   Reclaiming animals. A dangerous animal seized under Subpar. B above
may be reclaimed by the owner of the animal upon payment of impounding and
boarding fees and presenting proof to animal control that each of the
requirements under Subpar. B, is fulfilled. An animal not reclaimed under this
section within 14 days may be disposed of as provided under Subd. 20.F, and the
owner is liable to the city for costs incurred in confining and impounding the
animal.
      D.   Subsequent offenses. If an owner of an animal has subsequently
violated the provisions under Subd. 20.F with the same animal, the animal must
be seized by animal control. The owner may request a hearing as defined in
Subd. 20.F. If the owner is found to have violated the provisions for which the
animal was seized, the Animal Control Officer shall order the animal destroyed
in a proper and humane manner and the owner shall pay the costs of confining
the animal. If the person is found not to have violated the provisions for
which the animal was seized, the owner may reclaim the animal under the
provisions of Subpar. C above. If the animal is not yet reclaimed by the owner
within 14 days after the date the owner is notified that the animal may be
reclaimed, the animal may be disposed of as provided under Subd. 20.F and the
owner is liable to the animal control for the costs incurred in confining,
impounding and disposing of the animal.

§ 10.34 HOSTING AN EVENT OR GATHERING WHERE ALCOHOL IS PRESENT AND BEING
POSSESSED AND CONSUMED BY PERSONS UNDER 21 YEARS OF AGE PROHIBITED.
   Subd. 1.   Purpose and findings. The City Council intends to discourage
underage possession and consumption of alcohol, even if done within the
confines of a private residence, and intends to hold persons criminally
responsible who host events or gatherings where persons under 21 years of age
possess or consume alcohol regardless of whether the person hosting the event
or gathering supplied the alcohol. The City Council finds that:
      A.    Events and gatherings held on private or public property where
alcohol is possessed or consumed by persons under the age of 21 are harmful to
those persons and constitute a potential threat to public, from injuries
related to alcohol consumption, such as alcohol overdose or alcohol-related
traffic collisions.
      B.    Prohibiting underage consumption acts to protect underage persons,
as well as the general public, from injuries related to alcohol consumption,
such as alcohol overdose or alcohol-related traffic collisions.
      C.    Alcohol is an addictive drug which, if used irresponsibly, could
have drastic effects on those who use it as well as those who are affected by
the actions of an irresponsible user.
      D.    Often, events or gatherings involving underage possession and
consumption occur outside the presence of parents. However, there are times
when the parent(s) is/are present and condone the activity, and in some
circumstances provide the alcohol.
      E.    Even though giving or furnishing alcohol to an underage person is a
crime, it is difficult to prove, and an ordinance is necessary to help further
combat underage consumption.
      F.    A deterrent effect will be created by holding a person criminally
responsible for hosting an event or gathering where underage possession or
consumption occurs.
   Subd. 2.   Authority.  This section is enacted pursuant to M.S. § 145A.05,
Subd. 1.

if the person intentionally aids, advises, hires, counsels, or conspires with

present at the event or gathering to be criminally responsible.

ZONING DISTRICTS AND MAP
§ 11.020 DISTRICTS.
   Subd. 1. In order to classify, regulate and restrict the location of trade
and industry, and location of buildings designated for specific uses, to
protect residential uses, to regulate and limit the height and bulk of
buildings hereafter erected or altered, to regulate and limit the intensity of
the use of lot areas and to regulate and determine the areas of yards and open
space within and surrounding the buildings, the city is hereby divided into
zoning districts.
   Subd. 2. The use, height and area regulations shall be as described for each
district, and the districts shall be known as:
      A. R-1 Single-Family Residence District. The R-1 District is established
to encourage the preservation of residential neighborhoods characterized by
single-family buildings on medium sized lots and to preserve undeveloped lands
for similar types of residential development by permitting a minimum of
auxiliary non-residential uses.
      B. R-2 Multi-Family Residence District. It is the purpose of the R-
2 District to assist in the maintenance and development of desirable
residential neighborhoods, characterized by high density development,
appropriate levels of service and choice of tenancy. Non-residential uses
permitted in this district shall be limited to those uses and buildings that
will provide stability and dignity to the area as a residential neighborhood.
      C. R-O Multi-Family Residence - Office District. It is the purpose of the
R-O District to restore economic value to developed sections of the city in
multi-family residential, commercial, or mixed use where existing properties
are no longer practical for single-family residency, and where residential
properties along major thoroughfares can be removed and replaced by modern
residential and office buildings.
      D. B-2 Community Business District. It is the purpose of the B-2 District
to permit and to encourage the establishment of commercial shopping centers
which offer a wide variety of consumer goods and services. It is intended that
the community business district serve a larger population and larger area than
the B-1 District and, when located along major highways and thoroughfares,
accommodate primarily automotive-oriented establishments.
      E. B-3 Central Business District. It is the purpose of the B-3 District
to permit and encourage the establishment of a wide variety of uses in the
downtown in such a way as to attract people to live, work and play to maintain
Austin's traditional downtown as a regional tourism and cultural center. Design
standards will be implemented to maintain the character of Main Street and 4th
Avenue.
      F. I-1 Limited Industrial District. It is the purpose of the I-1 District
to create industrial areas that will be acceptable within the city and will not
adversely affect adjacent business or residential neighborhoods by permitting
industrial establishments which are those whose operations are relatively free
from objectionable influences or ones whose objectionable features will be
obviated by design and/or appropriate devices.
      G. I-2 Industrial District. It is the purpose of the I-2 District to
create industrial areas to accommodate a wide variety of industrial
establishments who may operate to their maximum advantage without adversely
affecting other nearby similar or dissimilar uses and activities.
      H. I-3 Business/Industrial Park District. It is the purpose of the I-
3 District to provide for the establishment of industrial development that is
compatible with surrounding or abutting residential districts and encourage
high level performance standards. Development in the Business/Industrial
District is limited to administrative, wholesaling, manufacturing and related
compatible uses, with suitable open spaces, landscaping and parking areas.
      I. A-1 Agriculture, Recreation and Conservation District. It is the
purpose of the A-1 District to encourage the preservation of areas within the
planning area where farmland will ultimately be converted to urban land use or
where urbanization is not likely to occur, including areas subject to
acquisition as permanent open space areas.
      J. SZO Shoreland Overlay. It is the purpose of the Shoreland Overlay to
regulate the subdivision, use and development of the shorelands of public
waters and thus preserve and enhance the quality of surface waters, conserve
the economic and natural environmental values of shorelands, and provide for
the wise use of waters and related land resources.
      K. RM Residential Manufactured Home District. It is the purpose of the R-
M District to set aside areas within the city wherein manufactured homes can be
placed in a safe and healthful environment with due regard to their necessity
as a residential dwelling unit.
      L. PD Planned Unit Development District. It is the purpose of the PD
District to encourage a more creative and efficient development of land in
residential, commercial or mixed uses and its improvements than is possible
under the more restrictive application of zoning dimensional requirements,
while at the same time meeting the standards and purposes of the comprehensive
plan and preserving the health, safety and welfare of the citizens; to allow
for a mixture of residential units and commercial in an integrated and well-
planned area while ensuring concentration of open space into more usable areas;
and the preservation of the natural resources of the site including wetlands,
woodlands, steep slopes and scenic areas.

   Subd. 3. In un-subdivided property, the district boundary lines shown on the
zoning map and overlay district map shall be determined by use of the scale
shown on such map.
      A. Annexed territory. For any land which may be annexed to the city in

§ 11.042 S-O, SHORELAND OVERLAY.
   Subd. 1. Statutory authorization and policy.
      A. Statutory authorization. This shoreland ordinance is adopted pursuant
to the authorization and policies contained in M.S. Ch. 103F, as it may be
amended from time to time, Minnesota Rules, Parts 6120.2500 through 6120.3900,
and the planning and zoning enabling legislation in M.S. Ch. 462, as it may be
amended from time to time.
      B. Policy. The Legislature of Minnesota has delegated responsibility to
local governments of the state to regulate the subdivision, use and development
of the shorelands of public waters and thus preserve and enhance the quality of
surface waters, conserve the economic and natural environmental values of
shorelands, and provide for the wise use of waters and related land resources.
This responsibility is hereby recognized by the City of Austin.
   Subd. 2. General provisions and definitions.
      A. Jurisdiction. The provisions of this section apply to the shorelands
of the public water bodies as classified in Subd. 4.A. of this section, and to
the shorelands of public water bodies greater than ten acres in unincorporated
areas in which the city has, by ordinance, extended the application of its
zoning regulations as provided by M.S. § 462.357 Subd 1, as it may be amended
from time to time. Pursuant to Minnesota Rules, Parts 6120.2500 through
6120.3900, no lake, pond, or flowage less than ten acres in size in
municipalities, or 25 acres in size in unincorporated areas need be regulated
in a local government's shoreland regulations. A body of water created by a
private user where there was no previous shoreland may, at the discretion of
the governing body, be exempt from this section.
      B. Enforcement. The City of Austin is responsible for the administration
and enforcement of this section. Any violation of the provisions of this
section or failure to comply with any of its requirements including violations
of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variances
or conditional uses constitutes a misdemeanor and is punishable as defined by
law. Violations of this section can occur regardless of whether or not a permit
is required for a regulated activity listed in this section.
      C. Severability. If any subdivision, clause, provision, or portion of
this section is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the remainder of this section shall not be affected thereby.
      D. Abrogation and greater restrictions. It is not intended by this
section to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or
deed restrictions. However, where this section imposes greater restrictions,
the provisions of this section shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent
with this section are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.

Statutes and are subject to the following:
         1. A variance may not circumvent the general purposes and intent of
this section; and
         2. For properties with existing sewage treatment systems, a
certificate of compliance, consistent with Minnesota Rules, is required for
variance approval. A sewage treatment system shall be considered compliant if
the only deficiency is the system's improper setback from the ordinary high
water level.
      F. Conditional uses. All conditional uses in the shoreland area are
subject to a thorough evaluation of the waterbody and the topographic,
vegetation, and soil conditions to ensure:
         1. The prevention of soil erosion or other possible pollution of
public waters, both during and after construction;
         2. The visibility of structures and other facilities as viewed from
public waters is limited;
         3. There is adequate water supply and on-site sewage treatment; and
         4. The types, uses, and numbers of watercraft that the project will
generate are compatible in relation to the suitability of public waters to
safely accommodate these watercrafts.
      G. Mitigation.
         1. In evaluating all variances, conditional uses, zoning and building
permit applications, the zoning authority shall require the property owner to
address the following conditions, when related to and proportional to the
impact, to meet the purpose of this section, to protect adjacent properties and

section may continue, but will be managed according to Minnesota Statutes and
other regulations of this community for alterations and additions; repair after
damage; discontinuance of use; and intensification of use.
         2. All additions or expansions to the outside dimensions of an
existing nonconforming structure must meet the setback, height, and other
requirements of Subd. 5. through Subd. 8. of this section. Any deviation from
these requirements must be authorized by a variance.
      I. Notifications to the Department of Natural Resources.
         1. All amendments to this shoreland section must be submitted to the
Department of Natural Resources for review and approval for compliance with the
statewide shoreland management rules. The city will submit the proposed
amendments to the Commissioner or the Commissioner's designated representative

            c. Uses that require short-term watercraft mooring for patrons must
centralize these facilities and design them to avoid obstructions of
navigation, and to be the minimum size necessary to meet the need; and
            d. Uses that depend on patrons arriving by watercraft may use signs
and lighting, provided that:
               i. Signs placed in or on public waters must only convey
directional information or safety messages and may only be placed by a public
authority or under a permit issued by the county sheriff; and
               ii. Signs placed within the shore impact zone are:
                  A. No higher than ten feet above the ground, and no greater
than 32 square feet in size; and
                  B. If illuminated by artificial lights, the lights must be
shielded or directed to prevent illumination across public waters; and
               iii. Other lighting may be located within the shore impact zone
or over public waters if it is used to illuminate potential safety hazards and
is shielded or otherwise directed to prevent direct illumination across public
waters. This does not preclude use of navigational lights.
         2. Commercial, industrial, public, and semipublic uses that are not
water-dependent must be located on lots or parcels without public waters
frontage, or, if located on lots or parcels with public waters frontage, must
either be set back double the ordinary high water level setback or be
substantially screened from view from the water by vegetation or topography,
assuming summer, leaf-on conditions.
      B. Agriculture use standards.
         1. Buffers.
            a. The shore impact zone for parcels with permitted agricultural
land uses is equal to a line parallel to and 50 feet from the ordinary high
water level.
            b. General cultivation farming, grazing, nurseries, horticulture,
truck farming, sod farming, and wild crop harvesting are permitted uses if
steep slopes and shore and bluff impact zones are maintained in perennial
vegetation or operated under an approved conservation plan consistent with the
field office technical guides of the local soil and water conservation district
or the Natural Resource Conservation Service, and as approved by the local soil
and water conservation district.
      C. Forest management standards.
         1. The harvesting of timber and associated reforestation must be
conducted consistent with the applicable provisions of the Sustaining Minnesota
Forest Resources: Voluntary Site-Level Forest Management Guidelines for
Landowners, Loggers and Resource Managers.
         2. Intensive vegetation clearing for forest land conversion to another
use is a conditional use subject to an erosion control and sedimentation plan
developed and approved by the soil and water conservation district.
   Subd. 6. Dimensional and general performance standards.
      A. Purpose. To establish dimensional and performance standards that
protect shoreland resources from impacts of development.
      B. Lot area and width standards. After the effective date of this
section, all new lots must meet the minimum lot area and lot width requirements

            c. Watercraft docking facilities for each lot must be centralized
in one location and serve all dwelling units in the building; and
            d. No more than 25% of a lake's shoreline can be in duplex,
triplex, or quad developments.
         2. Controlled access lots are permissible if created as part of a
subdivision and in compliance with the following standards:
            a. The lot must meet the area and width requirements for
residential lots, and be suitable for the intended uses of controlled access
lots as provided in Subd. 6. C. 2. d.;
            b. If docking, mooring, or over-water storage of more than six
watercraft is to be allowed at a controlled access lot, then the width of the
lot (keeping the same lot depth) must be increased by a percentage of the
requirements for riparian residential lots for each watercraft beyond six,
consistent with the following table:
 
Ratio of lake size to shore length  Required percent increase in frontage
(acres/mile)

provided riparian access rights on the access lot; and
            d. Covenants or other equally effective legal instruments must be
developed that:
               i. Specify which lot owners have authority to use the access
lot;
               ii. Identify what activities are allowed. The activities may
include watercraft launching, loading, storage, beaching, mooring, docking,
swimming, sunbathing, or picnicking;
               iii. Limit the total number of vehicles allowed to be parked and
the total number of watercraft allowed to be continuously moored, docked, or

               iv. Require centralization of all common facilities and
activities in the most suitable locations on the lot to minimize topographic
and vegetation alterations; and
               v. Require all parking areas, storage buildings, and other
facilities to be screened by vegetation or topography as much as practical from
view from the public water, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions.
         3. Access easements. Easements providing access to boat docking and
mooring facilities to non-riparian property owners are prohibited.
      D. Placement, height, and design of structures.
         1. OHWL setback for structures and sewage treatment systems. When more
than one setback applies to a site, structures and facilities must be located
to meet all setbacks, and comply with the following OHWL setback provisions.
The structure setback standards for sewered properties can only be used if
publicly owned sewer system service is available.

            a. OHWL setbacks. Structures, impervious surfaces, and sewage
treatment systems must meet setbacks from the ordinary high water level (OHWL),
except that one water-oriented accessory structure or facility, designed in
accordance with Subd. 7. C. of this section, may be set back a minimum distance
of ten feet from the OHWL.
            b. Setback averaging. Where structures exist on the adjoining lots
on both sides of a proposed building site, structure setbacks may be altered
without a variance to conform to the adjoining setbacks from the OHWL, provided
the proposed structure is not located in a shore impact zone or in a bluff
impact zone (see Figure 8).

            c. Setbacks of decks. Deck additions may be allowed without a
variance to a structure not meeting the required setback from the ordinary high
water level if all of the following criteria are met:
               i. The structure existed on the date the structure setbacks were
established;
               ii. A thorough evaluation of the property and structure reveals
no reasonable location for a deck meeting or exceeding the existing ordinary
high water level setback of the structure;
               iii. The deck encroachment toward the ordinary high water level
does not exceed 15% of the existing setback of the structure from the ordinary
high water level, or is no closer than 30 feet from the OHWL, whichever is more
restrictive; and
               iv. The deck is constructed primarily of wood, and is not roofed
or screened (see Figure 9).

            d. Additional structure setbacks. Structures must also meet the
following setbacks, regardless of the waterbody classification:
 
Setback from:                                                    Setback (ft)
Top of bluff                                                     30
Unplatted cemetery                                               50
Right-of-way line of federal, state, or county highway           50
Right-of-way line of town road, public street or other roads not 20
classified
 
            e. Bluff impact zones. Structures, impervious surfaces, and
accessory facilities, except stairways and landings, must not be placed within
bluff impact zones.
         2. Height of structures. All structures in residential districts in
cities, except churches and nonresidential agricultural structures, must not
exceed 25 feet in height.
         3. Low floor elevation.
            a. Determining elevations. Structures must be placed at an
elevation consistent with the applicable floodplain regulatory elevations.
Where these controls do not exist, the elevation to which the low floor,
including basement, is placed or flood-proofed must be determined as follows:
               i. For lakes, by placing the low floor at a level at least three
feet above the highest known water level, or three feet above the ordinary high
water level, whichever is higher (see Figure 9);
               ii. For rivers and streams, by placing the low floor at least
three feet above the highest known flood elevation. If highest known flood
elevation is not available, by placing the low floor at least three feet above
the ordinary high water level (see Figure 10), or by conducting a technical
evaluation to establish a flood protection elevation. Technical evaluations
must be done by a qualified engineer or hydrologist consistent with Minnesota
Rules, parts 6120.5000 through 6120.6200.
            b. Methods for placement.
               i. In addition to the low floor, all service utilities must be
elevated or water-tight to the elevation determined in Subd. 6.D.3.a.
               ii. If elevation methods involving fill would result in filling
in the SIZ, then structures must instead be elevated through floodproofing
methods in accordance with Subd. 6.D.3.a.iii. below;
               iii. If the structure is floodproofed, then it must be built to
resist hydrostatic pressure through elevation methods such as blocks, pilings,
filled stem walls, elevated concrete pad, internally flooded enclosed areas, or
through other accepted engineering practices consistent with FEMA Technical
Bulletins 1, 2 and 3 (see Figure 10).

         4. Significant historic sites. No structure may be placed on a
significant historic site in a manner that affects the values of the site
unless adequate information about the site has been removed and documented in a
public repository.
      E. Water supply and sewage treatment.
         1. Water supply. Any public or private supply of water for domestic
purposes must meet or exceed standards for water quality of the Minnesota
Department of Health and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.
         2. Sewage treatment. Any premises used for human occupancy must be
connected to a publicly-owned sewer system, where available, or comply with
Minnesota Rules, Chapters 7080 through 7081.
   Subd. 7. Performance standards for public and private facilities.
      A. Placement and design of roads, driveways, and parking areas. Public
and private roads and parking areas must be designed to take advantage of
natural vegetation and topography to achieve maximum screening as viewed from
public waters and comply with the following standards:
         1. Roads, driveways, and parking areas must meet structure setbacks
and must not be placed within bluff and shore impact zones, when other
reasonable and feasible placement alternatives exist. If no alternatives exist,
they may be placed within these areas, and must be designed to minimize adverse
impacts;
         2. Watercraft access ramps, approach roads, and access-related parking
areas may be placed within shore impact zones provided the vegetative screening
and erosion control conditions of this subpart are met;
         3. Private facilities must comply with the grading and filling
provisions of Subd. 8.C. of this section; and
         4. For public roads, driveways and parking areas, documentation must
be provided by a qualified individual that they are designed and constructed to
minimize and control erosion to public waters consistent with the field office
technical guides of the local soil and water conservation district, or other
applicable technical materials.
      B. Stairways, lifts, and landings. Stairways and lifts are the preferred
alternative to major topographic alterations for achieving access up and down
bluffs and steep slopes to shore areas. Stairways, lifts, and landings must
meet the following design requirements:
         1. Stairways and lifts must not exceed four feet in width on
residential lots. Wider stairways may be used for commercial properties, public
recreational uses, and planned unit developments;
         2. Landings for stairways and lifts on residential lots must not
exceed 32 square feet in area. Landings larger than 32 square feet may be used
for commercial properties, public-space recreational uses, and planned unit
developments;
         3. Canopies or roofs are not allowed on stairways, lifts, or landings;
         4. Stairways, lifts, and landings may be either constructed above the
ground on posts or pilings, or placed into the ground, provided they are
designed and built in a manner that ensures control of soil erosion;
         5. Stairways, lifts, and landings must be located in the most visually
inconspicuous portions of lots, as viewed from the surface of the public water
assuming summer, leaf-on conditions, whenever practical; and
         6. Facilities such as ramps, lifts, or mobility paths for physically
handicapped persons are also allowed for achieving access to shore areas, if
they are consistent with the dimensional and performance standards of Subd.
7.B.1. through Subd. 7.B.6. and the requirements of Minnesota Rules, Chapter
1341.
      C. Water-oriented accessory structures or facilities. Each residential
lot may have one water-oriented accessory structure or facility if it complies
with the following provisions:
         1. The structure or facility must not exceed ten feet in height,
exclusive of safety rails, and cannot occupy an area greater than 250 square
feet. The structure or facility may include detached decks not exceeding eight
feet above grade at any point, or at-grade patios;
         2. The structure or facility is not in the bluff impact zone;
         3. The setback of the structure or facility from the ordinary high
water level must be at least ten feet;
         4. The structure is not a boathouse or boat storage structure as
defined under Minnesota Statutes;
         5. The structure or facility must be treated to reduce visibility as
viewed from public waters and adjacent shorelands by vegetation, topography,
increased setbacks or color, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions;
         6. The roof may be used as an open-air deck with safety rails, but
must not be enclosed with a roof or sidewalls or used as a storage area;
         7. The structure or facility must not be designed or used for human
habitation and must not contain water supply or sewage treatment facilities;
         8. As an alternative for general development and recreational
development waterbodies, water-oriented accessory structures used solely for
storage of watercraft and boating-related equipment may occupy an area up to
400 square feet provided the maximum width of the structure is 20 feet as
measured parallel to the shoreline; and
         9. Water-oriented accessory structures may have the low floor placed
lower than the elevation specified in Subd. 6.D.3. if the structure is designed
to accommodate internal flooding, constructed of flood-resistant materials to
the elevation, electrical and mechanical equipment is placed above the
elevation, and if long-duration flooding is anticipated, the structure is built
to withstand ice action and wind-driven waves and debris.
   Subd. 8. Vegetation and land alterations.
      A. Purpose. Alterations of vegetation and topography are regulated to
prevent erosion into public waters, fix nutrients, preserve shoreland
aesthetics, preserve historic values, prevent bank slumping, sustain water
quality, and protect fish and wildlife habitat.
      B. Vegetation management.
         1. Removal or alteration of vegetation must comply with the provisions
of this subsection except for:
            a. Vegetation alteration necessary for the construction of
structures and sewage treatment systems under validly issued permits for these
facilities;
            b. The construction of public roads and parking areas if consistent
with Subd. 7.A. of this section;
            c. Forest management uses consistent with Subd. 5.C. of this
section; and
            d. Agricultural uses consistent with Subd. 5.B. of this section.
         2. Intensive vegetation clearing in the shore and bluff impact zones
and on steep slopes is prohibited. Intensive clearing outside of these areas is
allowed if consistent with the forest management standards in Subd. 5.C. of
this section.
         3. Limited clearing and trimming of trees and shrubs in the shore and
bluff impact zones and on steep slopes, is allowed to provide a view to the
water from the principal dwelling and to accommodate the placement of stairways
and landings, picnic areas, access paths, livestock watering areas, beach and
watercraft access areas, and permitted water-oriented accessory structures or
facilities, provided that:
            a. The screening of structures, vehicles, or other facilities as
viewed from the water, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions, is not
substantially reduced;
            b. Existing shading of water surfaces along rivers is preserved;
            c. Cutting debris or slash shall be scattered and not mounded on
the ground; and
            d. Perennial ground cover is retained.
            e. Picnic areas, access paths, livestock watering areas, beaches
and watercraft access areas are prohibited in bluff impact zones.
         4. Removal of trees, limbs, or branches that are dead, diseased,
dying, or pose safety hazards is allowed without a permit.
         5. Fertilizer and pesticide runoff into surface waters must be
minimized through use of vegetation, topography or both.
      C. Grading and filling.
         1. Grading and filling activities must comply with the provisions of
this subsection except for the construction of public roads and parking areas
if consistent with Subd. 7.A. of this section.
         2. Permit requirements.
            a. Grading, filling and excavations necessary for the construction
of structures, sewage treatment systems, and driveways, if part of an approved
permit, do not require a separate grading and filling permit. However, the
standards in Subd. 8.C.3. of this section must be incorporated into the permit.
            b. For all other work, including driveways not part of another
permit, a grading and filling permit is required for:
               i. The movement of more than ten cubic yards (approximately
5,000 sq. ft.) of material on steep slopes or within shore or bluff impact
zones; and
               ii. The movement of more than 50 cubic yards (approximately
5,000 sq. ft.) of material outside of steep slopes and shore and bluff impact
zones.
         3. Grading, filling and excavation activities must meet the following
standards:
            a. Grading or filling of any wetland must meet or exceed the
wetland protection standards under Minnesota Rules, Chapter 8420 and any other
permits, reviews, or approvals by other local, state, or federal agencies such
as watershed districts, the DNR or US Army Corps of Engineers;
            b. Land alterations must be designed and implemented to minimize
the amount of erosion and sediment from entering surface waters during and
after construction consistently by:
               i. Limiting the amount and time of bare ground exposure;
               ii. Using temporary ground covers such as mulches or similar
materials;
               iii. Establishing permanent, deep-rooted and dense vegetation
cover as soon as possible;
               iv. Using sediment traps, vegetated buffer strips or other
appropriate techniques;
               v. Stabilizing altered areas to acceptable erosion control
standards consistent with the field office technical guides of the soil and
water conservation district;
               vi. Not placing fill or excavated material in a manner that
creates unstable slopes. Plans to place fill or excavated material on steep
slopes must be reviewed by qualified professionals for continued slope
stability and must not create finished slopes of 30% or greater;
               vii. Fill or excavated material must not be placed in bluff
impact zones;
               viii. Any alterations below the ordinary high water level of
public waters must first be authorized by the Commissioner under M.S. Ch. 103G,
as it may be amended from time to time;
               ix. Alterations of topography are only allowed if they are
accessory to permitted or conditional uses and do not adversely affect adjacent
or nearby properties; and
               x. Placement of natural rock riprap, including associated
grading of the shoreline and placement of a filter blanket, is permitted if:
                  A. The finished slope does not exceed three feet horizontal
to one foot vertical;
                  B. The landward extent of the riprap is within ten feet of
the ordinary high water level; and
                  C. The height of the riprap above the ordinary high water
level does not exceed three feet (see Figure 11).

         4. Connections to public waters. Excavations to connect boat slips,
canals, lagoons, and harbors to public waters require a public waters permit
and must comply with Minnesota Rules, Chapter 6115.
      D. Stormwater management.
         1. General standards.
            a. When possible, existing natural drainageways and vegetated soil
surfaces must be used to convey, store, filter, and retain stormwater runoff
before discharge to public waters.
            b. Development must be planned and conducted in a manner that will
minimize the extent of disturbed areas, runoff velocities, erosion potential,
and reduce and delay runoff volumes. Disturbed areas must be stabilized as soon
as possible and appropriate facilities or methods used to retain sediment on
the site.
            c. When development density, topography, soils, and vegetation are
not sufficient to adequately handle stormwater runoff, constructed facilities
such as settling basins, skimming devices, dikes, waterways, ponds and

resources and is safe and functional.
      B. Land suitability. Each lot created through subdivision, including
planned unit developments authorized under Subd. 10. of this section, must be
suitable in its natural state for the proposed use with minimal alteration. A
suitability analysis must be conducted for each proposed subdivision, including
planned unit developments, to determine if the subdivision is suitable in its
natural state for the proposed use with minimal alteration, and whether any
feature of the land is likely to be harmful to the health, safety, or welfare
of future residents of the proposed subdivision or of the community.

the top of the bluff and the lake or stream.
      F. Dedications. When a land or easement dedication is a condition of
subdivision approval, the approval must provide easements over natural drainage
or ponding areas for management of stormwater and significant wetlands.
      G. Platting. All subdivisions that cumulatively create five or more lots
or parcels that are two and one-half acres or less in size shall be processed
as a plat in accordance with M.S. 462.358 Subd. 3a (cities) and M.S. Ch. 505,
as they may be amended from time to time. No permit for construction of
buildings or sewage treatment systems shall be issued for lots created after
the adoption of this ordinance unless the lot was previously approved as part

shoreland areas during and after development and redevelopment of high density
residential and commercial uses.
      B.   Types of PUDs permissible. Planned unit developments (PUDs) are
allowed for new projects on undeveloped land, redevelopment of previously built
sites, or conversions of existing buildings and land. Deviation from the
minimum lot size standards of Subd. 6.B. of this section is allowed if the
standards in this section are met.
      C. Processing of PUDs. Planned unit developments in the Shoreland
District must be processed as a conditional use and comply with the provisions
of this section in addition to those standards outlined elsewhere in the zoning
and subdivision regulations. When there is a conflict in requirements, the more
stringent of the requirements shall be applied. An expansion to an existing
commercial PUD involving six or less new dwelling units or sites since the date
this section was adopted is permissible as a permitted use, provided the total
project density does not exceed the allowable densities calculated in the
project density evaluation procedures in Subd. 10.E. Approval cannot occur
until all applicable environmental reviews are complete.

in accordance with the criteria and analysis specified in Subd. 10.F. of this
section.
         4. A master plan/site plan describing the project and showing floor
plans for all commercial structures.
         5. Additional documents necessary to explain how the PUD will be
designed and will function.
      E. Density determination. Proposed new, or expansions to existing,
planned unit developments must be evaluated using the following procedures.
         1. Step 1. Identify density analysis tiers. Divide the project parcel
into tiers by drawing one or more lines parallel to the ordinary high water
level at the following intervals, proceeding landward:
 
Waterbody Classification                    No Sewer (ft.) Sewer (ft.)
General development lakes - 1st tier        200            200
General development lakes - all other tiers 267            200
Recreational development lakes              267            267
Natural environment lakes                   400            320
All rivers                                  300            300
 
         2. Step 2. Calculate suitable area for development. Calculate the
suitable area within each tier by excluding all wetlands, bluffs, or land below
the ordinary high water level of public waters.
         3. Step 3. Determine base density.
            a. For residential PUDs, divide the suitable area within each tier
by the minimum single residential lot area for lakes to determine the allowable
number of dwelling units, or base density, for each tier. For rivers, if a
minimum lot area is not specified, divide the tier width by the minimum single
residential lot width.
            b. For commercial PUDs:
               i. Determine the average area for each dwelling unit or dwelling
site within each tier. Include both existing and proposed dwelling units and
sites in the calculation.
                  A. For dwelling units, determine the average inside living
floor area of dwelling units in each tier. Do not include decks, patios,
garages, or porches and basements, unless they are habitable space.
                  B. For dwelling sites (campgrounds), determine the area of
each dwelling site as follows:
                     (i)   For manufactured homes, use the area of the
manufactured home, if known, otherwise use 1,000 square feet.
                     (ii)   For recreational vehicles, campers or tents, use
400 square feet.
               ii. Select the appropriate floor area/dwelling site area ratio
from the following table for the floor area or dwelling site area determined in
Subd. 10.E.3.b.i.

               iii. Multiply the suitable area within each tier determined in
Subd. 10.E.3.b.i. by the floor area or dwelling site area ratio to yield the
total floor area or dwelling site area for each tier to be used for dwelling
units or dwelling sites.
               iv. Divide the total floor area or dwelling site area for each
tier calculated in Subd. 10.E.3.b.i. by the average inside living floor area
for dwelling units or dwelling site area determined in Subd. 10.E.3.b.iii. This
yields the allowable number of dwelling units or dwelling sites, or base
density, for each tier.
            c. Allowable densities may be transferred from any tier to any
other tier further from the waterbody, but must not be transferred to any tier
closer to the waterbody.
            d. All PUDs with densities at or below the base density must meet
the design standards in Subd. 10.F.
         4. Step 4. Determine if the site can accommodate increased density.

         9. Location of utility services and easements.
      C. Mitigation.
         1. In any development that the tree/woodland allowable removal limits
are exceeded, the applicant shall mitigate the tree loss by either
reforestation of (tree replacement) appropriate areas within the development
area in accordance with the tree replacement schedule, or payment to the city
of the sum per diameter inch calculated from the total amount of diameter
inches of the required replacement trees in accordance with the tree
replacement schedule. The fee per diameter inch shall be set forth in the city
fee schedule and the payment thereon shall be deposited into an account
designated specifically for tree mitigation.
         2. The form of mitigation to be provided by the applicant shall be
determined by the city.
         3. The planting of trees for mitigation shall be in addition to any
other landscape requirements of the city.
         4. Significant tree replacement will be calculated by replacing the
largest diameter tree first, proceeding down to the smallest diameter
significant tree.
      D. Required protective measures. The tree preservation plan shall
identify and require the following measures to be utilized to protect
significant trees, specimen trees and significant woodlands:
         1. Installation of snow fencing or polyethylene laminate safety
netting or silt fencing placed at the drip line or at the perimeter of the
critical root zone (CRZ), whichever is greater, of significant trees, specimen
trees and significant woodlands to be preserved. No grade change, construction
activity or storage of materials shall occur within this fenced area.
         2. Identification of any oak trees requiring pruning between April 15
and July 1. Any oak trees so pruned shall be required to have any cut areas
sealed with an appropriate non-toxic tree wound sealant.
         3. Prevention of change in soil chemistry due to concrete washout and
leakage or spillage of toxic materials, such as fuels or paints.
      E. Additional protective measures. The following tree protection measures
are suggested to protect significant trees, specimen trees and significant
woodlands that are intended to be preserved according to the submitted tree
preservation plan and may be required by the city:
         1. Installation of retaining walls or tree wells to preserve trees.
         2. Placement of utilities in common trenches outside of the drip line
of significant trees or use of tunneled installation.
         3. Use of tree root aeration, fertilization and/or irrigation systems.
         4. Transplanting of significant trees into a protected area for later
moving into permanent sites within the construction area.
         5. Therapeutic pruning.
      F. Review process. The tree preservation plan shall be reviewed by the
city to assess the best possible layout to preserve significant trees, specimen
trees and significant woodlands and to enhance the efforts to minimize damage
to specimen trees, significant trees and significant woodlands. The applicant
shall meet with city staff prior to submission of the development application
or prior to application for the grading permit, whichever is sooner, to
determine the most feasible and practical placement of buildings, parking,
driveways, streets, storage and other physical features, in order that the
fewest significant trees, specimen trees and significant woodlands are
destroyed or damaged.
      G. Performance guarantee.
         1. Any applicant of a new development shall provide the required
performance guarantee following preliminary approval of the tree preservation
plan and prior to any construction and/or grading. The amount of the
performance guarantee to be submitted, specific to the tree preservation
fulfillments, shall be calculated as follows:
            a. Unless the applicant provides tree mitigation in the form of
cash dedication, 100% of the cost of completing tree replacement mitigation as
determined by the city.
            b. An amount to guarantee preservation of all trees identified by
the approved tree preservation plan to be preserved within 15 feet of the
construction zone (measured from the construction limit to the nearest side of
the tree). The amount shall be calculated by multiplying the total diameter
inches of significant trees and specimen trees to be preserved within this 15-
foot zone by the rate of payment of $25 per diameter inch and the total square
feet of significant woodlands to be preserved within the 15-foot zone by the
rate of $1.20 per square foot.
         2. No performance guarantee shall be required for applicants of
building permits of single- family residential units.
         3. Following written request by the applicant for acceptance, the
performance guarantee will be released upon verification by the city that the
tree preservation plan was followed and that the tree replacement schedule was
complied with, where necessary, but in no event shall the performance guarantee
be released earlier than one year after the date of the project closure.
      H. Removal of diseased trees required. Prior to any grading, all
diseased, hazard and nuisance trees on the subject property shall be identified
by the Park Department in accordance with the tree disease control and
prevention regulations of the City Code. Any and all diseased and nuisance
trees so identified shall be removed from the property, at the time of grading,
if so directed.
      I. Compliance with plan.
         1. The applicant shall implement the tree preservation plan prior to
and during any construction. The tree protection measures shall remain in place
until all grading and construction activity is terminated or until a request is
made to and approved by the city.
         2. No significant trees, specimen trees or significant woodlands shall
be removed until a tree preservation plan is approved and except in accordance
with the approve tree preservation plan as approved by the city. If a
significant tree(s), specimen tree(s) or any significant woodland(s) that is
intended to be preserved is removed without permission of the City Park
Department or damaged so that it is in a state of decline within one year from
date of project closure, a cash mitigation, calculated per diameter inch of the
removed/destroyed tree or per total square foot of significant woodlands, in
the amount set forth in the city fee schedule, shall be remitted to the city.
         3. The city shall have the right to inspect the development and/or
building site in order to determine compliance with the approved tree
preservation plan. The city shall determine whether compliance with the tree
preservation plan has been met.
   Subd. 8. Allowable tree removal.
      A. Tree removal allowance. Specimen tree, significant tree and
significant woodland removal shall be in accordance with the city-approved tree
preservation plan and in no case shall the amount of removal exceed the
following percentages:
         1. Single-lot development.
            a. Single-unit residential: 20%.
            b. Commercial and multi-unit residential: 30%.

§ 11.047 TRANSPORTATION INTERCONNECTIVITY.
   All development shall provide for a connecting segment of road, sidewalk
and/or trail on the development property to the adjacent property line where
such transportation routes have been identified within any plan or policy
adopted by the city.
(Ord. 699, passed 1-18-22)
§ 11.048 MAJOR TRAFFIC GENERATORS AND TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDIES.
   Subd. 1. Major traffic generators. Any applicant or proposer of a
development project (construction projects of buildings, structures, streets or
other infrastructure) which meets the definition of major traffic generator
shall provide a traffic impact study (TIS) that includes information necessary
to allow the city to assess:
      A. The transportation implications of traffic associated with a proposed
development;
      B. The existing and future capacity and condition of the affected street
system; and
      C. The growth of the transportation system may occur in a manner that is
comprehensive in nature and supportive of the public good.
   Subd. 2. Traffic impact studies.
      A. A TIS prepared consistent with the provisions of this chapter will be
required. All roads and intersections serving a proposed use must be determined
to be capable of handling the future projected traffic generated by the use. No
application for a development identified as requiring a TIS will be deemed
complete unless it is accompanied by a TIS. All projects requiring a TIS will
require a conditional use permit no matter the zoning district in which the
project is located.
      B. A traffic impact study shall identify:
         1. What improvements, if any, are needed to:
            a. Ensure safe ingress to and egress from a site;
            b. Maintain adequate street capacity and appropriate level of
service on public streets serving the development;
            c. Ensure safe and reasonable traffic operating conditions on
streets and at intersections along the proposed route; avoid creation of or
mitigate existing hazardous traffic conditions;
            d. Minimize the impact of non-residential traffic on residential
uses along the route; and
            e. Safeguard the public investment in the existing street system.
         2. The road system investments to the city, county and state road
systems necessary to serve anticipated development.
      C. Traffic impact studies shall include the following information:
         1. An analysis of current and future traffic operations and
intersection improvement needs at all site access points in the affected
transportation routes. This operational evaluation shall include on-site
circulation as it may affect access, on-site and off-site turn lanes and
required vehicle storage, the potential need for signalization or other traffic
control, and review of sight distance, vehicle turning movements and other
intersection safety aspects. The proposed access plan should be consistent with
the standards of the city's transportation plan (contained in the adopted
comprehensive plan or as amended) and with county or state requirements for
access management;
         2. An analysis of the impact of site-generated traffic on the level of
service of affected intersections and public streets along the proposed route.
Affected road segments or intersections are where the additional traffic volume
created by the proposed development is greater than 10% of the current traffic
volume (for road segments) or the current entering volume (for intersections).
Examples of possible effects include, but are not limited to, pedestrian and
bicyclist safety hazards, traffic noise or turning movement's conflicts with
other driveways or intersecting roads;
         3. For developments expected to generate more than 60 heavy vehicle
trips per day, an analysis of the intersections and road segments these trucks
would use to enter and exit the city limits is required. Issues of concern
include structural capacity, impacts of slow moving vehicles on roadway safety
and the need for intersection operation improvements to accommodate truck
traffic;
         4. An analysis of the impact of the proposed development on
residential uses (where the abutting land use is predominately residential)
along the proposed route to identify any potential adverse effects of the
proposed development and mitigation measures to address any impacts. Examples
of possible effects include, but are not limited to: non-residential traffic
impacts on residential neighborhoods; pedestrian and bicyclist safety hazards;
traffic noise; or turning movement conflicts with other driveways or
intersecting roads;
         5. A detailed list of the transportation infrastructure improvements
needed to mitigate the impact of the development and estimated costs of these
improvements; and
         6. An explanation of how improvements that are identified to mitigate
the traffic impact of the development meet commonly accepted engineering design
standards and access management criteria.
      D. The TIS shall be led by a traffic or transportation engineer, or other
qualified professional with experience in the preparation of the analysis. The
city shall have the final approval of the selection of the professional or
shall employ other professionals (such as the City Engineer) to review the TIS
on the city's behalf. The applicant shall be responsible for the costs of
preparation of the TIS and of the City Engineer's review.
      E. The standards for traffic service that shall be used to evaluate the
findings of traffic impact studies are:
         1. Level of service.
            a. The level of service standard for all highway corridor
operations (including freeway mainline, merging areas and ramp junctions, and
arterial and collector intersections or corridors) should meet the level of
service standards listed in the table below. Level of service should be
calculated using the Transportation Research Board's Highway Capacity Manual.
Where the existing level of service is below these standards, a TIS shall
identify those improvements needed to maintain the existing level of service
and what additional improvements would be needed to raise the level of service
to the standards indicated; and
            b. The Highway Capacity Manual estimates the quality of traffic
flow in letter grades, referred to as levels of service. A and B represent
uncongested conditions, C and D are approaching congestion and E and F are very
congested.

         2. Number of access points. The number of access points shall be the
minimum needed to provide adequate access capacity for the site. The spacing of
access points shall be consistent with the road authority's access management
requirements. If the road authority has not adopted access management
requirements, then there shall be spacing of 300 feet between access points, or
the maximum available distance if there is less than 300 feet between an access
point and the nearest adjoining intersection or driveway on an adjacent parcel;
         3. Residential street impact. Without mitigative measures, non-
residential development shall contribute no more than 20% of the traffic on any
local street for which residentially zoned property makes up more than 50% of
the street frontage;
         4. Vehicle storage.  The capacity of storage bays and auxiliary lanes
for turning traffic shall be adequate to ensure turning traffic will not
interfere with through traffic flows on any public street;
         5. Internal circulation. On-site vehicle circulation and parking
patterns shall be designed so as not to interfere with the flow of traffic on
any public street and shall accommodate all anticipated types of site traffic;
and
         6. Safety.  Access points shall be located and designed to provide for
adequate intersection and stopping sight distance and appropriate facilities to
accommodate acceleration and deceleration of site traffic. The geometric design
of access points shall meet the standards of the access management requirements
of the road authority connecting to the proposed development site.
      F. The city shall require either the applicant or the owner or user of
the property on which the project is proposed to post a security in such form
and sum as determined by the City Engineer. The amount of the security shall be
sufficient to cover the city's extraordinary cost and expense of repairing,
from time to time, any highways, streets or other public ways where such repair
work is made necessary by the special burden resulting from hauling and travel
for the proposed project. The amount of the security shall also be sufficient
to ensure compliance with all requirements of this chapter, and the particular
permit, and to pay the expense the city may incur as a result of the permit.
      G. Waivers.
         1. The requirement for a transportation impact study may be waived by
the city after consulting with road authority representatives with roads
comprising any designated haul routes (the county's Highway Engineer for
affected county roads in the county, the City Engineer for any affected city
roads, the District Engineer of MnDOT for federal highways, or the County
Engineer for county roads) if it is determined that:
            a. A transportation impact study is not necessary to determine
needed road improvements on roadway access points or portions of haul routes
under their jurisdiction, and that for roadways and the intersections along
haul routes under their jurisdiction, no unsafe or hazardous conditions will be
created by the development as proposed;
            b. The applicant has provided performance bonds or other guarantees
providing adequate assurance that anticipated damage to roads can be mitigated
and/or that unsafe conditions can be mitigated or avoided; and
            c. The use is seasonal or short-term, less than three months in
total, with peak daily trip generation that exceeds the major traffic
generators thresholds, but whose annual average trip generation does not pose a
risk to the road infrastructure or traffic safety of the facility and adjacent
road network based on evaluation of the cumulative pavement impact expected and
geometric design of the roadway.
         2. This waiver shall not preempt the authority of the state's
Department of Transportation to require a traffic study on any state or federal
highway, nor the authority of any affected jurisdiction to require a traffic
study under an applicable ordinance. A waiver will not be granted to haul any
product that is deemed hazardous or a potential threat to the health of the
public.
         3. Applications for major traffic generator waiver shall be made to
the Zoning Administrator or designee on forms provided by his or her office.
Only one waiver will be granted per 12-month period per site. Completed
applications shall be forwarded to the City Engineer for review and then to the
Street Commission for consideration at an upcoming meeting. The application
must include:
            a. A detailed description and map of the proposed haul route;
            b. Number of daily and total trips requested;
            c. Haul days and hours; and
            d. Any other data that the City Engineer might request to make a
determination on the waiver application.

§ 11.052 SOLAR STRUCTURES AND SOLAR GARDENS/FARMS.
   Subd. 1. Purpose.  In order to accommodate the renewable energy needs of
residents and businesses and enhance the sustainability of local energy
production and consumption, while protecting the public health, safety and
general welfare of the community, the city finds that these regulations are
necessary in order to:
      A. Allow property owners the opportunity to capture their on-site solar
energy resource;
      B. Allow small-scale solar distributed generation that can provide
support to the local electric grid;
      C. Enhance the economic use of local resources and foster the development
of solar energy businesses in the city;
      D. Minimize adverse visual effects of solar energy installations through
careful design and siting standards; and
      E. Encourage distributed generation that fully integrates into the
municipal electric utility to protect the utility's distribution system,
protection and control schemes, and maintain existing levels of safety and
reliability to customers.
   Subd. 2. Permitted accessory use. Solar energy systems are allowed as an
accessory use in all zoning classifications where structures of any sort are
allowed, subject to certain requirements as set forth below.
      A. Height. Solar energy systems must meet the following height
requirements:
         1. Building- or roof-mounted solar energy systems shall not exceed the
maximum allowed height in any zoning district, except that for solar
installations on flat roofs or roofs with minimal slope (under 10%) solar
installations shall be exempt from height limitations consistent with §
11.042 Subd. 5.A.2. of this chapter. Regardless of height limitations, solar
energy systems shall not extend more than three feet above the peak of a
pitched roof, and shall not extend more than ten feet above the roof surface of
flat roofs or roofs with minimal slope (under 10%).
         2. Ground- or pole-mounted solar energy systems shall not exceed 20
feet in height when oriented at maximum tilt.
      B. Setback. Solar energy systems are required to meet set-back standard
for the district in which the systems are located, except as provided below:
         1. Solar energy systems mounted on the primary building or garage are
allowed to extend into a required side or rear yard consistent with §
11.041 Subd. 5.B. Measurements of encroachment are made from the edge of the
collector or the collector support system, whichever extends nearest to the
adjacent property line.
         2. For roof-mounted solar energy systems the collector surface and
mounting devices shall not extend beyond the exterior perimeter of the
building's roof, except as such extensions are building-integrated systems,
designed to serve as an awning or canopy. Exterior piping for solar hot water
systems or electrical conduit or other electric component shall be allowed to
extend beyond the perimeter of the building on a side or rear yard exposure.
         3. Ground-mounted solar energy systems may be located within the rear
or side yard areas, but in no case will they be less than five feet from any
property line when oriented at minimum design tilt. Solar energy systems shall
not be permitted in the required front yard or easement areas.
         4. Clearance to electric lines. Electric lines passing over the
collector must have a minimum clearance of ten feet, or most recent standard in
the National Electric Safety Code.
      C. Coverage. Ground-mounted solar energy systems are subject to accessory
use coverage limitations of §
11.031 Subd. 1, except that solar energy installations shall not count toward
the maximum number of accessory structures and are not required to have
exterior finishes similar to the primary structure. Coverage shall be
calculated as the square footage of ground under the system when at the solar
energy system's minimum design tilt.
      D. Visibility. Building or roof-mounted solar energy systems shall be
designed to blend into the architecture of the building, as viewed from the
front public right-of-way. Solar energy systems that meet the following design
standards shall be in compliance with the visibility requirements:
         1. On pitched roofs located in residential districts, the solar
collectors shall not extend above the peak of the roof.
         2. On pitched roofs on a corner lot, roof-mounted systems shall be
flush-mounted.
         3. The solar collector shall not extend beyond the edge of the
finished roof.
         4. Building-integrated solar energy systems meet the visibility
standard.
         5. Solar energy systems not meeting the above design standards shall
require a conditional use permit.
      E. Approved solar components. Electric solar energy system components
must have a UL listing and solar hot water systems must have an SRCC rating.
      F. Compliance with state codes. All active solar energy systems shall
meet approval of the relevant code officials, consistent with the most
currently adopted State of Minnesota Building Code, National Electric Code,
National Electric Safety Code and Plumbing Code.
   Subd. 3. Restrictions on solar energy systems limited. No homeowners'
agreement, covenant, common interest community standard, or other contract
between multiple property owners, created as of May 31, 2013, shall prohibit
property owners from installing solar energy systems for the capture of direct
sunlight. Design review conducted by a common interest community as applied to
proposed solar energy installations within the CIC may reasonably require
mitigation of visual impacts but may not preclude solar development within the
CIC.

   Subd. 4. The following standards shall apply in the calculation of spaces
required for off-street parking (in all districts).
      A. When calculation of the number of required off-street parking spaces
results in a fraction, the fraction shall be rounded up to the next highest
number.
      B. When the number of off-street parking spaces is based on the maximum
number of persons or patrons, this shall be defined by Building or Fire Code
requirements.
      C. When the number of off-street parking spaces is based on the number of
employees, this shall be defined by the number of employees at the facility
during the largest shift regardless of full-time status.
      D. In cases where future potential uses of a building or development site
will generate additional parking demand, the city may require a proof of
parking plan for the difference between minimum parking requirements and the
anticipated future demand.
      E. The Planning Commission may consider reducing the number of spaces
required for passenger vehicles owned by the business if evidence is provided
that adequate storage is being provided off-site.
   Subd. 5. The parking requirement for uses not listed in this section may be
established by the city based on the characteristics of the use and available
information on parking demand for such use.
   Subd. 6. The Planning Commission shall consider varying the amount, location
and design requirements for parking in PUDs if a finding is made that changing
standards provides adequate parking for the proposed development and better
meets the goals of this chapter.
(Ord. 699, passed 1-18-22)
SUBDIVISION STANDARDS
§ 11.065 PURPOSE.
   Subd. 1. Land subdivision is the first step in the process of community
development. Once land has been divided into streets, blocks, lots and open
spaces, a pattern has been established which determines how well community
needs for residence, business and industry will be met. It also determines to a
great extent how well the community will be able to handle its traffic
circulation problems, how well it will be able to meet the demand for home
sites and how efficiently and economically it will be able to provide the many
services that are required.
   Subd. 2. After land has been subdivided and publicly recorded, it is very
difficult and costly to correct defects and deficiencies in the subdivision
layout and in the facilities provided. In addition, a subdivided area sooner or
later becomes a public responsibility. The roads and streets must be maintained
and various public services customary to urban areas must be provided. The
welfare of the entire community is affected in many important respects. The
guidance of land development through subdivision regulations is therefore a
matter of public concern. It is in the interest of the public, the developer
and future owners that subdivisions be conceived and designed and developed in
accordance with sound rules and proper minimum standards.
   Subd. 3. These subdivision regulations are designed to provide for
harmonious development of the subdivided area; for coordinated layout; for the
proper arrangement of streets; for adequate and convenient spaces for traffic,
utilities, recreation, light, air and access for fire fighting equipment and
for adequate provision of water, drainage, sewer and other sanitary facilities.
These regulations shall not apply to land used only for agricultural purposes.
   Subd. 4. Legal authority. This chapter is enacted under the authority of
M.S. § 462.358, as amended.
   Subd. 5. Jurisdictional limits. The regulations governing plats and
subdivision of land established by this chapter shall apply within the
corporate limits of the City of Austin and to the unincorporated area within
two miles of its limits, provided that where a municipality lies less than four
miles from the limits of the city, this chapter shall apply only to a line
equidistant from the city and the municipality, provided that the governing
bodies of unincorporated towns adjacent to the city have not adopted ordinances
for the regulation of subdivision of land or platting. A copy of the resolution
approving subdivision plats of land outside the city but not subject to
township subdivision regulations shall be filed with the clerk of the town in
which the land is situated.
   Subd. 6. Recording. It is unlawful for any person, being the owner or agent,
having control of any land within the incorporated area of the city to
subdivide or lay out the land in lots unless by plat in accordance with the
regulations contained herein. No plat shall be recorded with the County
Recorder and no lot shall be sold from the plat unless approved, as herein
required.
(Ord. 699, passed 1-18-22)
§ 11.066 MINIMUM IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED.
   Subd. 1. No final plat of any subdivision shall be approved unless the
subdivider shall comply with the following general principles and requirements.
All of the improvements required in this chapter shall be constructed only
after the plans and specifications thereof have been approved by the
appropriate public official.
   Subd. 2. General. The general purpose of a good subdivision and site design
is to create a functional and attractive development, to minimize adverse
impacts and maintenance costs, and to ensure that a project will be an asset to
a community. To promote this purpose, the subdivision or site plan shall
conform to the following standards which are designed to result in a well-
planned community without adding unnecessarily to development costs. The
minimum requirements assure that the layout of the subdivision harmonizes with
existing plans affecting the development and its surroundings and are in
conformity with the city's development objectives for the entire area. Detailed
specifications for the minimum design standards, the engineering standards and
adopted comprehensive plan may be obtained from the appropriate department
(Engineering, Utilities, Planning or Fire Departments).
   Subd. 3. Thoroughfare plan. Whenever a tract to be subdivided embraces any
part of an arterial or collector street or highway, so designated on the
thoroughfare plan, the part shall be platted by the subdivider in the location
and at the width indicated on the plan.
   Subd. 4. Public facilities plan. Where a proposed park, playground or other
recreational area, proposed school site or other public ground, under the
adopted comprehensive plan of the city, is located in whole or in part within
the proposed subdivision, the proposed public ground or part, if not dedicated
to the city, shall be reserved for a period of not less than two years from the
date of final approval of the final plat by the Council for acquisition by
purchase or otherwise.
   Subd. 5. Park dedication. At the time of filing a tentative subdivision map
for approval, the subdivider of the property shall, as part of the filing,
indicate whether he or she desires to dedicate property for park or recreation
purposes, or whether he or she desires to pay a fee in lieu thereof or a
combination of dedication and in-lieu fees. If he or she desires to dedicate
land for this purpose, he or she shall designate the area thereof on the
tentative subdivision map as submitted.
      A. Action of the city. At the time of tentative map approval by the
Council, after consultation with the Director of Parks and Recreation, the
Council shall determine, as a part of the approval, whether to require a
dedication of land within the subdivision, payment of a fee in lieu thereof, or
a combination of both. In making this determination, the Council shall include
in its consideration the following factors:
         1. The topography, soils, access and location of land in the
subdivision available for dedication;
         2. The size and shape of the subdivision and land available for
dedication;
         3. How much land consisting of school playgrounds is available for
combination with dedicated lands in the formation of local park and recreation
facilities; and
         4. The open space or local recreation facilities to be privately owned
and maintained by future residents of the subdivision.
      B. Prerequisite for approval of final plat and payment of fees. When land
is to be dedicated, it shall be offered for the dedication in substantially the
same manner as for streets and easements. When a fee is required, it shall be
deposited with the city prior to approval of the final subdivision map. The
land and fees shall be held in trust by the city and administered by the Parks
and Recreation Department until the Council delegates responsibility to a
special district or association.
      C. Amount of land to be dedicated in lieu of fees. Local park or
recreational facilities shall be provided for the subdivision through the
dedication of lands or the payment of fees in lieu thereof or both under the
following conditions and in accord with the following requirements:
         1. In subdivisions having 50 lots or more, the subdivider or owner
shall dedicate land for local parks acceptable to the Council (or pay in-lieu
fees) according to the following formulas in which:
            a. D1 = number of dwelling units in a single-family area.
            b. Dm = number of dwelling units in a multiple-family area.
            c. A1 = amount of land required for dedication in acres in the
single-family area.
            d. Am = amount of land required for dedication in acres in the
multiple-family area.
               i. Single-family areas formula: D1 x .008 = A1
               ii. Multiple-family areas formula: Dm x .008 = Am
            e. The factor .008 is the constant determined from an analysis of
population trends and studies of the city which when multiplied by the number
of dwelling units permitted in the subject area will produce the gross acreage
determined by the Council to be the minimum for local parks or recreational
purposes to be dedicated.
         2. In a subdivision having less than 50 lots or where the subdivision
has 50 lots or more, but the land for local parks or recreational purposes
cannot be located within the subdivision or where other more suitable land is
available as determined by the Council upon advice of the Director of Parks and
Recreation, the subdivider or owner shall pay to the city for use in supplying
local park or recreational facilities within the one mile of all lots in the
subdivision, a sum calculated pursuant to the following formula in which:
            a. A = amount of land in acres that would be required with the
application of the formulas.
            b. V = full cash value for acre of the property to be subdivided as
determined by the most recent estimated market value.
            c. M = number of dollars to be paid as the in-lieu fee.
         3. In-lieu fee formula: A x V = M
      D. Dedication of land in subdivision of less than 50 lots. Nothing in
this chapter shall prohibit the dedication of land for park and recreational
purposes for residential subdivision of less than 50 lots, provided the
subdividers and the Council determine that dedication of land is desirable and
the land meets the tests prescribed in Subd. 5.A. above.
      E. Credit for open spaces. The Council, after recommendation by the
Planning Commission, may grant credit for open space or local recreational
facilities to be privately owned and maintained by the future residents of the
subdivision. The credit, if granted in acres (or comparable amounts in in-lieu
fees), shall be subtracted from the requirements for dedication or fees or both
required under Subd. 5.B. above provided:
         1. Yards, court areas, setback and other open areas required to be
maintained by other regulations shall not be included in the private open space
and recreation credit.
         2. Provision by written agreement is made that the areas shall be
maintained adequately.
         3. Use of the private open space or recreation facilities is
restricted for park and recreational purposes by recorded covenants which run
with the land in favor of the future owners of the property within the tract,
and which cannot be defeated or eliminated without the consent of the Council.
Covenants for private park or recreational facilities which are claimed for
credit shall be submitted to the city prior to approval of the final
subdivision map, and shall be recorded contemporaneously with the final
subdivision map. Land which may be considered by the Council for credit toward
required land dedication for local parks or recreation facilities or in-lieu
fees includes, but is not to be limited to the following:
            a. Areas of scenic or natural beauty;
            b. Historic sites;
            c. Existing or planned hiking, riding or motorless-type bicycle
trails, including pedestrian walkways separated from public roads;
            d. Existing or planned planting strips;
            e. Landscaped portions of road parkways which are in excess of
required road right-of-way widths for the road in question;
            f. Lakesides or river beaches;

City Engineer. Contracts for the above may be let by the Council or subdivider.
Engineering and installation of water, natural gas and electricity, whether by
utility crews or contractors, will be arranged for and be under the direction
of the Austin Utilities. If requested to do so by the Austin Utilities, the

(Ord. 699, passed 1-18-22)
§ 11.086 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   Subd. 1. Zoning Administrator to enforce. The Zoning Administrator shall
enforce this chapter and shall perform the following duties:
      A. Oversee issuance of building permits and make and maintain records
thereof.
      B. Oversee inspections and use of land to determine compliance with the
terms of this chapter.
      C. Maintain permanent and current records of this chapter, including, but
not limited to all:
         1. Maps;
         2. Amendments;
         3. Conditional uses;
         4. Interim uses;
         5. Variances;
         6. Planned unit developments;
         7. Subdivision plats;
         8. Minor subdivisions;
         9. Permits;
         10. Appeals; and
         11. Applications therefor.
      D. Receive, file and forward all applications to the designated official
bodies.
      E. Review proposed development to ensure that all necessary permits have
been received from those governmental agencies from which approval is required
by federal or state law.
   Subd. 2. Nonconformities and preexisting lots, structures, and uses.
      A. Purpose.  It is the purpose of this section to provide for the
regulation of nonconforming buildings, structures and uses and to specify those
requirements, circumstances and conditions under which nonconforming buildings,
structures and uses will be operated and maintained. It is necessary and
consistent with the establishment of zoning districts that nonconforming
buildings, structures and uses not be permitted to continue without
restriction. Furthermore, it is the intent of this section that all
nonconforming uses shall eventually brought into conformity.
      B. No lot shall be so reduced that the dimensions and yard requirements
imposed by this chapter cannot be met unless the reduction converts a non-
conforming use or structure into a conforming use or structure. No part of the
yard or open space required for a given building shall be included as part of
the yard or open space required for another building.
      C. Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this
division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except
where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
         1. EXPAND OR EXPANSION. Any increase in a dimension, size, area,
volume or height; any increase in the area of use; any placement of a structure
or part thereof where none existed before; any addition to a site feature such
as a deck, patio, fence, driveway, parking area, or swimming pool; any
improvement that would allow the land to be more intensely developed; any move
of operations to a new location on the property; any increase in intensity of
use based on a review of the original nature, function or purpose of the
nonconforming use; increase in the hours of operation, traffic, parking, noise,
exterior storage, signs, exterior lighting, types of operations, types of goods
or services offered, odors, area of operation, number of employees or such
other factors deemed relevant by the city.
         2. IMPROVEMENT. Making the nonconforming use better, more efficient,
or aesthetically pleasing, including any change that does not replicate what
pre-existed. A mere expansion, enlargement or intensification of a
nonconforming use does not constitute an improvement for that reason alone.
         3. NONCONFORMING LAND USE. An activity using land, a building or
structure, or a combination thereof, for a purpose that was lawful when
established and which is not permitted by the provisions of existing land use
regulations.
         4. NONCONFORMING STRUCTURE. A structure that was constructed in
compliance with the land use regulations in effect at that time with respect to
certain standards such as location, height, setback or size, but no longer
complies in that regard with existing land use regulations.
         5. REPLACEMENT, RECONSTRUCTION OR RESTORATION. The repair of a
building or structure that duplicates the condition of the building prior that
existed prior to the construction activity or to allow for ingress/egress as
required by the Building Code.
      D. General principles.
         1. A nonconforming use or structure may be used and continued by means
of repair, replacement, restoration, maintenance or improvement that does not
constitute an expansion.
         2. A nonconforming land use or nonconforming structure may not be
expanded except for the purpose of making it a permitted use or structure; or,
as otherwise may be permitted by the provisions of this section.
         3. A nonconforming use land use may be extended throughout the
building or structure, provided no structural alterations or changes are made
therein. If a structural alteration or change is required by law, is needed to
promote safety, or is otherwise necessary to secure or ensure the continued
advantageous use of the building during its natural life, such structural
alteration is permitted.
         4. A nonconforming land use may not be resumed if the use has been
discontinued for a period of 12 consecutive months; or if the use requires the
existence of a nonconforming structure that has been removed and not replaced
for a period of 12 consecutive months.
         5. Removal or destruction of a nonconforming structure to the extent
of more than 50% of its estimated market value at the time of its removal or
damage by fire or other peril terminates the right to replace or repair such
nonconforming structure, unless a building permit application to do so is
submitted to the city for approval within 180 days of the date of the removal
or damage.
         6. An expansion may be made to a structure used as a residence that
constitutes a nonconforming land use when such expansion improves the
livability and safety of the structure, and does not increase the number of
dwelling units contained within the structure. Construction and alteration of a
garage or accessory building is also permitted if the construction or
alteration otherwise complies with the building standards applicable to the
underlying zoning district, and the use of the building is consistent with the
nonconforming land use in question.
         7. If a nonconforming land use is superseded or replaced by a
permitted use, the nonconforming status of the premises and any right which may
arise under the provisions of this section terminate.
         8. Except as otherwise provided, the use and height of buildings
hereafter erected, converted, moved, enlarged or structurally altered, and use
of any land shall be in compliance with the regulations established herein for
the district in which the buildings or lands are located.
      E. Pre-existing lots of record. A single-family detached dwelling may be
erected on any lot, irrespective of its area or width, of record prior to the
effective date of ordinance from which this chapter is derived, provided that:
         1. Such residential construction was permitted on that lot under city
zoning and land use ordinances which predated this chapter; and
         2. Such construction complies with the applicable yard size open
space, and other requirements of such previous ordinances.
   Subd. 3. Fees and expenses. Costs, charges, fees or other eligible expenses
incurred under the administration of this chapter shall be paid in full as a
condition of approval thereof.
   Subd. 4. Permits.
      A. Application.
         1. Except as hereinafter provided, no person shall construct, erect,
alter, wreck, or move any building or structure or part thereof within the
corporate city limits without first securing a building permit from the city.
The application for a permit shall apply as set forth in the State Building
Code.
         2. The application for a building permit shall be made on forms to be
furnished by the city. Each application for a permit to construct or alter a
building shall be accompanied by a plan, drawn to scale, showing the dimensions
of the lot to be built upon and the size and location of the building and
accessory buildings to be erected. Applications for any kind of building permit
shall contain such other information as may be deemed necessary for the proper
enforcement of this chapter or any other ordinance of the city.
      B. Issuance. The Zoning Administrator shall issue the building permit
only after determining that the building plans together with the application
comply with the terms of this chapter. A building permit shall be valid for 180
days after the date of issuance, and shall expire if the construction is not
commenced within that period.
   Subd. 5. Decisions on case-by-case basis. All requests for variances,
conditional use permits, and interim use permits shall be decided solely on the
individual situation. No action on any such matter shall be used or cited in
consideration of another such application or case, nor shall such action be
considered as setting precedent or changing the terms of this chapter.

(Ord. 699, passed 1-18-22)
§ 11.088 CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT CRITERIA.
   Subd. 1.  Criteria.  In granting a conditional use permit, the Planning
Commission shall consider the advice and recommendations of the Planning and
Zoning Administrator and the effect of the proposed use on the comprehensive
plan and upon the health, safety, and general welfare of occupants of
surrounding lands. Among other things, the City Council shall make the
following findings, where applicable:
      A. The use will not create an excessive burden on existing parks,
schools, streets and other public facilities which serve or are proposed to
serve the area.
      B. The use will be sufficiently compatible or separated by distance or
screening from adjacent residentially zoned or used land so that existing homes
will not be depreciated in value and there will be no deterrence to development
of vacant land.
      C. The structure and site shall have an appearance that will not have an
adverse effect upon adjacent residential properties.
      D. The use is reasonably related to the overall city needs and to the
existing land use.
      E. The use is consistent with the purposes of this chapter and the
purposes of the zoning district in which the applicant intends to locate the
proposed use.
      F. The use is not in conflict with the city's comprehensive plan.
      G. The use will not cause any traffic hazard or congestion.
      H. Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and other necessary
facilities have been or will be provided.
   Subd. 2. Interim use permits. Interim use permits may be approved for any
use in any zoning district consistent with the requirements of this Subd. 2.
However, approval of such interim use permit shall at all times be fully
optional, allowing for the issuance of the permit either with or without
conditions, or denial of the permit on any grounds. Any interim use permit may
be terminated by a change in this chapter resulting in the disallowance of such
use, whether by interim use permit or otherwise.
      A. Purpose. The purpose and intent of allowing interim uses is:
         1.   To allow a use for a brief period of time until a permanent
location is obtained or while the permanent location is under construction.
         2.   To allow a use that is presently judged acceptable by the city,
but that, with anticipated development or redevelopment, will not be acceptable
in the future.
         3.   To allow a use that otherwise may not be allowed under the zoning
regulations but because of its temporary nature may be acceptable.
      B. Application, public hearing, notice and procedure. The application,
public hearing, public notice and procedure requirements for interim use
permits shall be the same as those for conditional use permits as provided in
Section 11.088, Subd. 1, with the exception that the Planning Commission shall
make a recommendation to City Council for final determination. In addition to
the general planning and zoning application requirements, applications for
interim use permits shall include:
         1. A signed statement agreeing:
            a. That the applicant, owner, operator, tenant and/or user has no
entitlement to future re-approval of the interim use permit.
            b. That the interim use will not impose additional costs on the
public if it is necessary for the public to fully or partially take the
property in the future; and
            c. That the applicant, owner, operator, tenant and/or user will
abide by conditions of approval that the City Council attaches to the interim
use permit.
         2. A statement addressing the relationship of the proposed project to
the neighboring uses.
      C. General issuance standards. The Planning Commission may recommend an
interim use permit and the council may issue such interim use permits only if
it finds that:
         1. The period of time for which the interim use permit is to be
granted will terminate before any adverse impacts are felt upon adjacent
properties.
         2. The date or event that will terminate the use can be identified
with certainty, with a maximum duration of five years from the date of
approval.
         3. The use will not adversely impact the health, safety and welfare of
the community;
         4. The use is similar to existing uses in the area;
         5. The use shall conform to zoning regulations, except the City
Council may waive ordinance provisions upon a finding that the temporary nature
of the interim use will eliminate the adverse effects the provisions were
intended to prevent;
         6. There is adequate assurance the property will be left in a suitable
condition after the use is terminated;
         7. By agreement, the use will not impose additional costs on the
public if it is necessary for the public to take the property in the future;
         8. The property owner, or other mutually designated party (“party”),
agrees to any conditions that the City Council has deemed appropriate for
permission of the use, including an optional condition that the party provide
an appropriate financial surety to cover the cost of removing the interim use
and interim structures upon the expiration of the interim use permit.
      D. Termination. An interim use permit shall terminate upon the occurrence
of any of the following events; whichever is first:
         1. The date stated in the permit;
         2. A violation of conditions and subsequent revocation of the permit;
         3. Revocation resulting from a cessation of the interim use for 180
consecutive days;
         4. A change in the zoning regulations that renders the use
nonconforming.
   Subd. 3. Additional conditions. In permitting a new or existing conditional
use, the City Council may impose, in addition to the standards and requirements
expressly specified by this chapter, additional conditions which the City
Council considers necessary to protect the best interest of the surrounding
area or the community as a whole. These conditions may include, but are not
limited to the following:
      A. Increasing the required lot size or yard dimension.
      B. Limiting the height, size or location of buildings.
      C. Controlling the location and number of vehicle access points.
      D. Increasing the street width.
      E. Increasing the number of required off-street parking spaces.
      F. Limiting the number, size, location or lighting of signs.
      G. Requiring diking, fencing, screening, landscaping or other facilities
to protect adjacent or nearby property.
      H. Designating sites for open space.
      I. Establishing a time limit on operations.
   Subd. 4. The Planning and Zoning Administrator shall maintain a record of
all conditional use permits issued, including information on the use, location,
and conditions imposed by the Planning Commission, time limits, review dates,
and such other information as may be appropriate.
   Subd. 5. Exhibits to accompany application. The following shall be required
to be submitted with a conditional use permit application:
      A. A preliminary building and site development plan. The Planning
Commission Council may also require a boundary survey of the property.
      B. Evidence of ownership or enforceable option on the property.
   Subd. 6. Procedure. The procedure for obtaining a conditional use permit is
as follows:
      A. The property owner or their agent shall meet with the Zoning
Administrator to explain their situation, learn the procedures and obtain an
application form.
      B. The applicant shall file the completed application form, together with
the required exhibits, with the Zoning Administrator and shall pay a filing fee
as established from time to time by the City Council.
      C. The Zoning Administrator shall transmit the application to the
Planning Commission and shall notify by mail all property owners within 350
feet of the outer boundaries of the property in question; however, failure of
any property owner to receive such notification shall not invalidate the
proceedings.
      D. The Zoning Administrator shall set the date for a public hearing and
shall have notice of such hearing published at least once in the legal
newspaper, not less than ten days and not more than 30 days prior to the
hearing.
      E. The Planning Commission shall hold the public hearing and shall study
the application to determine possible adverse effects of the proposed
conditional use and what additional requirements may be necessary to reduce
such adverse effects. The Planning Commission shall take one of three actions
within 30 days after holding the public hearing: approval, denial, or approval
with special conditions.
      F. If it grants the conditional use permit, the Planning Commission may
impose conditions it considers necessary to protect the public health, safety
and welfare, and such conditions may include time limits for the use to exist
or operate.
      G. All appeals of the decision of the Planning Commission relating to
conditional use permits shall be filed within 15 days of such decision to the
Board of Adjustment.
      H. Where a conditional use permit has been issued pursuant to the
provisions of this section, such permit shall become null and void without
further action by the Planning Commission or City Council, unless work thereon
commences within six months of the date such permit was granted. A conditional
use permit shall be deemed to authorize only one particular use and shall
expire if that use ceases for more than 180 consecutive days.
      I. In the event that the applicant violates any of the conditions set
forth in the conditional use permit, the City Council shall have the authority
to revoke the conditional use permit.
      J. No application of a property owner for a conditional use shall be
considered by the Planning Commission within a one-year period following a
denial for such a request, except the Planning Commission may permit a new
application if, in its opinion, new evidence or a change in circumstances
warrants it.
   Subd. 7. Violations. A violation of any condition of a conditional use
permit may result in immediate termination of such permit by the City Council,
following a public hearing.

§ 11.089 BOARD OF APPEALS AND ADJUSTMENTS.
   Subd. 1. Variances.
      A. Procedure. The procedures for obtaining a variance from the
regulations of this chapter are as follows:
         1. The property owner or his or her agent shall meet with the Zoning
Administrator to explain his or her situation, learn the procedures and obtain
an application form.
         2. The applicant shall file the completed application form, together
with the required exhibits, with the Zoning Administrator and shall pay a
filing fee, as established from time to time by the City Council.
         3. The Zoning Administrator shall schedule the application for review
by Planning Commission and shall notify by mail all property owners within 350
feet of the outer boundaries of the property in question; provided however,
failure of any property owners to receive such notification shall not
invalidate the proceedings.
         4. The Zoning Administrator shall set the date for a public hearing
and shall have the notice of such hearing published at least once in the legal
newspaper, not less than ten days prior to the hearing.
         5. The Board of Adjustment shall hold a public hearing on the proposed
variance and shall make a decision within 30 days after the public hearing. It
shall take one of three actions: approval, denial, or approval with special
conditions.
         6. No application by a property owner for a variance shall be
submitted to the Board of Adjustment within a six-month period following a
denial of such a request, except the Board may permit a new application, if in
the opinion of the Board, new evidence or change of circumstances warrants it.
         7. All appeals from the decision of the Board of Adjustment relating
to variances shall first be presented to the City Council, and shall be filed
in writing with the City Council within 30 days of the action of the Board of
Adjustment. Any further appeals may then be directed to a court of competent
jurisdiction; any such appeal must be filed within 30 days of the City
Council's final action.
         8. The Board of Adjustment may impose such restrictions and conditions
upon the premises benefitted by a variance as may be necessary to comply with
the standards established by this chapter, or to reduce or minimize the effect
of such variance upon other properties in the neighborhood, and to better carry
out the intent of the variance.
      B. Exhibits to accompany application.
         1. A preliminary building and site development plan is required to be
submitted when applying for a variance. The Board of Adjustment or City Council
may also require a boundary survey of the property.
         2. Evidence of ownership or enforceable option on the property shall
be required to be submitted when applying for a variance.
      C. Criteria.
         1. The Board of Adjustment, consistent with the authority granted by
law, may grant a property owner a variance from compliance with the literal
provisions of this chapter in an instance where strict enforcement would cause
practical difficulties to the individual property owner and when it can be
demonstrated that such action will be in keeping with the spirit and intent of
this chapter.
         2. The term "practical difficulties" means that the:
            a. Property owner purposes to use the property in a reasonable
manner that is not otherwise permitted; and
            b. The plight of the property owner is due to circumstances unique
to the property, not created by the property owner; and
            c. The variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character
of the locality.
            d. Economic considerations alone do not constitute practical
difficulties. "Practical difficulties," for the purposes of this section, also
means and includes, but is not limited to, inadequate access to direct sunlight
for solar energy systems.
      D. Notwithstanding a finding that practical difficulties exist, the Board
of Adjustment may not permit as a variance any use that is not permitted under
the provisions of this chapter for property in the zone where the land for
which the variance is sought is located.
      E. In its consideration of a variance request the Board of Adjustment
shall consider the following questions:
         1. Whether or not exceptional, unique or extraordinary circumstances
apply to the physical surrounding, shape or topographic conditions of the
parcel of land which results in practical difficulties for the owner.
         2. Whether or not the variance requested will alter the essential
character of the locality.
         3. Whether or not granting the variance requested will:
            a. Impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property;
            b. Substantially increase congestion in adjacent public streets;
            c. Endanger the public safety;
            d. Substantially diminish or impair property values within the
vicinity.
         4. Whether the variance requested is the minimum variance which would
alleviate the practical difficulties.
         5. Whether or not the variance requested is consistent with the intent
of this chapter and the city's comprehensive plan.
         6. Whether or not the variance requested provides for a reasonable and
practical solution that eliminates the practical difficulties.
      F. The Board of Adjustment, in granting a variance, may impose additional
conditions to ensure compliance with its decision and protect adjacent
properties. Such conditions must be directly related to and bear a rough
proportionality to the impact created by the variance.

the construction of dwelling units. At least once every six months following
the approval of the final development plan, the Zoning Administrator shall
review all of the building permits issued for the planned unit development and
examine the construction which has taken place on the site. If he or she shall
find that the rate of construction of dwelling units is faster than the rate at
which common open spaces and public recreational facilities have been
constructed and provided, he or she shall forward this information to the City
Council, which may revoke the conditional use permit. If the developer or

the common open space and any buildings, structures or improvements which have
been placed on it.
         2. It may be conveyed to trustees provided in an indenture
establishing a homeowners' association or similar organization for the
maintenance of the planned development. The common open space must be conveyed
to the trustees, subject to covenants to be approved by the City Council which
restrict the common open space to the uses specified on the final development
plan, and which provide for the maintenance of the common open space in a
manner which ensures its continuing use for its intended purpose.
      B. Maintenance. If the common open space is conveyed to a homeowners'
association and the common open space is not maintained properly to the city's
satisfaction, the city shall have the authority to maintain the property, bill
the homeowners, and assess any unpaid maintenance costs back to the benefitted
properties.
   Subd. 8. Standards for common open space. No open area may be accepted as
common open space under the provisions of this section, unless it meets the
following standards:
      A. The location, shape, size and character of the common open space must
be suitable for the planned development.
      B. The common open space must be used for amenity or recreational
purposes. The uses authorized for the common open space must be appropriate to
scale and character of the planned development, considering its size, density,
expected population, topography and the number and type of dwellings to be
provided.
      C. The common open space must be suitably improved for its intended use;
the common open space containing natural features worthy of preservation may be
left unimproved. The buildings, structures and improvements which are permitted
in the common open space must be appropriate to the uses which are authorized
for the common open space and must enhance the amenities.
   Subd. 9. Utility connections.
      A. Where more than one property is served from the same water service

may be shut off by the city, in addition to the normally supplied shutoff at
the street.
      B. Where more than one unit is serviced by a sanitary sewer lateral which
exceeds 300 feet in length, a provision must be made for a manhole to allow
adequate cleaning and maintenance of the lateral. All maintenance and cleaning
shall be the responsibility of the property owners association or individual
property owners.
   Subd. 10.  PUD review and amendments.
      A. Revisions to the PUD.
         1. Minor changes in the location, placement and heights of buildings
or structures may be authorized by the Zoning Administrator if required by
engineering or other circumstances not foreseen at the time the final plan was
approved.
         2. Approval by the Planning Commission and City Council shall be
required for other changes such as rearrangement of lots, blocks and building
tracts. These changes shall be consistent with the purpose and intent of the
approved final development plan.
         3. Any amendment to a PUD shall require the same procedures for the
application of a conditional use permit as set forth in §
11.088 of this chapter.
   Subd. 11. Zoning amendments in relation to the comprehensive plan. Any

§ 12.07 INTERPRETATION.
   The boundaries of the zoning districts shall be determined by scaling
distances on the Flood Insurance Rate Map.
   Subd. 1.   Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the
boundaries of the district as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map, as for
example where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and
actual field conditions and there is a formal appeal of the decision of the
Zoning Administrator, the Board of Adjustment shall make the necessary
interpretation.
   Subd. 2.   All decisions will be based on elevations on the regional (1%
chance) flood profile, the ground elevations that existed on the site at the
time the city adopted its initial flood plain ordinance or on the date of the
first National Flood Insurance Program map showing the area within the
regulatory flood plain, if earlier, and other available technical data.
   Subd. 3.   Persons contesting the location of the district boundaries will
be given a reasonable opportunity to present their case to the Board of
Adjustment and to submit technical evidence.

12.10, Subd. 7;
      F.   Road-ready recreational vehicles either on individual lots of
records or in existing or new subdivisions or commercial or condominium type
campgrounds, subject to the exemptions and provisions of §
12.23, Subd. 3; and
      G.   Structural works for flood control such as levees, dikes and
floodwalls constructed to any height where the intent is to protect individual
structures and levees or dikes where the intent is to protect agricultural
crops for a frequency flood event equal to or less than the 100-year frequency
flood event.
   Subd. 4.   Standards for floodway conditional uses.
      A.   All uses. No conditional use is permitted that will cause any
increase in the stage of the 1% chance or regional flood or cause an increase
in flood damages in the reach or reaches affected. This provision applies to
structures (temporary or permanent), fill (including fill for roads and
levees), deposits, obstructions, storage of materials or equipment, and all
other uses.
      B.   All floodway conditional uses shall be subject to the procedures and
standards contained in §
12.26.
      C.   Fill.
         1.   Fill, dredge spoil and all other similar materials deposited or
stored in the flood plain shall be protected from erosion by vegetative cover,
mulching, riprap or other acceptable method.
         2.   Dredge spoil sites and sand and gravel operations shall not be
allowed in the floodway unless a long-term site development plan is submitted
which includes an erosion/sedimentation prevention element to the plan.
         3.   As an alternative, and consistent with Subpar. 2 immediately
above, dredge spoil disposal and sand and gravel operations may allow
temporary, on-site storage of fill or other materials which would have caused
an increase to the stage of the 1% chance or regional flood, but only after the
governing body has received an appropriate plan which assures the removal of
the materials from the floodway based upon the flood warning time available.
The conditional use permit must be title registered with the property in the
office of the County Recorder.
      D.   Accessory structures.
         1.   Accessory structures shall not be designed for human habitation.
         2.   Accessory structures, if permitted, shall be constructed and
placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the flow
of flood waters.
            a. Whenever possible, structures shall be constructed with the
longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow; and
            b. So far as practicable, structures shall be placed approximately
on the same flood flow lines as those of adjoining structures.
         3.   Accessory structures shall be elevated on fill or structurally
dry flood-proofed in accordance with FP-1 or FP-2 flood proofing
classifications in the State Building Code. All flood-proofed accessory
structures must meet the following additional standards:
            a. The structure must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse or lateral movement of the structure and shall be designed to equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
            b. Any mechanical and utility equipment in a structure must be
elevated to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or properly
flood-proofed.
         4.   As an alternative, an accessory structure may be flood proofed to
the FP-3 or FP-4 flood proofing classification in the State Building Code
provided the accessory structure constitutes a minimal investment, does not
exceed 576 square feet in size at its largest projection, and for a detached
garage, the detached garage must be used solely for parking of vehicles and
limited storage. The structure must meet the following standard:
            a. To allow for the equalization of hydrstatic pressure, there must
be a minimum of two automatic openings in the outside walls of the structure
having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot
of enclosed area subject to flooding. There must be openings on at least two
sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings must be no higher than
one foot above the lowest adjacent grade to the structure.
            b. Using human intervention to open a garage door prior to flooding
will not satisfy this requirement for automatic openings.
      E.   Storage of materials and equipment.
         1.   The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of
flooding, flammable, explosive or potentially injurious to human, animal or
plant life is prohibited.
         2.   Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if readily
removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning and in
accordance with a plan approved by the Council.
(Ord. 238, Second Series, passed 4-30-91)
      F.   Structural works for flood control that will change the course,
current or cross-section of protected wetlands or public waters shall be
subject to the provisions of M.S. Chapter 103G.245, as it may be amended from
time to time. Community-wide structural works for flood control intended to
remove areas from the regulatory flood plain shall not be allowed in the
floodway.
(Ord. 252, Second Series, passed 10-22-91)
      G.   A levee, dike or floodwall constructed in the floodway shall not
cause an increase in the 100-year or regional flood and the technical analysis
must assume equal conveyance or storage loss on both sides of a stream.
(`80 Code, § 12.13) (Ord. 602, passed 8-19-13)
§ 12.14 FLOOD FRINGE DISTRICT, FF.
   Subd. 1.   Permitted uses.
      A.   Permitted uses shall be those uses of land or structures listed as
permitted uses in the underlying zoning districts.
      B.   All permitted uses shall comply with the standards for flood fringe
permitted uses listed in Subd. 2 below and the standards for flood fringe
conditional uses listed in Subd. 3 below.
   Subd. 2.   Standards for flood fringe permitted uses.
      A.   All structures, including accessory structures, must be elevated on
fill so that the lowest floor including basement floor is at or above the
regulatory flood protection elevation. The finished fill elevation for
structures shall be no lower than one foot below the regulatory flood
protection elevation and the fill shall extend at an elevation at least 15 feet
beyond the outside limits of the structure erected thereon.
      B.   As an alternative to elevation on fill, accessory structures that
constitute a minimal investment and that do not exceed 576 square feet at its
largest projection may be internally flood-proofed in accordance with §
12.13, Subd. 4, Subpar. D.
      C.   The cumulative placement of fill in excess of 250 cubic yards of
fill on the parcel shall be allowable only as a conditional use unless the fill
is specifically intended to elevate a structure in accordance with Subpar. A
above.
      D.   The storage of any materials or equipment shall be elevated on fill
to the regulatory flood protection elevation.
      E.   The provisions of Subd. 5 below shall apply.
   Subd. 3.   Conditional uses. The following uses may be allowed as
conditional uses following the procedure set forth in §
12.26 and further subject to the standards in Subd. 5 below.
      A.   Any structure that is not elevated on fill or flood-proofed in
accordance with Subd. 2, Subpar. A and B above.
      B.   Accessory structures exceeding the 576 square feet, as specified in
Subd. 2, Subpar. B above in accordance with the flood proofing standards of §
12.13, Subd. 4, Subpar. D.
      C.   Storage of any material or equipment below the regulatory flood
protection elevation.
      D.   The cumulative placement of more than 250 cubic yards of fill when
the fill is not being used to elevate a structure.
   Subd. 4.   Standards for flood fringe conditional uses.
      A.   Alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill may be
utilized to elevate a structure’s lowest floor above the regulatory flood
protection elevation. These alternative methods may include the use of stilts,
pilings, parallel walls and the like or above- grade, enclosed areas such as
crawl spaces or tuck-under garages. The base or floor of an enclosed area shall
be considered above-grade and not a structure’s basement or lowest floor if:
         1.   If the enclosed area is above-grade on at least one side of the
structure;
         2.   Is designed to internally flood and is constructed with flood
resistant materials; and
         3.   Is used solely for parking of vehicles, building access or
storage.
      B.   The above-noted alternative elevation methods are subject to the
following additional standards:
         1.   Design and certification. The structure’s design and as-built
condition must be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect
as being in compliance with the general design standards of the State Building
Code and, specifically, that all electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and
air conditioning equipment and other service facilities must be at or above the
regulatory flood protection elevation or be designed to prevent flood water
from entering or accumulating within these components during times of flooding.
         2.   Specific standards for above-grade, enclosed areas. Above-grade,
fully enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck-under garages must be
designed to internally flood and the design plans must stipulate:
            a. The minimum area of openings in the walls where internal
flooding is to be used as a flood-proofing technique. There shall be a minimum
of two openings on at least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all
openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. The automatic openings
shall have a minimum net area of not less than one square inch for every square
foot of enclosed area subject to flooding unless a registered professional
engineer or architect certifies that a smaller net area would suffice. The
automatic openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
flood waters without any form of human intervention; and
            b. That the enclosed area will be designed of flood resistant
materials in accordance with the FP-3 or FP-4 classifications in the State
Building Code and shall be used solely for building access, parking of vehicles
or storage.
      C.   Basements, as defined in §
12.10, Subd. 4, shall be subject to the following:
         1.   Residential basement construction is not allowed below the
regulatory flood protection elevation.
         2.   Non-residential basements may be allowed below the regulatory
flood protection elevation provided the basement is structurally dry flood-
proofed in accordance with Subpar. D below.
      D.   All areas of non-residential structures including basements to be
placed below the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be flood-proofed
in accordance with the structurally dry flood-proofing classifications in the
State Building Code. Structurally dry flood- proofing must meet the FP-1 or FP-
2 flood-proofing classification in the State Building Code and this shall
require making the structure watertight with the walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of
buoyancy. Structures flood-proofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 classification shall not
be permitted.
      E.   When at any one time more than 250 cubic yards of fill or other
similar material is located on a parcel for such activities as on-site storage,
landscaping, sand and gravel operations, landfills, roads, dredge spoil
disposal or construction of flood control works, an erosion/sedimentation
control
plan must be submitted.
         1.   The plan must clearly specify methods to be used to stabilize the
fill on-site for a flood event at a minimum of the 1% or regional flood event.
         2.   The plan must be prepared and certified by a registered
professional engineer or other qualified individual acceptable to the governing
body.
         3.   The plan may incorporate alternative procedures for removal of
the material from the flood plain if adequate flood warning time exists.
      F.   Storage of materials and equipment:
         1.   The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of
flooding, flammable, explosive or potentially injurious to human, animal or
plant life is prohibited.
         2.   Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if readily
removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning and in
accordance with a plan approved by the governing body.
      G.   The provisions of Subd. 5 below shall also apply.
   Subd. 5.   Standards for all flood fringe uses.
      A.   All new principal structures must have vehicular access at or above
an elevation not more than two feet below the regulatory flood protection
elevation. If a variance to this requirement is granted, the Board of
Adjustment must specify limitations on the period of use or occupancy of the
structure for times of flooding and only after determining that adequate flood
warning time and local flood emergency response procedures exist.
      B.   Commercial uses. Accessory land uses, such as yards, railroad tracks
and parking lots may be at elevations lower than the regulatory flood
protection elevation. However, a permit for the facilities to be used by the
employees or the general public shall not be granted in the absence of a flood
warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area would be
inundated to a depth and velocity such that when multiplying the depth (in
feet) times velocity (in feet per second) the product number exceeds four upon
occurrence of the regional flood.
      C.   Manufacturing and industrial uses. Measures shall be taken to
minimize interference with normal plant operations especially along streams
having protracted flood durations. Certain accessory land uses such as yards
and parking lots may be at lower elevations subject to requirements set out in
Subpar. B above. In considering permit applications, due consideration shall be
given to needs of an industry whose business requires that it be located in
flood plain areas.
      D.   Fill shall be properly compacted and the slopes shall be properly
protected by the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable method.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for
removing the special flood hazard area designation for certain structures
properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation - FEMA’s
requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection
standards for multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should
be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of
special flood hazard area designation will be requested.
      E.   Flood plain developments shall not adversely affect the hydraulic
capacity of the channel and adjoining flood plain of any tributary watercourse
or drainage system.
      F.   Standards for recreational vehicles are contained in §
12.23, Subd. 3.
      G.   All manufactured homes and those recreational vehicles not meeting
the exemption criteria of §
12.23, Subd. 3 must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system that resists flotation, collapse and lateral movement. Methods of
anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to use of over-the-top or
frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable
state or local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.

§ 12.15 GENERAL FLOOD PLAIN DISTRICT.
   Subd. 1.   Permissible uses.
      A.   The uses listed in §
12.13, Subd. 1, Floodway District, shall be permitted uses.
      B.   All other uses shall be subject to the floodway/flood fringe
evaluation criteria pursuant to Subd. 2 below. If the proposed use is in the
Floodway District §
12.13 shall apply and §
12.14 shall apply if the proposed use is in the Flood Fringe District.
   Subd. 2.   Procedures for floodway and flood fringe determinations in
General Flood Plain District.
      A.   Upon receipt of an application for a permit or other approval within
the General Flood Plain District, the Zoning Administrator must obtain, review
and reasonably utilize any regional flood elevation and floodway data available
from a federal, state, or other source. In the absence of such data, the
applicant must furnish such of the following information as is deemed necessary
by the Zoning Administrator for the determination of the regulatory flood
protection elevation and whether the proposed use is within the Floodway or
Flood Fringe District.
         1.   A typical valley cross-section(s) showing the channel of the
stream, elevation of land areas adjoining each side of the channel, cross-
sectional areas to be occupied by the proposed development, and high water
information.
         2.   Plan (surface view) showing elevations or contours of the ground,
pertinent structure, fill, or storage elevations, the size, location, and
spatial arrangement of all proposed and existing structures on the site, and
the location and elevations of streets.
         3.   Photographs showing existing land uses, vegetation upstream and
downstream, and soil types.
         4.   Profile showing the slope of the bottom of the channel or flow
line of the stream for at least 500 feet in either direction from the proposed
development.
      B.   The applicant is responsible for submitting one copy of the above
information to a designated engineer or other expert person or agency for
technical assistance in determining whether the proposed use is in the Floodway
or Flood Fringe District and to determine the regulatory flood protection
elevation. Procedures consistent with Minnesota Regulations 1983, Parts
6120.5000 through 6120.6200 and 44 CFR Part 65 shall be followed in this expert
evaluation. The designated engineer or expert is strongly encouraged to discuss
the proposed technical evaluation methodology with the respective Department of
Natural Resources Area Hydrologist prior to beginning the analysis. The
designated engineer or expert shall:
         1.   Estimate the peak discharge of the regional flood.
         2.   Calculate the water surface profile of the regional flood based
upon a hydraulic analysis of the stream channel and overbank areas.
         3.   Compute the floodway necessary to convey or store the regional
flood without increasing flood stages more than one-half foot. A lesser stage
increase than one- half foot shall be required if, as a result of the
additional stage increase, increased flood damages would result. An equal
degree of encroachment on both sides of the stream within the reach shall be
assumed in computing floodway boundaries.
      C.   The Zoning Administrator or his or her designee shall review the
technical evaluation and findings of the designated engineer or expert, in
conformance with accepted engineering practices. Based on this review, the
Zoning Administrator may formally accept the technical evaluation and the
recommended Floodway and/or Flood Fringe District boundary or deny the permit
application. If questions remain, the Zoning Administrator may present the
technical evaluation and findings of the designated engineer or expert to the
governing body for acceptance or denial. The Zoning Administrator, prior to
official action, may submit the application and all supporting data and
analyses to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Department of Natural
Resources or the Planning Commission for review and comment.
      D.   Once the Floodway and Flood Fringe District boundaries have been
determined, the Zoning Administrator shall process the permit application
consistent with the applicable provisions of §§
12.13 and
12.14 of this chapter, with the following exceptions:
         1.   In the Floodway District, as determined by the analysis in Subd.
2, Subpar. B above, development may increase the regional flood stage by up to
one-half foot, provided that flood damage potential to any existing structure
is not increased.
         2.   In the Flood Fringe, as determined by the analysis in Subd. 2,
Subpar. B above, the regulatory flood protection elevation must include a stage
increase of one-half foot.

§ 15.01 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
   Subd. 1.   Whereas, The City of Austin, Minnesota (the “city”) has reviewed
and analyzed numerous studies, reports, articles, judicial decisions and the
experience and legislative findings of other cities around the country
concerning the impacts or “secondary effects” of adult-orientated businesses
and the sale, distribution, and display of sexually oriented materials
(collectively, “adult-oriented business activities”) on the areas in which such
activities are located or take place; and
   Subd. 2.   Whereas, adult-oriented business activities can cause or
contribute significantly to increases in criminal activity in the areas in
which they are located or take place, thereby taxing crime prevention, law
enforcement, and public health services; and
   Subd. 3.   Whereas, activities and conduct provided by adult-oriented
business activities encourages prostitution, increases the frequency of sexual
assaults, attracts or encourages other related criminal activity, increases the
public health and safety risks associated with adult-oriented business
activities, and otherwise causes or contributes significantly to the adverse
impacts and secondary effects of adult- oriented business activities on the
areas in which such activities are located or take place; and
   Subd. 4.   Whereas, adult-oriented business activities can cause or
contribute significantly to the deterioration of residential neighborhoods, can
impair the character and quality of such neighborhoods and the housing located
therein, and can inhibit the proper maintenance and growth of such
neighborhoods, limiting or reducing the availability of quality, affordable
housing for area residents and reducing the value of property in such areas;
and
   Subd. 5.   Whereas, adult-oriented business activities can undermine the
stability of other established business and commercial uses in the areas in
which adult-oriented business activities are located or take place and can
cause or contribute significantly to the deterioration of such business and
commercial uses, thereby causing or contributing to a decline in such uses, an
inhibition on business and commercial growth, and a resulting adverse impact on
local government revenues and property values; and
   Subd. 6.   Whereas, adult-oriented business activities can have a
dehumanizing and distracting influence on young people and students attending
schools; can diminish or destroy the enjoyment and family atmosphere of persons
using parks, playgrounds, forest preserves, and other public recreational
areas; can interfere with or even destroy the spiritual experience of persons
attending church, synagogue, or other places of worship; and can interfere with
or even destroy the opportunity for solemn and respectful contemplation at
cemeteries and similar facilities; and
   Subd. 7.   Whereas, the presence of adult-oriented business activities is
perceived by the public generally and by neighboring business owners and
residents as an indication that the area in which such activities occur or take
place is in decline and deteriorating, a perception that can quickly lead to
such decline and deterioration, prompting businesses and residents to flee the
affected area to avoid the consequences of such decline and deterioration; and
   Subd. 8.   Whereas, the exterior appearance, including signage, of adult-
oriented business activities can have an adverse impact on young people and
students, can contribute to the decline in property values associated with
adult-oriented business activities, and can otherwise cause or contribute
significantly to the adverse impacts and secondary effects of adult-oriented
business activities on the areas in which such activities are located or take
place; and
   Subd. 9.   Whereas, the city has the power and authority to adopt and
enforce the regulations established in this chapter pursuant to (1) its general
police powers to protect the public health, safety, morals, and general public
welfare; and (2) all other applicable provisions of law.
   Subd. 10.   The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor
effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any
communicative materials, including adult-oriented materials. Similarly, it is
not the intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults
to adult- oriented materials protected by the First Amendment or to deny access
by distributors and exhibitors of adult-oriented entertainment to their
intended market.

or
      C. For construction projects on land used for agricultural purposes
(e.g., pipelines across crop or range land) final stabilization may be
accomplished by returning the disturbed land to its preconstruction
agricultural use. Areas disturbed that were not previously used for
agricultural activities, such as buffer strips immediately adjacent to surface
waters and drainage systems, and areas which are not being returned to their
preconstruction agricultural use must meet the final stabilization criteria in
A. or B. above.

      D. Objects such as motor vehicle parts that contain grease, oil or other
hazardous substances and unsealed receptacles containing hazardous materials
shall not be stored in areas susceptible to runoff. Any machinery or equipment
that is to be repaired or maintained in areas susceptible to runoff shall be
placed in a confined area to contain any leaks, spills, or discharges.
      E. Debris and residue shall be removed, as required below:
         1. All motor vehicle parking lots and paved private streets shall be
swept, at a minimum of once a year in the spring to remove debris. Such debris
shall be collected and be disposed of properly.
         2. Fuel and chemical residue or other types of potentially harmful
material, such as animal waste, garbage or batteries shall be removed as soon
as possible and disposed of properly. Household hazardous waste must be
disposed of through the county collection program or at any other authorized
disposal site.
   Subd. 10. Industrial or Construction Activity Discharges to the Storm
Drainage System.
      A. Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES
stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit.
Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to
the city prior to the allowing of discharge to the storm drainage system.
      B. All facilities that have stormwater discharges associated with
industrial activity must adhere to the following requirements: Any person
responsible for a property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an
illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's expense,
additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge
of pollutants to the storm drainage system. These BMPs shall be part of a
stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with
requirements of the NPDES permit.
   Subd. 11. Notification of Spills. Notwithstanding other requirements of law,
as soon as any person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible
for emergency response for a facility or operation, has information of any
known or suspected release of materials that are resulting or may result in
illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into the storm drainage system, or
waters of the state, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the
discovery, containment and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a
release of hazardous materials, said person shall immediately notify emergency
response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services, such as by
calling 911. In the event of a release of non-hazardous materials, said person
shall notify the city no later than the next business day. Notifications in
person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to
the city within three business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of
prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment,
the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site
written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its
recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three years.
   Subd. 12. Access to Buildings for Inspection, Sampling, Dye Testing,
Monitoring and Examination Related to Stormwater Discharge.
      A. The city shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to
regulation under this chapter as often as may be necessary to determine
compliance with this chapter. If a discharger has security measures in force
that require proper identification and clearance before entry into its
premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access
to representatives of the city.
      B. Facility operators shall allow the city ready access to all parts of
the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying
of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to
discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as defined
by state and federal law.
      C. The city shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility such
devices as are necessary in the opinion of the city to conduct monitoring and/
or sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge.
      D. The city has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring
equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall
be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the
discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and
quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
      E. Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the city and shall not be replaced.
The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
      F. Unreasonable delays in allowing the city access to a permitted
facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this chapter. A
person who is the operator of a facility with an NPDES permit to discharge
stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the person
denies the city reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of
conducting any activity authorized or required by this chapter.
      G. If the city has been refused access to any part of the premises from
which stormwater is discharged, and he or she is able to demonstrate probable
cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there
is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling
program designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any order issued
hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the
community, then the authorized enforcement agency may seek issuance of a search
warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.
   Subd. 13. Suspension of Storm Drainage System Access.
      A. The city may, without prior notice, suspend storm drainage system
discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge that presents or may present an imminent and
substantial danger to the environment; to the public health or welfare; to the
storm drainage system; or to the waters of the state. If the violator fails to
comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the city may take such
steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the storm drainage
system or waters of the state, or to minimize danger to the public.
      B. Any person discharging to the storm drainage system in violation of
this section may have his or her storm drainage system access terminated if
such termination will abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The city will
notify a violator of the proposed termination of its drainage system access.
The violator may petition the authorized enforcement agency for a
reconsideration and hearing. No person shall reinstate the storm drainage
system access to premises terminated pursuant to this section without the prior
approval of the city.
   Subd. 14. Watercourse Protection. Every person owning property through which
a watercourse passes, or such person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that
part of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, excessive
vegetation, and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or
significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse. In addition,
the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately-owned structures within
or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard
to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse.
   Subd 15. Salt and Deicer Storage. 
      A. Applicability.
         1. The following sections apply to all indoor and outdoor bulk deicer
storage facilities (temporary and permanent) including salt piles, salt bag
storage and other storage of deicing materials. Bulk storage, as regulated by
this chapter, is defined as storage of any material used for deicing and/or
traction during winter conditions that is more than five tons in solid form (or
1,000 gallons in liquid form).
      B. General Requirements.
         1. Indoor operations for the storage of deicing materials must be
provided wherever possible in order to prevent such materials from being
affected by rain, snow and melt water.
         2. All salt and other deicing materials stored outdoors must be
covered at all times.
            a. When not using a permanent roof, a waterproof impermeable,
flexible cover must be placed over all storage piles to protect against
precipitation and surface water runoff. The cover must prevent runoff and
leachate from being generated by the outdoor storage piles. The cover must be
secured to prevent removal by wind or other storm events. Piles must be formed
in a conical shape and covered as necessary to prevent leaching.
            b. Any roof leaks, tears or damage should be temporarily repaired
during winter to reduce the entrance of precipitation. Permanent repairs must
be completed prior to the next winter season.
      C. Facility Siting.
         1. The facility must be in close proximity to the area in which the
deicing materials are to be used, if practical.
         2. Each facility must be located outside of floodplains and 50 feet
from lakes, rivers, streams, ditches, storm drains, manholes, catch basins,
wetlands and any other areas likely to absorb runoff. A facility must not be
located in close proximity to surface water features, water supplies, wells or
drywells.
         3. A facility must be located on impermeable surfaces.
         4. The property slope must be away from the facility’s salt, and
deicer storage area.
         5. Salt vulnerable/intolerant natural areas should be avoided as
storage facilities to the extent possible. Where they cannot be avoided,
specific measures should be instituted to protect vulnerable areas. Salt
vulnerable/intolerable natural areas include, but are not limited to:
            a. Areas with salt sensitive vegetation;
            b. Areas serving as a source of drinking water (surface water and
ground water);
            c. Areas with bodies of water with low dilution, low volume or salt
sensitive species;
            d. Areas associated with ground water recharge zones or shallow
water table, with medium to high permeable soils.
      D. Transfer of Materials.
         1. Practices must be implemented in order to reduce exposure (e.g.,
sweeping, diversions, and/or containment) when transferring salt or other
deicing material.

§ 20.05 CONSTRUCTION SITE EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL.
   Subd. 1. Established. This section shall be known as the “Construction Site
Erosion and Sediment Control Ordinance” of the city and may be so cited.
   Subd. 2. Introduction; Purpose.
      A. During the construction process, soil is highly vulnerable to erosion
by wind and water. Eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing water
quality and causing the siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other
desirable species. Eroded soil also necessitates repair of sewers and ditches
and the dredging of lakes. In addition, clearing and grading during
construction cause the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and
aquatic habitat.
      B. As a result, the purpose of this local regulation is to safeguard
persons, protect property, and prevent damage to the environment in the city.
This section will also promote the public welfare by guiding, regulating, and
controlling the design, construction, use, and maintenance of any development
or other activity that disturbs or breaks the topsoil or results in the
movement of earth on land in the city.
      C. This section is not to serve as a replacement for the regulations set
forth by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) or U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) regarding construction activity stormwater permitting.
In the event that any regulation contained in this section conflicts with a
corresponding MPCA and/or EPA regulation, the more stringent or restrictive
regulation will be upheld.
   Subd. 3. Definitions. See §
20.03.
   Subd. 4. Permits.
      A. No person shall be granted a site development permit for land-
disturbing activity that would require the uncovering of 43,560 or more square

accordance with the SWPPP and that a certified contractor shall be on site on
all days when construction or grading activity takes place.
   Subd. 5. Review and Approval.
      A. The city will review each application for a site development permit to
determine its conformance with the provisions of this regulation. Within 15
days after receiving an application, the city shall respond to the applicant
if:
         1. The application is not approved;
         2. The application is approved, pending conditions.
      B. No response by the city on an original or revised application within
15 days of receipt shall authorize the applicant to proceed in accordance with
the plans as filed unless such time is extended by agreement between the
applicant and the city. Pending preparation and approval of a revised plan,
development activities shall be allowed to proceed in accordance with
conditions established by the city.
   Subd. 6.   Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP).
      A. The Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan shall include the following:
         1. A natural resources map identifying soils, forest cover, and water
resources located on or near the site;
         2. A sequence of construction of the development site, including
stripping and clearing; rough grading; construction of utilities,
infrastructures, and buildings; and final grading and landscaping. Sequencing
shall identify the expected date on which clearing will begin, the estimated
duration of exposure of cleared areas, areas of clearing, installation of
temporary erosion and sediment control measures, and establishment of permanent
vegetation;
         3. All erosion and sediment control measures necessary to meet the
objectives of this local regulation throughout all phases of construction and
after completion of development of the site. Depending upon the complexity of
the project, the drafting of intermediate plans may be required at the close of
each season;
         4. Seeding mixtures and rates, types of sod, method of seedbed
preparation, expected seeding dates, type and rate of lime and fertilizer
application, and kind and quantity of mulching for both temporary and permanent
vegetative control measures;
         5. Waste controls for any type of waste which may be generated on the
site. Waste controls must provide for appropriate waste storage on-site and
property disposal;
         6. Provisions for maintenance of control of facilities, including
easements and estimates of the cost of maintenance;
         7. A statement indicating the party responsible for the long-term
stormwater management for the development and the party responsible for any
permanent stormwater management systems on site; and
         8. Modifications to the plan shall be processed and approved or
disapproved in the same manner as Subd. 5 of this regulation, may be authorized
by the city by written authorization to the permittee, and shall include:
      A. Major amendments of the SWPPP submitted to Inspection Department;
      B. Field modifications of a minor nature.
   Subd. 7. Design Requirements.
      A. Grading, erosion control practices, sediment control practices, and
waterway crossings shall be at least as stringent as the MPCA's General Permit
to Discharge Stormwater Associated with Construction Activity No. MNR100001
(Part IV: Construction Activity Requirements) and shall be adequate to prevent
transportation of sediment from the site to the satisfaction of the city.
Recommended Best Management Practices (BMPs) are those in the latest version of
the Minnesota Stormwater Manual.
      B. Clearing and grading of natural resources, such as forests and
wetlands, shall not be permitted, except when in compliance with all other
requirements and all applicable state and federal laws. Clearing techniques
that retain natural vegetation and drainage patterns, as described in the
Minnesota Stormwater Manual, shall be used to the satisfaction of the city.
      C. Clearing, except that necessary to establish sediment control devices,
shall not begin until all sediment control devices have been installed and have
been stabilized.
      D. Erosion control requirements shall include the following:
         1. Soil stabilization shall be completed within five days of clearing
or inactivity in construction;
         2. If seeding or another vegetative erosion control method is used, it
shall become established within two weeks or the city may require the site to
be reseeded or a non-vegetative option employed;
         3. Special techniques that meet the design criteria outlined in the
Minnesota Stormwater Manual on steep slopes or in drainage ways shall be used
to ensure stabilization;
         4. Soil stockpiles must be stabilized or covered at the end of each
workday. The entire site must be stabilized, using a heavy mulch layer or
another method that does not require germination to control erosion, at the
close of the construction season;
         5. Techniques shall be employed to prevent the blowing of dust or
sediment from the site;
         6. Techniques that divert upland runoff past disturbed slopes shall be
employed.
      E. Sediment control requirements shall include:
         1. Settling basins, sediment traps, or tanks and perimeter controls;

adaptation to provide long-term stormwater management, if required by the city;
         3. Protection for adjacent properties by the use of a vegetated buffer
strip in combination with perimeter controls.
      F. Waterway and watercourse protection requirements shall include:
         1. Stabilization of the watercourse channel before, during, and after
any in-channel work;
         2. On-site stormwater conveyance channels designed according to the
criteria outlined in the Minnesota Water Manual; and
         3. Stabilization adequate to prevent erosion located at the outlets of
all pipes and paved channels.
      G.   Construction site access requirements shall include:
         1. A temporary rock construction entrance provided at all sites. Rock
shall be crushed 1-1/2 inch diameter, minimum. The dimensions shall be 20 feet
by 50 feet with a depth of at least nine inches;
         2. Other measures required by the city in order to ensure that
sediment is not tracked onto public streets by construction vehicles or washed
into storm drains.
      H. Post-construction stormwater management BMPs in accordance with §
20.06.
   Subd. 8.   Inspection.
      A. The City shall make inspections as hereinafter required and either
shall approve that portion of the work completed or shall notify the permittee
wherein the work fails to comply with the SWPPP as approved. Plans for grading,
stripping, excavating, and filling work shall be maintained at the site during
the progress of the work. The permittee shall notify the city at least two
working days before the following:
         1. Start of construction;
         2. Completion of site clearing;
         3. Completion of final grading; and
         4. Completion of final landscaping.
      B. The permittee shall make regular inspections per the requirements of
the MPCA construction activity stormwater permit.
      C. The city or its designated agent shall enter the property of the
applicant as deemed necessary to make regular inspections.
   Subd. 9.   Small Construction Sites.
      A. All construction activities which disturb less than one acre of land,
and that are not part of a larger plan of development or sale, are considered
“small construction sites” and are required to have the following erosion and
sediment control BMPs in place:
         1. Perimeter control. Down gradient silt fence or other approved
method as listed in the Minnesota Stormwater Manual.
         2. Vehicle tracking control. Rock or wood mulch construction entrance
measuring at least eight feet wide and 20 feet long. All construction access

         3. Stockpile control. All soil stockpiles not being actively used
shall be either covered with an impermeable sheet or protected by silt fence,
no further than three feet from the base of the stockpile.
         4. Turf establishment. Upon completion of final topsoil grading and
seeding, the soil shall be covered with straw mulch (disked in), liquid
tackifier, or erosion control blanket. Perimeter controls shall remain in place
until this is completed.
         5. Good housekeeping. Any sediment that is transported off-site shall
be cleaned up and replaced on the site within 24 hours of discovery. This
includes any sediment in the roadway or gutter.
      B. A plan shall be submitted to the city which addresses the details and
locations of the items listed in Part A.1. through 5. of this subdivision,
above.
      C. Erosion and sediment control on small construction sites is the
responsibility of the general contractor for the site. In the event that there
is no general contractor for the site, the landowner becomes responsible.
      D. Exemptions. Activities disturbing less than 2,500 square feet of soil
are exempt from the requirements set forth in this section.
(Ord. 622, passed 12-1-14)
§ 20.06 POST-CONSTRUCTION STORMWATER MANAGEMENT.
   Subd. 1. Purpose. This chapter is intended to prevent or reduce water
pollution after construction activity is completed, related to new development
or redevelopment projects with land disturbance of greater than or equal to one
acre, including projects less than one acre that are part of a larger common
plan of development or sale with the city and that discharge to the city's MS4.
   Subd. 2. Definitions. See §
20.03.
   Subd. 3. Conditions for Post-Construction Stormwater Management. Plans for
drainage design and stormwater management must meet the regulations of the
Cedar River Watershed District, the Department of Natural Resources, and the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Site plans for new development or redevelopment
shall also include any combination of Best Management Practices, with the
highest preference given to green infrastructure techniques and practices,
necessary to meet the following conditions on the site of a construction
activity to the maximum extent practicable:
      A. Owners of construction activity to submit site plans with post
construction stormwater management BMPs designed with accepted engineering
practices to the permittee for review and confirmation that regulatory
mechanism(s) requirements have been met, prior to start of construction
activity.
      B. Owners of construction activity must treat the water quality volume on
any project where the sum of the new impervious surface and the fully
reconstructed impervious surface equals one or more acres.
      C. For construction activity (excluding linear projects), the water
quality volume must be calculated as one inch times the sum of the new and the
fully reconstructed impervious surface.
      D. For linear projects, the water quality volume must be calculated as
the larger of one inch times the new impervious surface or one-half inch times
the sum of the new and the fully reconstructed impervious surface.
         1. Where the entire water quality volume cannot be treated within the
existing right-of-way, a reasonable attempt to obtain additional right-of-way,
easement, or other permission to treat the stormwater during the project
planning process must be made.
         2. Volume reduction practices must be considered first, as described
in Subd 3. Volume reduction practices are not required if the practices cannot
be provided cost effectively.
         3. If additional right-of-way, easements, or other permission cannot
be obtained, owners of construction activity must maximize the treatment of the
water quality volume prior to discharge from the MS4.
      E. Volume reduction practices (e.g., infiltration or other) to retain the
water quality volume on-site must be considered first when designing the
permanent stormwater treatment system. This permit does not consider wet
sedimentation basins and filtration systems to be volume reduction practices.
If this permit prohibits infiltration as described in item 20.9, other volume
reduction practices, a wet sedimentation basin, or filtration basin may be
considered.
   Subd. 4. Stormwater management limitations and exceptions.
      A. Limitations. The use of infiltration techniques to achieve the
conditions for post-construction stormwater management in Subd. 3 is prohibited
when the infiltration structural stormwater BMP will receive discharges from,
or be constructed in areas:
         1. That receive discharges from vehicle fueling and maintenance areas,
regardless of the amount of new and fully reconstructed impervious surface.
         2. Where high levels of contaminants in soil or groundwater may be
mobilized by the infiltrating stormwater. To make this determination, the
owners and/or operators of construction activity must complete the MPCA's site
screening assessment checklist, which is available in the Minnesota Stormwater
Manual, or conduct their own assessment. The assessment must be retained with
the site plans.
         3. Where soil infiltration rates are more than 8.3 inches per hour
unless soils are amended to slow the infiltration rate below 8.3 inches per
hour.
         4. With less than three feet of separation distance from the bottom of
the infiltration system to the elevation of the seasonally saturated soils or
the top of bedrock.
         5. Of predominately Hydrologic Soil Group D (clay) soils.
         6. In an Emergency Response Area (ERA) within a Drinking Water Supply
Management Area (DWSMA) as defined in Minn. R. 4720.5100, Subp. 13, classified
as high or very high vulnerability as defined by the Minnesota Department of
Health.
         7. In an ERA within a DWSMA classified as moderate vulnerability
unless you perform or approve a higher level of engineering review sufficient
to provide a functioning treatment system and to prevent adverse impacts to
groundwater.
         8. Outside of an ERA within a DWSMA classified as high or very high
vulnerability unless you perform or approve a higher level of engineering
review sufficient to provide a functioning treatment system and to prevent
adverse impacts to groundwater.
         9. Within 1,000 feet up-gradient or 100 feet down gradient of active
karst features.
         10. That receive stormwater runoff from these types of entities
regulated under NPDES for industrial stormwater: automobile salvage yards;
scrap recycling and waste recycling facilities; hazardous waste treatment,
storage, or disposal facilities; or air transportation facilities that conduct
deicing activities.       B. Exceptions for stormwater discharge volume. Lesser
volume control on the site of the original construction activity than that in
Subd. 3. is allowed only under the following circumstances:
         1. The owner and/or operator of a construction activity is precluded
from infiltrating stormwater through a designed system due to any of the
infiltration related limitations described above; and
         2. The owner and/or operator of the construction activity implements,
to the MEP, volume reduction techniques, other than infiltration, (e.g.,
evapotranspiration, reuse/harvesting, conservation design, green roofs, and the
like) on the site of the original construction activity that reduces stormwater
discharge volume, but may not meet the conditions for post-construction
stormwater management in Subd. 3.
   Subd. 5.   Mitigation provisions. In circumstances where the City or other
owners and operators of a construction activity cannot cost effectively meet
the conditions for post-construction stormwater management for TSS and/or TP in
Subd. 3. on the site of the original construction activity, the city shall
identify, or may require owners or operators of a construction activity to
identify, locations where mitigation projects can be completed. Any stormwater
discharges of TSS and/or TP not addressed on the site of the original
construction activity shall be addressed through mitigation and, at a minimum,
shall ensure the following requirements are met:
      A. Mitigation project areas are selected in the following order of
preference:
         1. Locations that yield benefits to the same receiving water that
receives runoff from the original construction activity;
         2. Locations within the same Department of Natural Resource (DNR)
catchment area as the original construction activity;
         3. Locations in the next adjacent DNR catchment area up-stream;
         4. Locations anywhere within the permittee's jurisdiction.
      B. Mitigation projects must involve the creation of new structural
stormwater BMPs or the retrofit of existing structural stormwater BMPs, or the
use of a properly designed regional structural stormwater BMP.
      C. Routine maintenance of structural stormwater BMPs already required by
this permit cannot be used to meet mitigation requirements of this part.
      D. Mitigation projects shall be completed within 24 months after the
start of the original construction activity.
      E. The city shall determine, and document, who is responsible for long-
term maintenance on all mitigation projects of this part.
      F. If the city receives payment from the owner and/or operator of a
construction activity for mitigation purposes in lieu of the owner or operator
of that construction activity meeting the conditions for post-construction
stormwater management in Subd. 3., the city shall apply any such payment
received to a public stormwater project, and all projects must be in compliance
with requirements in Subd. 4.A. through E. above.
   Subd. 6. Long-term maintenance of structural stormwater BMPs. Legal
mechanism(s) shall be established between the city and owners or operators
responsible for the long-term maintenance of structural stormwater BMPs not
owned or operated by the city, that have been implemented to meet the
conditions for post-construction stormwater management in Subd. 3. This
includes only structural stormwater BMPs constructed after this chapter is
passed, that are directly connected to the city's MS4, and that are in the
city's jurisdiction. The legal mechanism shall include provisions that, at a
minimum:
      A. Allow the city to conduct inspections of structural stormwater BMPs
not owned or operated by the city, perform necessary maintenance, and assess
costs for those structural stormwater BMPs when the city determines that the
owner and/or operator of that structural stormwater BMP has not conducted
maintenance.
      B. Include conditions that are designed to preserve the city's right to
ensure maintenance responsibility, for structural stormwater BMPs not owned or
operated by the city, when those responsibilities are legally transferred to
another party.
      C. Include conditions that are designed to protect/preserve structural
stormwater BMPs and site features that are implemented to comply with Subd. 3.
If site configurations or structural stormwater BMPs change, causing decreased
structural stormwater BMP effectiveness, new or improved structural stormwater
BMPs must be implemented to ensure the conditions for post-construction
stormwater management in Subd. 3. continue to be met.

§ 20.07 ENFORCEMENT.
   Subd. 1.   Illicit Discharges and Connections.
      A. Notice of Violation. Whenever the city finds that a person has
violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of §
20.04, the city may order compliance by sending written notice of the violation
to the responsible person. Such notice may require without limitation:
         1. The performance of monitoring, analyses and reporting;
         2. The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;
         3. Discharges, practices, or operations in violation of this section
to cease and desist;
         4. The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property; and
         5.   The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
      B. The offending party may appeal the city's notice to the City Council.
An appeal must be brought in writing no later than ten days from the date of
the notice.
      C. If abatement of a violation or restoration of affected property is
required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such remediation
or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall further advise that, should
the offending party fail to remediate or restore within the established
deadline, the work will be done by a designated governmental agency or a
contractor and the expense thereof will be charged to the offending party.
      D. In the event that the abatement or restoration work is performed by

and the violation has been satisfactorily addressed. Failure to address a
notice of violation in a timely manner can result in civil, criminal, or
monetary penalties in accordance with the enforcement measures authorized in
this chapter.
