104.03 ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT OF CODE REGULATIONS.
Subd. 1.   Purpose.  The administrative enforcement procedures established
within this section are intended to provide the City of Shorewood with an
informal, cost-effective and more efficient alternative to criminal prosecution
or civil litigation for certain violations of the City Code. The city retains
the right, at its sole discretion, to enforce provisions of this code by
bringing criminal charges or commencing civil litigation in any case where the
city determines it is appropriate or necessary, but finds that an
administrative process is beneficial to the residents of the city and further
finds that that such a process is a legitimate and necessary alternative method
of enforcing code violations.
Subd. 2.   Procedure.
      a.   Administrative notice.  A Code Compliance Officer may issue, either
in person or by United States first class mail, an administrative notice to a
person suspected or known to have committed a code offense or to be the owner
of property upon which a code offense is being committed. The administrative
notice shall identify the code offense, the location upon which the code
offense occurred or is occurring, and the recommended corrective action for the
code offense. The administrative notice may also state that the alleged
violator has, at the discretion of the Code Compliance Officer, up to ten days
after the issuance of the administrative notice to correct or abate the code
offense. If the alleged violator or owner of property upon which a code offense
is being committed is unable to correct or abate the code offense within the
prescribed time, that person may request in writing an extension of no more
than 30 additional days from the City Council. Any extension granted by the
City Council shall be in writing and shall specifically state the date of
expiration. If the code offense is not corrected or abated within the
prescribed time or any extension thereto, the Code Compliance Officer may issue
a citation, as provided below.
      b.   Citation. A Code Compliance Officer is authorized to issue a
citation upon the belief that a code offense has occurred, whether or not an
administrative notice has first been issued in regard to the code offense. The
citation shall be given to the person responsible for the violation or to the
owner of the property upon which the violation has occurred, either in person
or by United States first class mail. The citation shall state: i) the nature
of the code offense; ii) the time and date the code offense occurred; iii) the
civil penalty applicable to that code offense; and, iv) the manner for paying
the civil penalty or requesting a hearing before a Hearing Officer to contest
the citation.
      c.   Responding to a citation / payment. The alleged violator or the
owner of the property upon which the violation has occurred shall, within ten
days of the issuance of the citation either request a hearing in writing
according to the procedure set forth in this section or, within 15 days of the
issuance of the citation, pay the civil penalty set forth in the citation. The
civil penalty may be paid either in person at City Hall, or by United States
first class mail, postage prepaid and postmarked within the prescribed 15 days.
Payment of the civil penalty shall be deemed to be an admission of the code
0ffense.
Subd. 3.   Appeal to Hearing Officer.
      a.   Requesting a hearing.  Any person contesting a citation issued
pursuant to this section may, within ten days of the issuance of the citation,
request a hearing before a Hearing Officer. Any request for a hearing shall be
made in writing on a form provided by the city, shall be accompanied by the fee
required in the City of Shorewood Master Fee Schedule, and either delivered
personally to the city at City Hall or mailed to the city by United States
first class mail, postage prepaid and postmarked within the prescribed ten
days. The hearing shall be held at City Hall within 30 days of the date the
city receives a timely hearing request. Failure to attend the hearing
constitutes a waiver of the violator’s rights to an administrative hearing and
an admission of the violation. A Hearing Officer may waive this result upon
good cause shown. The Hearing Officer shall determine good cause, which shall
not include forgetfulness or intentional delay.
      b.   Hearing Officer. The City Council shall by resolution from time to
time appoint a list of persons authorized to act as a Hearing Officer. The
Hearing Officer is authorized to conduct an informal hearing to determine if a
code offense has occurred. The Hearing Officer shall have the authority to
uphold or dismiss the citation or reduce, stay or waive the civil penalty
imposed upon such terms and conditions as the Hearing Officer shall determine.
The Hearing Officer’s decision shall be made in writing on a form provided by
the city for such purpose. A copy of the Hearing Officer’s decision shall be
served either in person or by United States first class mail upon the person
requesting the hearing. The Hearing Officer’s decision is final, except for
appeal in limited cases to the City Council, as set forth below, or as allowed
under state law.
      c.   Conduct of hearing. At the hearing, the parties will have the
opportunity to present testimony, documents and exhibits and question
witnesses. The Hearing Officer shall tape record the proceedings and receive
testimony and exhibits. Strict rules of evidence will not apply. The Hearing
Officer must receive and give weight to evidence, including hearsay evidence
that possesses probative value commonly accepted by reasonable and prudent
persons in the conduct of their affairs.
      d.   Outcome of hearing. If the Hearing Officer upholds the citation, the
appellant shall pay the cost of the Hearing Officer plus any civil penalties
that result from the citation. If the Hearing Officer dismisses the citation
and waives the penalty, the city shall pay the costs for the Hearing Officer
and refund the application fee for the appeal request.
Subd. 4.   Appeal of Hearing Officer’s decision.
      a.   The Hearing Officer’s decision shall be appealable to the City
Council only for the following matters:
         (1)   An alleged failure to obtain a required permit, license, or
other approval from the City Council as required by the City Code;
         (2)   An alleged violation of a permit, license, or other approval, or
the conditions attached to the permit, license or approval, that was issued by
the City Council; or
         (3)   An alleged violation of regulations governing a person or entity
who has received a license issued by the City Council.
      b.   An appeal to the City Council of the Hearing Officer’s decision must
be made in writing on a form provided by the city and must be served on the
City Clerk either in person or by United States first class mail, postage
prepaid, within ten days of the Hearing Officer’s decision.
      c.   The City Council will hear all timely appeals. The city will serve a
notice of hearing upon the appellant in person or by United States first class
mail at least ten days in advance of the date of the hearing. The parties to
the hearing will have an opportunity to present oral or written arguments
regarding the Hearing Officer’s decision.
      d.   The City Council shall consider the record, the Hearing Officer’s
decision, and any additional arguments before making a determination. The City
Council is not bound by the Hearing Officer’s decision, but may adopt all or
part of the Hearing Officer’s decision. The City Council’s decision may be
voted upon and given at the hearing or may be given in writing within 30 days
of the hearing.
      e.   The failure of the appellant to appear in front of the City Council
or participate in the appeal constitutes a waiver of the violator’s right of
appeal and an admission of the violation. The Council may waive the result upon
good cause shown. The determination of a showing of good cause shown shall be
made solely at the discretion of the City Council but does not include
forgetfulness and intentional delay.
Subd. 5.   Failure to pay.
      a.   In the event a person charged with a code offense fails to pay the
civil penalty and correct or abate the code offense for which a citation was
issued within the prescribed time, a late charge of 15% shall be imposed
thereon for each seven days the civil penalty remains unpaid and the code
offense remains uncorrected or unabated beyond the due date.
      b.   An unpaid civil penalty and accrued late charges will constitute a
personal obligation of the person(s) to whom the citation was issued and the
city shall have the right to collect such unpaid civil penalty and accrued late
charges, together with the city’s costs and reasonable attorney’s fees, in
criminal or civil proceedings.
      c.   Pursuant to M.S. §§ 429.101, 514.67 and other applicable law, a lien
in the amount of the civil penalty and any accrued late charges may be assessed
against the property where the code offense occurred and collected in the same
manner as taxes. Any such assessment shall not preclude the city from issuing
additional citations for a continuing code offense, nor shall it preclude the
city from making additional assessments against the same property resulting
from a continuing or new code offense.
      d.   The city may suspend or revoke a license or permit or other approval
associated with the code offense if the civil penalty and accrued late charges
are not timely paid.
Subd. 6.   Subsequent violations. If a second citation for a code offense is
issued by the city to the alleged violator or owner of the property upon which
the violation has occurred within 24 months of the issuance of a previous
citation for the same code offense, the civil penalty shall increase by 25%
over the scheduled civil penalty amount. If a third citation for a code offense
is issued by the city to the alleged violator or the owner of the property upon
which the violation has occurred within 24 months of the issuance of a previous
citation for the same code offense, the civil penalty shall increase by 50%
over the scheduled civil penalty amount. If a fourth citation for a code
offense is issued by the city to the alleged violator or the owner of the
property upon which the violation has occurred within 24 months of the issuance
of a previous citation for the same code offense, the civil penalty shall
increase by 100% over the scheduled civil penalty amount.

302.01 PURPOSE.
   Because the city recognizes that many persons under the age of 21 years
purchase or otherwise obtain, possess and use tobacco, and tobacco-related
devices, and the sales, possession and use are violations of both state and
federal laws; and because studies, which are hereby accepted and adopted, have
shown that most smokers begin smoking before they have reached the age of 21
years and that those persons who reach the age of 21 years without having
started smoking are significantly less likely to begin smoking and because
smoking has been shown to be the cause of several serious health problems which
subsequently place a financial burden on all levels of government; this chapter
shall be intended to regulate the possession and use of tobacco, and tobacco-
related devices for the purpose of enforcing and furthering existing laws, to
protect minors against the serious effects associated with the illegal use of
tobacco, and tobacco-related devices and to further the official public policy
of the State of Minnesota in regard to preventing young people from starting to
smoke as stated in M.S. § 144.391.
(Ord. 475, passed 5-9-2011; Ord. 571, passed 1-27-2020)
302.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply

those authorized to sell tobacco, and tobacco-related devices are following and
complying with the requirements of this chapter. COMPLIANCE CHECKS shall
involve the use of minors as authorized by this chapter. COMPLIANCE CHECKS
shall also mean the use of minors who attempt to purchase tobacco, or tobacco-
related devices for educational, research and training purposes as authorized
by state and federal laws. COMPLIANCE CHECKS may also be conducted by other
units of government for the purpose of enforcing appropriate federal, state or
local laws and regulations relating to tobacco, and tobacco-related devices.

individually for sale. Individually wrapped tobacco shall include, but not be
limited to, single cigarette packs, single bags or cans of loose tobacco in any

customer and the licensee or employee. SELF-SERVICE MERCHANDISING shall not
include vending machines.

smoking tobacco; snuff; snuff flour; cavendish; plug and twist tobacco; fine

any tobacco product that has been approved by the United States Food and Drug
Administration for sale as a tobacco cessation product, as a tobacco dependence
product, or for other medical purposes, and is being marketed and sold solely
for such an approved purpose.

309.01 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
Subd. 1.   Studies conducted by the Minnesota Attorney General, the American
Planning Association and cities such as St. Paul, Minnesota; Indianapolis,
Indiana; Hopkins, Minnesota; Ramsey, Minnesota; Rochester, Minnesota; Phoenix,
Arizona; Los Angeles, California; and Seattle, Washington have studied the
impacts that adult establishments have in those communities. These studies have
concluded that adult establishments have adverse impacts on the surrounding
neighborhoods.
Subd. 2.   These impacts include increased crime rates, lower property values,
increased transiency, neighborhood blight and potential health risks. Based on
these studies and findings, the City Council concludes:
      a.   Adult establishments have adverse secondary impacts of the types set
forth above;
      b.   The adverse impacts caused by adult establishments tend to diminish
if adult establishments are governed by geographic, licensing and health
requirements;
      c.   It is not the intent of the City Council to prohibit adult
establishments from having a reasonable opportunity to locate in the city;
      d.   M.S. §§ 462.357 and 412.221 allow the city to adopt regulations to
promote the public health, safety, morals and general welfare;
      e.   The public health, safety, morals and general welfare will be

revocation of a license granted hereunder. In the event that the City Council
proposes to revoke or suspend the license, the licensee must be notified in
writing of the basis for the proposed revocation or suspension. The Council
will hold a hearing for the purpose of determining whether to revoke or suspend
the license. The hearing must be within 30 days of the date of the notice. The
City Council must determine whether to suspend or revoke a license within 30
days after the close of the hearing or within 60 days of the date of the
notice, whichever is sooner. The Council must notify the licensee of its
decision within that period.
      b.    If the Council determines to suspend or revoke a license, the
suspension or revocation is not effective until 15 days after notification of
the decision to the licensee. If, within that 15 days, the licensee files and
serves an action in state or federal court challenging the Council’s action,
then the suspension or revocation is stayed until the conclusion of the action.
      c.   If the City Council determines not to renew a license, the licensee
may continue its business for 15 days after receiving notice of the non-
renewal. If the licensee files and serves an action in state or federal court

hazards;

      d.   Regular police inspections are necessary to prevent the sale of
these materials to minors;
       e.   Regular inspections by the Fire Marshal are necessary to prevent
improper display, storage and disposal of consumer fireworks;
      f.   Accurate information concerning the addresses and locations of
persons dealing in permitted consumer fireworks in the city is necessary to

regulations and performance standards and to assist the city in responding to

506.03   Residence prohibition; penalties; exceptions
506.04   Renting real property; penalties
506.01 FINDINGS AND INTENT.
Subd. 1.   Findings. Repeat sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical
violence, and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual predators who
present an extreme threat to the public safety. Sexual offenders are extremely
likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses, and most sexual
offenders commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported,
and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of
sexual offender victimization to society at large, while incalculable, clearly
exorbitant.
Subd. 2.   Intent.  It is the intent of this chapter to serve the city's
compelling interest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety and
welfare of the citizens of the city by creating areas around locations where
children regularly congregate wherein certain sexual offenders and sexual
predators are prohibited from establishing temporary or permanent residence.
(Ord. 538, passed 1-23-2017)

   For purposes of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.

601.01 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
Subd. 1.   The city deems it necessary to provide for the regulations of alarm
systems which are designed to signal the presence of a hazard requiring urgent
attention to which public safety personnel are expected to respond, in order to
protect the public health, safety and welfare.
Subd. 2.   The City Council finds that the regulation of alarms is necessary in
order to reduce the increasing frequency of false alarms in the city. The great
number of and increasing frequency of these false alarms requires intensive,
time-consuming efforts by the Public Safety Department and thereby distracts
from and reduces the level of services available to the rest of the community.
This diminishes the ability of the city to promote the general health, welfare
and safety of the community. In consideration for the necessity on the part of
the city to provide numerous public safety services to all segments of the
community, without an undue concentration of public services in one area to
work to the detriment of members of the general public, it is decided that the
alarm systems shall be regulated through the permit process described below.
(1987 Code, § 601.01)
601.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ALARM SYSTEM. An assembly of equipment and devices (or a single device such
as a solid state unit) arranged to signal the presence of a hazard. For the
purposes of this chapter, the alarm, when triggered, must be directly connected
to a central monitoring agency which then notifies the Police and/or Fire
Departments of an emergency to which public safety personnel must respond or
may emit an audible signal which will require urgent attention and to which
public safety personnel are expected to respond.
   ALARM USER. The person, firm, partnership, association, corporation, company
or organization of any kind on whose premises an alarm system is maintained.
ALARM USER shall include persons occupying dwelling units for residential
purposes, but shall not include persons maintaining alarm systems in
automobiles.
   CHIEF. The head of the appropriate Public Safety Department.
   FALSE ALARMS. The activation of an alarm system through mechanical failure,
malfunction, improper installation or the negligence of the owner or lessee of
an alarm system or of his or her employees or agents. It does not include
activation of the alarm by utility company power outages (except as set forth
below) or by climatic conditions such as tornadoes, lightning, earthquakes,
other violent conditions of nature or any other conditions which are clearly
beyond the control of the alarm manufacturer, installer or owner. Effective
August 1, 1987, false alarms resulting from power outages shall be treated as
other false alarms and counted as false alarms for permit purposes.
   PERSON. Any individual, partnership, corporation, association, cooperative
or other entity.
(1987 Code, § 601.02) (Ord. 353, passed 6-14-1999)
601.03 PERMITS AND EXEMPTIONS.
Subd. l.   Permit required. Every alarm user who, during the course of a 12
month period, incurs more than two false police alarms or more than one false
fire alarm shall be required to obtain an alarm user’s permit.
Subd. 2.   Review of permit. The Chief shall review the issuance of all alarm
permits.
Subd. 3.   Process for issuance of permit. Upon receipt and determination of
the third false police alarm report, or the second false fire alarm report at
an address within a 12 month period, the Chief, after review, shall notify the
City Administrator/Clerk who shall then assess the alarm user for an alarm
user’s permit. The assessment invoice shall be sent by certified mail or
delivered and accepted personally. The alarm user must submit the required
permit fee to the City Administrator/Clerk within ten working days after
receipt of the assessment invoice in order to continue to use his or her alarm
system. Any subsequent false police or fire alarms at that address within a
period of 12 months from the date of issuance of the permit shall automatically
revoke the permit and the process must then be repeated and a new permit
obtained; except that after six months or more have elapsed since the issuance
of the permit, a single false police alarm shall not revoke the permit.
Subd. 4.   Duration of permit. All permits, unless otherwise revoked, will
expire 12 months from date of issue.
Subd. 5.   Exemptions. The provisions of this chapter are not applicable to
audible alarms affixed to automobiles.
(1987 Code, § 601.03) (Ord. 353, passed 6-14-1999)
601.04 FALSE ALARMS, REPORTS REQUIRED.
Subd. 1.   False alarm reports. The Chief may, at his or her discretion,
require a false alarm report to be filed by the alarm user with the Public
Safety Department, within a time period to be specified by the Chief. If the
Chief determines that a false alarm has occurred at an address, the alarm user
at that address may submit a written report to the Chief to explain the cause
of the alarm activation. If the Chief determines that the alarm was caused by
conditions beyond the control of the alarm user, the alarm will not be counted
as a false alarm at that address.
Subd. 2.   False alarms excused. False alarms will be excused if they are the
result of an effort or order to upgrade, install, test or maintain an alarm
system and if the Public Safety Department is given notice in advance of the
upgrade, installation, test and maintenance.
(1987 Code, § 601.04) (Ord. 353, passed 6-14-1999)
601.05 PROHIBITED CONDITIONS, SYSTEMS UTILIZING TAPED OR PRERECORDED MESSAGES.
   No person shall install, monitor or use and possess an operative alarm which
utilizes taped or prerecorded messages which deliver a telephone alarm message
to the Police or Fire Departments.
(1987 Code, § 601.05) (Ord. 182, passed 7-14-1986)
 601.06 PERMIT FEES.
Subd. 1.   Permit fees. The fees for alarm users’ permits shall be as provided
in §
1301.02 of this code.
Subd. 2.   Requirement of subsequent permit. After expiration of an alarm
user’s permit, no subsequent permit shall be required until the time as the
alarm user incurs more than two false police alarms or more than one false fire
alarm within a 12 month period.
(1987 Code, § 601.06) (Ord. 182, passed 7-14-1986; Am. Ord. 263, passed 12-14-
1992)
601.07 SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION OF PERMIT.
Subd. 1.   Basis for revocation or suspension. In addition to the automatic
revocation process described in §
601.03 of this chapter, the Public Safety Department may suspend or revoke any
alarm user’s permit issued pursuant to this chapter if the Public Safety
Department finds that any of the following occur:
      a.   That any provision or condition of this chapter has been violated by
an alarm user or his or her agents;
      b.   That an alarm system has actuated an excessive number of police
false alarms or in excess of four in a 12 month period of fire false alarms;
      c.   That the alarm user has knowingly made false statements in or
regarding his or her application for an alarm user’s permit;
      d.   That the alarm user has failed to correct or remove, within a
reasonable period, violations of this chapter after receipt of notice to do so;
      e.   That the continued effectiveness of the alarms user permit
constitutes a substantial threat to the public peace, health, safety or
welfare.
Subd. 2.   Investigation. All alleged violations defined above shall be
investigated by the Public Safety Department. The alarm user shall be given
notice of the proposed revocation or suspension and be provided an opportunity
to informally present evidence to the Chief prior to the final decision on
revocation or suspension. Anyone aggrieved by the decision of the Chief may
appeal that decision to the City Council. The Safety Department may suspend or
revoke any alarm user’s permit issued pursuant to this Chapter if the Public
Safety Department finds that any of the following occur:
      a.   That any provision or condition of this chapter has been violated by
an alarm user or his or her agents;
      b.   That an alarm system has actuated an excessive number of false
alarms;
      c.   That the alarm user has knowingly made false statements in or
regarding his or her application for an alarm user’s permit.
       d.   That the alarm user has failed to correct or remove, within a
reasonable period, violations of this chapter after receipt of notice to do so;
      e.   That the continued effectiveness of the alarm user permit
constitutes a substantial threat to the public peace, health, safety or
welfare.

   Except as otherwise provided in §§
604.03 and
604.04, any money or personal property, other than animals, coming into the
possession of the city in the course of any municipal operation shall be
handled and disposed of in the manner provided in this section.
Subd. 1.   Custody of unclaimed personalty. Any money or personal property
coming into the possession of any city officer, agent or employee, or member of
any city department shall, within 24 hours, be turned over to the responsible
authority by the officer, agent or employee or member of the city department.
The responsible authority shall make provisions for receiving and safekeeping
of property and money delivered to him or her and coming into his or her
possession in the course of municipal operations. A receipt shall be issued to
the person delivering the property or money to the city. The property shall be
stored in a safe place and the money deposited with the City Treasurer in a
special account for a period of three months unless claimed by the lawful
owner.
Subd. 2.   Claims by owners. During the three month period, the responsible
authority shall make a search to locate the lawful owner. He or she may deliver
the property or order the money paid to the owner thereof after receiving
satisfactory proof of ownership and after providing ten days notice by mail to
the person, other than the police officer or city employee, who delivered the
property and to the other person who has asserted a claim of ownership. The
Administrator shall not issue any order for the disbursement of the money
without the written order of the responsible authority. If ownership cannot be
determined to his or her satisfaction, the responsible authority may refuse to
deliver the property or order the payment of the money to anyone until ordered
to do so by a court of competent jurisdiction.
Subd. 3.   Claim by finder. If the lawful owner does not claim the property or
money during this three month period, the responsible authority may deliver the

previously asserted in writing a claim to the property or money.
Subd. 4.   Disposition of unclaimed money. If any money is not claimed by the

of any nonprofit, charitable corporation, organization or foundation for a
charitable purpose, upon approval of such a method of appropriation by the City
Council.
      b.   Public sale. If the volume and value of unclaimed property is
insufficient, in the opinion of both the Chief of Police and the City
Administrator/Clerk, to justify a public auction, the unclaimed property may be
sold by public sale. The responsible authority shall follow the procedure in
paragraph a(1) above except that sale will be at a public sale to the person
with the first reasonable offer.
      c.   Proceeds of sale. The responsible authority shall remit the proceeds
of the auction/sale to the City Treasurer for deposit in the General Fund.

Administrator/Clerk directs.

auction or sale shall, upon application to the City Administrator/Clerk within
six months from the date of sale and upon delivery of satisfactory proof of
ownership, be paid the sale price from the General Fund, less the reasonable
expenses incurred in the movement, storage, care and sale of the property.

612.04   Exceptions
Cross-reference:
   For regulation of the consumption, purchase and possession of alcohol by
persons under the age of 21 years, see
Ch. 402
612.01 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
Subd. 1.   The City Council finds that:
      a.   Consumption of alcohol by persons under the age of 21 is harmful to
those persons and constitutes a potential threat to public health from injuries
related to alcohol consumption, such as alcohol overdose or alcohol-related
traffic collisions.
      b.   Alcohol is also an addictive drug which, if used irresponsibly,
could have drastic effects on those who use it as well as those who are
affected by the actions of an irresponsible user.
      c.   As a result, gatherings held on private or public property where
alcohol is possessed or consumed by persons under the age of 21 should be
prevented as much as possible.
      d.   Gatherings involving underage possession and consumption often occur
outside the presence of parents or other responsible adults. However, there are
times when a parent or other adult is present and condones the activity, and in
some circumstances provides the alcohol.
      e.   Although furnishing alcohol to an underage person is a crime, it is
difficult to prove, and an ordinance is necessary to help further combat
underage consumption.
      f.   A deterrent effect will be created by holding a person criminally
responsible for hosting a gathering where underage possession or consumption
occurs.
Subd. 2.   The purpose of this chapter is to discourage underage possession and
consumption of alcohol, even if done within the confines of a private
residence, and to hold persons criminally responsible who host gatherings where
persons under 21 years of age possess or consume alcohol, regardless of whether
the person hosting the gathering supplied the alcohol or was present.
Subd. 3.   The City Council intends that this chapter should not target parents
who may have alcoholic beverages on their premises, but who have issued a
standing order that alcohol is not to be consumed by underage persons on those
premises.
(Ord. 498, passed 8-27-2012)
612.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For purposes of this chapter, the following terms have the meanings given:

(Ord. 498, passed 8-27-2012)

premises if:
      a.   The person knows that alcohol or alcoholic beverages will be
present; and
      b.   The person knows that an underage person will attend, or is likely
to attend; and
      c.   The person fails to take reasonable steps to prevent the possession
or consumption of alcoholic beverages by an underage person; and
      d.   An underage person consumes an alcoholic beverage, or possesses an
alcoholic beverage with the intent to consume it, at the gathering.
Subd. 2.   Examples of reasonable steps include:
      a.   Directing, on a one-time basis or as a standing order, that no
consumption of alcohol and alcoholic beverages is allowed; or

      c.   Checking identification of attendees to determine age; or
      d.   Supervising the activities of underage persons at the gathering,

person does not know that a gathering will occur, or does not know that
alcoholic beverages will be present, or does not know that an underage person
will be or is likely to be present. However, if a person has the knowledge
specified in subdivision 1 above, a person who hosts a gathering does not have
to be present at the gathering to be criminally responsible.
Subd. 4.   A person is criminally responsible for violating Subd. 1. above if
the person intentionally aids, advises, hires, counsels or conspires with or
otherwise procures another to commit the prohibited act.

occupants, obstructs and interferes with the free use of public rights-of-way,
and has as its object the harassment of the dwelling occupants. The City
Council further finds that, without resorting to targeted residential
picketing, ample opportunities otherwise exist for those desiring to exercise
constitutionally-protected freedom of speech and expression.

within 100 feet of the property boundary, without the consent of the dwelling’s
occupants;
      b.   Marching, standing, patrolling or other similar activities by one or
more persons directed at a particular residential dwelling in a manner that
adversely affects the safety, security, or privacy of an occupant of the
dwelling;
      c.   Marching, standing, patrolling or other similar activities by one or
more persons which prevents or hinders an occupant of a residential dwelling
from gaining access to or exiting from the property on which the residential
dwelling is located; or
      d.   Marching, standing, patrolling or other similar activities by one or
more persons focused on, in front of or about a particular residential dwelling
without the consent of the dwelling’s occupants.

provided by the Minnesota Commissioner of Public Safety. The animal control
authority may charge the registrant a reasonable fee to cover its
administrative costs and the cost of the warning symbol.
      d.   Dangerous animal designation review. Beginning six months after an
animal is declared dangerous, an owner may request annually that the
designating animal control authority review the designation. The owner must
provide evidence that the animal's behavior has changed due to age, neutering,
environment, completion of obedience training that includes modification of
aggressive behavior, or other factors. If the animal control authority finds
sufficient evidence that the animal's behavior has changed, the authority may

animal but that will not cause injury to the animal or interfere with its
vision or respiration.
      b.   The owner of a dangerous animal must have a microchip implanted in
the animal for identification, and the name of the microchip manufacturer and
identification number of the microchip must be provided to the animal control
authority. If the microchip is not implanted by the owner, it may be implanted
by the animal control authority. In either case, all costs related to purchase
and implantation of the microchip must be borne by the animal's owner. It is a
misdemeanor to remove a microchip from a dangerous or potentially dangerous
animal.
      c.   An owner of a dangerous animal must renew the registration of the

and must, if requested by the animal control authority, execute an affidavit
under oath setting forth either the circumstances of the animal's death and
disposition or the complete name, address, and telephone number of the person
to whom the animal has been transferred or the address where the animal has
been relocated.

            (a)   The owner of any animal declared dangerous has the right to a
hearing concerning the dangerous dog or dangerous animal declaration, and if
applicable, prior potentially dangerous dog or potentially dangerous animal
declarations for the animal. The animal owner must make the request in writing,
on a form provided by the SLMPD, within 14 days of receiving notice of the
declaration. Failure to do so within 14 days of the date of receiving the
notice will terminate the owner's right to a hearing under this section.
            (b)   Any hearing must be held within 14 days of the request to
determine the validity of the declaration. The hearing officer must be an
impartial person retained by the city or by the SLMPD to conduct the hearing.
In the event that the declaration is upheld by the hearing officer, actual
expenses of the hearing, up to a maximum of $1,000, will be the responsibility
of the animal's owner. The hearing officer shall issue a decision on the matter
within ten days after the hearing. The decision must be delivered to the
animal's owner by hand delivery or registered mail as soon as practical and a
copy must be provided to the animal control authority.
         (2)   Requirements during appeals process. While awaiting final
disposition of an appeal of a dangerous animal declaration, the owner of the
animal shall keep the animal, while on the owner's property, in a proper
enclosure. If the animal is outside the proper enclosure, it must be muzzled
and restrained by a substantial chain or leash and under the physical restraint
of a responsible person. The muzzle must be made in a manner that will prevent
the animal from biting any person or animal but that will not cause injury to
the animal or interfere with its vision or respiration. A person who transfers
ownership of a dangerous dog or dangerous animal must notify the new owner that
the animal control authority has identified the animal as dangerous. The
current owner must also notify the animal control authority in writing of the
transfer of ownership and provide the animal control authority with the new
owner's name, address, and telephone number.
Subd. 6.   Confiscation.
      a.   Seizure. The animal control authority having jurisdiction shall
immediately seize any dangerous animal if:
         (1)   After 14 days after the owner has notice that the animal is
dangerous, the animal is not validly registered under this section;
         (2)   After 14 days after the owner has notice that the animal is
dangerous, the owner does not secure the proper liability insurance or surety
coverage as required under this section;
         (3)   The animal is not maintained in the proper enclosure;
         (4)   The animal is outside the proper enclosure and not under
physical restraint of a responsible person as required in the previous section;
         (5)   The animal is not sterilized within 30 days; or
         (6)   If an owner of an animal is convicted of a crime for which the
animal was originally seized, the court may order that the animal be
confiscated and may be disposed of in a manner permitted by law, and that the
owner pay the costs incurred in confiscating, confining, and destroying the
animal.
      b.   Animals reclaimed. A dangerous animal seized under division a.(1)
may be reclaimed by the owner of the animal upon payment of impounding and
boarding fees, and presenting proof to the animal control authority that the
requirements of the previous section will be met. An animal not reclaimed under
this subdivision within seven days may be surrendered to the Animal Humane
Society or humanely euthanized and the owner is liable to the animal control
authority for costs incurred in confining and disposing of the animal.
Subd. 7.   Destruction of animals in certain circumstances.
      a.   Circumstances. An animal may be destroyed in a proper and humane
manner by the animal control authority if the animal:
         (1)   Inflicted substantial or great bodily harm on a human on public
or private property without provocation;
         (2)   Inflicted multiple bites on a human on public or private
property without provocation;
         (3)   Bit multiple human victims on public or private property in the

a threat to native plant and animal life by excessive foraging which disturbs
natural ecological balances; and poses a threat to the quality of life by deer-
related damage to landscaping and vegetable gardens. This chapter is intended
to reduce these threats by restricting supplemental feeding of deer, which
results in unnatural concentrations of deer and can affect the normal movement
of deer within the community. It is not the intent of this chapter to regulate
the recreational feeding of birds.

intentionally result in deer feeding, unless such items are screened or
protected in a manner that prevents deer from feeding on them. Living fruit
trees and other live vegetation shall not be considered as supplemental deer
feeding.

705.08 FORFEITURE OF ANIMAL OWNERSHIP RIGHTS.
Subd. 1.   Forfeiture of rights. The ownership rights of a person owning the
following types of animals may be forfeited to the city pursuant to the
procedure in this section:
      a.   A public nuisance animal;
      b.   A wild animal; and
      c.   A maltreated animal.
         In addition, the ownership rights with respect to other animals owned
by the same owner may be forfeited if he or she has demonstrated an inability
or unwillingness to properly care for or control such animals, in order to
prevent any of them from becoming public nuisance or maltreated animals.
Subd. 2.   Notice. Authorized city personnel must notify the owner or apparent
owner of the animal sought to be forfeited that the city intends to forfeit his
or her ownership rights. The notice must be served on the owner personally or
by registered mail. The notice must be in writing and state the reasons why
forfeiture is sought, including a summary of applicable incidents. The notice
must state that the owner has a right, within ten days after receiving the
notice, to request a hearing before a Hearing Officer appointed under City Code
Chapter 104. The request for a hearing must be in writing and must state the
reason or reasons for the request. A failure to request the hearing will
constitute an admission of the facts alleged in the notice, and the animal will
be deemed forfeited to the city.
Subd. 3.   Findings of fact. If the owner requests a hearing, the hearing will
be held in accordance with City Code
Chapter 104. The Hearing Officer must make written findings of fact and reach a
conclusion whether the allegations are true and whether the animal will be
forfeited to the city. The findings and conclusions must be made within ten
working days after the hearing and must be served on the owner personally or by
registered mail. The decision of the Hearing Officer is final, but may be
appealed by a writ of certiorari to the District Court.
Subd. 4.   Animal confinement. After receiving the forfeiture notice and during
the forfeiture proceedings, the owner must keep the subject animal confined
within his or her home or within a secure, covered enclosure. If the owner
fails to do so, or if there is an immediate threat to public health or safety
or to the animal's health or safety, authorized city personnel may immediately
impound the animal and keep it at the impound facility, at the owner's expense,
until a forfeiture determination has been made.
Subd. 5.   Forfeiture. If the animal is deemed or ordered forfeited, the owner
must immediately give the animal to authorized city personnel, and a failure or
refusal to do so is a misdemeanor. Authorized city personnel may use reasonable
force and go onto private property to take the animal into custody.
Subd. 6.   Disposition of forfeited animal. Authorized city personnel will
determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether forfeited animals are destroyed or
given to new owners who will adequately care for and control them.

Subd. 1.   Findings and purpose. To provide for the health, safety and welfare
of its citizens, and to ensure the integrity of its streets and the appropriate
use of the rights-of-way, the city strives to keep its rights-of-way in a state
of good repair and free from unnecessary encumbrances. Accordingly, the city
hereby enacts this chapter of this code relating to right-of-way permits and
administration. This chapter imposes reasonable regulation on the placement and
maintenance of facilities and equipment currently within its rights-of-way or
to be placed therein at some future time. It is intended to complement the
regulatory roles of state and federal agencies. Under this chapter, persons
excavating and obstructing the rights-of-way will bear financial responsibility
for their work. Finally, this chapter provides for recovery of out-of-pocket
and projected costs from persons using the public rights-of-way. This chapter
shall be interpreted consistently with 1997 Session Laws, Chapter 123,
substantially codified in M.S. §§ 237.16, 237.162, 237.163, 237.79, 237.81, and
238.086 (the "Act") and 2017 Session Laws, Chapter 94 amending the Act, and the
other laws governing applicable rights of the city and users of the right-of-
way. This chapter shall also be interpreted consistent with Minn. Rules
7819.0050 - 7819.9950 where possible. To the extent any provision of this
chapter cannot be interpreted consistently with the Minnesota Rules, that
interpretation most consistent with the Act and other applicable statutory and
case law is intended. It is the purpose of this section to provide for lawful
incidental private use of publicly-owned rights-of-way not inconsistent with
public use. This chapter shall not be interpreted to limit the regulatory and
police powers of the city to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to
protect the health, safety and welfare of the public.
Subd. 2.   Election to manage the public rights-of-way. Pursuant to the
authority granted to the city under state and federal statutory, administrative
and common law, the city hereby elects, pursuant M.S. § 237.163 Subd. 2(b), to
manage rights-of-way within its jurisdiction.

901.03 ENCROACHMENTS.
Subd. 1.   Purpose. The public welfare requires that the public rights-of-way
within the city, including highways, roads, streets and alleys, be reserved for
public purposes. Public use of the full width of the rights-of-way is necessary
to public safety and the proper and efficient maintenance of the rights-of-way.
However, it is recognized that limited private use or encroachment onto the
rights-of-way is not necessarily inconsistent with public use. It is the
purpose of this section to provide for lawful incidental private use of
publicly-owned rights-of-way not inconsistent with public use.
Subd. 2.   Permit to encroach. 
      a.   Permit required. The right to use publicly-owned rights-of-way
within the city for any private use or purpose other than the primary purpose
of public travel, whether the use constitutes a substantial or incidental use,
may be acquired only through permit granted pursuant to this section.
      b.   Application for permit. Any person may apply to the City Council for
a permit to keep or maintain private property within a publicly-owned right-of-
way. The application shall be in writing and must describe with specificity the
private property and right-of-way involved and the nature and extent of the
requested encroachment.
      c.   Issuance of permit; conditions. The City Council may grant the
permit if it is determined that the use applied for is incidental and not
inconsistent with safe and efficient public use. However, no permit will be
issued until the applicant has agreed in writing to waive any right to recover
from the city for damage occurring to the property located within the right-of-
way which may result from the performance of the city or its agents of its
public duties as required by law.
      d.   Special permit for underground sprinkler systems. The City Engineer
may approve an application for a special permit for the installation of an
underground sprinkler system within the public right-of-way, providing the
installation is not inconsistent with the public use of the right-of-way. In
the application, in addition to the information required by subsection b.
above, the applicant shall provide a legal description of the private property

disruptions or damage to the right-of-way;
         (2)   The traffic volume carried by the right-of-way; the character of
the neighborhood surrounding the right-of-way;
         (3)   The pre-excavation condition of the right-of-way; the remaining
life-expectancy of the right-of-way affected by the excavation;
         (4)   Whether the relative cost of the method of restoration to the
permit holder is in reasonable balance with the prevention of an accelerated
depreciation of the right-of-way that would otherwise result from the
excavation, disturbance or damage to the right-of-way; and
         (5)   The likelihood that the particular method of restoration would
be effective in slowing the depreciation of the right-of-way that would
otherwise take place.
      b.   The excavation, backfilling, patching and restoration, and all other
work performed in the right-of-way shall be done in conformance with Minn.
Rules 7819.1100 and 7819.5000 and other applicable local requirements, in so
far as they are not inconsistent with the M.S. §§ 237.162 and 237.163.
Installation of service laterals shall be performed in accordance with Minn.
Rules Chapter 7560 and this code. Service lateral installation is further
subject to those requirements and conditions set forth by the city in the
applicable permits and/or agreements referenced in § 901.18, Subd. 2 of this
code.
Subd. 4.   Duty to correct defects. The permittee shall correct defects in
patching or restoration performed by permittee or its agents. The permittee
shall correct all restoration work to the extent necessary, using the method
required by the city. Said work shall be completed within seven calendar days
of the notice being sent by the city, not including days during which work
cannot be done because of circumstances constituting force majeure or days when
work is prohibited as unseasonable or unreasonable.
Subd. 5.   Failure to restore. If the permittee fails to restore the right-of-
way in the manner and to the condition required by the city, or fails to
satisfactorily complete all restoration required by the city, the city at its
option may do such work or hire a contractor to complete the work. Any
restoration done in this manner will include an administrative charge to cover
the city's cost, but said charge will in no event be less than $100 and the
city will withhold permits for future work until reimbursement is made by the
permittee. In that event the permittee shall pay to the city, within 30 days of
billing, the cost of restoring the right-of-way. If permittee fails to pay as
required, the city may exercise its rights under the letter of credit, cash
deposit, or other financial guarantee. Failure to restore shall also be
considered a violation of the registration requirements and may subject
permittee to removal from city registration.
Subd. 6.   Guarantees. The permit holder shall guarantee its work and shall
maintain it for 24 months following its completion. During this 24 month period
it shall, upon notification from the City Engineer, promptly correct all
restoration work to the extent necessary, using the method required by the City
Engineer.
(Ord. 552, passed - -2018)
901.12 PERMIT LIMITATIONS.
   Permits issued pursuant to this section are valid only for the area of the
right-of-way specified in the application and the permit and only for the dates
so specified. No work shall be extended beyond the permitted area or dates
without a new permit being procured therefore, provided the City Engineer may
extend the completion date of the work in accordance with §
901.11, Subd. 1 of this chapter.

the denial is necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare or when
necessary to protect the right-of-way and its current use.
Subd. 2.   Procedural requirements. The denial or revocation of a permit must
be made in writing and must document the basis for the denial. The city must
notify the applicant or right-of-way user in writing within three business days

receipt of the notice of denial, no additional application fee shall be
imposed. The city must approve or deny the resubmitted application within 30
days after submission.
(Ord. 552, passed --2018)
901.14 EMERGENCY WORK.
Subd. 1.   Emergency situations. Each registrant shall immediately notify the
director of any event regarding its facilities that it considers to be an
emergency. Excavators' notification to Gopher State One Call regarding an
emergency situation does not fulfill this requirement. Within two business days
after the occurrence of the emergency, the registrant shall apply for the
necessary permits, pay the fees associated therewith, and fulfill the rest of
the requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with this chapter
for the actions it took in response to the emergency. If the City Engineer
becomes aware of an emergency, the City Engineer shall attempt to contact the
local representative of each registrant affected, or potentially affected, by
the emergency. In any event, the City Engineer may take whatever action deemed
necessary to respond to the emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the
registrant whose facilities or equipment occasioned the emergency.
Subd. 2.   Non-emergency situations. Except in an emergency, any person who,
without first having obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or excavates a
right-of-way must subsequently obtain a permit and, as a penalty, pay double
the normal fee for said permit, pay double all the other fees required by the
city code, deposit with the city the fees necessary to correct any damage to
the right-of-way, and comply with all of the requirements of this chapter.
(Ord. 552, passed - -2018)
901.15 REVOCATION OF PERMITS.
Subd. 1.   Substantial breach. The city reserves its right, as provided herein,
to revoke any right-of-way permit without a fee refund, if there is a
substantial breach of the terms and conditions of any statute, ordinance, rule
or regulation, or any material condition of the permit. A substantial breach by
permittee shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following:
      a.   The violation of any material provision of the right-of-way permit;
      b.   An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the right-
of-way permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit
upon the city or its citizens. Any material misrepresentation of fact in the
application for a right-of-way permit;
      c.   The failure to complete the work in a timely manner, unless a permit
extension is obtained or unless the failure to complete work is due to reasons
beyond the permittee's control; or
      d.   The failure to correct, in a timely manner, work that does not
conform to a condition indicated on an order issued pursuant to §
901.21 of this chapter.
Subd. 2.   Written notice of breach. If the city determines that the permittee
has committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any statute,
ordinance, rule, regulation, or any condition of the permit, the city shall
make a written demand upon the permittee to remedy such violation. The demand
shall state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the
permit. A substantial breach, as stated above, will allow the city, at its
discretion, to place additional or revised conditions on the permit to mitigate
or remedy the breach.
Subd. 3.   Response to notice of breach. Within 48 hours of the city sending
notification of the breach, permittee shall provide the city with a plan,
acceptable to the city, which will cure the breach. Permittee's failure to so
contact the city, or permittee's failure to timely submit an acceptable plan,
or permittee's failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be
cause for immediate revocation of the permit.
Subd. 4.   Reimbursement of city costs. If a permit is revoked, the permittee
shall also reimburse the city for the city's reasonable costs, including, but
not limited to, restoration costs and the costs of collection and reasonable
attorneys' fees incurred in connection with such revocation.
(Ord. 552, passed - -2018)
901.16 APPEAL.
Subd. 1.   Filing of appeal. Any person aggrieved by the denial of a permit
application, the denial of a registration, the revocation of a permit, or the
application of the fee imposed by the City of Shorewood's Master Fee Schedule,
may appeal to the Council by filing a written notice of appeal with the Clerk.
Said notice must be filed with 20 days of the action causing the appeal.
Subd. 2.   Notice of hearing. The Council shall hear the appeal not later than
30 days after the date the appeal is filed. Notice of the date, time, place,

901.17 MAPPING.
Subd. 1.   Information required. Each registrant and permittee, upon request by
the city, shall provide mapping information required by the city in accordance
with Minn. Rules 7819.4000 and 7819.4100. Following completion of any work
pursuant to a permit, and upon city request, the permittee shall provide the
City Engineer accurate maps and drawings certifying the "as-built" location of
all equipment installed, owned and maintained by the permittee. Such maps and
drawings shall include the horizontal and vertical location of all facilities
and equipment and shall be provided consistent with the city's mapping system.
Failure to provide maps and drawings pursuant to this subsection shall be
grounds for revoking the permit holder's registration.
Subd. 2.   Service laterals. All permits issued for the installation or repair
of service laterals, other than minor repairs as defined in Minn. Rules
7560.0150, subp. 2, shall require the permittee's use of appropriate means of
establishing the horizontal locations of installed service laterals. Permittees
or their subcontractors shall submit to the director evidence satisfactory to
the director of the installed service lateral locations. Compliance with this
subdivision 2 and with applicable Gopher State One Call law and Minn. Rules
governing service laterals installed after December 31, 2005, shall be a
condition of any city approval necessary for payments to contractors working on
a public improvement project including those under M.S. Chapter 429, and city
approval of performance under development agreements, or other subdivision or
site plan approval under M.S. Chapter 462. The director shall reasonably
determine the appropriate method of providing such information to the city.
Failure to provide prompt and accurate information on the service laterals
installed may result in the revocation of the permit issued for the work or for
future permits to the offending permittee or its subcontractors.
(Ord. 552, passed - -2018)
901.18 LOCATION OF FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT.
Subd. 1.   Undergrounding by telecommunications right-of-way users. Any new
construction and the installation of new equipment and replacement of old
equipment of telecommunication right-of-way users shall be underground or
contained within buildings or other structures in conformity with applicable
codes. Provided, telecommunications right-of-way users may attach equipment and
facilities to existing poles and structures maintained by a service or utility
service. New and improved telecommunications facilities shall be made available
for service to abutting parcels on the same terms and conditions available to
others in the same service area.
Subd. 2.   Corridors. The City Engineer may assign specific corridors within
the right-of-way, or any particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for
each type of equipment that is or, pursuant to current technology, the City
Engineer expects will someday be located within the right-of-way. All permits
issued by the City Engineer involving the installation or replacement of
equipment shall designate the proper corridor for the equipment at issue.
Subd. 3.   Limitation of space. To protect health and safety, the City Engineer
shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional
equipment within the right-of-way if there is insufficient space to accommodate
all of the requests of registrants or persons to occupy and use the right-of-
way. In making such decisions, the City Engineer shall strive to the extent
possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the right-of-way,
but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the public interest, the
public's needs for the particular utility service, the condition of the right-
of-way, the time of year with respect to essential utilities, the protection of
existing equipment in the right-of-way, and future city plans for public
improvements and development projects which have been determined to be in the
public interest.
(Ord. 552, passed - -2018)
901.19 UNDERGROUNDING AND RELOCATION OF FACILITIES.
Subd. 1.   Placement, location, and relocation of facilities must comply with
the code, with other applicable law, and with Minn. Rules 7819.3100, 7819.5000,
7819.5100, to the extent the rules do not limit authority otherwise available
to cities.
      a.   Relocation notification procedure. The city shall notify the utility
owner at least 90 days in advance of the need to relocate existing facilities
so the owner can determine if relocation or replacement is required and plan
for any required work. The city shall provide a second notification to the
owner one month before the owner needs to begin the relocation. The utility
owner shall begin relocation of the facilities within one month of the second
notification. To the extent technically feasible, all utilities shall be
relocated within one month or in a time frame determined by the city. The city
may allow a different schedule if it does not interfere with the city's
project. The utility owner shall diligently work to relocate the facilities
within the above schedule. The registrant shall restore any rights-of-way to
the condition it was prior to removal and relocation.
      b.   Delay to city project. The city shall notify the utility owner if
the owner's progress will not meet the relocation schedule. If the owner fails
to meet the relocation schedule due to circumstances within its control, the
city may charge the utility owner for all costs incurred and requested by a
contractor working for the city who is delayed because the relocation is not
completed in the scheduled time frame and for all costs incurred by the city
due to the delay.
      c.   Delay penalties. Delay penalties under this section shall be set
time to time by the City Council.
      d.   For relocations or requests made by the city that are matters of
convenience, and where the city shall be charged for such costs, the utility
owner shall provide the city a detailed estimate of all relocation costs,
including, but not limited to: quantities of all materials and supplies, cost
for each quantity, labor costs, other. The city shall have the right to
independently verify the cost to determine reasonableness.
Subd. 2.   Undergrounding of relocated telecommunications facilities. A
telecommunications right-of-way user shall relocate all above ground facilities
and equipment to underground locations at its own cost and expense at the
city's request when the city requires the relocation of all telecommunications
facilities and equipment to underground locations, or structures or poles to
which the registrant's facilities or equipment is attached are abandoned or
removed by the owner of such structures or poles, or as ordered removed by the
city.
Subd. 3.   Nuisance. One year after the passage of this chapter, any facilities
found in a right-of-way that have not been registered shall be deemed to be a
nuisance. The city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in
equity, including, but not limited to, abating the nuisance or taking
possession of the facilities and restoring the right-of-way to a useable
condition.
Subd. 4.   Limitation of space. To protect health, safety and welfare, or when
necessary to protect the right-of-way and its current use, the city shall have
the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional facilities
within the right-of-way. In making such decisions, the city shall strive to the
extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the right-
of-way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the public interest,
the public's needs for the particular utility service, the condition of the
right-of-way, the time of year with respect to essential utilities, the
protection of existing facilities in the right-of-way, and future city plans
for public improvements and development projects which have been determined to
be in the public interest.
Subd. 5.   Fee waiver. When relocation occurs in conjunction with a public
improvement project, the City Engineer shall have discretion to waive all or a
portion of the fees associated with the work that is occurring within the
boundaries of the public improvement project.

901.20 PRE-EXCAVATION FACILITIES LOCATION.
   In addition to complying with the requirements of M.S. §§ 216D.01-.09 ("One
Call Excavation Notice System") before the start date of any right-of-way
excavation, each registrant who has facilities or equipment in the area to be
excavated shall mark the horizontal and vertical placement of all said
facilities. Any registrant whose facilities are less than 20 inches below a
concrete or asphalt surface shall notify and work closely with the excavation
contractor to establish the exact location of its facilities and the best
procedure for excavation.
(Ord. 552, passed - -2018)

901.22 AUTHORITY OF DIRECTOR OR CITY ENGINEER.
Subd. 1.   At the time of inspection, the director or City Engineer may order
the immediate cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the life,
health, safety or well-being of the public.
Subd. 2.   The director or City Engineer may issue an order to the permittee
for any work that does not conform to the terms of the permit or other
applicable standards, conditions, or codes. The order shall state that failure
to correct the violation will be cause for revocation of the permit. Within ten
days after issuance of the order, the permittee shall present proof to the
director that the violation has been corrected. If such proof has not been
presented within the required time, the director may revoke the permit pursuant
to §
901.15 of this chapter.
(Ord. 552, passed - -2018)
901.23 RIGHT-OF-WAY VACATION.
Subd. 1.   Reservation of right. If the city vacates a right-of-way that
contains the facilities of a registrant, the registrant's rights in the vacated
right-of-way are governed by Minn. Rules 7819.3200.
Subd. 2.   Relocation of equipment. If the vacation requires the relocation of
registrant facilities and equipment, then the following shall apply:
      a.   If the vacation proceedings are initiated by the registrant, the
registrant must pay the relocation costs;
      b.   If the vacation proceedings are initiated by the city, the
registrant must pay the relocation costs unless otherwise agreed to by the city
and the registrant; or

pursuant to M.S. § 645.11.
(Ord. 552, passed - -2018)
901.24 ABANDONED AND UNUSABLE EQUIPMENT.
Subd. 1.   Discontinued operations. A registrant who has determined to
discontinue its operations in the city must either:
      a.   Provide information satisfactory to the City Engineer that the
registrant's obligations for its equipment in the right-of-way under this
section have been lawfully assumed by another registrant; or
      b.   Submit to the City Engineer an action plan for the removal or
abandonment of equipment and facilities. The City Engineer shall require
removal of such facilities and equipment if the City Engineer determines such
removal is necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare. The City
Engineer may require the registrant to post a construction performance
guarantee in an amount sufficient to reimburse the city for reasonably
anticipated costs to be incurred in removing the facilities and equipment.
Subd. 2.   Abandoned facilities and equipment. Facilities and equipment of a
registrant located on the surface of or above a right-of-way or on public
grounds which remains unused shall be deemed to be abandoned. Such abandoned
equipment is deemed to be a nuisance. The city may exercise any remedies or
rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to:
      a.   Abating the nuisance; or
      b.   Requiring removal of the equipment or facilities by the registrant,
or the registrant's successor in interest. Appeals under this section shall
follow the procedures in §

901.25 INDEMNIFICATION AND LIABILITY.
   By registering with the city, or by accepting a permit under this chapter, a
registrant or permittee agrees to defend and indemnify the city in accordance
with the provisions of Minn. Rules 7819.1250.
Subd. 1.   Limitation of liability. By reason of the acceptance of a
registration or the grant of a right-of-way permit, the city does not assume
any liability for injuries to persons, damage to property, or loss of service
claims by parties other than the registrant or the city, or for claims or
penalties of any sort resulting from the installation, presence, maintenance,
or operation of equipment by registrants or activities of registrants.
Subd. 2.   Indemnification. By registering with the City Engineer, a registrant
agrees, or by accepting a permit under this section, a permit-holder is
required, to defend, indemnify, and hold the city whole and harmless from all
costs, liabilities, and claims for damages of any kind arising out of the
construction, presence, installation, maintenance, repair or operation of its
equipment, or out of any activity undertaken in or near a right-of-way, whether
or not any act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed, or prohibited
by a right-of-way permit. It further agrees that it will not bring, nor cause
to be brought, any action, suit or other proceeding claiming damages, or
seeking any other relief against the city for any claim nor for any award
arising out of the presence, installation, maintenance or operation of its
equipment, or any activity undertaken in or near a right-of-way, whether or not
the act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed or prohibited by a
right-of-way permit. The foregoing does not indemnify the city for its own
negligence except for claims arising out of or alleging the city's negligence
where such negligence arises out of or is primarily related to the presence,
installation, construction, operation, maintenance or repair of said equipment
by the registrant or on the registrant's behalf, including but not limited to,
the issuance of permits and inspection of plans or work. This section is not,
as to third parties, a waiver of any defense or immunity otherwise available to
the registrant or to the city; and the registrant, in defending any action on
behalf of the city, shall be entitled to assert in any action every defense or
immunity that the city could assert in its own behalf.

this chapter and the franchise agreement, the more restrictive provision shall
govern.
(Ord. 552, passed - -2018)
901.27 SUPPLEMENTARY APPLICATIONS.
Subd. 1.   Limitation on area. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the area
of the right-of-way specified in the permit. No permittee may do any work
outside the area specified in the permit, except as provided herein. Any
permittee which determines that an area greater than that specified in the
permit must be obstructed or excavated must before working in that greater area
make application for a permit extension and pay any additional fees required
thereby, and be granted a new permit or permit extension.
Subd. 2.   Limitation on dates. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the
dates specified in the permit. No permittee may begin its work before the

date. If a permittee does not finish the work by the permit end date, it must
apply for a new permit for the additional time it needs, and receive the new
permit or an extension of the old permit before working after the end date of
the previous permit. This supplementary application must be submitted before
the permit end date.
(Ord. 552, passed - -2018)
901.28 OTHER OBLIGATIONS.
Subd. 1.   Compliance with other laws. Obtaining a right-of-way permit does not
relieve permittee of its duty to obtain all other necessary permits, licenses,
and authority and to pay all fees required by the city or other applicable
rule, law or regulation. A permittee shall comply with all requirements of
local, state and federal laws, including but not limited to M.S. §§ 216D.01-.09
(Gopher One Call Excavation Notice System) and Minn. Rules Chapters 7560 and
7819. A permittee shall perform all work in conformance with all applicable
codes and established rules and regulations, and is responsible for all work
done in the right-of-way pursuant to its permit, regardless of who does the
work.
Subd. 2.   Prohibited work. Except in an emergency, and with the approval of
the city, no right-of-way obstruction or excavation may be done when the city
determines it is seasonally prohibited or when the city determines that the
conditions are unreasonable for such work.
Subd. 3.   Interference with right-of-way. A permittee shall not so obstruct a
right-of-way that the natural free and clear passage of water through the
gutters or other waterways shall be interfered with. Private vehicles of those
doing work in the right-of-way may not be parked within or next to a permit
area, unless parked in conformance with city parking regulations. The loading
or unloading of trucks must be done solely within the defined permit area
unless specifically authorized by the permit.
Subd. 4.   Trenchless excavation. As a condition of all applicable permits,
permittees employing trenchless excavation methods, including but not limited
to Horizontal Directional Drilling, shall follow all requirements set forth in
M.S. Chapter 216D and Minn. Rules Chapter 7560, and shall require potholing or
open cutting over existing underground utilities before excavating. If any
trenchless excavation crosses or intersects with a city sanitary sewer main or
lateral, storm sewer main or lateral, catch basin, manhole or any associated
structure, a post excavation televised inspection in accordance with the city's
current standard specifications shall be made of all such crossings within 30
days of said work to ensure that the city utilities were not damaged or
impacted by the trenchless excavation. Televised results shall be provided in a
format acceptable to the city, and sent to the city within 30 days of the
televising.
(Ord. 552, passed - -2018)
901.29 SEVERABILITY.
   If any portion of this chapter is for any reason held invalid by any court
of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed separate, distinct, and
independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the
remaining portions thereof. Nothing in this chapter precludes the city from
requiring a franchise agreement with the applicant, as allowed by law, in
addition to the requirements set forth herein.
(Ord. 552, passed - -2018)
901.30 VIOLATION.
   Any person who shall violate any of the provisions of this chapter shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor, unless otherwise specified.

903.18 WATER IMPROVEMENT PROCESS.
Subd. 1.   Scope and purpose. The purpose of this subsection is to supplement
the requirements of State law, to provide for the methods to initiate a water
improvement, and to authorize the formulation of policies relating to
allocating the costs for the public improvements.
Subd. 2.   Special assessment procedure.
      a.   Initiating the improvement. Improvement proceedings may be initiated
in any one of the following four ways:
         (1)   One hundred percent petition.  By a petition signed by 100% of
the owners of real property abutting any street named as the location of the
improvement. Upon receipt of a petition of 100% of the abutting property
owners, the City Council must determine that it has been signed by 100% of the
owners of the affected property. After making this determination, a feasibility
report shall be undertaken and the project may be ordered without a public
hearing, pursuant to the procedures set forth in M.S. § 429; or
         (2)   Thirty-five percent petition.  By a petition signed by the
owners of not less than 35% of the frontage of the real property abutting on
the streets named as the location of the improvement, when the property owners
are willing to pay the entire cost of the improvement. Upon receipt of a
petition of 35% of the owners of abutting frontage, the City Council must
determine that it has been signed by 35% of the owners. After making this
determination, a feasibility report shall be undertaken and a public hearing
shall be scheduled to consider the project, pursuant to the procedures set
forth in M.S. § 429; or
         (3)   Sixty-seven percent petition.  By a petition signed by the
owners of not less than 67% of the lots or parcels abutting on the streets
named as the location of the improvement. Upon receipt of a petition of 67% of
the owners, the City Council must determine that it has been signed by 67% of
the owners. After making this determination, a feasibility report shall be
undertaken and a public hearing shall be scheduled to consider the project. If
an improvement is ordered, benefitting properties shall be assessed pursuant to
the procedures set forth in M.S. § 429; or
         (4)   By the initiative of the City Council. If the City Council
determines to order an improvement, a feasibility report, as set forth in c.
below, shall be undertaken and a public hearing shall be scheduled to consider
the project. A simple majority vote of the City Council is needed to start the
proceedings. If an improvement is ordered, benefitting properties shall be
assessed pursuant to the procedures set forth in M.S. § 429.
      b.   Petitions. Not later than the time a petition is considered for
acceptance by the City Council pursuant to a.(1) through a.(3) of this section,
the petitioners shall have executed and delivered to the city an agreement
whereby the petitioners agree to pay the cost of the improvement as defined in
the agreement and agree not to contest or challenge either the assessment
process or the amount to be assessed. The petition shall include an agreement
that the cost of preparing the feasibility report shall be paid by the
petitioners in the event the improvement is determined not to be feasible.
Failure to pay for the feasibility report shall result in the costs being
assessed against the properties of the petitioners.
      c.   Preparing the feasibility study. An improvement project which is
initiated by action of the City Council or by a 35% or 67% petition, as set
forth in a.(2) and a.(3) of this section, may be ordered only after a public
hearing. Prior to adopting a resolution calling a public hearing on an
improvement, the Council must secure from the City Engineer a report advising
it in a preliminary way as to:
         (1)   Whether the proposed improvement is feasible;
         (2)   Whether the proposed improvement is consistent with Capital
Improvement Planning;
         (3)   Whether the improvement should be made as proposed or in
connection with some other improvement;
         (4)   The estimated cost of the improvement;
         (5)   A proposed project schedule; and
         (6)   Any other information thought pertinent and necessary for
complete Council consideration.
      d.   Holding a public hearing on the improvement.  
         (1)   Improvement projects which are initiated by a 100% petition may
be ordered by the City Council without a public hearing if the City Council
determines the project may be undertaken without unreasonable changes to the
Capital Improvements Program or the petitioning property owners agree to pay
100% of the cost of the improvements. In the case of a Council-initiated
project or petition of less than 100% of abutting property owners, the Council
must adopt a resolution calling a public hearing on the improvement project for
which mailed and published notices of the hearing must be given. The notice of
public hearing must include the following information:
            (a)   The time and place of hearing;
            (b)   The general nature of the improvements;
            (c)   The estimated cost; and
            (d)   The area proposed to be assessed.
         (2)   Not less than 10 days before the hearing the notice of hearing
must be mailed to the owner of each parcel in the area proposed to be assessed.
The notice of public hearing must be published in the city’s legal newspaper at
least twice, each publication being at least one week apart, with the last
publication at least three days prior to the hearing.
         (3)   At the public hearing, the contents of the feasibility study
will be presented and discussed with the intent of giving all interested
parties an opportunity to be heard and their views expressed.
         (4)   Following a public hearing a resolution ordering the improvement
may be adopted at any time within six months after the date of the hearing by a
four-fifths vote of the City Council, unless the project was initiated by a 35%
petition or a 67% petition in which event it may be adopted by a majority vote.
At this time a special assessment is considered to be “pending” for all
assessable properties in the improvement area.
Subd. 3.   Deferred assessments.
      a.   The City Council may defer special assessments.  On homestead
property owned by a person who qualifies under the hardship criteria set forth
below.
      b.   Procedure. The property owner shall make application for deferred
payment of special assessments. The application shall be made within 30 days
after the adoption of the assessment roll by the City Council and shall be
renewed each year upon the filing of a similar application no later than
September 30. The City Administrator/Clerk shall establish a case number for
each application; review the application for complete information and details
and make a recommendation to the City Council to either approve or disapprove
the application for deferment. The City Council by majority vote, shall either
grant or deny the deferment and if the deferment is granted, the City Council
may require the payment of interest due each year. Renewal applications will be
approved by the City Administrator/Clerk for those cases whereby the original
conditions for qualifications remain substantially unchanged.
         (1)   If the City Council grants the deferment, the City
Administrator/Clerk shall notify the County Auditor who shall in accordance
with M.S. § 435.194, record a notice of the deferment with the County Recorder
setting forth the amount of assessment.
         (2)   Interest shall be charged on any assessment deferred pursuant to
this section at a rate equal to the rate charged on other assessments for the
particular public improvement projects the assessment is financing. If the City
Council grants an assessment deferral to an applicant, the interest may also be
deferred, or the interest may be due and payable on a yearly basis up until the
assessment period terminates and only the principal is deferred. The decision
as to whether the principal and interest or just the principal is deferred is
decided by the City Council when considering the application.
Subd. 4.   Conditions of hardship.
      a.   Any applicant must be 65 years of age, or older, or retired by
reason of permanent or total disability and must own a legal or equitable
interest in the property applied for which must be the homestead of the
applicant; or
      b.   The annual gross income of the applicant shall not be in excess of
the criteria for determining low income as set by the Hennepin County CDBG
Program income limits for very low income and family size. Income specified in
the application should be the income of the year proceeding the year in which
the application is made, or the average income of the three years prior to the
year in which the application is made, whichever is less; and
      c.   Permanent and/or total disability shall be determined by using the
criteria established for “permanent and total disability” for Workman’s
Compensation and the Social Security Administration.
Subd. 5.   Policies. The City Council shall establish and may from time to time
modify policies pertaining for the fair, equitable and consistent allocation of
the cost of water improvements. The policies may relate to factors for
determining economic feasibility, fees and charges for connecting to the system
and the additional matters as the Council shall determine appropriate in its
reasonable discretion.

hearing is held thereon by the City Council. A notice of the time, place and
purpose of the hearing shall be published in the city’s official newspaper and

every quarterly utility billing until the property is in compliance.
Subd. 6.   Temporary waiver. The City Council, upon recommendation of the City
Administrator/Clerk and City Engineer, shall hear and decide requests for
temporary waivers from the provisions of this chapter where strict enforcement
would cause a threat to public safety because of circumstances unique to the
individual property under consideration. Any request for a temporary waiver
shall be submitted to the City Administrator/Clerk in writing. Upon approval of
a temporary waiver from the provisions of this chapter, the property owner
shall agree to pay an additional fee for sanitary sewer services based on the
number of gallons discharged into the sanitary sewer system as estimated by the
City Engineer.
Subd. 7.   Drainage. Storm water and all other unpolluted drainage shall be
discharged to the drainage facilities as are specifically designated by the
City Engineer.
Subd. 8.   Remedies. The imposition of the surcharge shall not limit the right
of the city to seek an injunction in District Court ordering the person to
disconnect the nonconforming connection to the sanitary sewer or from pursuing
any other legal remedies available, or in the alternative, the city may correct
the violation and certify the costs of correction as an assessment against the
property on which the correction was made.

Subd. 1.   Rates and charges.
      a.   Rates established. The following rates and charges for use and
services of the sanitary sewer system are established; the charges and rates to
be made against each lot, parcel or land, unit or premises which may have a
connection directly or indirectly into the city sanitary sewer system and which
discharges only normal sewage into the system.
         (1)   Minimum charges. The minimum quarterly charge, whether the use
of water is metered or not metered, shall be that quarterly or monthly charge
established by ordinance of the City Council.
         (2)   Metered charges. Metered flow charges shall be as established by
ordinance of the City Council.
      b.   Beginning service. For a fraction of a quarter, the charges and

flat charge; provided, however, that the actual month of beginning shall be
considered as having begun on the first or the fifteenth of the month,
whichever is closer.
      c.   Determination of amount of water entering sewage system. If the lot,
parcel of land or premises discharges normal sewage or industrial waste into
the sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, and it can be
shown to the satisfaction of the City Council that a portion of the water
measured by the water meter does not and cannot enter the sanitary sewerage
system, then, and in that event, the City Council may permit or require the
installation of other or additional meters in a manner that the quantity of
water which actually could enter the sewer system may be determined. In this
case, the charges or rates shall be based upon the amount of water which can
enter the sanitary sewage system.
      d.   Estimated charges. If the owner, occupant or person in charge of any
premises shall fail or refuse to provide information as provided in subdivision
1c hereof, or shall fail or refuse to comply with any requirement of this
chapter, the proper charge for the premises shall be estimated and billed in
accordance with the estimate.
Subd. 2.   Meter use for nonresidential premises.
      a.   Use of meter. A meter recording the use of water may be installed on
any nonresidential lot, parcel, premises or unit enumerated in subdivision 1 of
this section and thereafter the rate shall be based upon the use of water. The
City Council may, by resolution, require and order the installation of the
meter on any lot, parcel, premises or unit, or class thereof, where it shall
determine that the aforementioned flat charges are impractical to apply, or
result in inequitable charges because insufficient or excessive; and
thereafter, the rate shall be based upon the use of water.
      b.   Installation and maintenance. Any water meter installed for use or
used as a basis for the computation of sewer rates shall be installed and
maintained in good operating condition at all times, the installation and
maintenance to be without expense to the city. Any meter shall be of a type

credited to the Sewer Operating Fund. The revenue shall be used only for the
purpose of paying the cost of operating and maintaining the sewage system,
paying charges made by the MWCC, providing an adequate depreciation fund,
paying costs of meter reading, billing, collection and other similar or related
sewer operating expenses. If the rates and charges prescribed herein do not
produce a net revenue sufficient to permit payment of the purposes for which
established, the rates and charges provided herein shall be adjusted from time
to time to permit the accumulation of net revenues equal to the charges and
expenses of operating the sanitary sewer system.
Subd. 5.   Violation. Any person violating any of the provisions of this
section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

CHAPTER 905
STORMWATER UTILITY
Section
905.01   Purpose
905.02   Establishment of stormwater drainage utility
905.03   Stormwater utility rates
905.04   Other land uses
905.05   Adjustment of charges
905.06   Exemptions
905.07   Payment of charge
905.08   Establishment of tax lien
905.09   Recalculation of charges
905.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to establish a Shorewood/Lake System
Stormwater Management Utility (SMU). The following are the objectives of this
special utility:
Subd. 1.   Maintain and improve the present stormwater management system;
Subd. 2.   Improve the quality of water runoff to lakes which helps recharge
aquifers, control lake levels and decrease erosion and sediment to lakes;
Subd. 3.   Operate and maintain stormwater facilities to protect people and
property;
Subd. 4.   Provide the resources to respond to small scale emergency drainage
issues affecting residents;
Subd. 5.   Acquire land and/or construct stormwater detention and retention
sites;
Subd. 6.   Direct water from street surfaces which saves street maintenance
costs;
Subd. 7.   Encourage local watershed stormwater management improvement projects
by supplementing funding from local watershed districts and other city sources.
(1987 Code, § 905.01) (Ord. 268, passed 1-25-1993)
905.02 ESTABLISHMENT OF STORMWATER DRAINAGE UTILITY.
   The municipal storm sewer system shall be operated as a public utility
pursuant to M.S. § 444.075. Pursuant thereto, the city establishes a stormwater
drainage utility and authorizes the imposition of just and reasonable charges
for the use and availability of storm sewer facilities subject to the
provisions of this section and Minnesota Statutes.
(1987 Code, § 905.02) (Ord. 268, passed 1-25-1993)
905.03 STORMWATER UTILITY RATES.
Subd. 1.   Residential equivalent factor. Rates and charges for the use and
availability of the system shall be determined through the use of a
“residential equivalent factor” (REF). For the purposes of this section, one
REF is defined as the ratio of the average volume of surface water runoff
coming from one acre of land and subjected to a particular use, to the average
volume of runoff coming from one acre of land subjected to typical single-
family residential use within the city during a “standard rainfall event.” For
purposes of this chapter, a standard rainfall event is defined as the 1-year,
24 hour rainfall event of two to three inches as published by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture’s “Minnesota Hydrology Guide.”
Subd. 2.   Stormwater drainage charges. In determining charges the City Council
shall by resolution establish a basic system rate to be charged against one
acre of land having an REF of one. The charge to be made against each parcel of
land shall then be determined by multiplying the REF for the parcel’s zoning
district classification times the parcel’s acreage times the basic system rate.
For land uses identified as Classification 2 below, the charge to be made shall
be determined by multiplying the REF times the basic system rate. The REF’s for
land uses within the city and the billing classifications for the land uses are
as follows:
 
Classification Land Uses                                         REF
1              Cemeteries                                        0.70
               Single-family and duplex residential              0.70

1004.05 INSPECTIONS.
Subd. 1.   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish standards for a
program of inspections meant to improve and maintain the overall rental housing
in the city. Housing inspections do not indicate compliance with any
inspectional program other than that of the city. Inspections are made as a
public service and do not constitute any representation, guarantee or warranty
to any person as to the conditions of the building inspected. The city does not
assume any responsibility or liability in connection with the inspection and
issuance of the license required by §
1004.03 of this chapter.
Subd. 2.   Initial compliance inspection. Prior to issuance of a license to
operate a rental dwelling unit, the Compliance Official and the Fire Inspector
(as may be applicable) shall inspect the premises for compliance with this
chapter. A record of the inspection shall be kept on file at the City Hall. The
compliance inspection must occur within 30 days of the application (either for
a new license or renewal) or the application shall be considered void.

is authorized to obtain an administrative search warrant before making the
inspection.

1004.06 SHORT-TERM RENTAL PROHIBITED.
Subd. 1.   Purpose. The city finds that short-term rentals located in
residential zoning districts constitute commercial use of residential property,
conflict with the residential character of residential zoning districts,
disrupt the residential character of neighborhoods, and have a negative impact
on the livability of residential neighborhoods. The city has received
complaints from residents regarding short-term rentals, including complaints
related to noise, over-occupancy, and illegal parking. Studies have reported
that short-term rentals can render a significant number of housing units
unavailable for long-term residents and can raise the cost of housing. To
ensure adequate housing options for residents, preserve the residential
character of the city's residential districts, preserve property values, and
reduce land use conflicts, the city determines, in furtherance of the public
health, safety and general welfare, it is necessary to limit short-term rentals
to hotels, motels, lodging establishments and similar accommodations which are
appropriately zoned and have the appropriate infrastructure and services for
short-term use.
Subd. 2.   Prohibition. Short-term rental of any dwelling or dwelling unit to a
transient for less than 30 consecutive days in a residential zoning district is
prohibited. State licensed hotels, motels and lodging establishments located
outside residential districts or residential planned unit development districts
are allowed, pursuant to applicable city codes.
Subd. 3.   Enforcement.  
      a.   An owner, operator, tenant or occupant of any building or property
in violation of the provisions of this section may be charged and found guilty
of a misdemeanor and may be held responsible for the cost of enforcement in
addition to penalties.
      b.   The city may exercise any and all remedies at law or in equity to
ensure compliance with this section. All unpaid costs, charges and penalties
may be certified as a special assessment levy against the property.
(Ord. 533, passed 9-26-2016; Am. Ord. 546, passed - -2017)

the occupants or of the public may be declared unfit for human habitation.
Whenever any rental dwelling or rental dwelling unit has been declared unfit

1101.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE.
Subd. 1.   Statutory authorization. The legislature of the State of Minnesota
has, in M.S. Ch. 103F and Ch. 462 delegated the responsibility to local
government units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses.
Therefore, the City Council does ordain as follows.
Subd. 2.   Purpose.
      a.   This chapter regulates development in the flood hazard areas of the
city. These flood hazard areas are subject to periodic inundation, which may
result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of
commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood
protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base. It is the purpose of
this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare by
minimizing these losses and disruptions.
      b.   National Flood Insurance Program compliance. This chapter is adopted
to comply with the rules and regulations of the National Flood Insurance
Program codified as 44 Code of Federal Regulations Parts 59 -78, as amended, so
as to maintain the community's eligibility in the National Flood Insurance
Program.
      c.   This chapter is also intended to preserve the natural
characteristics and functions of watercourses and floodplains in order to
moderate flood and stormwater impacts, improve water quality, reduce soil
erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitat, provide recreational
opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits and enhance community and economic
development.
(Ord. 534, passed 10-24-2016)
1101.02 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
Subd. 1.   How to use this chapter. This chapter adopts the floodplain maps
applicable to the city and includes three floodplain districts: Floodway, Flood
Fringe, and General Floodplain.
      a.   Where Floodway and Flood Fringe districts are delineated on the
floodplain maps, the standards in §§
1101.04 or
1101.05 will apply, depending on the location of a property.
      b.   Locations where Floodway and Flood Fringe districts are not
delineated on the floodplain maps are considered to fall within the General
Floodplain district. Within the General Floodplain district, the Floodway
District standards in §
1101.04 apply unless the floodway boundary is determined, according to the
process outlined in §
1101.06. Once the floodway boundary is determined, the Flood Fringe District
standards in §
1101.05 may apply outside the floodway.
Subd. 2.   Lands to which chapter applies.
      a.   This chapter applies to all lands within the jurisdiction of the
city shown on the floodplain maps and/or the attachments to the maps as being
located within the boundaries of the Floodway, Flood Fringe, or General
Floodplain districts.
      b.   The Floodway, Flood Fringe and General Floodplain districts are
overlay districts that are superimposed on all existing zoning districts on the
Zoning Districts map referenced in
Chapter 1201 of this code. The standards imposed in the overlay districts are
in addition to any other requirements in
Chapter 1201 of this Code. In case of a conflict, the more restrictive
standards will apply.
Subd. 3.   Incorporation of maps by reference. The following maps together with
all attached material are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part
of this chapter. The attached material includes the Flood Insurance Study for
Hennepin County, Minnesota, and Incorporated Areas, dated November 4, 2016 and
the Flood Insurance Rate Map panels enumerated below, dated November 4, 2016,
all prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. These materials are on
file in the City Offices.
      Effective Flood Insurance Rate Map panels: 27053C0292 F, 27053C0295 F,
27053C0308 F, 27053C0309 F, 27053C0311 F, 27053C0312 F, 27053C0313 F,
27053C0314 F, 27053C0316 F, 27053C0317 F, 27053C0318 F, 27053C0319 F.
Subd. 4.   Regulatory flood protection elevation. The regulatory flood
protection elevation (RFPE) is an elevation no lower than one foot above the
elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation caused by
encroachments on the floodplain that result from designation of a floodway.
Subd. 5.   Interpretation. The boundaries of the floodplain districts are
determined by scaling distances on the Flood Insurance Rate Map.
      a.   Where a conflict exists between the floodplain limits illustrated on
the flood plain map and floodplain elevations discover in actual field
conditions, the flood elevations shall be the governing factor. The Zoning
Administrator must interpret the boundary location based on the ground
elevations that existed on the site on the date of the first National Flood
Insurance Program map showing the area within the regulatory floodplain, and
other available technical data.
      b.   Persons contesting the location of the district boundaries will be
given a reasonable opportunity to present their case to the City Council,
serving as the Board of Adjustments and Appeals and to submit technical
evidence.
Subd. 6.   Abrogation and greater restrictions. It is not intended by this
chapter to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or
other private agreements. However, where this chapter imposes greater
restrictions, the provisions of this chapter prevail. All other ordinances
inconsistent with this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the
inconsistency only.
Subd. 7.   Warning and disclaimer of liability. This chapter does not imply
that areas outside the floodplain districts or land uses permitted within such
districts will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter does not
create liability on the part of the city or its officers or employees for any
flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision lawfully made hereunder.
Subd. 8.   Severability. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this
chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of law, the
remainder of this chapter shall not be affected and shall remain in full force.
Subd. 9.   Definitions. Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases
used in this chapter must be interpreted according to common usage and so as to
give this chapter its most reasonable application.
         ACCESSORY USE OR STRUCTURE.  A use or structure on the same lot with,

         LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking
of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a basement area,
is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided, that such enclosure is
not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-
elevation design requirements of 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 60.3.
         MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections,

living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. For the
purposes of this chapter, the term RECREATIONAL VEHICLE is synonymous with the
term TRAVEL TRAILER/TRAVEL VEHICLE.
         REGIONAL FLOOD. A flood which is representative of large floods known
to have occurred generally in Minnesota and reasonably characteristic of what
can be expected to occur on an average frequency in the magnitude of the 1%
chance or 100-year recurrence interval. REGIONAL FLOOD is synonymous with the
term BASE FLOOD used in a flood insurance study.

synonymous with ONE HUNDRED YEAR FLOODPLAIN.
         START OF CONSTRUCTION. Includes substantial improvement, and means the
actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement or other improvement that occurred before the permit's expiration
date. The actual start is either the first placement of permanent construction
of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers,
foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
         STRUCTURE. Anything constructed or erected on the ground or attached
to the ground or on-site utilities, including, but not limited to, buildings,

         SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
where the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would
equal or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred.
         SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Within any consecutive 365-day period, any
reconstruction, rehabilitation (including normal maintenance and repair),
repair after damage, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of
which equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the
START OF CONSTRUCTION of the improvement. This term includes structures that
have incurred SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE, regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include either:
            (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct
existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code
specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement
official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
            (2)   Any alteration of a HISTORIC STRUCTURE, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
HISTORIC STRUCTURE. For the purpose of this chapter, HISTORIC STRUCTURE is as
defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 59.1.
Subd.10.    Annexations. The Flood Insurance Rate Map panels adopted by
reference into §
1101.02 Subd. 3. above may include floodplain areas that lie outside of the
corporate boundaries of the city at the time of adoption of this chapter. If
any of these floodplain land areas are annexed into the city after the date of
adoption of this chapter, the newly annexed floodplain lands will be subject to
the provisions of this chapter immediately upon the date of annexation.
Subd. 11.    Detachments. The Flood Insurance Rate Map panels adopted by
reference into §
1101.02 Subd. 3. above will include floodplain areas that lie inside the
corporate boundaries of municipalities at the time of adoption of this chapter.

      b.   Flood Fringe District. The Flood Fringe District includes areas
within Zones AE that have a floodway delineated on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
adopted in §
1102.02 Subd. 3., but are located outside of the floodway. For other lakes,
wetlands and other basins within Zones AE that do not have a floodway
delineated, the Flood Fringe District also includes those areas below the 1%
annual chance (100-year) flood elevation but above the ordinary high water
level as defined in M.S. § 103G.005, Subd. 14.
      c.   General Floodplain District. The General Floodplain District
includes those areas within Zone A as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
adopted in §
1102.02, Subd. 3.
Subd. 2.   Applicability. Within the floodplain districts established in this
chapter, the use, size, type and location of development must comply with the
terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. In no cases shall
floodplain development adversely affect the efficiency or unduly restrict the
capacity of the channels or floodways of any tributaries to the main stream,
drainage ditches, or any other drainage facilities or systems. All uses not
listed as permitted uses or conditional uses in §§
1101.04,
1101.05, and
1101.06, are prohibited. In addition, critical facilities, as defined in §
1102.02 (Critical Facilities), are prohibited in all floodplain districts.

      c.   Railroads, streets, bridges, utility transmission lines and
pipelines, provided that the Department of Natural Resources' Area Hydrologist
is notified at least ten days prior to issuance of any permit.
Subd. 2.   Standards for floodway permitted uses.
      a.   The use must have a low flood damage potential.
      b.   The use must not obstruct flood flows or cause any increase in flood
elevations and must not involve structures, obstructions, or storage of
materials or equipment.
      c.   Any facility that will be used by employees or the general public
must be designed with a flood warning system that provides adequate time for
evacuation if the area is inundated to a depth and velocity such that the depth
(in feet) multiplied by the velocity (in feet per second) would exceed a
product of four upon occurrence of the regional (1% chance) flood.
Subd. 3.   Conditional uses. The following uses may be allowed as conditional
uses following the standards and procedures set forth in §
1101.10 Subd.4. of this chapter and further subject to the standards set forth
in §
1101.04 Subd. 4., if otherwise allowed in the underlying zoning district or any
applicable overlay district.

1101.04 Subd. 1. a. through c. above and the uses listed in b. through c.
below.
      b.   Extraction and storage of sand, gravel, and other materials.
      c.   Marinas, boat rentals, docks, piers, wharves, and water control
structures.
      d.   Storage yards for equipment, machinery, or materials.
      e.   Placement of fill or construction of fences that obstruct flood
flows.
      f.   General farming, pasture, grazing, outdoor plant nurseries,
horticulture, truck farming, forestry, sod farming, and wild crop harvesting.
Subd. 4.   Standards for floodway conditional uses.
      a.   All uses. A conditional use must not cause any increase in the stage
of the 1% chance or regional flood or cause an increase in flood damages in the
reach or reaches affected.
      b.   Fill; storage of materials and equipment.
         (1)   The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of
flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or
plant life is prohibited.
         (2)   Fill, dredge spoil, and other similar materials deposited or
stored in the floodplain must be protected from erosion by vegetative cover,
mulching, riprap or other acceptable method. Permanent sand and gravel
operations and similar uses must be covered by a long-term site development
plan.
         (3)   Temporary placement of fill, other materials, or equipment which
would cause an increase to the stage of the 1% chance or regional flood may
only be allowed if the City Council has approved a plan that assures removal of
the materials from the floodway based upon the flood warning time available.
      c.   Accessory structures. Accessory structures, as identified in §
1101.04 Subd. 3.a., may be permitted, provided that:
         (1)   Structures are not intended for human habitation;
         (2)   Structures will have a low flood damage potential;
         (3)   Structures will be constructed and placed so as to offer a
minimal obstruction to the flow of flood waters;
         (4)   Service utilities, such as electrical and heating equipment,
within these structures must be elevated to or above the regulatory flood
protection elevation or properly floodproofed; and
         (5)   Structures must be elevated on fill or structurally dry
floodproofed in accordance with the FP1 or FP2 floodproofing classifications in
the State Building Code. All floodproofed structures must be adequately
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement and designed to
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
         (6)   As an alternative, an accessory structure may be internally/wet
floodproofed to the FP3 or FP4 floodproofing classifications in the State
Building Code, provided the accessory structure constitutes a minimal
investment and does not exceed 576 square feet in size. Designs for meeting
this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer
or meet or exceed the following criteria:
            (a)   To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there
must be a minimum of two automatic openings in the outside walls of the
structure, with a total net area of not less than one square inch for every
square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; and
            (b)   There must be openings on at least two sides of the structure
and the bottom of all openings must be no higher than one foot above the lowest
adjacent grade to the structure. Using human intervention to open a garage door
prior to flooding will not satisfy this requirement for automatic openings.
      d.   Structural works for flood control that will change the course,
current or cross section of protected wetlands or public waters are subject to
the provisions of M.S. § 103G.245.
      e.   A levee, dike or floodwall constructed in the floodway must not
cause an increase to the 1% chance or regional flood. The technical analysis
must assume equal conveyance or storage loss on both sides of a stream.
      f.   Floodway developments must not adversely affect the hydraulic
capacity of the channel and adjoining floodplain of any tributary watercourse
or drainage system.
(Ord. 534, passed 10-24-2016)
1101.05 FLOOD FRINGE DISTRICT (FF).
Subd. 1.   Permitted uses. Permitted uses are those uses of land or structures
allowed in the underlying zoning district(s) that comply with the standards in
Subd. 2. below. If no pre-existing, underlying zoning districts exist, then any
residential or nonresidential structure or use of a structure or land is a
permitted use provided it does not constitute a public nuisance.
Subd. 2.   Standards for flood fringe permitted uses.
      a.   All structures, including accessory structures, must be elevated on
fill so that the lowest floor, as defined, is at or above the regulatory flood
protection elevation. The finished fill elevation for structures must be no
lower than one foot below the regulatory flood protection elevation and the
fill must extend at the same elevation at least 15 feet beyond the outside
limits of the structure.
      b.   Accessory structures. As an alternative to the fill requirements of
a. above, structures accessory to the uses identified in Subd. 1. above may be
permitted to be internally/wet floodproofed to the FP3 or FP4 floodproofing
classifications in the State Building Code, provided that:
         (1)   The accessory structure constitutes a minimal investment, does
not exceed 576 square feet in size, and is only used for parking and storage.
         (2)   All portions of floodproofed accessory structures below the
regulatory flood protection elevation must be:
            (a)   Adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral
movement and designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls;
            (b)   Be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage; and
            (c)   Must have all service utilities be water-tight or elevated to
above the regulatory flood protection elevation.
         (3)   Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by
a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following criteria:
            (a)   To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there
must be a minimum of two automatic openings in the outside walls of the
structure, with a total net area of not less than one square inch for every
square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; and
            (b)   There must be openings on at least two sides of the structure
and the bottom of all openings must be no higher than one foot above the lowest
adjacent grade to the structure. Using human intervention to open a garage door
prior to flooding will not satisfy this requirement for automatic openings.
      c.   The cumulative placement of fill or similar material on a parcel
must not exceed 1,000 cubic yards, unless the fill is specifically intended to
elevate a structure in accordance with Subd. 2.a. of this section, or if
allowed as a conditional use under Subd. 3.c. below.
      d.   The storage of any materials or equipment must be elevated on fill
to the regulatory flood protection elevation.
      e.   All service utilities, including ductwork, must be elevated or
water-tight to prevent infiltration of floodwaters.
      f.   The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of
flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or
plant life is prohibited.
      g.   All fill must be properly compacted and the slopes must be properly
protected by the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable method.
      h.   All new principal structures must have vehicular access at or above
an elevation not more than two feet below the regulatory flood protection
elevation, or must have a flood warning/emergency evacuation plan acceptable to
the City Council.
      i.   Accessory uses such as yards, railroad tracks, and parking lots may
be at an elevation lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation.
However, any facilities used by employees or the general public must be
designed with a flood warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation
if the area is inundated to a depth and velocity such that the depth (in feet)
multiplied by the velocity (in feet per second) would exceed a product of four
upon occurrence of the regional (1% chance) flood.
      j.   Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles must meet the standards
of §
1101.09 of this chapter.
Subd. 3.   Conditional uses. The following uses and activities may be allowed
as conditional uses, if allowed in the underlying zoning district(s) or any
applicable overlay district, following the procedures in §
1101.10 Subd. 4. of this chapter.
      a.   Any structure that is not elevated on fill or floodproofed in
accordance with Subd. 2.a. and 2.b. of this section.
      b.   Storage of any material or equipment below the regulatory flood
protection elevation.
      c.   The cumulative placement of more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill when
the fill is not being used to elevate a structure in accordance with Subd. 2.a.
of this section.
      d.   The use of methods to elevate structures above the regulatory flood
protection elevation, including stilts, pilings, parallel walls, or above-
grade, enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages, shall meet
the standards in Subd. 4.f. of this section.
Subd. 4.   Standards for Flood Fringe conditional uses.
      a.   The standards listed in Subd. 2.d. through 2.j. apply to all
conditional uses.
      b.   Basements, as defined by §
1101.02 Subd. 9. of this chapter, are subject to the following:
         (1)   Residential basement construction is not allowed below the
regulatory flood protection elevation.
         (2)   Nonresidential basements may be allowed below the regulatory
flood protection elevation provided the basement is structurally dry
floodproofed in accordance with Subd. 4.c. below.
      c.   All areas of nonresidential structures, including basements, to be
placed below the regulatory flood protection elevation must be floodproofed in
accordance with the structurally dry floodproofing classifications in the State
Building Code. Structurally dry floodproofing must meet the FP1 or FP2
floodproofing classification in the State Building Code, which requires making
the structure watertight with the walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water and with structural components capable of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy.
      d.   The placement of more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill or other
similar material on a parcel (other than for the purpose of elevating a
structure to the regulatory flood protection elevation) must comply with an
approved erosion/sedimentation control plan.
         (1)   The plan must clearly specify methods to be used to stabilize
the fill on site for a flood event at a minimum of the regional (1% chance)
flood event.
         (2)   The plan must be prepared and certified by a registered
professional engineer or other qualified individual acceptable to the City
Council.
         (3)   The plan may incorporate alternative procedures for removal of
the material from the floodplain if adequate flood warning time exists.
      e.   Storage of materials and equipment below the regulatory flood
protection elevation must comply with an approved emergency plan providing for
removal of such materials within the time available after a flood warning.
      f.   Alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill may be
utilized to elevate a structure's lowest floor above the regulatory flood
protection elevation. The base or floor of an enclosed area shall be considered
above-grade and not a structure's basement or lowest floor if: 1) the enclosed
area is above-grade on at least one side of the structure; 2) it is designed to
internally flood and is constructed with flood resistant materials; and 3) it
is used solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage. The above-
noted alternative elevation methods are subject to the following additional
standards:
         (1)   Design and certification. The structure's design and as-built
condition must be certified by a registered professional engineer as being in
compliance with the general design standards of the State Building Code and,
specifically, that all electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities must be at or above the
regulatory flood protection elevation or be designed to prevent flood water
from entering or accumulating within these components during times of flooding.
         (2)   Specific standards for above-grade, enclosed areas. Above-grade,
fully enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages must be
designed to internally flood and the design plans must stipulate:
            (a)   The minimum area of openings in the walls where internal
flooding is to be used as a floodproofing technique. There shall be a minimum
of two openings on at least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all
openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. The automatic openings
shall have a minimum net area of not less than one square inch for every square
foot of enclosed area subject to flooding unless a registered professional
engineer or architect certifies that a smaller net area would suffice. The
automatic openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
flood waters without any form of human intervention; and
            (b)   That the enclosed area will be designed of flood resistant
materials in accordance with the FP3 or FP4 classifications in the State
Building Code and shall be used solely for building access, parking of vehicles
or storage.

1101.06 GENERAL FLOODPLAIN DISTRICT (GF).
Subd. 1.   Permitted uses.
      a.   The uses listed in §
1101.04 Subd. 1. of this chapter, Floodway District permitted uses, are
permitted uses.
      b.   All other uses are subject to the floodway/flood fringe evaluation
criteria specified in §
1101.06 Subd. 2. below. Section
1101.04 applies if the proposed use is determined to be in the Floodway
District. Section
1101.05 applies if the proposed use is determined to be in the Flood Fringe
District.
Subd. 2.   Procedures for floodway and flood fringe determinations.
      a.   Upon receipt of an application for a permit or other approval within
the General Floodplain District, the Zoning Administrator must obtain, review
and reasonably utilize any regional flood elevation and floodway data available
from a federal, state, or other source.
      b.   If regional flood elevation and floodway data are not readily
available, the applicant must furnish additional information, as needed, to
determine the regulatory flood protection elevation and whether the proposed
use would fall within the Floodway or Flood Fringe District. Information must
be consistent with accepted hydrological and hydraulic engineering standards
and the standards in Subd. 2.c. below.
      c.   The determination of floodway and flood fringe must include the
following components, as applicable:
         (1)   Estimate the peak discharge of the regional (1% chance) flood.
         (2)   Calculate the water surface profile of the regional flood based
upon a hydraulic analysis of the stream channel and overbank areas.
         (3)   Compute the floodway necessary to convey or store the regional
flood without increasing flood stages more than 0.5 foot. A lesser stage
increase than 0.5 foot is required if, as a result of the stage increase,
increased flood damages would result. An equal degree of encroachment on both
sides of the stream within the reach must be assumed in computing floodway
boundaries.
      d.   The Zoning Administrator will review the submitted information and
assess the technical evaluation and the recommended Floodway and/or Flood
Fringe District boundary. The assessment must include the cumulative effects of
previous floodway encroachments. The Zoning Administrator may seek technical
assistance from a designated engineer or other expert person or agency,
including the Department of Natural Resources. Based on this assessment, the
Zoning Administrator may approve or deny the application.
      e.   Once the Floodway and Flood Fringe District boundaries have been
determined, the Zoning Administrator must process the permit application
consistent with the applicable provisions of §§
1101.04 and
1101.05 of this chapter.
(Ord. 534, passed 10-24-2016)
1101.07 LAND DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
Subd. 1.   In general. Recognizing that flood prone areas may exist outside of
the designated floodplain districts, the requirements of this chapter apply to
all land within the city.
Subd. 2.   Subdivisions. No land may be subdivided which is unsuitable for
reasons of flooding or inadequate drainage, water supply or sewage treatment
facilities. Manufactured home parks and recreational vehicle parks or
campgrounds are considered subdivisions under this chapter.
      a.   All lots within the floodplain districts must be able to contain a
building site outside of the Floodway District at or above the regulatory flood
protection elevation.
      b.   All subdivisions must have road access both to the subdivision and
to the individual building sites no lower than two feet below the regulatory
flood protection elevation, unless a flood warning emergency plan for the safe
evacuation of all vehicles and people during the regional (1% chance) flood has
been approved by the City Council. The plan must be prepared by a registered
engineer or other qualified individual, and must demonstrate that adequate time
and personnel exist to carry out the evacuation.
      c.   For all subdivisions in the floodplain, the Floodway and Flood
Fringe District boundaries, the regulatory flood protection elevation and the
required elevation of all access roads must be clearly labeled on all required
subdivision drawings and platting documents.
      d.   In the General Floodplain District, applicants must provide the
information required in §
1101.06 Subd.2. of this chapter to determine the regional flood elevation, the
Floodway and Flood Fringe District boundaries and the regulatory flood
protection elevation for the subdivision site.
      e.   If a subdivision proposal or other proposed new development is in a
flood prone area, any such proposal must be reviewed to assure that:
         (1)   All such proposals are consistent with the need to minimize
flood damage within the flood prone area;
         (2)   All public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas,
electrical, and water systems are located and constructed to minimize or
eliminate flood damage; and
         (3)   Adequate drainage is provided to reduce exposure of flood
hazard.
Subd. 3.   Building sites. If a proposed building site is in a flood prone
area, all new construction and substantial improvements (including the
placement of manufactured homes) must be:
      a.   Designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent
floatation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy;
      b.   Constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood
damage;
      c.   Constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; and
      d.   Constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding.
(Ord. 534, passed 10-24-2016)
1101.08 PUBLIC UTILITIES, RAILROADS, ROADS AND BRIDGES.
Subd. 1.   Public utilities. All public utilities and facilities such as gas,
electrical, sewer, and water supply systems to be located in the floodplain
must be floodproofed in accordance with the State Building Code or elevated to
the regulatory flood protection elevation.
Subd. 2.   Public transportation facilities. Railroad tracks, roads, and
bridges to be located within the floodplain must comply with §§
1101.04 and
1101.05 of this chapter. These transportation facilities must be elevated to
the regulatory flood protection elevation where failure or interruption of
these facilities would result in danger to the public health or safety or where
such facilities are essential to the orderly functioning of the area. Minor or
auxiliary roads or railroads may be constructed at a lower elevation where
failure or interruption of transportation services would not endanger the
public health or safety.
Subd. 3.   On-site water supply and sewage treatment systems. Where public
utilities are not provided: 1) On-site water supply systems must be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and are
subject to the provisions in Minnesota Rules Part 4725.4350, as amended; and 2)
New or replacement on-site sewage treatment systems must be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and
discharges from the systems into flood waters, they must not be subject to
impairment or contamination during times of flooding, and are subject to the
provisions in Minnesota Rules Part 7080.2270, as amended.
(Am. Ord. 534, passed 10-24-2016)
1101.09 MANUFACTURED HOMES AND PLACEMENT OF RECREATIONAL VEHICLES.
Subd. 1.   Manufactured homes. New manufactured home parks and expansions to
existing manufactured home parks are prohibited in any floodplain district. For
existing manufactured home parks or lots of record, the following requirements
apply:
      a.   Placement or replacement of manufactured home units is prohibited in
the Floodway District.
      b.   If allowed in the Flood Fringe District, placement or replacement of
manufactured home units is subject to the requirements of §
1101.05 of this chapter. New and replacement manufactured homes must be
elevated in compliance with §
1101.05 of this chapter and must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored
foundation system that resists flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top
or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable
state or local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
Subd. 2.   Recreational vehicles. New recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds
and expansions to existing recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds are
prohibited in any floodplain district. Placement of recreational vehicles in
existing recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds in the floodplain must meet
the exemption criteria below or be treated as new structures meeting the
requirements of this chapter.
      a.   Recreational vehicles are exempt from the provisions of this chapter
if they are placed in any of the following areas and meet the criteria listed
in §
1101.09 Subd. 2.b.:
         (1)   Individual lots or parcels of record;
         (2)   Existing commercial recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds;
or
         (3)   Existing condominium-type associations;
      b.   Criteria for exempt recreational vehicles:
         (1)   The vehicle must have a current license required for highway
use;
         (2)   The vehicle must be highway ready, meaning on wheels or the
internal jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type
utilities commonly used in campgrounds and recreational vehicle parks;
         (3)   No permanent structural type additions may be attached to the
vehicle; and
         (4)   The vehicle and associated use must be permissible in any pre-
existing, underlying zoning district.
         (5)   Accessory structures are not permitted within the Floodway
District. Any accessory structure in the Flood Fringe District must be
constructed of flood-resistant materials and be securely anchored, meeting the
requirements applicable to manufactured homes in §
1101.09 Subd. 2.b.
         (6)   An accessory structure must constitute a minimal investment.
      c.   Recreational vehicles that are exempt in §
1101.09 Subd. 2.b. lose this exemption when development occurs on the site that
exceeds a minimal investment for an accessory structure such as a garage or
storage building. The recreational vehicle and all accessory structures will
then be treated as new structures subject to the elevation and floodproofing
requirements of §
1101.05 of this chapter. No development or improvement on the parcel or
attachment to the recreational vehicle is allowed that would hinder the removal
of the vehicle should flooding occur.
(Ord. 534, passed 10-24-2016)
1101.10 ADMINISTRATION.
Subd. 1.   Zoning administrator. A Zoning Administrator or other official
designated by the City Council must administer and enforce this chapter.
Subd. 2.   Permit requirements.
      a.   Permit required. A permit must be obtained from the Zoning
Administrator prior to conducting the following activities:
         (1)   The erection, addition, modification, rehabilitation, or
alteration of any building, structure, or portion thereof. Normal maintenance
and repair also requires a permit if such work, separately or in conjunction
with other planned work, constitutes a substantial improvement as defined in
this chapter;
         (2)   The use or change of use of a building, structure, or land;
         (3)   The change or extension of a nonconforming use;
         (4)   The repair of a structure that has been damaged by flood, fire,
tornado, or any other source;
         (5)   The placement of fill, excavation of materials, or the storage
of materials or equipment within the floodplain;
         (6)   Relocation or alteration of a watercourse (including new or
replacement culverts and bridges), unless a public waters work permit has been
applied for; or
         (7)   Any other type of DEVELOPMENT as defined in this chapter.
      b.   Application for permit. Permit applications must be submitted to the
Zoning Administrator on forms provided by the Zoning Administrator. The permit
application must include the following as applicable:
         (1)   A site plan showing all pertinent dimensions, existing or
proposed buildings, structures, and significant natural features having an
influence on the permit.
         (2)   Location of fill or storage of materials in relation to the
stream channel.
         (3)   Copies of any required municipal, county, state or federal
permits or approvals.
         (4)   Other relevant information requested by the Zoning Administrator
as necessary to properly evaluate the permit application.
      c.   Certificate of zoning compliance for a new, altered, or
nonconforming use. No building, land or structure may be occupied or used in
any manner until a certificate of zoning compliance has been issued by the
Zoning Administrator stating that the use of the building or land conforms to
the requirements of this chapter.
      d.   Certification. The applicant is required to submit certification by
a registered professional engineer, registered architect, or registered land
surveyor that the finished fill and building elevations were accomplished in
compliance with the provisions of this chapter. Floodproofing measures must be
certified by a registered professional engineer or registered architect.
      e.   Record of first floor elevation. The Zoning Administrator must
maintain a record of the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) of
all new structures and alterations or additions to existing structures in the
floodplain. The Zoning Administrator must also maintain a record of the
elevation to which structures and alterations or additions to structures are
floodproofed.
      f.   Notifications for watercourse alterations. Before authorizing any
alteration or relocation of a river or stream, the Zoning Administrator must
notify adjacent communities. If the applicant has applied for a permit to work
in public waters pursuant to M.S. § 103G.245, this will suffice as adequate
notice. A copy of the notification must also be submitted to the Chicago
Regional Office of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
      g.   Notification to FEMA when physical changes increase or decrease base
flood elevations. As soon as is practicable, but not later than six months
after the date such supporting information becomes available, the Zoning
Administrator must notify the Chicago Regional Office of FEMA of the changes by
submitting a copy of the relevant technical or scientific data.
Subd. 3.   Variances.
      a.   Variance applications.  An application for a variance to the
provisions of this chapter will be processed and reviewed in accordance with
applicable state statutes and §
1201.05 of the zoning code.
      b.   Adherence to state floodplain management standards. A variance must
not allow a use that is not allowed in that district, permit a lower degree of
flood protection than the regulatory flood protection elevation for the
particular area, or permit standards lower than those required by state law.
      c.   Additional variance criteria. The following additional variance
criteria of the Federal Emergency Management Agency must be satisfied:
         (1)   Variances must not be issued by a community within any
designated regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base
flood discharge would result;
         (2)   Variances may only be issued by a community upon (i) a showing
of good and sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the
variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a
determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased
flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public
expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or
conflict with existing local laws or ordinances; and
         (3)   Variances may only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      d.   Flood insurance notice.  The Zoning Administrator must notify the
applicant for a variance that: 1) The issuance of a variance to construct a
structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for
flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage;
and 2) Such construction below the base or regional flood level increases risks
to life and property. Such notification must be maintained with a record of all
variance actions.
      e.   General considerations. The community may consider the following
factors in granting variances and imposing conditions on variances and
conditional uses in floodplains:
         (1)   The potential danger to life and property due to increased flood
heights or velocities caused by encroachments;
         (2)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands or
downstream to the injury of others;
         (3)   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems, if any, and
the ability of these systems to minimize the potential for disease,
contamination and unsanitary conditions;
         (4)   The susceptibility of any proposed use and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         (5)   The importance of the services to be provided by the proposed
use to the community;
         (6)   The requirements of the facility for a waterfront location;
         (7)   The availability of viable alternative locations for the
proposed use that are not subject to flooding;
         (8)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development
and development anticipated in the foreseeable future;
         (9)   The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Land
Use Plan and flood plain management program for the area;
         (10)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles; and
         (11)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site.
      f.   Submittal of hearing notices to the Department of Natural Resources
(DNR).  The Zoning Administrator must submit hearing notices for proposed
variances to the DNR sufficiently in advance to provide at least ten days'
notice of the hearing. The notice may be sent by electronic mail or U.S. mail
to the respective DNR area hydrologist.
      g.   Submittal of final decisions to the DNR. A copy of all decisions
granting variances must be forwarded to the DNR within ten days of such action.
The notice may be sent by electronic mail or U.S. mail to the respective DNR
area hydrologist.
      h.   Record-keeping.  The Zoning Administrator must maintain a record of
all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and must
report such variances in an annual or biennial report to the Administrator of
the National Flood Insurance Program, when requested by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
Subd. 4.   Conditional uses.
      a.   Administrative review.  An application for a conditional use permit
under the provisions of this chapter will be processed and reviewed in
accordance with this zoning code.
      b.   Factors used in decision-making.  In passing upon conditional use
applications, the City Council must consider all relevant factors specified in
other sections of this chapter, and those factors identified in §
1101.10 Subd. 3.e. of this chapter.
      c.   Conditions attached to conditional use permits. The City Council may
attach such conditions to the granting of conditional use permits as it deems
necessary to fulfill the purposes of this chapter. Such conditions may include,
but are not limited to, the following:
         (1)   Modification of waste treatment and water supply facilities;
         (2)   Limitations on period of use, occupancy, and operation;
         (3)   Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed
restrictions;
         (4)   Requirements for construction of channel modifications,
compensatory storage, dikes, levees, and other protective measures; and
         (5)   Floodproofing measures, in accordance with the State Building
Code and this chapter. The applicant must submit a plan or document certified
by a registered professional engineer or architect that the floodproofing
measures are consistent with the regulatory flood protection elevation and
associated flood factors for the particular area.
      d.   Submittal of hearing notices to the Department of Natural Resources
(DNR). The Zoning Administrator must submit hearing notices for proposed
conditional uses to the DNR sufficiently in advance to provide at least ten
days' notice of the hearing. The notice may be sent by electronic mail or U.S.
mail to the respective DNR area hydrologist.
      e.   Submittal of final decisions to the DNR. A copy of all decisions
granting conditional uses must be forwarded to the DNR within ten days of such
action. The notice may be sent by electronic mail or U.S. mail to the
respective DNR area hydrologist.

1101.11 NONCONFORMITIES.
Subd. 1.   Continuance of nonconformities. A use, structure, or occupancy of
land which was lawful before the passage or amendment of this chapter but which
is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter may be continued
subject to the following conditions. HISTORIC STRUCTURES, as defined in §
1101.02 Subd. 9. of this chapter, are subject to the provisions of a. through
f. below.
      a.   A nonconforming use, structure, or occupancy must not be expanded,
changed, enlarged, or altered in a way that increases its flood damage
potential or degree of obstruction to flood flows except as provided in b.
below. Expansion or enlargement of uses, structures or occupancies within the
Floodway District is prohibited.
      b.   Any addition or structural alteration to a nonconforming structure
or nonconforming use that would result in increasing its flood damage potential
must be protected to the regulatory flood protection elevation in accordance
with any of the elevation on fill or floodproofing techniques (i.e., FP1 thru
FP4 floodproofing classifications) allowable in the State Building Code, except
as further restricted in c. through g. below.
      c.   If the cost of all previous and proposed alterations and additions
exceeds 50% of the market value of any nonconforming structure, that shall be
considered substantial improvement, and the entire structure must meet the
standards of §§
1101.04 or
1101.05 of this chapter for new structures, depending upon whether the
structure is in the Floodway or Flood Fringe District, respectively. The cost
of all structural alterations and additions must include all costs such as
construction materials and a reasonable cost placed on all manpower or labor.
      d.   If any nonconforming use, or any use of a nonconforming structure,
is discontinued for more than one year, any future use of the premises must
conform to this chapter. The Assessor must notify the Zoning Administrator in
writing of instances of nonconformities that have been discontinued for a
period of more than one year.
      e.   If any nonconformity is substantially damaged, as defined in §
1101.02 Subd. 9. of this chapter, it may not be reconstructed except in
conformity with the provisions of this chapter. The applicable provisions for
establishing new uses or new structures in §§
1101.04 or
1101.05 will apply depending upon whether the use or structure is in the
Floodway or Flood Fringe, respectively.
      f.   If any nonconforming use or structure experiences a repetitive loss,
as defined in §
1101.02 Subd. 9. of this chapter, it must not be reconstructed except in
conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
      g.   Any substantial improvement, as defined in §
1101.02 Subd. 9. of this chapter, to a nonconforming structure requires that
the existing structure and any additions must meet the requirements of §§
1101.04 or
1101.05 of this chapter for new structures, depending upon whether the
structure is in the Floodway or Flood Fringe District.

1101.12 PENALTIES AND ENFORCEMENT.
Subd. 1.   Violation constitutes a misdemeanor. Violation of the provisions of
this chapter or failure to comply with any of its requirements (including
violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants
of variances or conditional uses) constitute a misdemeanor and will be
punishable as defined by law.
Subd. 2.   Other lawful action. Nothing in this chapter restricts the city from
taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any
violation. If the responsible party does not appropriately respond to the
Zoning Administrator within the specified period of time, each additional day
that lapses will constitute an additional violation of this chapter and will be
prosecuted accordingly.
Subd. 3.   Enforcement. Violations of the provisions of this chapter will be
investigated and resolved in accordance with the provisions of this zoning
code. In responding to a suspected ordinance violation, the Zoning
Administrator and City Council may utilize the full array of enforcement
actions available to it including but not limited to prosecution and fines,
injunctions, after-the-fact permits, orders for corrective measures or a
request to the National Flood Insurance Program for denial of flood insurance
availability to the guilty party. The city must act in good faith to enforce

established in connection with grants of variances or conditional uses) shall
constitute a misdemeanor and shall be punishable as defined by law.
Subd. 2.   Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City of Shorewood from
taking other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.
The actions may include but are not limited to:
      a.   In responding to a suspected ordinance violation, the Zoning
Administrator and Shorewood may utilize the full array of enforcement actions
available to it, including, but not limited to prosecution and fines,
injunctions, after-the-fact permits, orders for corrective measures or a
request to the National Flood Insurance Program for denial of flood insurance
availability to the guilty party. Shorewood must act in good faith to enforce
these official controls and to correct ordinance violations to the extent
possible so as not to jeopardize its eligibility in the National Flood
Insurance Program.
      b.   When an ordinance violation is either discovered by or brought to
the attention of the Zoning Administrator, the Zoning Administrator shall
immediately investigate the situation and document the nature and extent of the
violation of the official control. As soon as is reasonably possible, this
information will be submitted to the appropriate Department of Natural
Resources and Federal Emergency Management Agency Regional Office along with
Shorewood’s plan of action to correct the violation to the degree possible.
      c.   The Zoning Administrator shall notify the suspected party of the
requirements of this chapter and all other official controls and the nature and
extent of the suspected violation of these controls. If the structure or use is
under construction or development, the Zoning Administrator may order the
construction or development immediately halted until a proper permit or
approval is granted by the city. If the construction or development is already
completed, then the Zoning Administrator may either:
         (1)   Issue an order identifying the corrective actions that must be
made within a specified time period to bring the use or structure into
compliance with the official controls; or
         (2)   Notify the responsible party to apply for an after-the-fact
permit/development approval within a specified period of time not to exceed 30
days.

1102.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
Subd. 1.   The City of Shorewood is a residential community located on the
south shore of Lake Minnetonka and it includes within its boundaries the
largest portion of Christmas Lake, Silver Lake, Lake Mary, a portion of Lake
Virginia and Galpin Lake, together with numerous inlets, harbors, bays,
wetlands, woods and valleys. The name of this city denotes its character--
a city of shoreland, water and woods--natural assets its citizens hold in trust
for future generations. It is in the public interest to protect these assets
against haphazard, uncoordinated and unplanned development which may affect in
some way lowlands, marshes, wetlands, swamps, lakes and watercourses within the
city.
Subd. 2.   Recognizing the obligation to protect these assets and natural
resource gifts from destruction and pollution of all kinds, and in order to
carry out a program of coordinated land and water management, the following
standards, prohibitions, regulations and requirements are hereinafter set
forth. In addition to the general purposes, the specific intent of this chapter
is to:
      a.   Reduce danger to health by protecting surface and ground water
supplies from the impairment which results from incompatible land uses by
providing safe and sanitary drainage;
      b.   Permit and encourage planned development land uses which will not
impede the flow of flood water or cause danger to life or property;
      c.   Permit and encourage land uses compatible with the preservation of
the natural vegetation and marshes which are a principal factor in the
maintenance of constant rates of water flow through the year and which sustain
many species of wildlife and plant growth;
      d.   Avoid fast runoff of surface waters from developed areas to prevent
pollution materials such as animal feces, motor oils, paper, sand, salt and
other debris, garbage and foreign materials from being carried directly into
the nearest natural stream, lake or other public waters;
      e.   Prevent the development of structures in areas which will adversely
affect the public passage and use of creeks, marshes, lowlands and watercourses
within the city.
(1987 Code, § 1102.01)

TREE PRESERVATION
Section
1103.01   Purpose and intent
1103.02   Regulations
1103.03   Penalty and enforcement
1103.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   It is the policy of the city to recognize and preserve existing natural
resources of the community. In its effort to maintain the wooded character of
the area, the city finds that trees provide numerous benefits, including:
stabilization of the soil by the prevention of erosion and sedimentation,
reduction of stormwater runoff, improvement of air quality, reduction of noise
pollution, control of urban heat island effect, protection and increase of
property values, protection of privacy, energy conservation through natural
insulation providing habitat for birds and other wildlife and conservation and
enhancement of the city’s physical and aesthetic environment. The purpose of
these regulations is to preserve and protect significant trees or stands of
trees whose loss due to land disturbances associated with the process of
development or construction would adversely effect the city’s existing natural
resources. The regulations also recognize that despite the best efforts of the
city and developers and property owners, trees will occasionally be lost in the
development and construction process. In such instances, these regulations will
require replacement of trees.
(1987 Code, § 1103.01)
1103.02 REGULATIONS.
   In furtherance of the purpose of this section, the City Council shall, by
resolution adopt and may, from time-to-time, amend resolutions providing for
tree preservation and replacement in situations involving development or
construction.
(1987 Code, § 1103.02)
1103.03 PENALTY AND ENFORCEMENT.
   Failure to comply with the provisions of the regulations shall constitute a
violation of this code; the city shall proceed to enforcement either in
accordance with §
104.02.

1201.01 TITLE AND APPLICATION.
Subd. 1.   Title. This chapter shall be known as the “Shorewood Zoning
Ordinance” except as referred to herein, where it shall be known as “this
chapter.”
Subd. 2.   Intent and purpose. The intent of this chapter is to protect the
public health, safety and general welfare of the community and its people
through the establishment of minimum regulations governing development and use
of land. This chapter shall divide the city into use districts and establish
regulations in regard to location, erection, construction, reconstruction,
alteration and use of structures and land. The regulations are established to
protect the use areas; to promote orderly development and redevelopment; to
provide adequate light, air and convenience of access to property; to prevent
congestion in the public right-of-way; to prevent overcrowding of land and
undue concentration of structures by regulating land, buildings, yards and
density of population; to provide for compatibility of different land uses; to
provide for administration of this chapter to provide for amendments; to
prescribe penalties for violation of the regulations; and to define powers and
duties of the city staff, the Board of Adjustment and Appeals, the Planning
Commission and the City Council in relation to the zoning ordinance.
Subd. 3.   Relation to Comprehensive Plan. It is the policy of the City of
Shorewood that the enforcement, amendment and administration of this chapter be
accomplished with due consideration of the recommendations contained in the
Comprehensive Plan as developed and amended from time to time by the City
Council of the city. The Council recognizes the Comprehensive Plan as the
Policy Guide responsible for regulation of land use and development in
accordance with the policies and purpose herein set forth.
Subd. 4.   Application of requirements.
      a.   Relationship to other laws. Where the conditions imposed by any
provision of this chapter are either more or less restrictive than comparable
conditions imposed by any other ordinance, rule or regulation of the city the
ordinance, rule or regulation which imposes the more restrictive condition,
standard or requirement shall prevail. The Zoning Administrator shall determine
which is more restrictive and appeals from the determination may be made in the
manner provided herein.
      b.   Minimum requirement. In their interpretation and application, the
provisions of this chapter shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the
promotion of the public health, safety and welfare.
Subd. 5.   Conformance. Except as provided herein, no structure shall be
erected, converted, enlarged, reconstructed or altered, and no structure or
land shall be used for any purpose nor in any manner which is not in conformity
with the provisions of this chapter. Except as herein provided, no building,
structure or premises shall hereafter be used or occupied and no building
permit shall be granted that does not conform to the requirements of this
chapter.
Subd. 6.   Uses not provided for within zoning districts. Whenever in any
zoning district a use is neither specifically permitted nor denied, the use
shall be considered prohibited. In such case, the City Council, on its own
initiative or upon request, may conduct a study to determine if the use is
acceptable and if so what zoning district would be most appropriate and make a
determination as to conditions and standards relating to development of the
use. The City Council or property owner, upon receipt of the staff study shall,
if appropriate, initiate an amendment to the zoning ordinance to provide for
the particular use under consideration or shall find that the use is not
compatible for development within the city.
Subd. 7.   Rules. The language set forth in the text of this chapter shall be
interpreted in accordance with the following rules of construction:
      a.   The singular number includes the plural, and the plural the
singular;
      b.   The present tense includes the past and the future tenses, and the
future the present;
      c.   The word SHALL is mandatory while the word MAY is permissive;
      d.   The masculine gender includes the feminine and neuter;

this chapter, its meaning shall be construed as set forth in the definition
thereof;
      f.   All measured distances expressed in feet shall be the nearest tenth
of a foot.
Subd. 8.   Separability. It is declared to be the intention of the city that
the several provisions of this chapter are separable in accordance with the
following:
      a.   Other parts of this chapter. If any court of competent jurisdiction
shall adjudge any provision of this chapter to be invalid, the judgment shall
not affect any other provisions of this chapter not specifically included in
the judgment;
      b.   Application to other party. If any court of competent jurisdiction
shall adjudge invalid the application of any provision of this chapter to a
particular property, building or other structure, the judgment shall not affect
the application of the provision to any other property, building or structure
not specifically included in the judgment.
Subd. 9.   Authority. This chapter is enacted pursuant to the authority granted
by the Municipal Planning Act, M.S. §§ 462.351 to 462.363.
Subd. 10.   Comprehensive revision. The Council intends this chapter to be a
comprehensive revision to the Shorewood Zoning Ordinance, as amended. Except as
otherwise provided herein, the provisions of this chapter are not intended to
alter, diminish or increase or otherwise modify any rights or liabilities
existing on its effective date. Any act done, offense committed or rights
accruing or accrued or liability or penalty incurred or imposed prior to the
effective date of this chapter is not affected by its enactment.

1201.03 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
Subd. 1.   Nonconforming buildings, structures and uses.
      a.   Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to regulate nonconforming
structures and uses and to specify those requirements, circumstances and
conditions under which nonconforming structures and uses will be operated and
maintained. The zoning ordinance establishes separate uses which are permitted
in that district. It is necessary and consistent with the establishment of
these districts that nonconforming structures and uses not be permitted to
continue without restriction. Furthermore, it is the intent of this section
that all nonconforming uses shall be eventually brought into conformity.
      b.   Any structure or use lawfully existing upon the effective date of
this chapter shall not be expanded, but may be continued at the size and in the
manner of operation existing upon the date except as hereinafter specified or
subsequently amended.
      c.   Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the placing of a nonconforming
structure into safe condition when the structure is declared unsafe by the
Building Official, unless the use is destroyed by fire or other peril to the
extent of 50% of its market value, and no building permit has been applied for
within 180 days of when the property is damaged. The market value shall be
determined by the City Assessor.
      d.   In instances where complete compliance cannot be achieved,
nonconforming structures may be moved or rebuilt, when it can be demonstrated
that the structure has less impact on adjacent properties, and conforms
substantially better with current zoning requirements. Approval of such cases
shall take into consideration existing and proposed landscaping, sight lines,
and site drainage, and shall be subject to review and recommendation by the
Planning Commission and approval by the City Council.
      e.   When any lawful nonconforming use of any structure or land in any
district has been changed to a conforming use, it shall not thereafter be
changed to any nonconforming use.
      f.   A lawful nonconforming use of a structure or parcel of land may be
changed to lessen the nonconformity of use. Once a nonconforming structure or
parcel of land has been changed, it shall not thereafter be so altered to
increase the nonconformity.
      g.   Any structure or use lawfully existing upon the effective date of
this chapter may be continued, including through repair, replacement,
restoration, maintenance, or improvement, but not including expansion, unless
the structure is removed or the use discontinued for a period of more than one
year, after which the land on which the nonconformity is located shall be
subject to all of the regulations specified by these zoning regulations for the
district in which the land and structures are located.
      h.   Alterations may be made to a building containing lawful
nonconforming residential units when they will improve the livability thereof,
provided they will not increase the number of dwelling units or the
nonconformity.
      i.   Lawful nonconforming, single-family residential units may be
expanded, provided:
         (1)   That the expansion does not increase the nonconformity and
complies with height and setback requirements of the district in which it is
located;
         (2)   That if the nonconformity exists because the lot area does not
meet the minimum requirement for the district in which it is located, the
expansion shall not increase the floor area of all structures to lot area ratio
to greater than 30%.
         (3)   That the granting of the expansion shall not adversely affect
the aesthetics or character of the adjacent property.
         (4)   That any expansion shall take into consideration the protection
of light and air to the adjacent property.
         (5)   That in cases where a structure is too close to a lot line, the
city may require that the discrepancy be made up by enlarging the opposite
required yard space. (Example: where a building is eight feet from a side lot
line in a district in which a ten foot setback is required, the city may
require a 12 foot setback on the other side.)
Subd. 2.   General building and performance requirements.
      a.   Purpose. The purpose of this section of the zoning ordinance is to
establish general development performance standards. These standards are
intended and designated to assure compatibility of uses; to prevent urban
blight, deterioration and decay; and to enhance the health, safety and general
welfare of the residents of the community.
      b.   Dwelling unit restriction.
         (1)   No cellar, basement, garage, tent or accessory building shall at
any time be used as an independent residence or dwelling unit, temporarily or
permanently. In residential districts recreational vehicles or equipment may be
used as temporary living quarters, on property where an occupied residence
exists, for no more than 14 days in any calendar year. There shall be no open
discharge of sanitary waste from the vehicle or equipment.
         (2)   Basements may be used as living quarters or rooms as a portion
of residential dwellings.
         (3)   Earth-sheltered housing shall not be considered as a basement or
cellar.
         (4)   Tents, playhouses or similar structures may be used for play or
recreational purposes.
         (5)   All dwelling units shall be serviced with sanitary sewer, water
supply and energy supply systems.
         (6)   Pursuant to authority granted by M.S. § 462.3593, Subd. 9, the
city opts-out of the requirements of M.S. § 462.3593, which defines and
regulates temporary family health care dwellings.
      c.   Property development.
         (1)   Any person desiring to improve property for which a building
permit is required shall submit to the Building Official a survey prepared by a
registered surveyor of the property showing the location and dimensions of
existing and proposed structures, location of easements crossing the property,
encroachments and any other information which may be necessary to ensure
conformance to city ordinances. The Building Official may waive the requirement
of a survey in cases where it is deemed unnecessary or where the location of
property boundaries can be verified.
         (2)   All structures shall be so placed so that they will not obstruct
future streets which may be constructed by the city in conformity with existing
streets and according to the system and standards employed by the city.
         (3)   A lot of record existing upon the effective date of this chapter
in a residential district which does not meet the requirements of this chapter
as to area or width may be utilized for a single-family detached dwelling
purpose, provided that:
            (a)   The lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous
frontage with other lots in the same ownership;
            (b)   The measurement of the area and width are within 70% of the
requirements of this chapter;
            (c)   Setbacks and yard requirements shall be in conformance with
this chapter;
            (d)   The ratio of the floor area of all structures to lot area
shall not exceed 30%.
         (4)   Except in the case of planned unit development as provided for
in §
1201.06 of this chapter, not more than one principal building shall be located
on a lot. The city may, by interim conditional use permit, allow a single-
family residential dwelling to remain on a lot while a new dwelling is being
constructed on the same lot, provided that:
            (a)   The new dwelling shall conform to the setback requirements of
the zoning district in which it is located;
            (b)   Construction of the new dwelling shall not result in
substantially greater site alteration (for example, tree removal or grading)
than if the original house is first removed;
            (c)   The property owner must provide an estimate from a licensed
contractor for the cost of removing the original dwelling and restoring the
site. From this estimate the city shall require a cash escrow or letter of
credit in the amount of 150% of the estimate to ensure that the original
dwelling will be removed within two weeks of the date that a certificate of
occupancy is issued for the new dwelling. In no instance shall the original
home remain on the property longer than two years;
            (d)   The property owner shall provide the cash escrow or letter of
credit referenced in (c) above at the time a building permit is issued for the
new dwelling. The new dwelling shall not be occupied until a certificate of
occupancy has been issued; and
            (e)   The request shall be subject to the requirements of §
1201.04 Subd. 4. of this chapter.
         (5)   On a through lot both street lines shall be front lot lines for
the application of the yard and parking regulations of this chapter.
         (6)   The improvements shall be in compliance with the standards
established by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency’s NPDES/SDS Construction
Stormwater General Permit MNR100001 (CSW Permit), the MPCA’s Small Municipal
Separate Storm Sewer Systems General permit MNR040000 (MS4 Permit), either
Minnehaha Creek Watershed District rules or Riley Purgatory Bluff Creek
Watershed District rules as may apply, and the City of Shorewood’s Surface
Water Management Plan as now constituted and from time to time amended.
      d.   Accessory buildings, structures, uses and equipment.
         (1)   No detached accessory building or structure shall be allowed on
any lot without a principal building to which it is accessory.
         (2)   No detached accessory building shall exceed 15 feet or one story
in height.

including attached garages, or combination of accessory buildings but excluding
docks shall exceed three in number, nor 1,200 square feet in area in the R 1A,
R 1B, R 1C, R 2A, R 2B and R 3A Districts, nor 1,000 square feet in area in the
R 1D, R 2C, R 3B and R-C Districts, except by conditional use permit as
provided for in §
1201.04 of this chapter. In addition the following conditions shall apply:
            (a)   The total area of accessory buildings shall not exceed the
floor area of all stories above grade of the principal structure. The City
Council may grant an exception for greenhouses, as defined herein, under the
following conditions:

exceed 7% of the minimum lot area for the district in which the property is
located.
            (b)   In no case shall the total area of accessory buildings exceed
10% of the minimum lot area for the district in which the property is located.
            (c)   In evaluating the conditional use permit, the city shall take
into consideration the location of existing and proposed structures, site
drainage and landscaping.
            (d)   The architectural character of proposed accessory buildings
shall be similar and consistent with other buildings on the site and in the
area.
            (e)   Properties occupied by nonconforming accessory structures are
not allowed to exceed three accessory structures, or to exceed 1,000 square
feet or 1,200 square feet of accessory floor area, based upon the district in
which they are located.
               Exception: An existing nonconforming accessory structure may be
allowed to remain nonconforming, and the total number of accessory structures
or the total area of accessory space may be expanded, provided that the
following can be demonstrated with respect to the nonconforming accessory
structure:
                  (i)   The applicant can demonstrate that the structure was

Subd. 11.   Sign regulations.
      a.   Findings. The City Council hereby finds it necessary for the
promotion and preservation of the public health, safety, welfare, and
aesthetics of the community that the construction, location, size, conspicuity,
brightness, legibility, operational characteristics and maintenance of signs be
controlled. Signs have a direct and substantial impact on traffic safety,
pedestrian safety, community aesthetics and property values. The City Council
recognizes that a great percentage of signs that are blighted, unattractive, or
provide an unsafe distraction to motorists can be corrected by sensible quality
control through adequate maintenance, inspection, and operational guidelines.
The City Council also recognizes that signs provide a guide to the physical
environment and, as such, serve an important function to the community and
economy. The City Council further finds as follows:
         (1)   Exterior signs can have a substantial impact on the character of
the community and the quality of the environment.
         (2)   Uncontrolled and unlimited signs can create traffic hazards,
aesthetic concerns and detriments to property values, thereby threatening the
public health, safety and welfare.
         (3)   Signs provide an important medium through which individuals may
convey a variety of messages.
         (4)   The city’s zoning regulations have, since as early as 1956,
included the regulations of signs in an effort to provide adequate means of
expression and to provide the economic viability of the business community,
while protecting the city and its citizens from a proliferation of signs of a
type, size, location and character that could adversely impact upon the
aesthetics of the community and threaten the health, safety and welfare of the
community.
         (5)   The regulation of the physical characteristics of signs has had
a positive impact on traffic safety and the appearance of the community.
      b.   Purpose and intent. The City Council intends by this chapter to
establish a legal framework for sign regulation in the city. The regulations
promulgated in this chapter are intended to facilitate an easy and agreeable
communication between people while protecting and promoting the public health,
safety, welfare, and aesthetics of the community.
         (1)   It is not the purpose or intent of these sign regulations to
prefer or favor commercial messages or speech over noncommercial messages or
speech, nor is it the purpose or intent of these sign regulations to
discriminate between types of noncommercial speech or the viewpoints
represented therein. It is not the purpose or intent of these sign regulations
to regulate the message displayed on any sign; nor is it the purpose or intent
of this subdivision to regulate any building design or any display not defined
as a sign, or any sign that cannot be viewed from outside of a building.
         (2)   The purpose and intent of these sign regulations is to:
            (a)   Regulate the number, location, size, type, illumination and
other physical characteristics of signs within the city in order to promote the
public health, safety and welfare.
            (b)   Maintain, enhance, and improve the aesthetic environment of
the city by preventing visual clutter when harmful to the appearance of the
community.
            (c)   Improve the visual appearance of the city while providing for
effective means of communication, consistent with constitutional guarantees and
the city’s goals of public safety and aesthetics.
            (d)   Provide for fair and consistent enforcement of the sign
regulations set forth in this subdivision under the zoning authority of the
city.
      c.   Effect. A sign may be erected, mounted, displayed or maintained in
the city if it is in conformance with the provisions of this subdivision. The
effect of these regulations is to:
         (1)   Allow a wide variety of sign types in commercial zones, and a
more limited variety of signs in other zones;
         (2)   Allow signs that are designed, constructed, installed and
maintained in a manner that does not adversely impact public safety or unduly
distract motorists;
         (3)   Allow certain small, unobtrusive signs incidental to the
principal use of a site in all zones when in compliance with the requirements
of this subdivision;
         (4)   Prohibit signs whose location, size, type, illumination or other
physical characteristics negatively affect the natural or built environment and
where the communication can be accomplished by means having a lesser impact on
the environment and the public health, safety and welfare; and
         (5)   Provide for the enforcement of the provisions of these
regulations.
      d.   Scope and applicability. All signs installed within the city are
subject to the sign regulations of this subdivision and all other applicable
provisions of this chapter. Signs are accessory uses and shall be permitted
only in those zoning districts where they are specifically listed as allowable
accessory uses, except for signs installed on vacant lots marketed for sale or
lease.
      e.   Substitution. The owner of any sign that is otherwise allowed by
this subdivision may substitute noncommercial speech in lieu of any other
commercial speech or noncommercial speech. This substitution of copy may be
made without any additional approval or permitting. The purpose of this
provision is to prevent any inadvertent favoring of commercial speech over
noncommercial speech or favoring of any particular noncommercial speech over
any other noncommercial speech. This provision prevails over any more specific
provision to the contrary.
      f.   Permit required.
         (1)   Permanent signs. Except as expressly provided in subdivision
11.f.(7), no permanent sign may be erected, altered, reconstructed, maintained
or moved without first securing a permit from the city. The content of the

signs allowed on any property, but must adhere to the other regulations of this
subdivision.
         (7)   Illumination. Illumination for signs must be constructed and
maintained so that the source of light is not visible from the public right-of-
way or a property used or zoned for residential purposes and consistent with
the regulations in subdivision 2.h. of this section. Illumination must be
authorized in the specific district in which the sign is located.
         (8)   Dynamic display. The purpose of this subdivision is to allow new
technologies in commercial signage that allow messages to be easily updated,
while at the same time preventing distraction to motorists and minimizing
visual impacts of electronic signage on residential properties. The city finds
that dynamic displays should be allowed on signs but with significant controls
to minimize their proliferation and their potential threat to public safety.
            (a)   Authorization. Signs with dynamic display are only permitted
in the zoning districts listed in subdivision 11.h. of this section that
specifically authorize them.
            (b)   Freestanding signs only. Signs with dynamic displays shall
only be allowed as part of freestanding signs.
            (c)   Setbacks/hours. Signs with dynamic displays must be a minimum
of 20 feet from side lot lines and 100 feet from adjacent residential
districts. Dynamic display signs within 500 feet of residential properties
shall be programmed to freeze the image between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 6:
00 a.m.
            (d)   Area limitation. Dynamic displays may occupy no greater than
25% of the actual copy and graphic area. The remainder of the signs shall not
have the capability to have dynamic displays even if they are not used. Only
one dynamic display area is allowed on a sign face. The dynamic display sign
shall be located at the bottom of the sign face.
            (e)   Duration of image for time/temperature. A display of time,
date, or temperature must remain for the duration specified in subdivision
11.h. of this section, before changing to a different display, but the time,
date, or temperature information itself may change no more often than once
every 60 seconds.
            (f)   Transition. If a dynamic display sign’s image or any portion
thereof changes, the change sequence must be instantaneous without any special
effects.
            (g)   Video display. No portion of a dynamic display sign may
change any part of its sign face by a method of display characterized by motion
or pictorial imagery, or depict action or a special effect to imitate movement,
or display pictorials or graphics in a progression of frames that gives the
illusion of motion of any kind.
            (h)   Fluctuating or flashing illumination. No portion of a dynamic
display sign image may fluctuate in light intensity or use intermittent, strobe
or moving light, or light that changes in intensity in sudden transitory
bursts, streams, zooms, twinkles, sparkles or in any other manner that creates
the illusion of movement.
            (i)   Audio. Dynamic display signs shall not be equipped with audio
speakers.
            (j)   Malfunctions. Dynamic display signs must be designed and
equipped to freeze the sign face in one position if a malfunction occurs.
Dynamic display signs must also be equipped with a means to immediately
discontinue the display if it malfunctions, and the sign owner or operator must
immediately turn off the display when notified by the city that it is not
complying with the standards of this subdivision.
            (k)   Brightness. All dynamic display signs shall meet the
following brightness standards:
               (i)   No dynamic display sign may exceed a maximum illumination
of 5,000 nits (candelas per square meter) during daylight hours and a maximum
illumination of 500 nits (candelas per square meter) between sunset to sunrise
as measured from the sign’s face at maximum brightness.
               (ii)   All dynamic display signs having illumination by means
other than natural light must be equipped with an ambient light sensor and a
dimmer control or other mechanism to continuously adjust the sign’s brightness
to ensure at any time the sign’s intensity does not exceed 0.3 foot candles
above ambient light levels as measured from 100 feet from the sign’s face and
automatically controls the sign’
               (iii)   No dynamic display sign may be of such intensity or
brilliance that it interferes with the effectiveness of an official traffic
sign, device or signal.
               (iv)   The owner or controller of the dynamic display sign must
adjust the sign to meet these brightness standards in accordance with the
city’s instructions. The adjustment must be made immediately upon notice of
non-compliance from the city.
               (v)   A written certification from the sign manufacturer that
light intensity has been preset to conform to the brightness levels established
by code and that the preset level is protected from end user manipulation by
password protected software or other method. This would offer the advantage of
ensuring that electronic signs at a minimum cannot exceed the standards.
         (9)   Temporary signs for properties available for sale, lease or
rent. Such properties may have the following additional signs:
            (a)   The maximum size of signs shall not exceed six square feet
for single-family, two-family, townhouse or quadraminium homes nor more than 20
square feet for multiple-family or nonresidential uses.
            (b)   The maximum height of the signs is eight feet.
            (c)   One sign is permitted per street frontage. Lakeshore lots may
have an additional sign oriented to the lake.
            (d)   Signs must be removed from the property within 14 days after
the sale or the building is leased/rented.
            (e)   The signs may not be illuminated.
         (10)   Flags. A maximum of four flags may be displayed on any one
property on freestanding poles and the height of the flagpole shall not exceed
the height allowed for a principal building in the applicable zoning district.
         (11)   Interior signage. This subdivision shall not apply to any signs
installed within buildings provided they are a minimum of three feet within the
building and not visible from outside the building.
         (12)   Traffic signs (public). No regulations in this subdivision
shall apply to public signs used for traffic or traffic control installed by or
directed to be installed by a federal, state, county or local government.
         (13)   Temporary signs for new nonresidential uses. Any new
nonresidential use that has applied for its permanent business sign may, at the
same time, apply for a permit for a temporary sign to be displayed for no
longer than 30 days, or until the permanent sign has been erected, whichever
comes first. The temporary sign shall be no larger than the approved permanent
sign.
         (14)   Temporary signs for properties with construction not related to
subdivision. One additional temporary sign may be installed on any property
where construction is occurring, but shall not exceed six square feet for
single-family, two-family, townhouse or quadraminium nor more than 20 square
feet for multiple-family or nonresidential uses. The sign shall be removed from
the site when the construction project is finished or two years from the
initial installation, whichever comes first. The maximum height of such signage
is eight feet.

Subd. 12.   Home occupations.
      a.   Purpose. The primary purpose of this subdivision is to provide a
means through establishment of specific standards and procedures by which home
occupations can be conducted in residential neighborhoods without jeopardizing
the health, safety and general welfare of the surrounding neighborhood. In
addition, this subdivision is intended to provide a mechanism enabling the
distinction between limited home occupations and special home occupations, so
that limited home occupations may be allowed as accessory uses within
residential zoning.
      b.   Application. Subject to the nonconforming use provision of this
section, all occupations conducted in the home shall comply with the provisions
of this subdivision.
      c.   Procedures and permits.
         (1)   Limited home occupation. Any home occupation, as defined in this
code and which qualifies as a limited home occupation under subsection d.(2) of
this section shall be allowed as accessory uses in all residential zoning
districts. Limited home occupations are allowed without a permit, but shall
comply with all other applicable provisions of this code.
         (2)   Special home occupation. Any home occupation which does not meet
the specific requirements for a limited home occupation as set forth in
subsection d.(2) of this section shall require a special home occupation permit
which shall be applied for, reviewed and disposed of in accordance with the
conditional use provisions of §
1201.04 of this chapter.
         (3)   Declaration of conditions. The Planning Commission may recommend
and the City Council may impose the conditions on the granting of a special
home occupation permit as may be necessary to carry out the purpose and
provisions of this subdivision.
         (4)   Effect of permit. A special home occupation permit may be issued
for a period of one year after which the permit may be reissued for periods of
up to three years each. Each application for permit renewal shall however, be
processed in accordance with the procedural requirements of the initial special
home occupation permit, except that notice of a public hearing need not be
published in the official city newspaper.
         (5)   Transferability. Permits shall not run with the land and shall
not be transferable.
         (6)   Lapse of special home occupation permit by non-use. Whenever,
within one year after granting a permit, the use as approved by the permit
shall not have been initiated, then the permit shall become null and void
unless a petition for extension of time in which to complete the work has been
granted by the City Council. The extension shall be requested in writing and
filed with the Zoning Administrator at least 30 days before the expiration of
the original permit. There shall be no charge for the filing of the petition.
The request for extension shall state facts showing a good faith attempt to
initiate the use. The petition shall be presented to the Planning Commission
for a recommendation and to the City Council for a decision.
         (7)   Reconsideration. Whenever an application for a permit has been
considered and denied by the City Council, a similar application for a permit
affecting substantially the same property shall not be considered again by the
Planning Commission or City Council for at least six months from the date of
its denial unless a decision to reconsider the matter is made by not less than
four-fifths vote of the full City Council.
         (8)   Renewal of permits. An applicant shall not have a vested right
to a permit renewal by reason of having obtained a previous permit. In applying
for and accepting a permit, the permit holder agrees that his or her monetary
investment in the home occupation will be fully amortized over the life of the
permit and that a permit renewal will not be needed to amortize the investment.
Each application for the renewal of a permit will be considered as a new permit
without taking into consideration that a previous permit has been granted. The
previous granting or renewal of a permit shall not constitute a precedent or
basis for the renewal of a permit.

with the following general provisions and according to classification, the
applicable requirement provisions.

compatible with surrounding land uses.
      b.   Development of towers.
         (1)    A tower shall be a conditional use in the C-1, General

distance equal to twice the height of the proposed tower of any use that
involves the storage, distribution or sale of volatile, flammable, explosive or
hazardous materials such as LP gas, propane, gasoline, natural gas and
corrosive or dangerous chemicals, unless the applicant can demonstrate with
credible engineering data, to the satisfaction of the city, that no danger
exists in locating the telecommunications facilities in the proposed proximity
to the uses.

accommodating additional telecommunications facilities owned by other persons,
and the tower owner agrees to comply with the provisions of the subsection
relating to existing towers. A new tower shall be designed and built to
accommodate three times the tower’s initial loading capacity. If the tower is
less than 100 feet in height it shall be built to accommodate two times the
tower’s initial loading capacity.
            (b)   A development approval to develop, build, construct or erect
a tower will not be granted to a person on the basis that it is economically
unfeasible for that person to co-locate or install telecommunications
facilities on a tower or antenna support structure owned by another person.
         (5)   An application to develop a tower must include:
            (a)   The names, addresses and telephone numbers of all owners of
other towers or antenna support structures and the locations of the structures,
within a one mile radius of the proposed new tower site;

but unsuccessful efforts for permission to install or co-locate the applicant’s
telecommunications facilities on towers or antenna support structures located
within a one-half mile radius of the proposed tower site;
            (c)   Written, technical evidence from an engineer that the
proposed tower or telecommunications facilities cannot be installed or co-
located on another person’s tower or antenna support structure located within a
one half mile radius of the proposed tower site and must be located at the
proposed site in order to meet the coverage requirements of the applicant’s
wireless communications system;
            (d)   A written statement from an engineer that the construction
and placement of the tower will not interfere with public safety communications
and the usual and customary transmission or reception of radio, television or
other communications service enjoyed by adjacent residential and nonresidential
properties;
            (e)   Written evidence from an engineer that the proposed structure
meets the structural requirements of this code.
         (6)   Setbacks.
            (a)   A tower must be located on a single parcel such that the base
of the tower is no closer to the property line than the height of the tower,
unless a qualified engineer specifies in writing that the failure of the tower
will occur within a lesser distance under reasonably foreseeable circumstances.
In no case will the tower be located outside the buildable area of the lot.
            (b)   Setback requirements for towers are measured from the base of
the tower to the property line of the parcel on which it is located.
         (7)   Structural requirements. Towers must be designed and certified
by an engineer to be structurally sound and, at minimum, in conformance with
the Uniform Building Code and any other standards set forth in this
subdivision.
         (8)   Height. A tower may not exceed 125 feet in height.
         (9)   Separation or buffer requirements. Towers must be separated from
land used or planned for residential use by a minimum of 90 feet or 100% of the
height of the proposed tower, whichever is greater. Setbacks may be reduced
where abutting nonresidential uses, but in no case shall the setback be less
than that which is required for the zoning district in which the property is
located. The minimum tower separation distance is calculated and applied
irrespective of city jurisdictional boundaries. Measurement of tower separation
distances for the purpose of compliance with this subdivision is measured from
the base of a tower to the closest point of the proposed site.
         (10)   Method of determining tower height. Measurement of tower height
must include the tower structure itself, the base pad and any other
telecommunications facilities attached thereto. Tower height is measured from
grade.
         (11)   Illumination. Towers may not be artificially lighted except as
required by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). At time of construction
of a tower, in cases where there are residential uses located within a distance
which is three times the height of the tower from the tower, dual mode lighting
must be requested from the FAA. Notwithstanding this provision, the City
Council may approve the placement of an antennae on an existing or proposed
lighting standard, provided that the antennae is integrated with the lighting
standard.
         (12)   Exterior finish. Towers not requiring FAA painting or marking
must have an exterior finish as approved in the site plan.
         (13)   Fencing. Fences constructed around or upon parcels containing
towers, antenna support structures or telecommunications facilities must be
constructed in accordance with the applicable fencing requirements in the
zoning district where the tower or antenna support structure is located, unless
more stringent fencing requirements are required by FCC regulations.
         (14)   Landscaping. Landscaping on parcels containing towers, antenna
support structures or telecommunications facilities must be in accordance with
landscaping requirements in the site plan. Utility buildings and structures
accessory to a tower must be architecturally designed to blend in with the
surrounding environment and to meet the setback requirements as are compatible
with the actual placement of the tower. Ground mounted equipment must be
screened from view by suitable vegetation, except where a design of non-
vegetative screening better reflects and complements the character of the
surrounding neighborhood. Accessory buildings may not be more than 2,000 square
feet in size.
         (15)   Security. Towers must be reasonably posted and secured to
protect against trespass.
         (16)   Access. Parcels upon which towers are located must provide
access during normal business hours to at least one paved vehicular parking
space on site.
         (17)   Stealth. All towers shall be, to greatest extent reasonably
possible, in the discretion of the city, of stealth design. Stealth shall not
require towers or telecommunications facilities to be totally hidden and does
not necessarily exclude the use of uncamouflaged lattice, guyed or monopole
tower designs.
         (18)   Existing towers.
            (a)   Any owner upon whose land a tower is located, which contains
additional capacity for installation or co-location of telecommunications
facilities, may allow other persons to install or co-locate telecommunications
facilities on a tower. Any co- location shall require amendment of the original
conditional use permit granted for the tower.
            (b)   An existing tower may be modified to accommodate co- location
of additional telecommunications facilities as follows:
               (i)   Application for a building permit shall be made to the
City Building Official;
               (ii)   The total height of the modified tower and
telecommunications facilities attached thereto shall be established by the new
conditional use permit, if granted;
               (iii)   Permission to exceed the existing height shall not
require an additional distance separation from designated areas as set forth in
this subdivision. The towers premodification height shall be used to calculate
the distance separations;
               (iv)   A tower which is being rebuilt to accommodate the co-
location of additional telecommunications facilities may be moved on site
subject to the setback requirements of this subdivision.
         (19)   Abandoned or unused towers or portions of towers. Abandoned or
unused towers and associated above-ground facilities must be removed within six
months of the cessation of operations of an antenna facility at the site unless
an extension is approved by the City Council. A copy of the relevant portions
of a signed lease that requires the applicant to remove the tower and
associated facilities upon cessation of operations at the site must be
submitted at the time of application. If a tower is not removed within six
months of the cessation of operations at a site, the tower and associated
facilities may be removed by the city and the costs of removal assessed against
the property.
         (20)   Evaluation and monitoring. As a condition of approval for
telecommunication facilities, the applicant shall reimburse the city for its
costs to retain outside expert technical assistance to evaluate any aspect of
the proposed siting of telecommunications facilities. The owner of a
telecommunications facility shall provide the city with current, technical
evidence of compliance with FCC radiation emission requirements, annually or
more frequently at the city’s reasonable request. If the owner does not
promptly provide the city with satisfactory technical evidence of FCC
compliance, the city may carry out tests to ensure FCC radiation compliance
using a qualified expert. The owner shall reimburse the city for its reasonable
costs in carrying out the compliance testing.
         (21)   Variances. The City Council may grant a variance to the
setback, separation or buffer requirements and maximum height provision of this
subdivision based only on the criteria set forth in §
1201.05 of this code.
         (22)   Additional criteria for variance. The City Council may grant a
variance pursuant to §
1201.05 of this code if the applicant also demonstrates with written or other
satisfactory evidence that:
            (a)   The location, shape, appearance or nature of use of the
proposed tower will not substantially detract from the aesthetics of the area
and not change the character of the neighborhood in which the tower is proposed
to be located;
            (b)   The variance will not create a threat to the public health,
safety or welfare;
            (c)   In the case of a requested modification to the setback
requirement, that the size of plat upon which the tower is proposed to be
located makes compliance impossible, and the only alternative for the applicant
is to locate the tower at another site but poses a greater threat to the public
health, safety or welfare or is closer in proximity to a residentially zoned
land;
            (d)   In the case of a request for modification of separation
requirements, if the person provides written technical evidence from an
engineer that the proposed tower and telecommunications facilities must be
located at the proposed site in order to meet the coverage needs of the
applicant’s wireless communications system and if the person agrees to create
approved landscaping and other buffers to screen the tower from being visible
to the residential area;
            (e)   In the case of a request for modification of the maximum
height limit, that the modification is necessary to:
               (i)   Facilities co-location of telecommunications facilities in
order to avoid construction of a new tower; or
               (ii)   To meet the coverage requirements of the applicant’s
wireless communications system, which requirements must be documented with
written, technical evidence from an engineer.
         (23)   Failure to comply.
            (a)   If the permittee fails to comply with any of the terms
imposed by the conditional use permit, the city may impose penalties or
discipline for noncompliance, which may include revocation of the permit, in
accordance with the following provisions.
            (b)   Except as provided in subsection (23)(c) below, the
imposition of any penalty shall be preceded by:
               (i)   Written notice to the permittee of the alleged violation;
               (ii)   The opportunity to cure the violation during a period not
to exceed 30 days following receipt of the written notice; and
               (iii)   A hearing before the City Council at least 15 days after
sending written notice of the hearing. The notices contained in (i) and (iii)
may be contained in the same notification. The hearing shall provide the
permittee with an opportunity to show cause why the permit should not be
subject to discipline.
            (c)   If the city finds that exigent circumstances exist requiring
immediate permit revocation, the city may revoke the permit and shall provide a
post-revocation hearing before the City Council not more than 15 days after
permittee’s receipt of written notice of the hearing. Following the hearing,
the City Council may sustain or rescind the revocation or may impose the other
and further discipline as it deems appropriate.
            (d)   Any decision to impose a penalty or other discipline shall be
in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record.

variance, or for any other city approval required by this chapter, or to amend
this chapter, shall be made in writing on a form provided by the city, if the
city has a form, to the Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator is
authorized to reject in writing any incomplete application within 15 business
days of receipt if the application is incomplete, stating the reasons or its
rejection, including what information is missing. This rejection shall be sent
by first-class mail to the applicant. Every application shall contain the legal
description of the property and a statement of the specific permit or action
being sought. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the city from
requesting additional information from the applicant upon which to base a
decision.
         (2)   If a dispute arises over a specific fee imposed by the city, the
amount of the fee must be deposited and held in escrow, and the person
aggrieved by the fee may appeal to district court, as provided by M.S. §

         (2)   In the case of a conditional use permit, the Council may impose
any condition it considers necessary to protect the public health, safety and
welfare.
         (3)   In the case of an amendment, the amendment shall not become
effective until the time as the City Council approves an ordinance reflecting
the amendment and after the ordinance is published in the official newspaper.
         (4)   Whenever an application for an amendment or conditional use
permit has been considered and denied by the City Council, a similar
application for the amendment or conditional use permit affecting substantially
the same property shall not be considered again by the Planning Commission or
City Council for at least six months from the date of its denial; a subsequent
application affecting substantially the same property shall likewise not be
considered again by the Planning Commission or City Council for an additional
six months from the date of the second denial, unless a decision to reconsider
the matter is made a simple majority of the full City Council.
Subd. 2.   Amendments - initiation. The City Council or Planning Commission
may, upon their own motion, initiate a request to amend the text or the
district boundaries of this chapter. Any person owning real estate within the
city may initiate a request to amend the district boundaries or text of this
chapter so as to affect his or her own real estate.
Subd. 3.   Conditional use permit.
      a.   Purpose. The purpose of a conditional use permit is to provide the
City of Shorewood with a reasonable degree of discretion in determining the
suitability of certain designated uses upon the general welfare, public health
and safety. In making this determination, whether or not the conditional use is
to be allowed, the city may consider the nature of the adjoining land or
buildings, whether or not a similar use is already in existence and located on
the same premises or on other lands immediately close by, the effect upon
traffic into and from the premises or on any adjoining roads and all other or
future factors as the city shall deem a prerequisite of consideration in
determining the effect of the use on the general welfare, public health and
safety.
      b.   Informational requirement. The information required for all
conditional use permit applications generally consists of the following items
and shall be submitted with the application.

Council, but that with anticipated development or redevelopment, will not be
acceptable in the future; or
         (3)   To allow a use that is reflective of anticipated long range
change to an area and that is in compliance with the Comprehensive Plan,

appropriate for permission of the use. The conditions shall be set forth in a
development agreement between the property owner and the city, which agreement
shall be recorded with the Hennepin County Recorder or Registrar of Deeds.
      e.   Conditions of approval. In permitting a new interim conditional use
permit or amending an existing interim conditional use permit, the Planning
Commission may recommend and the City Council may impose, in addition to the
standards and requirements expressly specified by this code, additional
conditions that the Planning Commission or City Council consider necessary to
protect the best interest of the surrounding area or the community as a whole.
These conditions may include but are not limited to the following:

         (1)   The property is found to be in violation of the conditions
listed in the interim conditional use permit; or
         (2)   If access to the property for purpose of making and inspection
is refused to the Zoning Administrator or its designee. The same process
established for granting the interim conditional use permit shall be followed
when considering revocation of an interim conditional use permit.

air to adjacent property, unreasonably increase the congestion in the public
street, or increase the danger of fire or endanger the public safety.
         (5)   The variance, and its resulting construction or project, would
not be detrimental to the public welfare, nor would it be injurious to other
land or improvements in the neighborhood.
         (6)   The variance is the minimum variance necessary to address or
alleviate the practical difficulties.
      b.   Procedure.
         (1)   Pursuant to M.S. § 15.99, an application for a variance shall be

extend the 60 day time limit by a time period not to exceed 60 additional days,
provided written notice of such extension is provided to the applicant before

proposed change, development or use.
         (3)   Staff review/technical assistance reports. Upon receipt of an
application for variance, the Zoning Administrator, or designee, may request
additional information or may obtain outside expert advice at the consent and
expense of the applicant. When all informational requirements have been
complied with, the request shall be considered officially submitted. The Zoning
Administrator, or designee, shall prepare technical reports and/or provide

proceedings as set forth within this chapter.
         (5)   Planning Commission action. The Planning Commission shall

thereof may appear to answer questions concerning the proposed request. The
Planning Commission shall also take public testimony.

authority to request any additional information from the applicant deemed
necessary to establish performance conditions pertaining to the request with

majority vote of a quorum of the City Council.
            (b)   The Council may impose any condition it considers necessary
to protect the public health, safety and welfare, provided such conditions are

variance.
            (c)   Whenever an application for a variance has been considered
and denied by the City Council, a similar application for the variance
affecting substantially the same property shall not be considered again by the
Planning Commission or City Council for at least six months from the date of

use permitted in the variance. The Zoning Administrator shall present the
request to the City Council for a decision.

1201.24 L-R, LAKESHORE RECREATIONAL DISTRICT.
Subd. 1.   Purpose. This District is intended to recognize the desirability for
areas to serve the lakeshore recreational needs of the city which of their very
nature are by geographic necessity located in proximity and adjacent to
residential areas of this community. Lake Minnetonka is the largest single park
and recreational facility available for use by the citizens of this city and
the providing of an opportunity for access to that facility is, in the opinion
of the city, an adjunct of zoning by the city. Recognizing the primary
residential nature of Shorewood, it behooves the city to subject the possible
areas available for access to the lake to close scrutiny and limitation so as
to insure that use of the land does not unduly infringe upon property rights
and public health, safety and welfare of others residing on nearby residential
sites.
Subd. 2.   Permitted uses. The following are permitted uses in the L-R District
as regulated herein with special limitation requirements and conditions
attached as provided in Subd. 8. below. Water harboring of boats at docks
attached to land, including limited related service facilities as hereinafter
authorized, is subject to an annual operating license which shall be issued
only in accordance with the following standards and limitations.
Subd. 3.   Permitted accessory uses. The following are permitted accessory uses
in a L-R District:
      a.   Off-street parking as regulated by §
1201.03, Subd. 5 and by §
1201.24, Subd. 8h of this section;
      b.   One clubhouse building, not exceeding 2000 square feet of floor area
on the first floor level. This building may be used for sale of limited items
used in conjunction with boating, including fishing bait and tackle, light
accessory marine-line equipment, soft drinks, prepackaged foods, shower and
meeting rooms;
      c.   One storage building, not exceeding 1200 square feet of floor area;
      d.   Gasoline dispensing equipment (boat only) subject to design
standards of the Minnesota Uniform Fire Code, approval of the State Fire
Marshall, the local Fire Marshal, the Pollution Control Agency, Department of
Natural Resources and other applicable agencies and if authorized by the City
Council. Sale of gasoline is limited to those individuals renting or leasing
dock slips, or launching boats from the subject site, or, in the case of a
yacht club, to members of the yacht club;

1201.25 P.U.D., PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT.
Subd. 1.   Purpose. This District is established to provide comprehensive
procedures and standards designed for district planned unit development to
allow the development of neighborhoods or portions thereof incorporating a
variety of residential types and nonresidential uses. Recognizing that
traditional density, bulk, setbacks, use and subdivision regulations which may
be useful in protecting the character of substantially developed areas may not
be appropriate to control development in less developed areas. Specifically,
P.U.D. is intended to encourage:
      a.   Innovations in residential development to the end that the growing
demands for housing at all economic levels may be met by greater variety in
tenure, type, design and siting of dwellings and by the conservation and more
efficient use of land in the developments;
      b.   Higher standards of site and building design through the use of
trained and experienced land planners, architects and landscape architects;
      c.   More convenience in location of commercial and service areas within
a given project or area, allowing more efficient and desirable transitions
between residential and nonresidential land uses;
      d.   The preservation and enhancement of desirable site characteristics
such as natural topography and geologic features and the prevention of soil
erosion;
      e.   A creative use of land and related physical development which allows
a phased and orderly transition of land from rural to urban uses;
      f.   An efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities
and streets thereby lowering housing costs and public investments;
      g.   A development pattern in harmony with the objectives of the City
Comprehensive Plan;
      h.   A more desirable environment than would be possible through the
strict application of zoning and subdivision regulations of the city;
      i.   To give the landowner and developer reasonable assurance of ultimate
approval before expending complete design monies while providing city officials
with assurances that the project will retain the character envisioned at the
time of concurrence;
      j.   To allow variation from the provisions of this chapter, including
setbacks, height, lot area, width and depth, yards and the like internally
within the project. Provisions of this chapter shall generally be maintained at
the periphery of the project area.
Subd. 2.   Permitted Uses. The development agreement for any proposed P.U.D.
shall set forth the uses permitted within the proposed P.U.D. All permitted,
accessory, or conditional uses allowed in this chapter may be considered for a
P.U.D. However, any P.U.D. that includes a mixture of residential and
nonresidential uses shall be limited to property containing no less than four
acres of gross land area.
Subd. 3.   Special procedures. The establishment of a P.U.D., Planned Unit
Development District shall be subject to the amendment procedure requirements
as outlined in §
1201.04, Subd. 1. Each of the three stages of the review process shall require
a separate application.
Subd. 4.   General requirements and standards.
      a.   Ownership. An application for P.U.D. approval must be filed by the
landowner or jointly by all landowners of the property included in a project.
The application and all submissions must be directed to the development of the
property as a unified whole. In the case of multiple ownership, the approved
final plan shall be binding on all owners.
      b.   Comprehensive Plan consistency. The proposed P.U.D. shall be
consistent with the City Comprehensive Plan.
      c.   Sanitary sewer plan consistency. The proposed P.U.D. shall be
consistent with the City Comprehensive Sewer Plan.
      d.   Common and public open space. Common and public open space at least
sufficient to meet the minimum requirements established in the Comprehensive
Plan and Zoning and Subdivision Ordinances and the complementary structures and
improvements as are necessary and appropriate for the benefit and enjoyment of
the residents of the P.U.D. shall be provided within the area of the P.U.D.
      e.   Operating and maintenance requirements for P.U.D. common open space
service facilities. Whenever common open space or service facilities are
provided within the P.U.D., the P.U.D. plan shall contain provisions to assure
the continued operation and maintenance of the open space and service
facilities to a predetermined reasonable standard. Common open space service
facilities within a P.U.D. may be placed under the ownership of one or more of
the following, as approved by the City Council:
         (1)   Dedicated to public, where a community-wide use is anticipated
and the City Council agrees to accept the dedication;
         (2)   Landlord control, where only use by tenants is anticipated;
         (3)   Property Owners Association, provided all of the following
conditions are met:
            (a)   Prior to the use or occupancy or sale or the execution of
contracts for sale of an individual dwelling unit, parcel, tract, or common
area, a declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions or an equivalent
document or a document such as specified by M.S. Chapter 515, as it may be
amended from time to time, and a set of floor plans such as specified by
Chapter 515, as it may be amended from time to time, shall be filed with the
city, and filing with the city to be made prior to the filings of the
declaration or document or floor plans with the recording officers of Hennepin
County, Minnesota; to time, and a set of floor plans such as specified by
Chapter 515, as it may be amended from time to time, shall be filed with the
city, and filing with the city to be made prior to the filings of the
declaration or document or floor plans with the recording officers of Hennepin
County, Minnesota;
            (b)   The declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions or
equivalent document shall specify that deeds, leases or documents of conveyance
affecting buildings, dwelling units, parcels, or tracts shall subject the
properties to the terms of the declaration;
            (c)   The declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions
shall provide that an owner’s association or corporation shall be formed and
that all owners shall be members of the association or corporation which shall
maintain all properties and common areas in good repair and which shall assess
individual property owners proportionate shares of joint or common costs. This
declaration shall be subject to the review and approval of the City Attorney.
The intent of this requirement is to protect the property values of the
individual owner through establishing private control;
            (d)   The declaration shall additionally provide that in the event
the association or corporation fails to maintain properties in accordance with
the applicable rules and regulations of the city or fails to pay taxes or
assessments on properties as they become due and in the event the city incurs
any expenses in enforcing its rules and regulations, which the expenses are not
immediately reimbursed by the association or corporation, then the city shall
have the right to assess each property its pro rata share of the expenses. The
assessments, together with interest thereon and costs of collection, shall be a
lien on each property against which each assessment is made;
            (e)   Membership must be mandatory for each owner and any
successive buyer;
            (f)   The open space restrictions must be permanent and not for a
given period of years;

restrictions to be recorded must be approved by the City Council prior to the
approval of the final P.U.D. plan;
      f.   Staging of public (park dedication) and common open space. When a
P.U.D. provides for common or public open space, the total area of common or
public open space or land escrow security in any stage of development shall, at
a minimum, bear the same relationship to the total open space to be provided in
the entire P.U.D. as the stages or units completed or under development bear to
the entire P.U.D.
      g.   Residential density. The maximum allowable density in a P.U.D. shall
be determined by reference to the Comprehensive Plan. Within 10% of that limit,
the exact density allowable shall be determined by standards agreed upon
between the applicant and the city. Whenever any P.U.D. is to be developed in
stages, no stage shall, when averaged with all previously completed stages,
have a residential density that exceeds 125% of the proposed residential
density of the entire P.U.D. For purposes of this section, density shall be
expressed as the ratio of residential units per 40,000 square feet and shall be
calculated based upon the total gross acreage of the property in question, less
the area devoted to designated wetlands, public rights-of-way, public open
space and nonresidential use.
      h.   Utilities. In any P.U.D., all utilities, including telephone,
electricity, gas and telecable shall be installed underground.
      i.   Utility connections.
         (1)   Water connections. Where more than one property is served from
the same service line, a shut-off valve must be located in a way that each
unit’s service may be shut off by the city, in addition to the normally
supplied shut-off at the street.
         (2)   Sewer connections. Where more than one unit is served by a
sanitary sewer lateral which exceeds 300 feet in length, provision must be made
for a manhole to allow adequate cleaning and maintenance of the lateral. All
maintenance and cleaning shall be the responsibility of the Property Owners
Association or owner.
      j.   Roadways. All public streets shall conform to the design standards
contained in the Shorewood Subdivision Ordinance, as may be amended. Private
streets, where allowed, shall conform to specifications provided by the City
Engineer.
      k.   Landscaping. In any P.U.D., landscaping shall be provided according
to a plan approved by the City Council, which shall include a detailed planting
list with sizes and species indicated as part of the final plan. In assessing
the landscaping plan, the City Council shall consider the natural features of
the particular site, the architectural characteristics of the proposed
structure(s) and the overall scheme of the P.U.D. plan.
      l.   Townhouse, quadraminium, and multiple-family dwelling uses.
         (1)   No single townhouse structure shall contain more than six
dwelling units.

permanent public record of the P.U.D. and the manner in which it is to be
developed. It shall incorporate all prior approved plans and all approved
modifications thereof resulting from the P.U.D. process. It shall serve in
conjunction with other city ordinances as the land use regulation applicable to
the P.U.D. The Final Plan is intended only to add detail to, and to put in
final form, the information contained in the Development Stage Plan and shall
conform to the Development Stage Plan in all respects.
         (2)   Schedule. Upon approval of the development stage plan, and
within the time established by Subd. 6.c.(5) above, the applicant shall file
with the Zoning Administrator a Final Plan consisting of the information and
submissions required by Subd. 5.c. of this section for the entire P.U.D. or for

provided herein, upon receiving notice from the Zoning Administrator that the
approved Final Plan has been approved and is consistent with the applicable
ordinances of the city, all appropriate officials of the city may issue
building and other permits to the applicant for development, construction and
other work in the area encompassed by the approved Final Plan; provided,
however, that no permit shall be issued unless the appropriate official is
first satisfied that the requirements of all codes and ordinances which are
applicable to the permit sought have been satisfied.
         (4)   Limitations on Final Plan approval. Approval of the Final Plan
P.U.D. shall expire within one year after the City Council grants the approval
if construction has not commenced or unless an extension shall have been
granted as hereinafter provided. The effect of this expiration shall
automatically render void the P.U.D. and all approvals of the P.U.D. plan and
the area encompassed within the P.U.D. shall thereafter be subject to those
provisions of the zoning ordinance and other ordinances applicable in the
district in which it is located. In this case, the Council shall adopt an
ordinance repealing all P.U.D. approvals and re-establishing the zoning and
other ordinance provisions that would otherwise be applicable.
         (5)   Inspection during development.
            (a)   Compliance with overall plan. Following Final Plan approval
of a P.U.D., or a stage thereof, the Zoning Administrator shall, at least
annually until the completion of development, review all permits issued and
construction undertaken and compare actual development with the approval
development schedule.
            (b)   Development not proceeding according to schedule. If the
Zoning Administrator finds that development is not proceeding in accordance
with the approved schedule, or that it fails in any other respect to comply
with the P.U.D. plans as finally approved, he or she shall immediately notify
the Council. Within 30 days of the notice, the Council shall either by
ordinance revoke the P.U.D. permit and the land shall thereafter be governed by
the regulations applicable in the district in which it is located or shall take
the steps as it shall deem necessary to compel compliance with the Final Plans
as approved or shall require the landowner or applicant to seek an amendment of
the Final Plan.

1201.26 S, SHORELAND DISTRICT.
Subd. 1.   Shoreland Districts. The shorelands within the city are designated
as shoreland districts and the requirements set forth in this chapter shall
govern development and other activities within these districts. The
classification of the shoreland areas shall govern the use, alteration and
development of these areas according to the classification as per M.S., Chapter
105, and Minnesota Regulations parts 6120.2500 - 6120.3900.
Subd. 2.   District application. The S District shall be applied to and
superimposed upon all zoning districts as contained herein as existing or
amended by the text and map of this chapter. The regulations and requirements
imposed by the S District shall be in addition to those established for
districts which jointly apply. Under the joint application of districts, the
more restrictive requirements shall apply.
Subd. 3.   Boundaries. The boundaries of the Shoreland District are established
within the following distances from the ordinary high water level of the
surface water depending on the size of the surface water as indicated on the
Shorewood Zoning Districts Map.
 
Surface Water                                              Distance (Feet)*
Greater than 10 acres (Table 1)                            1,000
Rivers and streams (draining an area greater than 2 square 300**
miles)
* The practical distance may be less whenever the waters involved are
bounded by topographical divides which extend landward from the waters for
lessor distances and prevent flowage toward the surface water.
** The distance requirement shall be increased to the limit of the flood
plain when the flood plain is greater than 300 feet.
 
Subd. 4.   Shoreland classification.
      a.   The surface waters affected by this section and which require
controlled development of their shoreland (shoreland district) are shown on the
map designated as the official “Zoning Districts Map of the City of Shorewood”
which is properly approved and made a part of the ordinance and filed with the
Zoning Administrator.
      b.   Surface waters generally greater than ten acres and given an
identification number by the State of Minnesota are defined in §
1201.02 and listed in Table 1 of this section. Other surface waters affected by
this chapter, generally having less than ten acres, are classified as wetlands
and thus regulated under the provisions of Shorewood Ordinance 70 (
Chapter 1102 of the City Code).

            (i)   Plans to place fill or excavated material on steep slopes
must be reviewed and approved by the City Engineer for continued slope
stability and must not create finished slopes greater than three units
horizontal to one vertical;
            (j)   Placement of natural rock riprap, including associated
grading of the shortline and placement of a filter blanket, is permitted if the
finished slope does not exceed three feet horizontal to one foot vertical, the
landward extent of the riprap is within ten feet of the ordinary high water
level and the height of the riprap above the ordinary high water level does not
exceed three feet;
         (2)   Any work which will change or diminish the course, current or
cross section of a public water must be approved by the Department of Natural
Resources as per M.S. § 105.44 before the work is begun. This includes
construction of channels and ditches, lagooning, dredging of lake bottom for
the removal of muck, silt or weeds and filling the lake bed, including low
lying marsh areas. Approval shall be construed to mean the issuance by the
Commissioner of the Department of Natural Resources of a permit under the
procedures of M.S. § 42 and other related statutes;
         (3)   Excavation on shorelands where the intended purpose is
connection to a public water, such as boat slips, canals, lagoons and harbors,
shall require a permit from the Building Official prior to commencement of
construction. The permit shall be obtained only after the Commissioner of the
Department of Natural Resources has approved the proposed connection to public
waters. Approval will be given only if the proposed work is consistent with
applicable state regulations for work in beds of public waters.
      c.   Steep slopes. The Zoning Administrator must evaluate possible soil
erosion impacts and development visibility from public waters before issuing a
permit for construction of roads, driveways, structures or other improvements
on steep slopes. When determined necessary, conditions must be attached to

vegetated soil surfaces must be used to convey, store, filter and retain
stormwater runoff before discharge to public waters.
         (2)   Development must be planned and conducted in a manner that will
minimize the extent of disturbed areas, runoff velocities, erosion potential
and reduce and delay runoff volumes. Disturbed areas must be stabilized and
protected as soon as possible and facilities or methods used to retain sediment
on the site.
         (3)   When development density, topographic features and soil and
vegetation conditions are not sufficient to adequately handle stormwater runoff
using natural features and vegetation, various types of constructed facilities
such as diversions, settling basins, skimming devices, dikes, waterways and
ponds may be used. Preference must be given to designs using surface drainage,
vegetation and infiltration rather than buried pipes and man- made materials
and facilities.
   b.   Specific standards.
         (1)   Impervious surface coverage of lots must not exceed 25% of the
lot area, except as provided in §
1201.03 Subd. 2.u. of this code.

documentation must be provided by a registered engineer licensed in the State
of Minnesota that they are designed and installed consistent with the field
office technical guide of the local soil and water conservation districts.
         (3)   New constructed stormwater outfalls to public waters must
provide for filtering or settling of suspended solids and skimming of surface
debris before discharge.
Subd. 9.   Planned Unit Development. The Planned Unit Development provisions
contained in §
1201.06 may be utilized within a Shoreland District, when consistent with the
provisions of this section and provided that the following requirements are
satisfactorily met:
      a.   Preliminary plans shall be approved by the Department of Natural
Resources prior to city approval;
      b.   Sufficient open space is preserved through the use of restrictive
deed covenants, public dedications and the like;
      c.   The following factors are carefully evaluated to insure that any
increased density of development is consistent with the resource limitations of
the public water:
         (1)   Suitability of the site for the proposed use;
         (2)   Physical and aesthetic impact of any increased density;
         (3)   Level of current development;
         (4)   Amount and ownership of undeveloped shoreland;
         (5)   Levels and types of water surface use and public access;
         (6)   Possible effects on overall public use;
      d.   Any commercial, recreational, community or religious facility
allowed as part of the planned unit development conforms to all applicable
federal and state regulations, including, but not limited to the following:
         (1)   Licensing provisions or procedures;
         (2)   Waste disposal regulations;
         (3)   Water supply regulations;

beaches, docks or boat launching facilities and the like shall be designed that
the facilities are centralized for common utilization.
Subd. 10.   Variance. Variances may be granted by the City Council upon
application as required in §
1201.05 of this chapter in extraordinary cases, but only when the proposed use
is determined to be in the public interest and no variance shall be granted
which the Council determines will or has a tendency to:
      a.   Result in the placement of an artificial obstruction which will
restrict the passage of storm and flood water in a manner as to increase the
height of flooding, except obstructions approved by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers in conjunction with sound flood plain management;
      b.   Result in compatible land uses or which would be detrimental to the
protection of surface and ground water supplies;
      c.   Be not in keeping with land use plans and planning objectives for
the city or which will increase or cause danger to life or property;
      d.   Be inconsistent with the objectives of encouraging land use
compatible with the preservation of the natural land forms, vegetation and the
marshes and wetlands within the city. No permit or variance shall be issued
unless the applicant has submitted a Shoreland Impact Plan as required and set
forth in this chapter. In granting any variance, the Council may attach the
conditions as they deem necessary to insure compliance with the purpose and
intent of this chapter.
Subd. 11.   DNR notification procedure.

conditional uses under this section shall be received by the Commissioner of
the Department of Natural Resources within ten days of final action or
amendment.
Subd. 12.   Effect of permit. The granting of any permit, variance or
subdivision approval under provisions of this section shall in no way affect
the owner’s capability to obtain the approval required by any other statute,
ordinance or legislation of any state agency or subdivision thereof. Approval
may be expressly given in conjunction with other permits applied for, but no
approval shall be implied from the grant of the permits nor from the necessity
to apply for a permit as described herein.

1202.03 PROCEDURES FOR FILING AND REVIEW.
Subd. 1.   Sketch plan. In order to insure that all applicants are informed of
the procedural requirements and minimum standards of this chapter, and the
requirements or limitations imposed by other city ordinances or plans prior to
the development of a preliminary plat, all applicants shall present a sketch
plan to the Zoning Administrator prior to filing a preliminary plat.
Subd. 2.   Preliminary Plat.
      a.   Filing. Five copies of the preliminary plat shall be submitted to
the Zoning Administrator. The required filing fee as established by City Code §
1301.03 shall be paid and any necessary applications for variances from the
provisions of this chapter shall be submitted with the required fee. The plan
shall be considered as being officially submitted when all the information
requirements have been complied with.
      b.   Public hearing. Upon receipt of the subdivision application, the
Zoning Administrator shall set a public hearing for public review of the
preliminary plat. The hearing shall be established once adequate time has been
allowed for staff and advisory body review of the plat. The Planning Commission
shall conduct the hearing and report its findings and make recommendations to
the City Council. Notice of the hearing shall contain a legal property
description, description of request detailing property location and be
published in the official newspaper no more than 30 and no less than ten days
prior to the hearing. Written notification of the hearing shall be mailed no
more than 30 and no less than ten days prior to the hearing to all owners of
land within 750 feet of the boundary of the property in question.
      c.   Technical assistance reports. The Zoning Administrator shall
instruct the appropriate staff persons to prepare technical reports and provide
general assistance in preparing a recommendation to the Planning Commission and
City Council.
      d.   Review by other commissions or jurisdictions. The Zoning
Administrator shall refer copies of the preliminary plat to the Park
Commission, county, metropolitan, state or other public jurisdictions for their
review and comment, where appropriate and when required.
      e.   Planning Commission action. The Planning Commission shall make a
recommendation to the City Council immediately following the close of the
public hearing. If the Planning Commission has not acted upon the preliminary
plat within 60 days from the opening of the public hearing, the Council may act
on the preliminary plat without the Planning Commission’s recommendation.
      f.   City Council action.
         (1)   If all requirements of this chapter and those that may be
additionally imposed by the Planning Commission are complied with, the Council
shall act upon the preliminary plat and may impose conditions and restrictions,
which are deemed necessary, within 60 days of the date of the close of the
Planning Commission’s public hearing. A request for a time extension of the
City Council’s review process may be granted by the City Council, if requested
in writing by the applicant.
         (2)   If the preliminary plat is not approved by the City Council, the
reasons for the action shall be recorded in the proceedings of the Council and
transmitted in writing to the applicant. If the preliminary plat is approved,
the approval shall not constitute final acceptance of the layout. Subsequent
approval will be required of the engineering proposals and other features and
requirements as specified by this chapter to be indicated on the final plat.
The City Council may require the revisions in the preliminary plat and final
plat as it deems necessary for the health, safety and general welfare of those
living in and near the city.
         (3)   If the preliminary plat is approved by the City Council, the
subdivider must submit the final plat within 180 days after the approval or
approval of the preliminary plat shall be considered void, unless a request for
time extension is submitted in writing and approved by the City Council prior
to expiration of the 180 day period. A reasonable time extension will be
considered by the City Council, if circumstances requiring the extension are
beyond the control of the applicant.
Subd. 3.   Final Plat.
      a.   Filing. After the preliminary plat has been approved, the applicant
must file a request, supportive information and the final plat with the Zoning
Administrator at least 20 days prior to the City Council meeting at which the
final request is to be considered. This must be done within 180 days from the
date of preliminary plat approval. If a request for final plat is not made
within this period of time, the approval of the preliminary plat is void and
the applicant must reapply for preliminary plat approval, unless an extension
of time has been formally approved by the City Council. The final plat may
constitute only that portion of the preliminary plat which the subdivider
proposes to record and develop at the time.
      b.   Approval of the City Council. If accepted and all fees for
processing the application have been paid, the final plat shall be approved by
resolution within 60 days of the date of the meeting at which the final plat
was received. The resolution shall provide for the acceptance of all agreements
for basic improvements, public dedication and other requirements as indicated
by the City Council. If denied, the grounds for any refusal to approve a plat
shall be set forth in the proceedings of the Council and reported to the person
or persons applying for the approval.
      c.   Recording Final Plat. If the final plat is approved by the City
Council, the subdivider shall record it with the Hennepin County Recorder
within 30 days after the approval or approval of the final plat shall be
considered void, unless a request for time extension is submitted in writing
and approved by the City Council. The subdivider shall, prior to recording,
furnish the Zoning Administrator with three blackline prints and a reproducible
mylar of the final plat. Upon recording the plat the subdivider shall provide
the Zoning Administrator with evidence of the recording. No building permits
shall be issued for construction of any structure on any lot in the plat until
the city has received evidence of the plat being recorded by Hennepin County.

(Am. Ord. 380, passed 2-11-2002)
1202.05 DESIGN STANDARDS.
Subd. 1.   Blocks.
      a.   Block length. In general, intersecting streets determining block
lengths shall be provided at intervals so as to serve cross-traffic adequately
and to meet existing streets. Where no existing plats control, the blocks in
residential subdivisions should not exceed 1200 feet in length, except where
topography or other conditions justify a departure from this maximum and
approval is received from the City Council. In blocks longer than 1000 feet,
pedestrian ways or easements through the block may be required in locations
deemed necessary for convenient pedestrian circulation.
      b.   Block width. The width of the block shall normally be sufficient to
allow two tiers of lots of appropriate depth. Blocks intended for commercial
use shall be of the width as to be considered most suitable for their
respective use, including adequate space for off-street parking and deliveries.
Subd. 2.   Lots.
      a.   Size. The minimum lot area, width and depth shall not be less than
that established by the Shorewood Zoning Ordinance in effect at the time of
adoption of the final plat. To eliminate any doubt as to the interpretation of
lot size, the minimum lot square footage shall not include any portion of an
adjacent public street, any portion of the city designated wetlands, as set
forth in
Chapter 1102 of the City Code, nor any portion of a lot located below the
ordinary high water level of a lake. No lots less than the minimum square
footage provided by the Shorewood Zoning Ordinance for the area involved shall
be authorized by this chapter except upon the granting of a variance in
accordance with the terms of this chapter.
      b.   Corner lots. Corner lots for residential use shall have additional
width to permit appropriate building setbacks from both streets as required in
the Zoning Ordinance.
      c.   Lot frontage. Every lot must have adequate frontage on a city
approved street to accommodate a driveway and required driveway setbacks, as
required in the Shorewood Zoning Ordinance.
      d.   Setback lines. Setback or building lines shall be shown on all lots
intended for residential use and shall not be less than the setback required by
the Shorewood Zoning Ordinance, as may be amended.
      e.   Lot remnants/outlots. Remnants of land below minimum lot size,
except in instances of cluster zoning, shall be added to adjacent lots rather
than remaining as unusable parcels. Outlots may be used, if they carry with it
an easement in favor of the city, for open space to guarantee that the same
will not be developed for building purposes. Outlots may also be used to set
aside land to be platted at a later time. In these cases a resubdivision sketch
for the outlot shall be required. Building permits shall not be issued for
outlots or remnants.
      f.   Double-frontage lots. Double-frontage lots that have frontage on two
parallel streets shall not be permitted, except where lots back on arterial
streets or highways or where topographic or other conditions render subdividing
otherwise unreasonable. The double-frontage lots shall have an additional depth
of at least 20 feet in order to provide space for screen planting along the
rear lot line.
      g.   Turn around access. Where proposed residential lots abut a collector
or arterial street, they should be platted in such a manner as to encourage
turn-around access and egress on each lot.
      h.   Lots abutting arterial streets. In new subdivisions there shall be
no direct vehicular access from residential lots to arterial streets.
Residential lots shall be separated from arterials by a 15 foot buffer strip,
which may be in the form of added depth or width of lots backing on or siding
on an arterial street right-of- way.
Subd. 3.   Political boundaries. No singular plat shall extend over a political
boundary or school district line without legal notification to and approval by
affected units of government.
Subd. 4.   Streets and alleys.
      a.   Continuous streets. Except for cul-de-sac streets, streets shall
connect with streets already dedicated in adjoining or adjacent subdivisions,
provide for future connections to adjoining unsubdivided tracts or shall be a
reasonable projection of streets in the nearest subdivided tracts. The
arrangement of arterials and collector streets shall be considered in their
relation to the reasonable circulation of traffic, to topographic conditions,
to run-off of storm water, to public convenience and safety and in their
appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the area to be served.
      b.   Local streets and dead-end streets. Local streets should be planned
as to discourage their use by non-local traffic. Dead-end streets are
prohibited, but cul- de-sac streets shall be permitted where topography or
other physical conditions justify their use. Cul-de-sac streets shall not be
longer than 700 feet including a terminal turn-around which shall be provided
at the closed end. The cul-de-sac shall have a right-of-way radius of not less
than 50 feet.
      c.   Temporary cul-de-sac. In those instances where a street is
terminated pending future extension in conjunction with future subdivision, a
temporary turn-around facility shall be provided at the closed end in
conformance with cul-de-sac requirements.
      d.   Frontage roads. Wherever the proposed subdivision contains or is
adjacent to the right-of-way of a state highway or an arterial street,
provision may be made for a marginal access street approximately parallel and
adjacent to the boundary of the right-of-way or for a street at a distance
suitable for the appropriate use of land between the street and right-of-way.
The distance shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance
required for lot depths.
      e.   Half-streets. Half-street shall be prohibited, except where
essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision and adjoining
unsubdivided areas.
      f.   Private streets. Private streets shall be prohibited, except where
absolutely essential to the enjoyment of property rights. When permitted,
private streets shall serve no more than three lots and shall be designed to
standards established by the City Engineer.
      g.   Street intersections. Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect
as nearly as possible at right angles, except where topography or other
conditions justify variations. Under no conditions shall the minimum angle of
intersection of streets be less than 80 degrees. Street intersection jogs with
an offset of less than 125 feet shall be avoided.
      h.   Street right-of-way width.
         (1)   Street right-of-way widths shall conform with following
standards:
            (a)   Arterial street: 100 feet;
            (b)   Collector street: 60 feet;
            (c)   Local street: 50 feet;
         (2)   All subdivisions incorporating streets which are identified in
the Hennepin County Thoroughfare Plan shall comply with the minimum right-of-
way, surfaced width and design standards as outlined in the plan.
      i.   Street grades. Except upon the recommendation of the City Engineer,
and the topography warrants a greater maximum, the grades in all streets,
thoroughfares, collector streets, local streets and alleys in any subdivision
shall not be greater than 8%. In addition there shall be a minimum center line
grade on all streets and thoroughfares of not less than 1%.
      j.   Reverse curves. Minimum design standards for collector and arterial
streets shall comply with Minnesota State Aid Standards.
      k.   Reserve strips. Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall
be prohibited except under conditions accepted by the City Council.
      l.   Street plans for future subdivisions. Where the plat to be submitted
includes only part of the tract owned or intended for development by the
subdivider, a tentative plan of a proposed future street system for the
unsubdivided portion shall be prepared and submitted by the subdivider.
      m.   Hardship to owners of adjoining property. Proposed street
arrangements shall not cause hardship to owners of adjoining property in
platting their own land and providing convenient access thereto.
Subd. 5.   Provisions for resubdivision of large lots and parcels. When a tract
is subdivided into larger than required building lots or parcels, the lots or
parcels shall be so arranged as to permit the logical location and openings of
future streets and appropriate resubdivision with provision for adequate
utility connections for the resubdivision. Streets and utilities shall be
extended to the boundary of the plat.
Subd. 6.   Easements.
      a.   Width and location. An easement for utilities at least ten feet wide
shall be provided on each side of all lot lines. If necessary for the extension
of city water or sewer lines or similar utilities, easements of greater width
may be required along lot lines or across lots.
      b.   Continuous utility easement locations. Utility easements shall
connect with easements established in adjoining properties. These easements,
when approved, shall not thereafter be changed without the approval of the City
Council, after a public hearing.
      c.   Guy wires. Additional easements for pole guys should be provided,
where appropriate, at the outside of turns. Where possible, lot lines shall be
arranged to bisect the exterior angle so that pole guys will fall along side
lot lines.
Subd. 7.   Erosion and sediment control.
      a.   Commencement of work. No filling, grading or clearing of vegetation
shall occur on the site during the processing of the plat until the final plat
has been approved by the City Council. Violation of this provision shall make
the application null and void.
      b.   Existing topography. The development shall conform to the natural
limitations presented by topography and soil so as to create the least
potential for soil erosion.
      c.   Staging. Erosion and siltation control measures shall be coordinated
with the different stages of construction. Appropriate control measures shall
be installed prior to development when necessary to control erosion.
      d.   Limitations on exposed ground. Land shall be developed in increments
of workable size that adequate erosion and siltation controls can be provided
as construction progresses. The smallest practical area of land shall be
exposed at any one period of time. When soil is exposed, the exposure shall be
for the shortest feasible period of time, as specified in the development
agreement.
      e.   Removal/replacement of topsoil. Where the topsoil is removed,
sufficient arable soil shall be set aside for respreading over the developed
area. Top soil shall be restored or provided to a depth of four inches and
shall be of a quality at least equal to the soil quality prior to development.
      f.   Tree preservation and reforestation. Natural vegetation shall be
protected in accordance with the Shorewood Tree Preservation and Reforestation
Policy.
      g.   Best management practices. All erosion control measures shall be
installed according to the Minnesota Urban Small Sites Best Management
Practices Manual and the City of Shorewood Department of Public Works Standard
Specifications and Detail Plates, as may be amended.
Subd. 8.   Storm drainage. All subdivision design shall incorporate adequate
provisions for storm water runoff consistent with the Shorewood Comprehensive
Water Resource Management Plan, as amended, and be subject to review and
approval of the City Engineer.
Subd. 9.   Protected areas.
      a.   Where land proposed for subdivision is deemed environmentally
sensitive by the city because of the existence of wetlands, drainage ways,
water courses, floodprone areas or steep slopes, the design of the subdivision
shall clearly reflect all necessary measures of protection to insure against
adverse environmental impact.
      b.   Based upon the necessity to control and maintain certain sensitive
areas, the city shall determine whether the protection will be accomplished
through lot enlargement, redesign, conservation easement, dedication of those
sensitive areas in the form of outlots or through the use of protective
covenants in Planned Unit Developments.
      c.   Measures of protection shall include design solutions that allow for
construction and grading involving a minimum of alteration to sensitive areas.
Where these areas are to be incorporated into lots within the proposed
subdivision, the subdivider shall be required to demonstrate that the proposed
design will not require construction on slopes that exceed 12% or result in
significant alteration to the natural drainage system, such that adverse
impacts cannot be confined within the plat boundary.
(Am. Ord. 380, passed 2-11-2002)
1202.06 PUBLIC LANDS.
Subd. 1.   Park dedication, land. Because a new subdivision or commercial land
development creates a need for parks, playgrounds and open space, 8% of the
total area of each new subdivision or its equivalent shall be dedicated for the
use. The area must be suitable for parks and playgrounds and shall conform to
the city plan for parks and playgrounds within the city.
Subd. 2.   Park dedication, fees. In lieu of requiring dedication of an area
for parks and playgrounds, the city, at its option, may require a developer to
pay into the City Park Fund a sum of money equivalent to 8% of the value of the
raw land contained in the proposed subdivision or commercial land development.
The value of the raw land contained in the proposed subdivision or development
shall be determined by the City Assessor; or as an alternative, the city may
require the subdivider to pay into the City Park Fund a park dedication fee as
provided in §
1301.02 of this code.
(Am. Ord. 380, passed 2-11-2002)
1202.07 REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS.
Subd. 1.   General provisions.
      a.   Development agreement. Before a final plat is delivered by the city
to the subdivider, the subdivider of the land covered by the plat shall pay all
applicable fees and execute and submit to the City Council a development
agreement that shall be binding on its heirs, personal representatives and
assigns, a part of which agreement shall set forth that the subdivider will
cause no private construction to be made on the lands within the plat, nor
shall the subdivider file or cause to be filed any application for building
permits for the construction until all improvements required under this chapter
have been made or arranged for in the manner and conforming to the requirements
as set forth herein.
      b.   Financial guarantee. Prior to the delivery of the approved final
flat, the subdivider shall deposit with the city financial security in an

was undertaken by the subdivider in accordance with the developer’s agreement
referred to above;
         (3)   The payment by the subdivider to the city of all expenses
incurred by the city, which expenses shall include, but not be limited to,
expenses for engineering, planning, fiscal, legal, construction and

escrow, the letter of credit shall be in a form satisfactory to the city.
      c.   City Engineer approval. No final plat shall be approved by the
Council without first receiving a report signed by the City Engineer certifying
that the improvements described therein, together with the agreements and
documents required under this section, meet the requirements of the city.
      d.   Maintenance guarantee. The city shall require a subdivider to submit
a warranty/maintenance guarantee in the form of a letter of credit or cash
deposit in the amount of 25% of the original cost of the improvements, or as
approved by the City Engineer, which shall be in force for two years following
the final acceptance of any required improvements and shall guarantee
satisfactory performance of the improvement.
      e.   As-built drawings. “As-built” drawings of all required improvements
as required by the City Engineer shall be furnished to the city by the
subdivider in mylar form and electronic form at no cost to the city. The “as-
built” drawings and files shall meet format requirements of the City Engineer.
The “as-built” drawings shall be certified to be true and accurate by the

accepted the project, pursuant to inspections;
         (3)   The street will not be accepted until the Council has received a

1202.08 NON-PLATTED SUBDIVISIONS.
Subd. 1.   Registered land surveys. It is the intention of this chapter that
all registered land surveys in the city should be presented to the Planning
Commission in the form of a preliminary plat in accordance with the standards
set forth in this chapter for preliminary plats. The Planning Commission shall
first recommend the arrangement, sizes and the relationships of proposed tracts
in the registered land surveys, and tracts to be used as easements or roads
should be so dedicated. Unless a recommendation and approval have been obtained
from the Planning Commission and City Council respectively, in accordance with
the standards set forth in this chapter, building permits will be withheld for
buildings on tracts that have been so subdivided by registered land surveys,
and the city may refuse to take over tracts as streets or roads or to improve,
repair or maintain any tracts unless so approved.
Subd. 2.   Minor subdivision and lot combination.
      a.   Application. This subdivision shall apply to the following
applications:
         (1)   Requests to divide a portion of a lot or lots where the division
is to permit the adding of a parcel of land to an abutting lot or lots so that
no additional lots are created and all new lots conform to the Zoning Code
minimum lot size standards;
         (2)   Requests to combine two existing platted lots or lots of record
in the R-ID zoning district:
            (a)   Of which one or both lots are nonconforming due to
insufficient lot size, width or depth; and
            (b)   That results in a single lot that is not greater in area than
125% of the minimum lot size for the R-lD zoning district;
         (3)   Requests to divide a lot from a larger tract of land thereby
creating no more than two lots, each of which meet the minimum size and area
requirements for the zoning district in which the property is located. In the
R-1D, Single-Family Residential zoning district, as provided for in the
Shorewood Zoning Code, neither lot may be greater than 125% of the minimum lot
size for the zoning district. To qualify, neither of the lots resulting from
the division may be capable of being further divided. Nor may the property have
been part of a previous minor subdivision or metes and bounds conveyance since
1985;
         (4)   Requests to divide a base lot, as defined by the Shorewood
Zoning Code, upon which has been constructed a two-family dwelling, townhouse
or quadraminium, where the division is to permit individual private ownership
of a single dwelling unit within the structure and the newly created property
lines will not cause any of the unit lots, as defined by the Shorewood Zoning
Code, or the structure to be in violation of this chapter, the Zoning Code or
the State Building Code.
      b.   Data requirement for minor subdivision or lot combination.
         (1)   Certificate of survey. The requested minor subdivision shall be
prepared in the form of a certificate of survey by a registered land surveyor.
         (2)   Property description and submission information. The data and
supportive information detailing the proposed subdivision shall be the same as
required for a preliminary plat as set forth in §
1202.04, Subd. 2. of this chapter. The Zoning Administrator may exempt the
subdivider from certain of the informational requirements.
         (3)   Proposed legal descriptions/drainage utility easements. The
subdivider’s registered land surveyor shall prepare legal descriptions for the
proposed new lots, any street right-of-way or conservation easements that may
be required as part of the minor subdivision approval, and for drainage and
utility easements, ten feet on each side of each lot line. Additional easement
width may be required based upon the recommendation of the City Engineer.
         (4)   Proof of ownership. Prior to release of a Council resolution
approving a minor subdivision, the subdivider shall submit an up-to-date from
within the last 30 days title opinion for review and approval by the City
Attorney.
         (5)   Deeds for easements and street right-of-way. Prior to release of
a Council resolution approving a minor subdivision, the subdivider shall submit
deeds in favor of the city for any easements or public right-of-way that may be
required as part of the minor division.
      c.   Minor subdivision or lot combination procedure. The procedure for
considering a minor subdivision or lot combination as described in Subd. 2.a.,
above shall be as follows:
         (1)   The subdivider shall schedule a meeting with the Zoning
Administrator to determine whether the application qualifies as a minor
subdivision as described in Subd. 2.a., above. A lot combination, as described
in Subd. 2.a., above, may be approved for recording with the Hennepin County
Recorder by the Zoning Administrator;
         (2)   The subdivider must submit an application, all required
information and a fee as required in
Chapter 1301 of the Shorewood City Code by the first Tuesday of any given month
in order to be placed on the Planning Commission agenda for the first Tuesday
of the following month;
         (3)   The Zoning Administrator shall refer the application to all
appropriate city staff for review and comment;
         (4)   The application and any reports prepared by city staff shall be
considered at a regular meeting of the Planning Commission at which the
subdivider shall be present to answer questions concerning the proposed
subdivision;
         (5)   The Planning Commission shall make its recommendation to the
City Council within 60 days of the date of the Planning Commission meeting at
which the application is first considered;
         (6)   Upon receipt of the application, any reports prepared by city
staff, and the Planning Commission’s recommendation, the City Council shall
take action within 45 days of the date of the Council meeting at which the
application is first considered. Approval of the application requires a simple
majority vote of the full City Council;
         (7)   The subdivider must record the minor subdivision, and any
required deeds for easements or street right-of-way with the Hennepin County
Recorder within 30 days of the date it receives the resolution approving the
subdivision. Failure to record the subdivision within 30 days shall void the
approval. No building permits shall be issued for new lots until the subdivider
has provided proof of recording.
(Am. Ord. 380, passed 2-11-2002)
1202.09 VARIANCES AND APPEALS.
Subd. 1.   Findings. The Planning Commission may recommend a variance from the
minimum standards of this chapter, but not procedural provisions, when in its
opinion, undue hardship may result from strict compliance. In recommending any
variance, the Commission shall prescribe any conditions that it deem necessary
to or desirable for the public interest. In making its recommendations, the
Planning Commission shall take into account the nature of the proposed use of
land and the existing use of land in the vicinity, the number of persons to
reside or work in the proposed subdivision and the probable effect of the
proposed subdivision upon traffic conditions in the vicinity. A variance shall
only be recommended when the Planning Commission finds:
      a.   There are special and highly unique circumstances or conditions
affecting the property that are not common to other properties in the city and
that the strict application of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the
applicant of the reasonable and minimum use of its land;
      b.   That the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the
public health or welfare or injurious to other property in the vicinity in
which the property is situated;
      c.   That the variance is to correct inequities resulting from an extreme
hardship limited to topography, soils or other physical factors of the land.
      d.   After consideration of the Planning Commission recommendations, the
City Council may grant variances, subject to a, b, and c, above.
Subd. 2.   Variance application procedures.
      a.   Procedure.
         (1)   Application. Appeals or requests for variances, as provided

accompanied by five copies of detailed written and graphic materials fully
explaining the proposed change, development or use.
         (2)   Staff review/technical assistance reports. Upon receipt of an
application for appeal or variance, the Zoning Administrator shall, when deemed
necessary, refer the request to appropriate staff to insure that informational
requirements are complied with. When all informational requirements have been
complied with, the request shall be considered officially submitted. Also, when
deemed necessary, the Zoning Administrator shall instruct the appropriate staff
persons to prepare technical reports and/or provide general assistance in

of the request, and shall be published no more than 30 days and no less than
ten days prior to the hearing. Written notification of the hearing shall also
be mailed at least ten days prior to the date of the hearing to all owners of
land within 500 feet of the boundary of the property in question. Failure of a
property owner to receive the notice shall not invalidate any proceedings as
set forth within this chapter.
         (4)   Planning Commission action. The Planning Commission shall
conduct the public hearing, at which time the applicant or a representative
thereof shall be present to answer questions concerning the proposed request.
            (a)   The Planning Commission shall consider possible adverse
effects of the appeal or variance. In the case of a variance request, the
Planning Commission’s judgment shall be based upon (but not limited to) the
conditions set forth in Subd. 1 above.
            (b)   The Planning Commission and city staff shall have the
authority to request any additional information from the applicant deemed
necessary to establish performance conditions pertaining to the request.

recommendation shall be in writing and accompanied by any report and
recommendation of the city staff. The written recommendation of the Planning
Commission shall be forwarded to the Zoning Administrator for referral to the
City Council within 60 days of the opening of the public hearing.
         (5)   Referral to City Council. Upon receipt of the Planning
Commission report and recommendation, or within 60 days of the opening of the
public hearing by the Planning Commission, the Zoning Administrator shall place
the request and any report or recommendation on the agenda of the next
regularly scheduled meeting of the City Council.

Planning Commission or City Council for at least six months from the date of
its denial; and a subsequent application affecting substantially the same
property shall likewise not be considered again by the Planning Commission or
City Council for an additional six months from the date of the second denial,
unless a decision to reconsider the matter is made by not less than a simple
majority vote of the full City Council.
