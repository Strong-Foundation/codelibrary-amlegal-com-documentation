dissolved solids, such as but not limited to sodium sulfate.
         (d)   Excessive discoloration, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes
and vegetable tanning solutions.
   (C)   Groundwater.
      (1)   The City Council finds that the discharge of water from roof,
surface, groundwater sump pump, footing tile or swimming pool or other natural
precipitation into the city sewerage system will, and has on numerous occasions
in the past, flooded and overloaded the sewerage system to such an extent as to
cause significant and grave damage to the waste treatment plant. This damage is
caused by the backup of sewage into the plant. The City Council, therefore,
finds it essential to the minimization of damage to property and to meet
Minnesota Pollution Control Agency and Preston Public Utilities Commission
regulations, that the provisions of this division be strictly enforced to avoid
emergencies in the future.
      (2)   No water from any roof, surface, groundwater, sump pump, footing
tile, outdoor swimming pool or other natural precipitation shall be discharged
into the sanitary sewer system. Dwellings and other buildings and structures
which require a sump pump discharge system because of infiltration of water
into basements, crawl spaces and the like, shall have a permanently installed
discharge line, which shall not at any time discharge water into the sanitary
sewer system, except as provided herein. A permanent installation shall be one
which provides for year-round discharge capability to either the outside of the
dwelling, building or structure, or is connected to the city storm sewer or
discharges through the curb and gutter to the street. It shall consist of a
rigid discharge line, without valving or quick connections for altering the
path of discharge.

§ 51.04 SPECIAL AGREEMENTS.
   No statement contained in this subchapter shall be construed as prohibiting
any special agreement between the approving authority and any person, whereby
an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be admitted to the
wastewater treatment works, either before or after pretreatment,
provided that there is no impairment of the functioning of the wastewater
treatment works by reason of the admission of the wastes, and no extra costs
are incurred by the city without recompense by the person, provided that all
rates and provisions set forth herein.

§ 51.06 DISCONNECTION OF GROUNDWATER CONNECTIONS.
   (A)   Disconnection. Before March 1, 2000, any person, firm or corporation
having a roof surface, groundwater sump pump, footing tile or outdoor swimming
pool now connected and/or discharging into the sanitary sewer system, shall
disconnect and/or remove same. Any disconnections or openings in the sanitary
sewer shall be closed or repaired in an effective, workmanlike manner, as
approved by the Public Works Director or his or her designated agent.
   (B)   Inspection. Every person owning improved real estate that discharges
into the city’s sanitary sewer system shall allow an employee of the city or
their designated representative to inspect the buildings to confirm that there
is no sump pump or other prohibited discharge into the sanitary sewer system.
In lieu of having the city inspect their property, any person may furnish a
certificate from a licensed plumber, certifying that their property is in
compliance with this section. Any person refusing to allow their property to be
inspected or refusing to furnish a plumber’s certificate within 14 days of the
date city employees or their designated representatives are denied admittance
to the property shall immediately become subject to the surcharge hereinafter
provided for. Any property found to violate this section shall make the
necessary changes to comply with this section and furnish proof of the changes
to the city by March 1, 2000.
   (C)   Future inspections. Each sump pump connection identified may be
reinspected on a yearly basis in conjunction with yearly water meter
inspections.
   (D)   New home inspections. All new homes will be required to have their
sump pump system inspected within 30 days of occupancy and certificate of
compliance completed.
   (E)   Waivers.
      (1)   The Utility Commission shall have the power and duty of hearing and
deciding requests for waivers from the applicability of the provisions of this
section where strict enforcement would cause
undue hardship because of circumstances unique to the individual property under
consideration, or would cause a safety problem. This would also include cases
that would not be practical or feasible to correct the clear water discharge
problem.
      (2)   Application for waivers pursuant to this division shall be
addressed in writing to the City Administrator. The applications shall, at a
minimum, identify the property for which the waiver is being applied, the name
of the property owner/applicant, and describe in detail what characteristics of
the subject property create an undue hardship. Within a reasonable time the
Utility Commission shall make its order deciding on the matter and serve a copy
of the order upon the applicant by mail. Upon approval of an application for a
waiver, a property owner shall be allowed to temporarily discharge directly
into the sanitary sewer system. The applicant will be asked to agree to pay an
additional fee for the additional sewer service, along with the regular monthly
charge. Fees for this service will be based on estimated yearly average amounts
discharged to the sanitary sewer.

§ 51.08 CONTROL OF INDUSTRIAL WASTES.
   (A)   Industrial discharges. If any waters or wastes are discharged, or
proposed to be discharged, to the public sewers, which waters or wastes contain
substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in §§ 51.02 through 51.05
and which, in the judgment of the approving authority, may have deleterious
effects upon the wastewater treatment works, processes, equipment, or receiving
waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life, health, or constitute a
public nuisance, the approving authority may do as follows.
      (1)   Reject the wastes.
      (2)   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
the public sewer consistent with 40 CFR 403.
      (3)   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge.
      (4)   Require payment to cover the added costs of handling and treating
the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under the provisions
of § 51.04.
   (B)   Control manholes.
      (1)   Each person discharging industrial wastes into a public sewer shall
construct and maintain one or more control manholes or access points to
facilitate observation, measurement, and sampling of his or her wastes,
including domestic sewage.
      (2)   Control manholes or access facilities shall be located and built in
a manner acceptable to the approving authority. If measuring devices are to be
permanently installed, they shall be of a type acceptable to the approving
authority.
      (3)   Control manholes, access facilities, and related equipment shall be
installed by the person discharging the waste, at his or her expense, and shall
be maintained by him or her so as to be in safe condition, accessible, and in
proper operating condition at all times. Plans for installation of the control
manholes or access facilities and related equipment shall be approved by the
approving authority prior to the beginning of construction.
   (C)   Measurement of flow. The volume of flow used for computing the sewer
service and cost recovery charges shall be based upon the water consumption of
the person as shown in the records of meter readings maintained by the Public
Utilities Commission, or as determined by other methods revealing accurate
water consumption of the person involved.
   (D)   Provision for deductions. In the event that a person discharging
industrial waste into the public sewers produces evidence satisfactory to the
approving authority that more than 10% of the total annual volume of water used
for all purposes does not reach the public sewer, then the determination of the
water consumption to be used in computing the waste volume discharged into the
public sewer may be made a matter of agreement between the approving authority
and the person.
   (E)   Metering of waste. Devices for measuring the volume of waste
discharged may be required by the approving authority if this volume cannot
otherwise be determined from the metered water consumption records. Metering
devices for determining the volume of waste shall be installed, owned, and
maintained by the person. Following approval and installation, meters may not
be removed without the consent of the approving authority.
   (F)   Waste sampling.  
      (1)   Industrial wastes discharged into the public sewers shall be
subject to periodic inspection and a determination of character and
concentration of the wastes. The determinations shall be made by the industry
as often as may be deemed necessary by the approving authority.
      (2)   Samples shall be collected in such a manner as to be representative
of the composition of the wastes. The sampling may be accomplished either
manually or by the use of mechanical equipment acceptable to the approving
authority.
      (3)   Testing facilities shall be the responsibility of the person
discharging the waste and shall be subject to the approval of the approving
authority. Access to sampling locations shall be granted to the approving
authority or its duly authorized representatives at all times. Every care shall
be exercised in the collection of samples to insure their preservation in a
state comparable to that at the time the sample was taken.
   (G)   Pretreatment. Where required, in the opinion of the approving
authority, to modify or eliminate wastes that are harmful to the structures,
processes, or operation of the wastewater treatment works, the person shall
provide, at his or her expense, such preliminary treatment or processing
facilities as may be required to render his or her wastes acceptable for
admission to the public sewers.
   (H)   Grease and/or sand interceptors. Grease, oil, and sand interceptors
shall be provided when, in the opinion of the approving authority, they are
necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes, containing floatable grease
in excessive amounts, as specified in § 51.03(B), or any flammable wastes, sand
or other harmful ingredients. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity
approved by the approving authority, and shall be located so as to be readily
and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. In the maintaining of these
interceptors, the owner(s) shall be responsible for the proper removal and
disposal by appropriate means of the captured material, and shall maintain
records of the dates and means of disposal which are subject to review by the
approving authority. Any removal and hauling of the collected materials not
performed by the owner’s personnel must be performed by currently licensed
waste disposal firms.
   (I)   Analysis.
      (1)   All measurements, tests, and analysis of the characteristics of
waters and waste to which reference is made in this subchapter shall be
determined in accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the
Examination of Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health
Association and Guidelines Establishing Test Procedures for Analysis of
Pollutants (1978, 40 CFR 136). Sampling methods, locations, times, durations,
and frequencies are to be determined on an individual basis subject to approval
by the approving authority.
      (2)   Determination of the character and concentration of the industrial
wastes shall be made by the person discharging them, or his or her agent, as
designated and required by the approving authority. The approving authority may
also make its own analysis of the wastes, and these determinations shall be
used as a basis for charges. If the person discharging the waste contests the
determination, the approving authority may elect to have an independent
laboratory determine the character and concentration of the waste. The
independent laboratory, in making determination, shall be assumed by the
discharger.
   (J)   Submission of information. Plans, specifications, and other pertinent
information relating to proposed flow equalization, pretreatment, or processing
facilities shall be submitted for review by the approving authority prior to
the start of their construction if the effluent from the facilities is to be
discharged into the public sewers.
   (K)   Submission of basic data. Within three months after passage of this
subchapter, each person who discharges industrial wastes to a public sewer
shall prepare and file with the approving authority a report that shall include
pertinent data relating to the quantity and characteristics of the waste
discharged to the wastewater works. Similarly, each person desiring to make a
new connection to a public sewer for the purpose of discharging wastes shall
prepare and file with the approving authority a report that shall include
actual or predicted data relating to the quantity and characteristics of the
waste to be discharged.
   (L)   Extension of time. When it can be demonstrated that circumstances
exist which would create an unreasonable burden on the person to comply with
the time schedule imposed herein, a request for extension of time may be
presented for consideration by the approving authority.

(Ord. 170, passed 8-10-1981)
§ 51.11 SEWER SERVICE CHARGES. 
   (A)   Sewer service and user charges are imposed upon each lot, parcel of
land, building, or premises served by the public sewer and wastewater
facilities, or otherwise discharging sewage, including industrial wastes, into
the public sewer and wastewater facilities. The user charge shall be included
in the sewer service charge, and be payable as hereinafter provided. The
methodology of determining the user charge rates is given in the user charge
system. The rate schedule will be reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary
to maintain a proportional distribution of costs among the users.
   (B)   The sewer service charge for any lot, parcel of land, building, or
premises within the corporate limits, and for any lot, parcel of land,
building, or premises outside the corporate limits which is connected to the
public sewer system, shall be based upon the quantity of wastewater generated
as measured by the water meter or sewage meter in use as follows.
      (1)   CATEGORY A is defined as normal or domestic strength wastewater
having organic concentrations of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) no greater
than 200 milligrams per liter (mg/l) and suspended solids no greater than 250
milligrams per liter (mg/l). The sewer service charge for Category A wastewater
is as follows.
Minimum Sewer Service Charge Per Billing Period With One Customer on Each Meter
Meter Size Debt Portion
   5/8 inch   $3.15 per month
   1-inch   $7.90 per month
   1¼-inch   $12.60 per month
   1½-inch   $18.90 per month
   2-inch   $31.50 per month
   3-inch   $50.40 per month
   5-inch   $201.60 per month
   Volumetric user charge   $1.15 per 1000 gallons
      (2)   CATEGORY B is defined as wastewater having organic concentrations
of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) greater than 200 milligrams per liter (mg/l)
and/or suspended solids greater than 250 milligrams per liter (mg/l). The
minimum Category B charge for BOD and suspended solids will be based on a
concentration of 200 mg/l for BOD and 250 mg/l for suspended solids. The sewer
charge for Category B wastewater is as follows.
   SSC = Category A charge (service charge + volumetric charge)
      +   (BOD - 200) x V x .00834 x CB
      +   (SS - 250) x V x .00834 x CS
in which: SSC = Total Sewer Service Charge per quarter
         BOD = Biochemical Oxygen Demand expressed as mg/1
         SS = Suspended solids expressed as mg/1
         CB = BOD unit price $.18/1000 pounds
         CS = SS unit price $.35/1000 pounds
         V = Total volume of water used, thousand gallons
      (3)   When the user places wastewater in a holding tank so that the flow
is distributed over a 20 to 24-hour period, no further adjustment in the user
charge shall be made. When no holding tank is provided and used by the user,
the sewer service charge aforesaid will be further adjusted by the hours of
operation per day divided by hours discharged, to be averaged over the entire
quarter (such as a user with an average operation of 12 hours per day would
have the sewer service charge increased by 24/12 to arrive at the final user
charge).
   (C)   Reassignment of sewer users. The approving authority will reassign
users into appropriate sewer service charge categories if wastewater sampling
programs and other related information indicate a change of categories is
necessary.
   (D)   Additional charges. Additional charges shall be imposed upon each lot,
parcel of land, building or premises served by public sewer and wastewater
facilities located outside the boundaries of the approving authority, to
equalize local capital costs. The additional charge shall result in a minimum
charge equal to the debt charge for each user, according to the schedule for
debt repayment from utility revenues. Additional charges shall be added to the
sewer bill for each billing period.

§ 51.12 INDUSTRIAL COST RECOVERY CHARGES.
   (A)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply, unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      (1)   COST OF RECOVERY CHARGE. A charge collected from users discharging
industrial wastes for the recovery of the Federal EPA grant amount allocable to
the treatment of wastes, and is proportionate to the volume and pollutional
characteristics at design capacity of Federal EPA-funded wastewater collection
and treatment facilities.
      (2)   INDUSTRIAL USER. Any non-governmental, nonresidential user of a
publicly-owned treatment works which discharges more than the equivalent of
25,000 gallons per day (gpd) of sanitary wastes and which is identified in the
Standard Industrial supplement under one of the following divisions.
         Division A--Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing.
         Division B--Mining.
         Division D--Manufacturing.
         Division E--Transportation, Communications, Electric, Gas,   and
Sanitary Services.
         (a)   In determining the amount of a user’s discharge for purposes of
industrial cost recovery, the grantee may exclude domestic wastes or discharges
from sanitary conveniences.
         (b)   After applying the sanitary waste exclusion in division (A)(2)
(a) of this section (if the grantee chooses to do so), dischargers in the above
divisions that have a volume exceeding 25,000 gpd, or the weight of biochemical
oxygen demand (BOD) or suspended solids (SS) equivalent to that weight found in
25,000 gpd of sanitary waste, are considered industrial users. Sanitary wastes,
for purposes of this calculation of equivalency, are the wastes discharges from
residential users having a strength of 200 mg/l BOD and 250 mg/l SS. Any non-
governmental user of a publicly-owned treatment works discharging wastewater to
the treatment works which contains toxic pollutants or poisonous solids,
liquids, or gases in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with
other wastes, to contaminate the sludge of any municipal systems, or to injure
or to interfere with any sewage treatment process, or which constitutes a
hazard to humans or animals, creates a public nuisance, or creates any hazard
in or has an adverse effect on the waters receiving any discharge from the
treatment works, shall be in violation of this ordinance.
   (B)   Cost recovery charge. In addition to the sewer service charge imposed
on each user herein, cost recovery charge shall be imposed upon each industrial
user. The charge shall be payable on the quarterly basis, and shall be the
greater of the actual usage of projected reserve capacity of the industrial
user. For purposes of cost recovery charge, the approving authority may exclude
domestic waste in determining the amount of usage. The cost recovery charge
shall be payable as hereinafter provided, and in an amount determinable as
follows. The cost recovery charge of any industrial user shall be based upon
the quantity of water used and quality of wastewater generated as measured by
the water meter or sewage meter in use as follows.
      Volume Charge (RV) - $1.55 per 1,000 gallons per day per year
      BOD Charge (RB) - $.20 per pounds BOD per day per year
      Suspended Solids Charge (RS)    $.20 per pounds SS per day per year
      R = (V x RV) + (V x RB x B x .00834) + (V x RS x S x .00834)
in which:      R = cost recovery charge
         V = wastewater volume in 1000 gallons of flow
         B = concentration of BOD in milligrams per liter (mg/l) in wastewater
         S = concentration of suspended solids in milligrams per liter (mg/l)
in wastewater
   (C)   Recovery and disbursement of revenues. The recovery and the
disbursement of revenues collected by the city through the cost recovery charge
shall conform to the 40 CFR 35.928-1 and 35.928-2, promulgated by the Federal
Water Pollution Control Act Amendment of 1972.

corresponding period of the water bills, and shall be payable to the City
Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer and Utility Secretary Cashier not later than two
months after the end of each period. A penalty of 5% shall be added to all
bills not paid by the date fixed for final payment.
   (B)   Lien. All sewage charges shall be a lien upon the property served
pursuant to the applicable Minnesota Statutes, and shall be collected in the
manner therein provided.
   (C)   Disposition of revenue. The amounts received from the collection of
charges authorized by this chapter shall be credited to a sanitary sewerage
account, which shall show all receipts and expenditures of the sewerage system.
When appropriated by the Council, the credits to the account shall be available
for the payment of the requirements for operation, maintenance, repairs, and
depreciation of the
sewerage system consistent with 40 CFR 35.929. Any surplus in the account shall
be available for the payment of principal and interest of bonds issued and
outstanding, or which may be issued, to provide funds for the sewerage system,
or part thereof, and all or a part of the expenses for additions and
improvements and other necessary disbursements or indebtedness, and the Council
may, by resolution, pledge the surplus or any part thereof for any purpose. All

   (A)   Minnesota Rules. Those standards provided in Minnesota Rules, Chapter
7080, except with amendments authorized by this subchapter, shall be the basis
for permit applications and issuance of permits, the conduct of inspections of
work in progress, the issuance of notices of violation and notices of
revocation of permits, except as otherwise provided herein.
      (1)   There shall be a four-foot thickness of soil separating the bottom
of a sewage treatment system from limiting factors such as bedrock or water
table. The soil shall have percolation rates ranging between 0.1 and 60 minutes
per inch unless an alternative system is installed.
      (2)   Twelve inches of soil fill material with appropriate percolation
rates shall be placed between the filter material and the original soil in the
excavation when soil conditions have very fast or very slow percolation rates.
      (3)   Where Minnesota Rules allow sewage mound systems to be located on
slopes, the mound shall be designed and constructed with sufficient base area
to prevent seepage out of the mound. The base area shall be designed according
to a calculated absorption rate of 0.24 gallons per day per square foot of base
area.
   (B)   Support areas. Sewage treatment systems shall be placed in a
designated support area. The least dimension of the support area running with
the contour lines shall be a minimum of 50 feet. Support areas shall be located
and sized according to the daily sewage flow and the slope as follows.
      (1)   For every proposed dwelling there shall be identified and preserved
at least 5,000 square feet of support area for the soil treatment system if
slopes do not exceed 6%. Where slopes exceed 6%, the support area size shall be
determined by multiplying the percent slope times 1,000 square feet.
      (2)   For installations other than single-family dwellings, the
appropriate size of support area shall be determined by multiplying the square
feet of the soil treatment area times three and adding 10% for every percent
slope that is more than 6%.
   (C)   Soils evaluations and construction designs. Soils evaluations and/or
construction designs must be prepared by a Minnesota Licensed Professional
Engineer, Hydrologist, Geologist, or Soils Scientist/Classifier, that is
trained and experienced in soils evaluation and sewage treatment design and
appropriately certified (or provisionally certified) by the Minnesota Pollution
Control Agency for individual sewage treatment systems site evaluation and/or
design when the following apply.
      (1)   The Soil Survey of Fillmore County published by the Soil
Conservation Service, indicates that soils have severe restrictive features or
when slopes exceed 20%.
      (2)   The sewage system proposed is designed for sewage flows that are
apt to exceed 5,000 gallons in any 24-hour period.
   (D)   Multi-family residential, commercial, or industrial development.
Proposed multi-family residential, commercial, or industrial developments that
generate sewage wastes shall connect to a public sewage collection system
properly operated in accordance with MPCA permits, unless otherwise authorized
by the State Board of Health. All other residences and commercial
establishments within the city that abut upon easements or streets where city
sanitary sewer lines are situated shall likewise connect to the public sewage
collection system.
   (E)   Non-water-carried sewage treatment/disposal methods.
      (1)   Homes or other establishments requiring sewage treatment facilities
may utilize non-water- carried sewage treatment facilities. However, an
adequate support area shall be located for future construction of a sewage
drain field.
      (2)   The city shall have the right to review all proposed construction
and issue permits for all non-water-carried sewage disposal and/or treatment
methods. The wastes from these systems shall be treated and disposed of to
protect the quality of surface or groundwaters and not become offensive, odor-
producing, or serve as a source or attraction for flies, vermin, or rodents.
Unsanitary conditions or nuisances caused by these devices must be corrected.
   (F)   Use and maintenance of sewage systems. No person shall use, operate,
or maintain a noncomplying sewage treatment system. No person shall permit
sewage effluent to spill upon or pool on the surface of the ground, or to enter
a well, sink hole, fissured rock formation, or stream or river.

need for the confinement by the officer to voluntarily and immediately confine
the animal for the required period of time in a veterinary hospital of the
owner’s choosing, not outside of the county in which this city is located, and
provide immediate proof of confinement in the manner as may be required, the
owner may do so. If, however, the animal has been inoculated with a live

certificate from a licensed veterinarian, the owner may confine the dog or
other animal to the owner’s property.
   (C)   Reclaiming. All animals conveyed to the pound shall be kept, with
humane treatment and sufficient food and water for their comfort, at least five

orders as deemed proper. This owner shall be notified as to dates, times,
places and parties bitten, and shall be given 14 days to appeal this order by
requesting a hearing before the City Council for a review of this
determination.
      (1)   If no appeal is filed, the orders issued will stand or the Animal
Control Officer may order the animal destroyed.
      (2)   If an owner requests a hearing for determination as to the
dangerous nature of the animal, the hearing shall be held before the City
Council, which shall set a date for hearing not more than three weeks after

property adjacent to a public sidewalk shall use diligence to keep the walk
safe for pedestrians. No owner or occupant shall allow snow, ice, dirt or
rubbish to remain on the walk longer than 24 hours after its deposit thereon.
Failure to comply with this section shall constitute a violation.
      (2)   Removal by city. The City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer or other
person designated by the City Council may cause removal from all public
sidewalks all snow, ice, dirt and rubbish as soon as possible beginning 24
hours after any matter has been deposited thereon or after the snow has ceased
to fall. The City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer or other designated person
shall keep a record showing the cost of removal adjacent to each separate lot
and parcel.
   (C)   Public health and safety hazards. When the city removes or eliminates
public health or safety hazards from private property under the following
provisions of this chapter, the administrative officer responsible for doing
the work shall keep a record of the cost of the removal or elimination against
each parcel of property affected and annually deliver that information to the
City Administrator/Clerk- Treasurer.
   (D)   Installation and repair of water service lines. Whenever the city
installs or repairs water service lines serving private property under Chapter
51 of this code, the City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer shall keep a record of
the total cost of the installation or repair against the property.
   (E)   Repair of sidewalks and alleys.
      (1)   Duty of owner. The owner of any property within the city abutting a
public sidewalk or alley shall keep the sidewalk or alley in repair and safe
for pedestrians. Repairs shall be made in accordance with the standard
specifications approved by the City Council and on file in the office of the
City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer.
      (2)   Inspections; notice. The City Council or its designee shall make
inspections as are necessary to determine that public sidewalks and alleys
within the city are kept in repair and safe for pedestrians or vehicles. If it
is found that any sidewalk or alley abutting on private property is unsafe and
in need of repairs, the City Council shall cause a notice to be served, by
registered or certified mail or by personal service, upon the record owner of
the property, ordering the owner to have the sidewalk or alley repaired and
made safe within 30 days, and stating that if the owner fails to do so, the
city will do so, and that the expense thereof must be paid by the owner, and if
unpaid it will be made a special assessment against the property concerned.
      (3)   Repair by city. If the sidewalk or alley is not repaired within 30
days after receipt of the notice, the City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer shall
report the facts to the City Council and the City Council shall by resolution
order the work done by contract in accordance with law. The City Administrator/
Clerk-Treasurer shall keep a record of the total cost of the repair
attributable to each lot or parcel of property.
   (F)   Personal liability. The owner of property on which or adjacent to
which a current service has been performed shall be personally liable for the
cost of the service. As soon as the service has been completed and the cost

result of any illegal operation, or driving or moving of the vehicle, equipment
or object or contrivance; or as a result of operating, driving or moving any
vehicle, equipment, object or contrivance weighing in excess of the maximum
weight permitted by statute or this code. When the driver is not the owner of
the vehicle, equipment, object or contrivance, but is operating, driving or
moving it with the express or implied permission of the owner, then the owner
and the driver shall be jointly and severally liable for any damage. Any person
who willfully acts or fails to exercise due care and by that act damages any
public property shall be liable for the amount thereof, which amount shall be
collectable by action or as a lien under M.S. § 514.67, as it may be amended
from time to time.
   (H)   Assessment. On or before September 1 of each year, the City
Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer shall list the total unpaid charges for each type
of current service and charges under this section against each separate lot or
parcel to which they are attributable under this section. The City Council may

year along with the current taxes.

§ 92.20 ABATEMENT.
   (A)   Notice. Written notice of violation; notice of the time, date, place
and subject of any hearing before the City Council; notice of City Council
order; and notice of motion for summary enforcement hearing shall be given as
set forth in this section.
      (1)   Notice of violation. Written notice of violation shall be served by
a peace officer on the owner of record or occupant of the premises either in
person or by certified or registered mail. If the premises is not occupied, the
owner of record is unknown, or the owner of record or occupant refuses to
accept notice of violation, notice of violation shall be served by posting it
on the premises.
      (2)   Notice of City Council hearing. Written notice of any City Council
hearing to determine or abate a nuisance shall be served on the owner of record
and occupant of the premises either in person or by certified or registered
mail. If the premises is not occupied, the owner of record is unknown, or the

hearing, notice of City Council hearing shall be served by posting it on the
premises.
      (3)   Notice of City Council order. Except for those cases determined by
the city to require summary enforcement, written notice of any City Council

      (4)   Notice of motion for summary enforcement. Written notice of any
motion for summary enforcement shall be made as provided for in M.S. § 463.17
(Hazardous and Substandard Building Act), as it may be amended from time to

is being maintained or exists on the premises in the city, the officer shall
notify in writing the owner of record or occupant of the premises of such fact
and order that the nuisance be terminated or abated. The notice of violation
shall specify the steps to be taken to abate the nuisance and the time within
which the nuisance is to be abated. If the notice of violation is not complied
with within the time specified, the officer shall report that fact forthwith to
the City Council. Thereafter, the City Council may, after notice to the owner
or occupant and an opportunity to be heard, determine that the condition
identified in the notice of violation is a nuisance and further order that if
the nuisance is not abated within the time prescribed by the City Council, the
city may seek injunctive relief by serving a copy of the City Council order and
notice of motion for summary enforcement.
   (C)   Emergency procedure; summary enforcement. In cases of emergency, where
delay in abatement required to complete the notice and procedure requirements
set forth in divisions (A) and (B) of this section will permit a continuing
nuisance to unreasonably endanger public health safety or welfare, the City
Council may order summary enforcement and abate the nuisance. To proceed with
summary enforcement, the officer shall determine that a public nuisance exists
or is being maintained on premises in the city and that delay in abatement of
the nuisance will unreasonably endanger public health, safety or welfare. The
officer shall notify in writing the occupant or owner of the premises of the
nature of the nuisance and of the city’s intention to seek summary enforcement
and the time and place of the City Council meeting to consider the question of
summary enforcement. The City Council shall determine whether or not the
condition identified in the notice to the owner or occupant is a nuisance,
whether public health, safety or welfare will be unreasonably endangered by
delay in abatement required to complete the procedure set forth in division (A)
of this section, and may order that the nuisance be immediately terminated or
abated. If the nuisance is not immediately terminated or abated, the City
Council may order summary enforcement and abate the nuisance.
   (D)   Immediate abatement. Nothing in this section shall prevent the city,
without notice or other process, from immediately abating any condition which
poses an imminent and serious hazard to human life or safety.
Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 92.21 RECOVERY OF COST.
   (A)   Personal liability. The owner of premises on which a nuisance has been
abated by the city shall be personally liable for the cost to the city of the
abatement, including administrative costs. As soon as the work has been
completed and the cost determined, the City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer or
other official shall prepare a bill for the cost and mail it to the owner.
Thereupon the amount shall be immediately due and payable at the office of the
City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer.
   (B)   Assessment. If the nuisance is a public health or safety hazard on
private property, the accumulation of snow and ice on public sidewalks, the
growth of weeds on private property or outside the traveled portion of streets,
or unsound or insect-infected trees, the City Administrator/Clerk- Treasurer
shall, on or before September 1 next following abatement of the nuisance, list
the total unpaid charges along with all other the charges, as well as other
charges for current services to be assessed under M.S. § 429.101, as it may be
amended from time to time, against each separate lot or parcel to which the
charges are attributable. The City Council may then spread the charges against
the property under that statute and other pertinent statutes for certification
to the County Auditor and collection along with current taxes the following
year or in annual installments, not exceeding ten, as the City Council may
determine in each case.
Penalty, see § 10.99

OUTDOOR WOOD BURNING FURNACES
§ 92.100 INTENT AND PURPOSE.
   The Preston City Council hereby find that:
   (A)   It is recognized and found that wood smoke is hazardous to an
individual's health and may affect the health of the general public when they
are involuntarily exposed to the presence of wood smoke.
   (B)   Reliable scientific studies, including studies conducted by the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), have shown that breathing wood smoke is
a significant health hazard particularly to children, elderly people,
individuals with cardiovascular disease, and individuals with impaired
respiratory functions, including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway
disease.
   (C)   It is recognized that "outdoor wood burning furnaces" are designed and
intended to be a primary heat source and therefore burn, and emit smoke, on a
continual basis. A distinction is drawn between "Outdoor wood burning furnaces"
and indoor wood stoves and fireplaces that, by nature, provide supplemental
heat and are generally used on a less-frequent basis.
   (D)   This subchapter is adopted for the purpose of protecting the public
health, safety, comfort, and the general welfare of the people of the City of
Preston; educating citizens affected by this subchapter; and assisting property
owners and managers in maintaining compliance.
(Ord. 248, passed 12-6-2005)
§ 92.101 DEFINITION.
   OUTDOOR WOOD BURNING FURNACE. A furnace, or similar device, designed and
intended, and/or used, through the burning of wood or other fuel sources, for
the purpose of heating the principal structure or another accessory structure
on the premises. These types of furnaces are characterized by a short stack
height. They are located outside of the principal structure and are contained
in free-standing structures. This definition includes outside wood burning
water stoves. This definition does not include furnaces that burn wood pellets
or corn that is augured to the fire box.

setback a minimum of 50 feet from all property lines.
   (E)   Structure setback. An outdoor wood burning furnace must be setback a
minimum of ten feet from any principal or accessory structure.
   (F)   Chimney stack height. An outdoor wood burning furnace shall have a
chimney height that extends at least 15 feet above ground level unless the
furnace is within 100 feet of a dwelling unit not on the same property of the
wood burning furnace. If the furnace is within 100 feet of a dwelling unit of
adjacent properties the chimney terminus is to extend above ground level to
equal the height of the roofs of all such residences.
   (G)   Dates of use. An outdoor wood burning furnace may not be used from
April 15 to October 15 of each year.
(Ord. 248, passed 12-6-2005)
§ 92.103 NONCONFORMING USE.
   (A)   Continuation of nonconforming uses. The lawful use of any existing
"outdoor wood burning furnace" existing at the time of the effective date of
this subchapter may be continued, although such use may not conform to the
provisions of this subchapter.
   (B)   Extension or enlargement. No pre-existing, non-conforming "outdoor
wood burning furnace" shall hereafter be extended, enlarged, or expanded.
   (C)   Abandonment and discontinuance. Any pre-existing, non-conforming
"outdoor wood burning furnace" which is abandoned or not used for a period of
12 consecutive months shall not be permitted to be re-established as a non-
conforming use, cannot be used, and must be immediately removed by the property
owner from the subject premises. If the property owner fails to remove the
"outdoor wood burning furnace" by the end of said 12 months, the City of
Preston Zoning Administrator shall give written notice by certified mail,
personal service, or posting to the property owner upon which the "outdoor wood
burning furnace" is located. Such notice shall provide that such person shall
remove the same within 15 days of the notice.
   (D)   Termination. At such time as the useful life of a non pre-existing,
nonconforming "outdoor wood burning furnace" has elapsed or would need to be
repaired to function properly, the unit cannot be replaced and must be
abandoned, not used, and removed from the property immediately.
   (E)   Enforcement. Any person committing violation of the provisions of this
subchapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction for a
violation hereof shall be subject to the terms of §
10.99.

   (A)   Timing. The work to be done under the excavation permit, and the
patching and restoration of the right-of-way as required herein, must be
completed within the dates specified in the permit, increased by as many days
as work could not be done because of circumstances beyond the control of the
permittee or when work was prohibited as unseasonal or unreasonable under this
subchapter.
   (B)   Patch and restoration. The permittee shall patch its own work. The
city may choose either to have the city restore the right-of-way or to restore
the right-of-way itself.
      (1)   City restoration. If the city restores the right-of-way, the
permittee shall pay the costs thereof within 30 days of billing. If following
the restoration, the pavement settles due to the permittee’s improper
backfilling, the permittee shall pay to the city, within 30 days of billing,
all costs associated with having to correct the defective work.
      (2)   Permittee restoration. If the permittee restores the right-of-way
itself, it shall at the time of application for an excavation permit post a
construction performance bond in accordance with the provisions of Minnesota
Rules part 7819.3000, as it may be amended from time to time.
   (C)   Standards. The permittee shall perform patching and restoration
according to the standards and with the materials specified by the city and

extent of the restoration, and may do so in written procedures of general
application or on a case-by-case basis.
   (D)   Duty to correct defects. The permittee shall correct defects in
patching, or restoration performed by the permittee or its agents. The
permittee upon notification from the Director, shall correct all restoration
work to the extent necessary, using the method required by the Director. The
work shall be completed within five calendar days of the receipt of the notice
from the Director, not including days during which work cannot be done because
of circumstances constituting force majeure or days when work is prohibited as
unseasonal or unreasonable under this subchapter.
   (E)   Failure to restore. If the permittee fails to restore the right-of-way
in the manner and to the condition required by the Director, or fails to
satisfactorily and timely complete all restoration required by the Director,
the Director at its option may do the work. In that event the permittee shall
pay to the city, within 30 days of billing, the cost of restoring the right-of-
way. If the permittee fails to pay as required, the city may exercise its
rights under the construction performance bond.
   (F)   Degradation fee in lieu of restoration. In lieu of right-of-way
restoration, a right-of-way user may elect to pay a degradation fee as

degradation fee shall not include the cost to accomplish these
responsibilities.
§ 93.27 SUPPLEMENTARY APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   Limitation on area. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the area
of the right-of-way specified in the permit. No permittee may do any work

permit must be obstructed or excavated must before working in that greater area
make application for a permit extension and pay any additional fees required
thereby, and be granted a new permit or permit extension.
   (B)   Limitation on dates. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the dates
specified in the permit. No permittee may begin its work before the permit
start date or, except as provided herein, continue working after the end date.
If a permittee does not finish the work by the permit end date, it must apply
for a new permit for the additional time it needs, and receive the new permit
or an extension of the old permit before working after the end date of the
previous permit. This supplementary application must be submitted before the
permit end date.
§ 93.28 DENIAL OF PERMIT.

necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare or when necessary to
protect the right-of-way and its current use.

performed in the right-of- way shall be done in conformance with Minnesota

does not conform to the terms of the permit or other applicable standards,
conditions, or codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the
violation will be cause for revocation of the permit. Within ten days after
issuance of the order, the permittee shall present proof to the Director that
the violation has been corrected. If proof has not been presented within the
required time, the Director may revoke the permit pursuant to § 93.33.
§ 93.31 WORK DONE WITHOUT A PERMIT.
   (A)   Emergency situations.  
      (1)   Each person with facilities in the right-of-way shall immediately

business days after the occurrence of the emergency, the owner shall apply for
the necessary permits, pay the fees associated therewith and fulfill the rest
of the requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with this chapter
for the actions it took in response to the emergency.
      (2)   If the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding facilities, the
city will attempt to contact the local representative of each facility owner
affected, or potentially affected, by the emergency. In any event, the city may
take whatever action it deems necessary to respond to the emergency, the cost
of which shall be borne by the person whose facilities occasioned the
emergency.
   (B)   Non-emergency situations. Except in an emergency, any person who,
without first having obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or excavates a
right-of-way must subsequently obtain a permit, and as a penalty pay double the
normal fee for the permit, pay double all the other fees required by this code,
deposit with the city the fees necessary to correct any damage to the right-of-
way and comply with all of the requirements of this chapter.
§ 93.32 SUPPLEMENTARY NOTIFICATION.
   If the obstruction or excavation of the right-of-way begins later or ends
sooner than the date given on the permit, the permittee shall notify the
Director of the accurate information as soon as this information is known.
§ 93.33 REVOCATION OF PERMITS.
   (A)   Substantial breach. The city reserves its right, as provided herein,
to revoke any right-of-way permit, without a fee refund if there is a
substantial breach of the terms and conditions of any statute, ordinance, rule
or regulation, or any material condition of the permit. A substantial breach by
the permittee shall include, but shall not be limited, to the following:
      (1)   The violation of any material provision of the right-of-way permit;
      (2)   An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the right-
of-way permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit
upon the city or its citizens;
      (3)   Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a
right-of-way permit;

reasons beyond the permittees control; or
      (5)   The failure to correct, in a timely manner, work that does not
conform to a condition indicated on an order issued pursuant to § 93.30.
   (B)   Written notice of breach. If the city determines that the permittee
has committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any statute,
ordinance, rule, regulation or any condition of the permit the city shall make
a written demand upon the permittee to remedy that violation. The demand shall
state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. A
substantial breach, as stated above, will allow the city, at its discretion, to
place additional or revised conditions on the permit to mitigate and remedy the
breach.
   (C)   Response to notice of breach.  Within 24 hours of receiving
notification of the breach, the permittee shall provide the city with a plan,
acceptable to the city, that will cure the breach. The permittee’s failure to
so contact the city, or the permittee’s failure to submit an acceptable plan,
or the permittee’s failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be
cause for immediate revocation of the permit.
   (D)   Reimbursement of city costs. If a permit is revoked, the permittee
shall also reimburse the city
for the city’s reasonable costs, including restoration costs and the costs of
collection and reasonable
attorneys’ fees incurred in connection with the revocation.

way, or any particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of
facilities that is or, pursuant to current technology, the city expects will
someday be located within the right-of-way. All excavation, obstruction, or
other permits issued by the city involving the installation or replacement of
facilities shall designate the proper corridor for the facilities at issue.
   (C)   Limitation of space.  To protect the health, safety, and welfare or
when necessary to protect the right-of-way and its current use, the Director
shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional
facilities within the right-of-way. In making those decisions, the Director
shall strive to the extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential
users of the right-of-way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of
the public interest, the public’s needs for the particular utility service, the
condition of the right-of-way, the time of year with respect to essential
utilities, the protection of existing facilities in the right-of-way, and
future city plans for public improvements and development projects which have
been determined to be in the public interest.

Director.
§ 93.40 APPEAL.
   A right-of-way user that has been denied registration; has been denied a
permit; has had permit revoked; or believes that the fees imposed are invalid,
may have the denial, revocation, or fee imposition reviewed, upon written
request, by the City Council. The City Council shall act on a timely written

foster equal opportunity for all to obtain decent, safe and sanitary housing
without regard to their race, creed, color, national origin, marital status,
disability status or sex, and strictly in accord with their individual merits
as human beings. It is also the policy of the city to protect all persons from
all unfounded charges of discrimination.

status, status with regard to public assistance, age or disability of the
applicant, or because of the location of the unit or units in areas of the city
occupied by persons of a particular race, color, sex, religion, creed, national
origin, marital status, status with regard to public assistance, age or
disability; or to discriminate by treating differently any person or group of

or maintain real property in a specific urban area because of social, economic
or environmental conditions of the area in the granting, withholding,
extending, modifying or renewing, or in the rates, terms, conditions, or
privileges of any financial assistance, or in the extension of services in
connection therewith. The bona fide programs of federal, state or local
governmental units or agencies, however structured or authorized to upgrade or
improve in any manner a specific urban area, shall not be deemed to be a
violation of this section.
   (D)   For any person, having sold, leased, or rented a housing unit or units
to any person, to discriminate with respect to facilities, services, or
privileges of occupancy by reason of race, color, sex, creed, religion,

public assistance.

from which he or she may benefit financially, to do the following.
      (1)   To represent that a change has occurred or will or may occur in the
composition of the block, neighborhood, or area in which the property is
located, in respect to the race, color, sex, creed, religion, national origin,

   (H)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person or

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 111.01 ADOPTION OF STATE LAW BY REFERENCE.
   The provisions of M.S. Chapter 340A, as they may be amended from time to
time, with reference to the definition of terms, conditions of operation,
restrictions on consumption, provisions relating to sales, hours of sale, and
all other matters pertaining to the retail sale, distribution, and consumption
of intoxicating liquor and 3.2% malt liquor are hereby adopted by reference and
are made a part of this chapter as if set out in full. It is the intention of
the City Council that all future amendments to M.S. Chapter 340A as it may be
amended from time to time are hereby adopted by reference or referenced as if
they had been in existence at the time this chapter is adopted.
§ 111.02 CITY MAY BE MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN STATE LAW.
   The Council is authorized by the provisions of M.S. § 340A.509, as it may be
amended from time to time, to impose, and has imposed in this chapter,
additional restrictions on the sale and possession of alcoholic beverages
within its limits beyond those contained in M.S. Chapter 340A, as it may be
amended from time to time.
§ 111.03 DEFINITIONS.
   In addition to the definitions contained in M.S. § 340A.101, as it may be
amended from time to time, the following terms are defined for purposes of this
chapter:
   LIQUOR. As used in this chapter, without modification by the words
“intoxicating” or “3.2% malt,” includes both intoxicating liquor and 3.2% malt
liquor.
   RESTAURANT. An eating facility, other than a hotel, under the control of a
single proprietor or manager, where meals are regularly prepared on the
premises, where full waitress/waiter table service is provided, where a
customer orders food from printed menus and where the main food course is
served and consumed while seated at a single location. To be a “restaurant” as
defined by this section, an establishment shall have a license from the state
as required by M.S. § 157.16, as it may be amended
from time to time, and meet the definition of either a “small establishment,”
“medium establishment” or “large establishment” as defined in M.S. § 157.16,
Subdivision 3d, as it may be amended from time to time. An establishment which
serves prepackaged food that receives heat treatment and is served in the
package or frozen pizza that is heated and served, shall not be considered to
be a restaurant for purposes of this chapter unless it meets the definitions of
“small establishment”, “medium establishment” or “large establishment.”
§ 111.04 NUDITY ON THE PREMISES OF LICENSED ESTABLISHMENTS PROHIBITED.
   (A)   The City Council finds that it is in the best interests of the public
health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the city that nudity is
prohibited as provided in this section on the premises of any establishment
licensed under this chapter. This is to protect and assist the owners,
operators, and employees of the establishment, as well as patrons and the
public in general, from harm stemming from the physical immediacy and
combination of alcohol, nudity, and sex. The Council especially intends to
prevent any subliminal endorsement of sexual harassment or activities likely to
lead to the possibility of various criminal conduct, including prostitution,
sexual assault, and disorderly conduct. The Council also finds that the
prohibition of nudity on the premises of any establishment licensed under this
chapter, as set forth in this section, reflects the prevailing community
standards of the city.
   (B)   It is unlawful for any licensee to permit or allow any person or
persons on the licensed premises when the person does not have his or her
buttocks, anus, breasts, and genitals covered with a non- transparent material.
It is unlawful for any person to be on the licensed premises when the person
does not have his or her buttocks, anus, breasts, and genitals covered with a
non-transparent material.
   (C)   A violation of this section is a misdemeanor punishable as provided by
law, and is justification for revocation or suspension of any liquor, wine, or
3.2% malt liquor license or the imposition of a civil penalty under the
provisions of § 111.99(B).
Penalty, see § 111.99
§ 111.05 CONSUMPTION IN PUBLIC PLACES.
   No person shall consume intoxicating liquor or 3.2% malt liquor in a public
park, on any public street, sidewalk, parking lot or alley, or in any public
place other than on the premises of an establishment licensed under this
chapter, in a municipal liquor dispensary if one exists in the city, or where
the consumption and display of liquor is lawfully permitted.
Penalty, see § 111.99
LICENSING
§ 111.20 NUMBER OF LICENSES WHICH MAY BE ISSUED.
   State law establishes the number of liquor licenses that a city may issue.
However, the number of licenses which may be granted under this chapter is
limited to the number of license which were issued as of the effective date of
this chapter, even if a larger number of licenses are authorized by law or
election. The Council in its sound discretion may provide by ordinance that a
larger number of licenses may be issued up to the number of licenses authorized
by M.S. Chapter 340A, as it may be amended from time to time. If a larger
number of licenses in a particular category has been authorized by a referendum
held under the provisions of M.S. § 340A.413, Subdivision 3, as it may be
amended from time to time, but not all of them have been issued, the larger
number of licenses is no longer in effect until the Council by ordinance
determines that any or all of the licenses may be issued. The Council is not
required to issue the full number of licenses that it has available.
§ 111.21 TERM AND EXPIRATION OF LICENSES.
   Each license shall be issued for a maximum period of one year. All licenses,
except temporary licenses, shall expire on December 31 of each year unless
another date is provided by ordinance. All licenses shall expire on the same
date. Temporary licenses expire according to their terms. Consumption and
display permits issued by the Commissioner of Public Safety, and the
accompanying city consent to the permit, shall expire on March 31 of each year.
§ 111.22 KINDS OF LIQUOR LICENSES.

Subdivision 2b, as it may be amended from time to time. The Council may in its
sound discretion authorize a retail on-sale licensee to dispense intoxicating
liquor off the licensed premises at a community festival held within the city
under the provisions of M.S. § 340A.404, Subdivision 4b, as it may be amended
from time to time. The Council may in its sound discretion authorize a retail
on-sale licensee to dispense intoxicating liquor off the licensed premises at
any convention, banquet, conference, meeting, or social affair conducted on the
premises of a sports, convention, or cultural facility owned by the city, under
the provisions of M.S. § 340A.404, Subdivision 4a, as it may be amended from
time to time; however, the licensee is prohibited from dispensing intoxicating
liquor to any person attending or participating in an amateur athletic event
being held on the premises.
   (F)   Sunday on-sale intoxicating liquor licenses, only after authorization
to do so by voter approval at a general or special election as provided by M.S.

M.S. § 340A.401, Subdivision 1, as it may be amended from time to time. The fee
for an on-sale wine license established by the Council under the provisions of
§ 111.23 shall not exceed one-half of the license fee charged for an on-sale
intoxicating liquor license. The holder of an on-sale wine license who also
holds an on-sale 3.2% malt liquor license is authorized to sell malt liquor
with a content over 3.2% (strong beer) without an additional license.

   (C)   The fee for all licenses, except temporary licenses, granted after the
commencement of the license year shall be prorated on a quarterly basis.

returned to the applicant.
   (E)   A refund of a pro rata share of an annual license fee may occur only
if authorized by M.S. § 340A.408, Subdivision 5, as it may be amended from time
to time.
§ 111.24 COUNCIL DISCRETION TO GRANT OR DENY A LICENSE.
   The Council in its sound discretion may either grant or deny the application
for any license or for the transfer or renewal of any license. No applicant has
a right to a license under this chapter.
§ 111.25 APPLICATION FOR LICENSE.
   (A)   Form. Every application for a license issued under this chapter shall
be on a form provided by the city. Every application shall state the name of
the applicant, the applicant’s age, representations as to the applicant’s
character, with references as the Council may require, the type of license
applied for, the business in connection with which the proposed license will
operate and its location, a description of the premises, whether the applicant
is owner and operator of the business, how long the applicant has been in that
business at that place, and other information as the Council may require from
time to time. An application for an on-sale intoxicating liquor license shall
be in the form prescribed by the Commissioner of Public Safety and shall also
contain the information required in this section. The form shall be verified
and filed with the city. No person shall make a false statement in an
application.
   (B)   Financial responsibility. Prior to the issuance of any license under
this chapter, the applicant shall demonstrate proof of financial responsibility
as defined in M.S. § 340A.409, as it may be amended from time to time, with
regard to liability under M.S. § 340A.801, as it may be amended from time to
time. This proof will be filed with the city and the Commissioner of Public
Safety. Any liability insurance policy filed as proof of financial
responsibility under this section shall conform to M.S. § 340A.409, as it may
be amended from time to time. Operation of a business which is required to be
licensed by this chapter without having on file with the city at all times
effective proof of financial responsibility is a cause for revocation of the
license.
Penalty, see § 111.99
§ 111.26 DESCRIPTION OF PREMISES.
   The application shall specifically describe the compact and contiguous
premises within which liquor may be dispensed and consumed. The description may
not include any parking lot or sidewalk.
§ 111.27 APPLICATIONS FOR RENEWAL.
   At least 90 days before a license issued under this chapter is to be
renewed, an application for renewal shall be filed with the city. The decision
whether or not to renew a license rests within the sound discretion of the
Council. No licensee has a right to have the license renewed.
§ 111.28 TRANSFER OF LICENSE.
   No license issued under this chapter may be transferred without the approval
of the Council. Any transfer of stock of a corporate licensee is deemed to be a
transfer of the license, and a transfer of stock without prior Council approval
is a ground for revocation of the license. An application to transfer a license
shall be treated the same as an application for a new license, and all of the
provisions of this code applying to applications for a license shall apply.
Penalty, see § 111.99
§ 111.29 INVESTIGATION.
   (A)   Preliminary background and financial investigation. On an initial
application for a license, on an application for transfer of a license and, in
the sound discretion of the Council that it is in the public interest to do so,
on an application for renewal of a license, the city shall conduct a
preliminary background and financial investigation of the applicant or it may
contract with the Commissioner of Public Safety for the investigation. The
applicant shall pay with the application an investigation fee of $500 which
shall be in addition to any license fee. If the cost of the preliminary
investigation is less than $500, the unused balance shall be returned to the
applicant. The results of the preliminary investigation shall be sent to the
Commissioner of Public Safety if the application is for an on-sale intoxicating
liquor license or an on-sale wine license.
   (B)   Comprehensive background and financial investigation. If the results
of a preliminary investigation warrant, in the sound discretion of the Council,
a comprehensive background and financial investigation, the Council may either
conduct the investigation itself or contract with the Commissioner of Public
Safety for the investigation. The investigation fee for this comprehensive
background and financial investigation to be paid by the applicant shall be
$500, less any amount paid for the initial investigation if the investigation
is to be conducted within the state, and $10,000, less any amount paid for the
initial investigation, if the investigation is required outside the state. The
unused balance of the fee shall be returned to the applicant whether or not the
application is denied. The fee shall be paid in advance of any investigation
and the amount actually expended on the investigation shall not be refundable
in the event the application is denied. The results of the comprehensive
investigation shall be sent to the Commissioner of Public Safety if the
application is for an on-sale intoxicating liquor license or an on-sale wine
license.
§ 111.30 HEARING AND ISSUANCE.
   The Council shall investigate all facts set out in the application and not
investigated in the preliminary or comprehensive background and financial
investigations. Opportunity shall be given to any person to be heard for or
against the granting of the license. After the investigation and hearing, the
Council shall in its sound discretion grant or deny the application. No license
shall become effective until the proof of financial security has been approved
by the Commissioner of Public Safety.
§ 111.31 RESTRICTIONS ON ISSUANCE.
   (A)   Each license shall be issued only to the applicant for the premises
described in the application.
   (B)   Not more than one license shall be directly or indirectly issued
within the city to any one person.
   (C)   No license shall be granted or renewed for operation on any premises
on which taxes, assessments, utility charges, service charges, or other
financial claims of the city are delinquent and unpaid.
   (D)   No license shall be issued for any place or any business ineligible
for a license under state law.
   (E)   No license shall be issued to any person who is not a resident of the
state. If the applicant is a corporation, all of the shareholders shall be
residents of the state. The provisions of this division (E) shall not apply to
any license existing on the effective date of this chapter or to the renewal of
an existing license.
   (F)   No license shall be granted within 500 feet of any school. No license
shall be granted within 250 feet of any church. The distance is to be measured
from the closest side of the school or church to the closest side of the
structure on the premises within which liquor is to be sold. This section does
not preclude the licensee from renewing the license if a church moves closer to
the facility.
(Ord. 247, passed 5-2-2005)
Penalty, see § 111.99
§ 111.32 CONDITIONS OF LICENSE.
   The failure of a licensee to meet any one of the conditions of the license
specified below shall result in a suspension of the license until the condition
is met.

shall be provided by an organization approved by the Council. Proof of training
shall be provided by the licensee.
   (B)   Every licensee is responsible for the conduct of the place of business
and the conditions of sobriety and order in it. The act of any employee on the

with the employee.
   (C)   Every licensee shall allow any peace officer, health officer, city
employee, or any other person designated by the Council to conduct compliance

   (B)   The Council shall impose a civil penalty of up to $2,000 for each
violation of M.S. Chapter 340A, as it may be amended from time to time, and of

order for the Council to impose the civil penalty. A hearing under the
Administrative Procedures Act, M.S. §§ 14.57 to 14.70, as it may be amended
from time to time, is not required before the penalty is imposed, but the
Council shall hold a hearing on the proposed violation and the proposed penalty
and hear any person who wishes to speak. Non-payment of the penalty is grounds
for suspension or revocation of the license. The following is the minimum
schedule of presumptive civil penalties which must be imposed in addition to

§ 112.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   Because the city recognizes that many persons under the age of 18 years
purchase or otherwise obtain, possess and use tobacco, tobacco products, and
tobacco related devices, and the sales, possession, and use are violations of
both state and federal laws; and because studies, which the city hereby accepts
and adopts, have shown that most smokers begin smoking before they have reached
the age of 18 years and that those persons who reach the age of 18 years
without having started smoking are significantly less likely to begin smoking;
and because smoking has been shown to be the cause of several serious health
problems which subsequently place a financial burden on all levels of
government; this chapter shall be intended to regulate the sale, possession and
use of tobacco, tobacco products, and tobacco related devices for the purpose
of enforcing and furthering existing laws, to protect minors against the
serious effects associated with the illegal use of tobacco, tobacco products,
and tobacco related devices, and to further the official public policy of the
state in regard to preventing young people from starting to smoke as stated in
M.S. § 144.391, as it may be amended from time to time.
§ 112.02 DEFINITIONS.
   Except as may otherwise be provided or clearly implied by context, all terms
shall be given their commonly accepted definitions. For the purpose of this

indicates or requires a different meaning.
   COMPLIANCE CHECKS. The system the city uses to investigate and ensure that
those authorized to sell tobacco, tobacco products, and tobacco related devices
are following and complying with the requirements of this chapter. Compliance
checks shall involve the use of minors as authorized by this chapter.
Compliance Checks shall also mean the use of minors who attempt to purchase
tobacco, tobacco products, or tobacco related devices for educational, research
and training purposes as authorized by state and federal laws. Compliance
checks may also be conducted by other units of government for the purpose of
enforcing appropriate federal, state or local laws and regulations relating to
tobacco, tobacco products, and tobacco related devices.
   INDIVIDUALLY PACKAGED. The practice of selling any tobacco or tobacco
product wrapped individually for sale. Individually wrapped tobacco and tobacco
products shall include but not be limited to single cigarette packs, single
bags or cans of loose tobacco in any form, and single cans or other packaging
of snuff or chewing tobacco. Cartons or other packaging containing more than a
single pack or other container as described in this definition shall not be
considered individually packaged.

cigarette.

intervention shall entail the actual physical exchange of the tobacco, tobacco
product, or tobacco related device between the customer and the licensee or

of the license.
Penalty, see § 112.99

§ 114.01 FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to control through permitting and
zoning regulations certain land uses that have a direct and detrimental effect
on the character of the city's residential and commercial districts.
   (B)   The City of Preston makes the following findings about the effect
adult uses and sexually oriented businesses have on the character of each
district. In making the findings, the city accepts the recommendations of staff
that have studied the experiences of other communities in the nation about such
businesses. The Minnesota Attorney General, the American Planning Association,
and the cities of St. Paul, Rochester, Indianapolis, Phoenix, Los Angeles,
Seattle and New York have studied the impacts of adult uses and sexually
oriented businesses on rural and urban areas. These studies have concluded that
adult uses and sexually oriented businesses have adverse impacts on the
surrounding neighborhoods. Based on these studies and findings, the City of
Preston concludes:
      (1)   Adult uses and sexually oriented businesses can contribute to an
increase in crime in the area where such businesses are located. This can be a
burden to city and county crime prevention programs and law enforcement
services.
      (2)   Adult uses and sexually oriented businesses can significantly
contribute to the deterioration of nearby neighborhoods and can increase
neighborhood blight. These businesses also can impair the character and quality
of the residential housing in the area where such businesses are located. This
situation can lessen the amount of desirable housing for residents.
      (3)   The concentration of adult uses and sexually oriented businesses in
one area can greatly affect the area where such businesses are concentrated and
on the quality of life. A cycle of decay can result from the influx and
concentration of adult uses and sexually oriented businesses. Others may
perceive the presence of such businesses as an indication that the area is
deteriorating. That is, other businesses move out of the vicinity and residents
flee from the area. Lower property values that can result from the
concentration of such businesses erode the city's tax base and contribute to
rural and urban blight.
      (4)   It is necessary to provide for the special and express regulation
of businesses, establishments or enterprises that operate as adult body
painting studios, adult bookstores, adult cabarets, adult car washes, adult
companionship establishments, adult hotels or motels, adult massage parlors or
health clubs, adult mini-motion picture theaters, adult modeling studios, adult
motion picture arcades or theaters, adult novelty businesses, adult saunas, and
similar adult oriented services operating under different names to protect the
public health, safety and welfare, and to guard against the inception and
transmission of disease.
      (5)   The enterprises such as the types described in division (B)(4) of
this section and all other similar establishments whose services include
sessions offered to adults conducted in private by members of the same or
opposite sex, and employing personnel with no specialized training are
susceptible to operations contravening, subverting, or endangering the health
and safety of the city by being the site of acts of prostitution, illicit sex,
and occasions of violent crimes, and thus requiring close inspection,
permitting, and regulation.
      (6)   Control and regulation of establishments of these types, in view of
the abuses often perpetrated, require intensive efforts by police departments,
the sheriffs office, and other departments serving the community. It is
necessary for the city to provide services to all of the city without
concentrating the public services in one area. The concentrated use of city
services detracts from and reduces the level of service available to the rest
of the city. Thus, these types of establishments can diminish the ability of
the city to protect and promote the general health, welfare and safety of the
City of Preston.
      (7)   The city adopts the following land use and permitting regulations,
recognizing that it has an interest in the present and future character of the
city's zoning districts. These regulations are to lessen the detrimental and
adverse effects that adult uses and sexually oriented businesses have on
adjacent land uses and to protect and promote the health, safety and welfare of
the residents of the City of Preston.
   (C)   It is not the intent of the city to prohibit adult uses and sexually
oriented businesses or establishments from having an opportunity to locate in
the City of Preston. It also is not the intent of the city to regulate these
businesses on the basis of content, but only on the basis of likely adverse
secondary effects.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 153.001 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The legislature of the State of Minnesota has, in M.S. Chapter 104 and 394,
as they may be amended from time to time, delegated the responsibility to local
government units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. The
City of Preston did so by adopting the City of Preston Floodplain Management
Ordinance on February 26, 1990. The purpose of this chapter is to update the
provisions of the city’s floodplain ordinance to include the revised Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) and maps.
(Ord. 197, passed 2-26-1990; Am. Ord. 216, passed 10-18-1994)
§ 153.002 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   Flood hazard areas. The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to
periodic inundation, which results in potential loss of life, loss of property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   Methods used to analyze flood hazards. This chapter is based upon a
reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which is consistent with the
standards established by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.
(Ord. 197, passed 2-26-1990)
§ 153.003 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare, and to minimize those losses described in § 153.002 by
provisions contained herein.
(Ord. 197, passed 2-26-1990)
§ 153.004 APPLICABLE AREA.
   This chapter shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city
shown on the Official Zoning Map and/or the attachments thereto as being
located within the boundaries of the Floodway or Flood Fringe Districts.
(Ord. 197, passed 2-26-1990)
§ 153.005 OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.
   The revised Flood Insurance Study for the city prepared by the Federal
Insurance Administration, the revised Official Zoning Map together with all
materials attached thereto, including the revised Flood Boundary and Floodway
Map and revised Flood Insurance Rate Map with effective dates of November 2,
1994, shall be adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter.
(Ord. 197, passed 2-26-1990; Am. Ord. 216, passed 10-18-1994)
§ 153.006 REGULATORY FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION.
   The Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation shall be an elevation no lower
than one above the elevation of the regional flood, plus any increases in flood
elevation caused by encroachments on the floodplain that result from
designation of a floodway.
(Ord. 197, passed 2-26-1990)
§ 153.007 INTERPRETATION.
   (A)   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this
chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the governing body, and shall not be deemed a limitation
or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes.
   (B)   The boundaries of the zoning districts shall be determined by scaling
distances on the Official Zoning Map. Where interpretation is needed as to the
exact location of the boundaries of the district as shown on the Official
Zoning Map, as for example where there appears to be a conflict between a
mapped boundary and actual field conditions, and there is a formal appeal of
the decision of the Zoning Administrator, the Board of Adjustment shall make
the necessary interpretation. All decisions will be based on elevations on the
regional (100-year) flood profile and other available technical data. Persons
contesting the location of the district boundaries shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to present their cases to the Board and to submit technical
evidence.
(Ord. 197, passed 2-26-1990)
§ 153.008 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   It is not intended by this chapter to repeal, abrogate, or impair any
existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this
chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall
prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with this chapter are hereby
repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
(Ord. 197, passed 2-26-1990)
§ 153.009 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY. 
   This chapter does not imply that areas outside the floodplain districts or
land uses permitted within those districts will be free from flooding or
damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city or any
officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on
this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 197, passed 2-26-1990)
§ 153.010 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the same meaning as they have in common
usage, and so as to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
   ACCESSARY USE OR STRUCTURE. A use or structure on the same lot with, and of
a nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal use or
structure.
   BASEMENT. Any area of a structure, including crawlspaces, having its floor
or base subgrade (below ground level) on all four sides, regardless of the
depth of excavation below ground level.
   CONDITIONAL USE. A specific type of structure or land use listed in the
official control that may be allowed, but only after an in-depth review
procedure and with appropriate conditions or restrictions as provided in the
official zoning controls or building codes, and upon a finding that the
following apply.
      (1)   Certain conditions as detailed in the zoning ordinance exist.
      (2)   The structure and/or land use conform to the comprehensive land use
plan (if one exists) and are compatible with the existing neighborhood.
   EQUAL DEGREE OF ENCROACHMENT. A method of determining the location of
floodway boundaries so that floodplain lands on both sides of a stream are
capable of conveying a proportionate share of flood flows.
   FLOOD. A temporary increase in the flow or stage of a stream, or in the
stage of a wetland or lake that results in the inundation of normally dry
areas.
   FLOOD FREQUENCY. The frequency for which it is expected that a specific
flood stage or discharge may be equaled or exceeded.
   FLOOD FRINGE. That portion of the floodplain outside of the floodway. Flood
fringe is synonymous with the term Floodway Fringe, used in the Flood Insurance
Study for the city.
   FLOODPLAIN. The beds proper and the areas adjoining a wetland, lake or
watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regional flood.
   FLOODPROOFING. A combination of structural provisions, changes, or
adjustments to properties and structures subject to flooding, primarily for the
reduction or elimination of flood damages.
   FLOODWAY. The bed of a wetland or lake and the channel of a watercourse and
those portions of the adjoining floodplain which are reasonably required to
carry or store the regional flood discharge.
   OBSTRUCTION. Any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment,
projection, excavation, channel modification, culvert, building, wire, fence,
stockpile, refuse, fill, structure, or matter in, along, across, or projecting
into any channel, watercourse, or regulatory floodplain which may impede,
retard, or change the direction of the flow of water, either in itself or by
catching or collecting debris carried by the water.
   PRINCIPAL USE OR STRUCTURE. All uses or structures that are not accessary
uses or structures.
   REACH. A hydraulic engineering term to describe a longitudinal segment of a
stream or river influenced by a natural or man-made obstruction. In an urban
area, the segment of a stream or river between two consecutive bridge crossings
would most typically constitute a reach.
   REGIONAL FLOOD. A flood which is representative of large floods known to
have occurred generally in Minnesota, and reasonably characteristic of what can
be expected to occur on an average frequency in the magnitude of the 100-year
recurrence interval. Regional flood is synonymous with the term Base Flood used
in the Flood Insurance Study.
   REGULATORY FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION. An elevation no lower than one foot
above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation
caused by encroachments on the floodplain that result from designation of a
floodway.
   STRUCTURE. Anything constructed or erected on the ground or attached to the
ground or on-site utilities, including, but not limited to buildings,
factories, sheds, detached garages, cabins, manufactured homes, travel
trailers/vehicles not meeting the exemption criteria specified in § 153.102(A)
and other similar items.
   VARIANCE. A modification or variation of the provisions of this code, as
applied to a specific piece of property. A VARIANCE from the literal provisions
of this code may be granted only in instances where the strict enforcement of
these provisions would cause undue hardship because of circumstances unique to
the individual property under consideration. VARIANCES shall be granted only
when it is demonstrated that the granting of the variance will be in keeping
with the spirit and intent of this code. UNDUE HARDSHIP as used in connection
with the granting of a variance means the property in question cannot be put to
a reasonable use if used under conditions allowed by the official controls, the
plight of the landowner is due to circumstances unique to the property not
created by the landowner, and the variance, if granted, will not alter the
essential character of the locality. Economic considerations alone shall not
constitute an undue hardship if reasonable use for the property exists under
the terms of the ordinance. Undue hardship also includes, but is not limited
to, inadequate access to direct sunlight for solar energy systems. VARIANCES
shall be granted for earth sheltered construction as defined in M.S. § 216C.06,
Subdivision 2, as it may be amended from time to time, when in harmony with the
ordinance. A use that is not permitted under the code for property in the zone
where the affected person’s land is located shall not be permitted by the
granting of a variance. The temporary use of a one-family dwelling as a two-
family dwelling may be permitted by a variance. Conditions may be imposed in
the granting of variances to insure compliance and to protect adjacent
properties.
(Ord. 197, passed 2-26-1990)
§ 153.011 NONCONFORMING USES.
   A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful before
the passage or amendment of this chapter, but which is not in conformity with
the provisions of this chapter, may be continued subject to the following
conditions.
   (A)   No such use shall be expanded, changed, enlarged, or altered in a way
which increases its nonconformity.
   (B)   Any alteration or addition to a nonconforming structure or
nonconforming use which would result in increasing the flood damage potential
of that structure shall be protected to the Regulatory Flood Protection
Elevation in accordance with any of the elevation on fill or floodproofing
techniques ( such as FP-1 through FP-4 floodproofing classifications) allowable
in the State Building Code, except as further restricted in division (C).
   (C)   The cost of any structural alterations or additions to any
nonconforming structure over the life of the structure shall not exceed 50% of
the market value of the structure, unless the conditions of this section are
satisfied. The cost of all structural alterations and additions constructed
since the adoption of the Community’s initial floodplain controls must be
calculated into today’s current cost, which will include all costs, such as
construction materials and a reasonable cost placed on all manpower or labor.
If the current cost of all previous and proposed alterations and additions
exceeds 50% of the current market value of the structure, then the structure
must meet the standards of §§ 153.040 through 153.057 of this chapter for new
structures, depending upon whether the structure is in the Floodway or Flood
Fringe, respectively.
   (D)   If any nonconforming use is discontinued for 12 consecutive months,
any future use of the building premises shall conform to this chapter. The
assessor shall notify the Zoning Administrator in writing of instances of
nonconforming uses which have been discontinued for a period of 12 months.
   (E)   If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means,
including floods, to an extent of 50% or more of its market value at the time
of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the
provisions of this chapter. The applicable provisions for establishing new or
new structures in §§ 153.040 through 153.057 will apply, depending upon whether
the use or structure is in the Floodway or Flood Fringe District, respectively.
(Ord. 197, passed 2-26-1990)
Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 153.012 AMENDMENTS.
   The floodplain designation on the Official Zoning Map shall not be removed
from floodplain areas unless it can be shown that the designation is in error
or that the area has been filled to or above the elevation of the regional
flood and is contiguous to lands outside the floodplain. Special exceptions to
this rule may be permitted by the Commissioner of Natural Resources, if he or
she determines that, through other measures, lands are adequately protected for
the intended use. All amendments to this chapter, including amendments to the
Official Zoning Map, must be submitted to and approved by the Commissioner of
Natural Resources prior to adoption. Changes in the Official Zoning Map must
meet the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Technical Conditions and
Criteria, and must receive prior FEMA approval before adoption. The
Commissioner of Natural Resources must be given ten-days written notice of all
hearings to consider an amendment to this chapter, and the notice shall include
a draft of the amendment or technical study under consideration.

allowed in the floodway unless a long-term site development plan is submitted
which includes an erosion/sedimentation prevention element to the plan.
         (c)   As an alternative, and consistent with division (B)(4)(b) of
this section immediately above, dredge spoil disposal and sand and gravel
operations may allow temporary, on-site storage of fill or other materials
which would have caused an increase to the stage of the 100-year or regional
flood but only after the governing body has received an appropriate plan which
assures the removal of the materials from the floodway based upon the flood
warning time available. The conditional use permit must be title registered
with the property in the Office of the County Recorder.
      (5)   Accessory structures.
         (a)   Accessory structures shall not be designed for human habitation.

of flood waters.
            1.   Whenever possible, structures shall be constructed with the
longitudinal axis parallel to the, direction of flood flow.
            2.   So far as practicable, structures shall be placed
approximately on the same flood flow lines as those of adjoining structures.
         (c)   Accessory structures shall be elevated on fill or structurally
dry floodproofed in accordance with the FP-1 or FP-2 floodproofing
classifications in the State Building Code. As an alternative, an accessory
structure may be floodproofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 floodproofing classification
in the State Building Code, provided the accessory structure constitutes a
minimal investment, does not exceed 500 square feet in size, and for a detached
garage, the detached garage must be used solely for parking of vehicles and
limited storage. All floodproofed accessory structures must meet the following
additional standards, as appropriate.
            1.   The structure must be adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure, and shall be designed
to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
            2.   Any mechanical and utility equipment in a structure must be
elevated to or above the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation or properly
floodproofed.
      (6)   Storage of materials and equipment.
         (a)   The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of
flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or
plant life is prohibited.
         (b)   Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if
readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood
warning, and in accordance with a plan approved by the governing body.
      (7)   Structural works. Structural works for flood control that will
change the course, current or cross-section of protected wetlands or public
waters shall be subject to the provisions of M.S. Chapter 105, as it may be
amended from time to time. Community-wide structural works for flood control
intended to remove areas from the regulatory floodplain shall not be allowed in
the floodway.
      (8)   Avoidance of increase in flood level. A levee, dike or floodwall
constructed in the floodway shall not cause an increase to the 100-year or
regional flood and the technical analysis must assume equal conveyance or
storage loss on both sides of a stream.

§ 153.055 PERMITTED USES.
   (A)   Permitted uses. Permitted uses shall be those uses of land or
structures listed as permitted uses in the underlying zoning use district(s).
If no pre-existing, underlying zoning use districts exist, then any residential
or nonresidential structure or use of a structure or land shall be a permitted
use in the Flood Fringe, provided the use does not constitute a public
nuisance. All permitted uses shall comply with the standards for Flood Fringe
permitted uses listed in division (B) of this section, and the standards for
all Flood Fringe permitted and conditional uses listed in § 153.057.
   (B)   Standards for Flood Fringe permitted uses.
      (1)   All structures, including accessory structures, must be elevated on
fill so that the lowest floor, including basement floor, is at or above the
Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation. The finished fill elevation for
structures shall be no lower than one foot below the Regulatory Flood
Protection Elevation, and the fill shall extend at that elevation at least 15
feet beyond the outside limits of the structure erected thereon.
      (2)   As an alternative to elevation on fill, accessory structures that
constitute a minimal investment and that do not exceed square feet for the
outside dimension at ground level may be internally floodproofed in accordance
with § 153.041(B)(5).
      (3)   The cumulative placement of fill where, at any one time, in excess
of 1,000 cubic yards of fill is located on the parcel, shall be allowable only
as a conditional use, unless the fill is specifically intended to elevate a
structure in accordance with division (B)(1) of this section.
      (4)   The storage of any materials or equipment shall be elevated on fill
to the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation.
      (5)   The provisions of § 153.057 of this chapter shall apply.
(Ord. 197, passed 2-26-1990)
Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 153.056 CONDITIONAL USES.
   (A)   Conditional uses. Any structure that is not elevated on fill or
floodproofed in accordance with § 153.055(B)(1) and (B)(2), or any use of land
that does not comply with the standards in § 153.055 (B)(3) or (B)(4) shall
only be allowable as a conditional use. An application for a conditional use
shall be subject to the standards and criteria and evaluation procedures
specified in division (B) of this section, and in §§ 153.057 and 153.118.
   (B)   Standards for Flood Fringe conditional uses.
      (1)   Alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill may be
utilized to elevate a structure’s lowest floor above the Regulatory Flood
Protection Elevation. These alternative methods may include the use of stilts,
pilings, parallel walls, and the like, or above-grade enclosed areas, such as
crawl spaces or tuck-under garages. The base or floor of an enclosed area shall
be considered above- grade and not a structure’s basement or lowest floor if
the enclosed area is above-grade on at least one side of the structure; is
designed to internally flood and is constructed with flood resistant materials;
and is used solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage. The
above noted alternative elevation methods are subject to the following
additional standards
         (a)   Design and certification. The structure’s design and as-built
condition must be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect
as being in compliance with the general design standards of the State Building
Code and, specifically, that all electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and
air conditioning equipment and other service facilities must be at or above the
Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation, or be designed to prevent flood water
from entering or accumulating within these components during times of flooding.
         (b)   Specific standards for above-grade, enclosed areas. Above-grade,
fully enclosed areas, such as crawl spaces or tuck-under garages, must be
designed to internally flood, and the design plans must stipulate the
following.
            1.   The minimum area of openings in the walls where internal
flooding is to be used as a floodproofing technique. When openings are placed
in a structure’s walls to provide for entry of flood waters to equalize
pressures, the bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices, provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
flood waters.
            2.   That the enclosed area will be designed of flood-resistant
materials in accordance with the FP-3 or FP-4 classifications in the State
Building Code, and shall be used solely for building access, parking of
vehicles or storage.
      (2)   Basements, as defined in § 153.010, shall be subject to the
following.
         (a)   Residential basement construction shall not be allowed below the
Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation.
         (b)   Nonresidential basements may be allowed below the Regulatory
Flood Protection Elevation provided the basement is structurally dry
floodproofed in accordance with division (B)(3) of this section.
      (3)   All areas of nonresidential structures, including basements to be
placed below the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation, shall be floodproofed
in accordance with the structurally dry
floodproofing classifications in the State Building Code. Structurally dry
floodproofing must meet the FP-1 or FP-2 floodproofing classification in the
State Building Code, and this shall require making the structure watertight,
with the walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and with
structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. Structures floodproofed to the
FP-3 or FP-4 classification shall not be permitted.
      (4)   When at any one time more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill or other
similar material is located on a parcel for such activities as on-site storage,
landscaping, sand and gravel operations, landfills, roads, dredge spoil,
disposal or construction of flood control works, an erosion/sedimentation
control plan must be submitted unless the community is enforcing a state-
approved shoreland management ordinance. In the absence of a state-approved
shoreland ordinance, the plan must clearly specify methods to be used to
stabilize the fill on-site for a flood event at a minimum of the 100-year or
regional flood event. The plan must be prepared and certified by a registered
professional engineer or other qualified individual acceptable to the governing
body. The plan may incorporate alternative procedures for removal of the
material from the floodplain if adequate flood warning time exists.
      (5)   (a)   The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of
flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or
plant life is prohibited.
         (b)   Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if
readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning
and in accordance with a plan approved by the governing body.

§ 153.057 STANDARDS FOR ALL FLOOD FRINGE USES.
   (A)   New principal structures. All new principal structures must have
vehicular access at or above an elevation not more than two feet below the
Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation. If a variance to this requirement is
granted, the Board of Adjustment must specify limitations on the period of use
or occupancy of the structure for times of flooding, and only after determining
that adequate flood warning time and local flood emergency response procedures
exist.
   (B)   Commercial uses. Accessory land uses, such as yards, railroad tracks,
and parking lots may be at elevations lower than the Regulatory Flood
Protection Elevation. However, a permit for such facilities to be used by the
employees or the general public shall not be granted in the absence of a flood
warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area would be
inundated to a depth greater than two feet or be subject to flood velocities
greater than four feet per second upon occurrence of the regional flood.
   (C)   Manufacturing and industrial uses. Measures shall be taken to minimize
interference with normal plant operations, especially along streams having
protracted flood durations. Certain accessory land uses such as yards and
parking lots may be at lower elevations, subject to requirements set out in
division (B) of this section. In considering permit applications, due
consideration shall be given to needs of an industry whose business requires
that it be located in floodplain areas.
   (D)   Fill. Fill shall be properly compacted and the slopes shall be
properly protected by the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable
method. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria
for removing the special flood hazard area designation for certain structures
properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation. FEMA’s
requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection
standards for multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should
be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of
special hazard area designation will be requested.
   (E)   Floodplain developments. Floodplain developments shall not adversely
affect the hydraulic capacity of the channel and adjoining floodplain of any
tributary watercourse or drainage system where a floodway or other encroachment
limit has not been specified on the Official Zoning Map.
   (F)   Travel vehicles. Standards for travel trailers and travel vehicles are
contained in § 153.102.
   (G)   Manufactured homes. All manufactured homes must be securely anchored
to an adequately anchored foundation system that resists flotation, collapse
and lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be
limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This
requirement is in addition to applicable state or local anchoring requirements
for resisting wind forces.

   (A)   Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with
any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards
established in connection with grants of variances, or conditional uses) shall
constitute a misdemeanor and shall be punishable as defined by law.
   (B)   Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city from taking other
lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. Actions may
include but are not limited to the following.
      (1)   In responding to a suspected ordinance violation, the Zoning
Administrator and local government may utilize the full array of enforcement
actions available to it, including but not limited to prosecution and fines,
injunctions, after-the-fact permits, orders for corrective measures or a
request to the National Flood Insurance Program for denial of flood insurance
availability to the guilty party. The community must act in good faith to
enforce these official controls and to correct violations to the extent
possible, so as not to jeopardize its eligibility in the National Flood
Insurance Program.
      (2)   When a violation is either discovered by or brought to the
attention of the Zoning Administrator, the Zoning Administrator shall
immediately investigate the situation and document the nature and extent of the
violation of the official control. As soon as is reasonably possible, this
information will be submitted to the appropriate Department of Natural
Resources and Federal Emergency Management Agency Regional Office along with
the community’s plan of action to correct the violation to the degree possible.
      (3)   The Zoning Administrator shall notify the suspected party of the
requirements of this chapter and all other official controls and the nature and
extent of the suspected violation of these controls. If the structure and/or
use is under construction or development, the Zoning Administrator may order
the construction or development immediately halted until a proper permit or
approval is granted by the community. If the construction or development is
already completed, then the Zoning Administrator may either issue an order
identifying the corrective actions that must be made within a specified time
period to bring the use or structure into compliance with the official
controls, or notify the responsible party to apply for an after-the-fact
permit/development approval within a specified period of time not to exceed 30
days,
      (4)   If the responsible party does not appropriately respond to the
Zoning Administrator within the specified period of time, each additional day
that lapses shall constitute an additional violation of this chapter, and shall
be prosecuted accordingly. The Zoning Administrator shall also, upon the lapse
of the specified response period, notify the landowner to restore the land to
the condition which existed prior to the violation of this chapter.

SUBDIVISION DESIGN STANDARDS.
§ 154.045 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Requirements of city. The Planning Commission, in its review of the
preliminary plat, will take into consideration the requirements of the city and
the best use of the land being subdivided.
   (B)   Conformance to Comprehensive Plan. If a Comprehensive Plan or official
map has been adopted by the city, the subdivision shall conform to it.
   (C)   Relationship to existing and planned subdivisions. The arrangement,
character, extent, width and location of all streets shall be considered in
their relation to existing and planned streets, to reasonable circulation of
traffic, to topographic conditions, to runoff of storm water, to public
convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses
of the land to be served by the streets. Wherever possible and necessary, the
arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall provide for the continuation
of existing streets in adjoining areas. Where adjoining unsubdivided areas may
be subdivided, the arrangement of streets in a new subdivision shall make
provision for the proper projection of the street into adjoining areas by
carrying the new streets to the boundaries of the new subdivision at
appropriate locations.
   (D)   Limitations in floodplains.
      (1)   Lots within floodplain. No land shall be subdivided which is
unsuitable for the reason of flooding, inadequate drainage, water supply or
sewage treatment facilities. All lots within the floodplain districts shall
contain a building site at or above the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation.
All subdivisions shall have water and sewage treatment facilities that comply
with the provisions of this chapter, and shall have road access both to the
subdivision and to the individual building sites no longer than two feet below
the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation. For all subdivisions in the
floodplain, the Floodway and Flood Fringe boundaries, the Regulatory Flood
Protection Elevation and the required elevation of all access roads shall be
clearly labeled on all required subdivision drawings and platting documents.
      (2)   Removal of special flood hazard area designation. The Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for removing the
special flood hazard area designation for certain structures properly elevated
on fill above the 100-year elevation. FEMA’s requirements incorporate specific
fill compaction and side slope protection standards for multi-structures or
multi-lot developments. These standards should be investigated prior to the
initiation of site preparation if a change of special flood hazard area
designation will be requested.

   *Not recommended
   **Special topography conditions (100 feet or less in length): 12%
   (B)   Street intersections. Insofar as practical, streets shall intersect at
right angles. In no case shall the angle formed by the intersection of two
streets be less than 75°. Intersections having more than four corners shall be
prohibited. Adequate land for future intersection and interchange construction
needs shall be dedicated.
   (C)   Street jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 100 feet
shall be avoided for local streets.
   (D)   Local streets. Minor streets shall be laid out so that their use by
through traffic is discouraged.

sac shall be 500 feet, measured from the centerline of the street of origin to
the end of the cul-de-sac right-of-way.
   (F)   Access to arterial streets. In the case where a proposed plat is
adjacent to a limited access highway (arterial), there shall be no direct
vehicular or pedestrian access from individual lots to highways. As a general
requirement, access arterials shall be at intervals of not less than ¼ mile and
through existing and established cross roads where possible.
   (G)   Half streets. Half streets shall be prohibited, except where it will
be practical to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining
property is subdivided, in which case the dedication of a half street may be
permitted. The probable length of time elapsing before dedication of the
remainder shall be considered in this decision.
   (H)   Hardship to owners of adjoining property. The street arrangements
shall not be such as to cause hardship to owners of adjoining property in
platting their own land and providing convenient access to it.

Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 154.047 BLOCKS.
   The length, width and acreage of blocks shall be sufficient to provide for
convenient access, circulation, control and safety of street design. Blocks may
be longer than 1,300 feet or shorter than 300 feet only if the Zoning
Administrator and city staff agree that exceptions are warranted. Exceptions
may be warranted in order to foster design originality provided that the
exceptions do not violate sound planning principles. Pedestrian ways may be
required on blocks longer than 900 feet, or in other areas dedicated to the
city to provide access to schools, parks and other destinations. Pedestrian
ways shall be at least ten feet wide, and shall be located so as to minimize
intersections with streets.

shown for all natural features, such as tree growth, wetlands, steep slopes,
watercourses, historic spots, or similar conditions, and plans adjusted to
preserve those which will add attractiveness, safety and stability to the
proposed development.
   (E)   Lot remnants. All remnants of lots below minimum size left over after
subdividing of a larger tract must be added to adjacent lots rather than
allowed to remain as unusable parcels.
   (F)   Double frontage lots. Double frontage lots (lots with frontage on two
parallel streets) or reverse frontage shall not be permitted except where lots
back on an arterial or collector street. Such lots shall have an additional
depth of at least ten feet in order to allow for screen planting along the back
lot line.
   (G)   Large lots. On large lots (one acre or more) septic tanks and drain
fields shall be located in such a way as to allow future subdivision of the
land.
(Ord. 217, passed 11-28-1994)

   (A)   The development shall conform to the natural limitations presented by
topography and soil so as to create the least potential for soil erosion.
   (B)   Erosion and siltation control measures shall be coordinated with the
different stages of development. Appropriate control measure shall be installed
prior to development when necessary to control erosion.
   (C)   Land shall be developed in increments of workable size such that
adequate erosion and siltation controls can be provided as construction
progresses. The smallest practical area of land shall be exposed at any one
period of time.
   (D)   When soil is exposed, the exposure shall be for the shortest feasible
period of time.
   (E)   Where the topsoil is removed, sufficient arable soil shall be set

§ 154.054 SANITATION.
   (A)   Where lots cannot be connected with a public sewerage system,
provisions must be made for sanitary sewerage facilities, consisting of
individual disposal systems for each lot. This does not mean that the
installation of individual disposal devices shall be at the expense of the
subdivider.
   (B)   Any subdivision or lot not provided with off-site sewer facilities may
be subject to soil and percolation tests being made to determine whether or not
the lot size proposed will meet minimum standards of health and sanitation, if
requested by the Planning Commission due to limitations of soils as shown on
existing soils maps. The lot area and topography must be such that it will
accommodate an adequate disposal system or systems to serve the residents for
the estimated unsewered years as determined by the governing body. Tests shall
be made at the expense of the subdivider and a sketch map shall be submitted to
identify the specific locations where tests were made.
   (C)   All proposed sewage disposal systems shall comply with the regulations
and recommended standards of the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (WPC-40),
and with the provisions of §§ 51.55 through 51.62, relating to private sewage

shall be required to provide a connection to the city system. Where a city
connection is determined to be feasible, service connections shall be stubbed
into each platted lot.
   (F)   Drainage. A system that will adequately take care of the surface water
runoff within the subdivision shall be installed where necessary in conjunction
with the grading of streets. Cross drains shall be provided to accommodate all
natural water flow, and shall be of sufficient length to permit full- width
roadways and required side slopes. Drainage ditches shall be sodded to prevent
erosion. When feasible, curb and gutter drainage shall be handled by storm
sewers.
   (G)   Public utilities. All utility lines for telephone and electrical
service shall be placed in rear line easements when carried on overhead poles.
   (H)   Parks and parkland. On all subdivisions consisting of five or more
lots and five or more acres, the property owner shall be required to provide
for parks. Subject to the approval of the Park Board, developers shall dedicate
5% of the total land mass to parks, or shall make a cash donation of $150 per
lot for parks.

PUD PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT
§ 155.165 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to provide areas which can be developed
with some modification of the strict application of regulations of the normal
zoning districts in accordance with the provisions and regulations contained
herein.
(Ord. 221, passed 11-6-1995)
§ 155.166 RESTRICTIONS. 
   Planned Unit Developments can be developed within any district with the
overall population density, number of living units or intensity of use
permitted to be constructed in general conformance with the provisions of the
basic zoning district in which it is located. Densities or intensities may be
permitted higher than those permitted in the zoning district with the specific
density or intensity determined by the Planning Commission and City Council.
However, rather than strictly enforcing the concept of uniformity of building
types in each district, this provision will encourage the following.
   (A)   Flexibility in land development to benefit from new technology in
building design and construction and land development.
   (B)   Variety in the organization of site elements, building densities and
housing types.
   (C)   Higher standards of site and building design through the use of
trained and experienced Land Planners. Registered architects and/or landscape
architects shall prepare plans for all Planned Unit Developments.
   (D)   Preservation and enhancement of desirable site characteristics and
open space.
   (E)   More efficient and effective use of land, open space and public
facilities.
(Ord. 221, passed 11-6-1995)
Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 155.167 PERMITTED USES.
   Within a PUD, no land shall be used except for one or more of the following
uses.
   (A)   Those uses listed as permitted or conditional uses in the district(s)
in which the development is proposed.
   (B)   Educational, religious, cultural, recreational or commercial
facilities that are designed and intended to serve the residents of the Planned
Unit Development. The burden of proof shall rest upon the applicant to show
that nonresidential uses, when located in a Residential District, are designed
and intended for the primary use of the residents in the PUD; provided further
that no commercial uses shall be constructed until 75% of the total dwelling
units contained in the entire project are completed. COMPLETED shall mean
qualifying for a certificate of occupancy.
   (C)   Uses normally more appropriate in other zoning districts shall not
occupy more than 15% of the land area within the district(s) in which the
development is proposed.
(Ord. 221, passed 11-6-1995)
Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 155.168 AREA, SETBACK, HEIGHT AND COVERAGE REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Lot area regulations. The minimum total project area shall be not less
than ten acres. Projects of less than ten acres may qualify only if the
applicant can show that the minimum lot area requirement should be waived
because the PUD is in the public interest and that one or both of the following
conditions exist.
      (1)   Unusual physical features of the property itself or of the
surrounding neighborhood are such that development under the standard
provisions of the normal district would not be appropriate in order to conserve
a physical or terrain feature of importance to the neighborhood or community.
      (2)   The property is adjacent to or across the street from property
which has been developed under the provisions of this section and will
contribute to the amenities of the neighborhood.
   (B)   Density. A PUD may provide for a variety of housing types in any one
of the basic residential zoning districts. The total number of dwelling units
permitted in a development shall be determined by either the area standards of
the zoning district in which the proposed development is to be located; or the
density specified by the Planning Commission or City Council consistent with
the intent of the city land use plan. A plan may provide for a greater number
of dwelling units per acre than would otherwise be permitted by the regulations
otherwise applicable to the site; however, the applicant has the burden to show
that the excess will not have an adverse effect on existing public facilities
and on the reasonable enjoyment of neighboring property. The Planning
Commission and City Council, in determining the reasonableness of the increase
in the authorized dwelling units per acre, shall recognize that increased
density may be compensated for by additional private amenities, and by
increased efficiency in public facilities and services to be achieved by the
location, amount and proposed use of common open space; the locations, design
and type of dwelling units; and the physical characteristics of the site.
   (C)   Front, rear and side yard building setback regulations. The PUD plan
shall state front, rear and side yard building setbacks for each lot in the
development.
   (D)   Building height regulations. There shall be no height limitations for
any buildings in a PUD, except that all buildings shall observe the setback
requirements and densities as specified in this section.
   (E)   Lot coverage.  
      (1)   In residential districts, the total ground area occupied by
buildings in a PUD shall not exceed 20% of the total site area. It the total
project is to be staged as regulated below, open space shall be provided so
that the ground coverage of each stage shall not exceed the maximum allowable
coverage.
      (2)   In nonresidential districts, the total ground area occupied by
buildings in a PUD shall not exceed 50% of the total project or commercial
facilities that are designed and intended to serve the residents of the Planned
Unit Development. The burden of proof shall rest upon the applicant to show
that nonresidential uses, when located in a residential district, are designed
and intended for the primary use of the residents in the PUD, provided further
that no commercial uses shall be constructed until 75% of the total dwelling
units contained in the entire project are completed. COMPLETED shall mean
qualifying for a certificate of occupancy.
      (3)   Uses normally more appropriate in other zoning districts shall not
occupy more than 15% of the land area within the district(s) in which the
development is proposed.

dwellings must comply with Chapter 154, Subdivision
Regulations in all respects not specifically noted in this subchapter as
appropriate variances or waivers.
   (B)   Building type. A PUD which only involves one building or housing type,
such as all detached or all attached units, shall not be considered as
inconsistent with the stated purposes and objectives of this subchapter, and
shall not be the sole basis for denial or approval.
   (C)   Considerations for review. Architectural style of buildings shall not
solely be a basis for denial or approval of a plan. However, the overall
appearance and compatibility of individual buildings to other site elements, or
to surrounding development, will be primary considerations in the review stages
of the Planning Commission and City Council.
   (D)   Land being reviewed. No building permit shall be granted for any
building on land for which a plan for a PUD is in the process of city review,
or which does not conform to the approved final plan or for one phase of the
final plan.
   (E)   Staging of development.
      (1)   Any PUD plan proposed to be construed in stages shall include full
details relative thereto, and the City Council may approve or modify, where
necessary, any such proposals.
      (2)   The staging shall include the time for beginning and completion of
each stage. The timing may be modified by the City Council on the showing of
good cause by the developer.
      (3)   The land owner or developer shall make any easements, convenants
and other arrangements, and shall furnish any performance bond or bonds as may
be determined by the City Council to be reasonably required to assure
performance and completion of private streets and utilities, landscaping and
privately-owned and maintained recreational facilities in accordance with the
plan, and to protect the public interest in the event of abandonment of the
plan before completion. The bond shall not be required to exceed 20% of the
estimated development costs for each stage.
   (F)   Open space.
      (1)   A primary function of PUD provision is to encourage development
which will preserve and enhance the worthwhile, natural terrain characteristics
and not force intense development to utilize all portions of a given site in
order to arrive at the minimum intensity or density permitted. When evaluating
individual proposals, the recognition of this objective will be a basic
consideration when granting approval or denial, including but not limited to
the following.
         (a)   The amount and location of common open space shall be consistent
with the stated purpose and intent of this subchapter, and in no case shall be
less than 15% of the total project area. The Planning Commission and City
Council may determine that portions of this open space, not to exceed 5% of the
total area site, will be dedicated to the city for general public recreation or
open space purposes.
         (b)   All common open space shall be labeled as such and as to its
intent or designed functions.
      (2)   In the event certain land areas or structures are provided within
the Planned Unit Development for private recreational use or as service
facilities, the owner of the land and buildings shall enter into an agreement
with the city to assure the continued operation and maintenance to
predetermined reasonable standards. Common areas may be placed under the
ownership of one of the following.
         (a)   Dedicated to public where a community-wide use would be
anticipated.
         (b)   Landlord control.
         (c)   Homeowner’s Association, provided all of the following
conditions are met.
            1.   The Homeowner’s Association must be established prior to any
sale.
            2.   Membership must be mandatory for each owner, and any
successive buyer.
            3.   The open space restrictions must be permanent, not for a given
period of years.
            4.   The Association must be responsible for liability insurance,
local taxes, and the maintenance of residential and other facilities.
            5.   Landowners must pay their pro rata share of the cost and the
assessment levied by the association that can become a lien on the property, in
accordance with the Minnesota Statutes.
            6.   The Association must be able to adjust the assessment to meet
changed needs.
   (G)   Convenants, easements and restrictions. The final plan shall contain
proposed covenants, easements and other provisions relating to the bulk,
location and density of residential units, nonresidential uses and public
facilities as are necessary for the welfare of the Planned Unit Development and
are consistent with the best interests of the entire city. All or any
covenants, easements and other provisions which are part of the final plan may
be modified, enforced, removed or released as deemed necessary by the City
Council for the preservation of the public health, safety, morals and general
welfare of all city residents.
   (H)   Streets, utilities, services, and public facilities. The uniqueness of
each proposal for a PUD requires that specifications and standards for streets,
utilities and services shall be subject to minor modifications from the
specifications and standards established in this chapter and other city
ordinances governing their construction. The City Council may, therefor, waive
or modify the specifications or standards where it is found that they are not
required in the interests of the residents or of the entire city. The plans and
profiles of all streets, utilities and services shall be reviewed and modified
if necessary,
and approved by the appropriate city staff prior to the final approval of the
PUD plan by the City Council. All PUD projects shall be served by public or
community water and sewer systems. All utilities including electrical will be
placed underground.

§ 155.170 APPLICATIONS, REVIEW AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   General procedure for application, review and action. The general
procedure for application, review and action on a PUD shall be according to the
following outline, with more detailed requirements found in the remainder of
this subdivision.
      (1)   The applicant shall file the completed application form together
with required exhibits, for the preliminary plan, with the Zoning
Administrator, and shall pay a filing fee as established by the Council.
      (2)   The Zoning Administrator shall review the application and within
ten business days after receiving the application shall notify the applicant in
writing if the application is not complete, and what additional information is
required.
      (3)   When the Zoning Administrator determines the application to be
complete, the Zoning Administrator shall set the date for a public hearing and
shall have notices of the hearing published in the legal newspaper, and shall
notify all property owners within 350 feet of the outer boundaries of the
property in question; not less than ten days and not more than 30 days prior to
the hearing. However, failure of any property owner to receive notification
shall not invalidate the proceedings at least once. The Council may waive the
mailed notice requirements for a city-wide amendment to this chapter initiated
by the Planning Commission or City Council. Notice of hearings shall be posted
at the City Hall and in one other place at least ten days prior to the public
hearing, in addition to publishing the notice in the official newspaper. This
notice shall describe the particular amendment, date, time and place of
hearing. The current City Assessor’s current tax records shall be deemed
sufficient for the location or certification of ownership of the adjacent
properties.
      (4)   The city shall take action to approve or deny the application
within 60 days of receiving a completed application. If the city cannot take
action to approve or deny the application within 60 days of receiving the
completed application, the city may make a one-time extension of the time for
taking action before the end of the initial 60-day period by providing written
notice of the extension, the reasons for the extension, and its anticipated
length, which may not exceed 60 days unless approved by the applicant in
writing. A valid reason for this extension may be that the city needs more time
to consider the application. A motion to approve the application which fails to
pass because of sufficient votes, shall not be deemed to be a denial of an
application. The passage of a motion to deny the application is required in
order for an application to be denied. Additional extensions beyond the first
extension will require the approval by the applicant in writing.
      (5)   The Planning Commission shall hold the public hearing, and may
table the application for further investigation if necessary, or the Commission
shall recommend to the Council one of three actions: approval, conditional
approval or denial.
      (6)   The Council shall act upon the application within 30 days after
receiving the recommendation of the Planning Commission.
      (7)   If the City Council approves the preliminary plan, the Zoning

zoning change was made, and further designates the district or portion of a
district as a PUD.
      (8)   The applicant shall submit final plans and all of the required
attachments to the city within 90 days of preliminary plan approval.
      (9)   The Zoning Administrator shall review the application, and within
ten business days after receiving the application, shall notify the applicant
in writing if the application is not complete and what additional information
is required.
      (10)   When the Zoning Administrator determines the application to be
complete, the City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer shall transmit copies of the
final plan to the Planning Commission and appropriate city staff.
      (11)   The Planning Commission shall review the final plans and may table
the application for further investigation if necessary, or the Commission shall
recommend to the Council one of three actions, approval, conditional approval
or denial, at least five days before the next Council meeting.
      (12)   The Council shall act upon the application after receiving the
recommendation of the Planning Commission.
   (B)   Similar to amendment procedure. Application procedures for a PUD
generally follow the procedure for amendment, set forth in § 155.007, with more
specific application requirements in the following divisions.
   (C)   Application by property owner. Application for a PUD shall be made by
the owner of the property, except that an option holder may apply for a PUD,
provided the application is accompanied by a signed statement indicating no
objections from the owner or owners of all properties involved in the
application.
   (D)   Preliminary PUD plan. Application for a preliminary PUD plan shall be
filed with the City Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer, and shall be accompanied by
six copies of the following plans and information.

or ordinance, unless the use is changed to one permitted in the district in
which the building or structure or land is located.
   (C)   A nonconforming use of a building may be replaced with another
nonconforming use, provided no structural alterations are made.

the change, except as defined in division (E) below.
   (E)   A nonconforming use may be changed to a more conforming use at any
time.
   (F)   Whenever a nonconforming use has been changed to a conforming use, the
use shall not thereafter be changed to a less conforming use.
   (G)   The extension or addition of a lawful use to any portion of a
nonconforming building or structure or land shall not be deemed as the
extension of the nonconforming use.
   (H)   Where nonconforming status applies to a building or structure, the
removal or destruction of same shall eliminate the nonconforming status of
land.
   (I)   If a building or structure is moved for any reason for any distance
whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in
which it is located after it is removed.
   (J)   All uses which lawfully exist on the effective date of this chapter
and are classified as a conditional use by this chapter for the district in
which they are located shall be considered lawful conditional uses.
   (K)   Whenever the boundaries of a district shall be changed so as to
transfer an area from one district to another district of a different
classification, the provisions of this subchapter shall also apply to any
nonconforming uses developing as a result of that action.

CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS; PROCEDURES
§ 155.250 APPLICATION.
   (A)   Conditional use permits may be issued for any and only the uses or
purposes for which such permits are required or permitted by provisions of this
chapter.
   (B)   An application for a conditional use permit shall be filled with the
Zoning Administrator indicating the section of this chapter under which the
conditional use permit is sought, and stating the grounds on which it is
requested. The application shall be accompanied by plans and elevations and
site plans as prescribed by the Board of Adjustment and presented by the Zoning
Administrator to the Board. A copy of all applications for a conditional use
under the provisions of the floodway and/or flood fringe portions of the
Floodplain District shall be forwarded to the Commissioner of Natural Resources
ten days prior to a public hearing.
   (C)   The applicant shall file the completed application form together with
required exhibits with the Zoning Administrator, and shall pay a filing fee as
established by the Council.
   (D)   The Zoning Administrator shall review the application and within ten
business days after receiving the application, shall notify the applicant in
writing if the application is not complete, and advise the applicant of what
additional information is required.
   (E)   When the Zoning Administrator determines the application to be
complete, the Zoning Administrator shall set the date for a public hearing, and
shall have notices of the hearing published in the legal newspaper, and shall
notify all property owners within the affected zone and within 350 feet of the
outer boundaries of the property in question; however, failure of any property
owner to receive notification shall not invalidate the proceedings at least
once, not less than ten days and not more than 30 days prior to the hearing.
The Council may waive the mailed notice requirements for a city-wide amendment
to this chapter initiated by the Planning Commission or City Council. Notice of
hearings shall be posted at the City Hall and in one other place at least ten
days prior to the public hearing. This notice shall describe the particular
amendment, date, time and place of hearing. The current City Assessor’s current
tax records shall be deemed sufficient for the location or certification of
ownership of the adjacent properties.
   (F)   The city shall take action to approve or deny the application within
60 days of receiving a completed application. If the city cannot take action to
approve or deny the application within 60 days of receiving the completed
application, the city may make a one-time extension of the time for taking
action before the end of the initial 60-day period by providing written notice
of the extension, the reasons for the extension, and its anticipated length,
which may not exceed 60 days unless approved by the applicant in writing. A
valid reason for this extension may be that the city needs more time to
consider the application. A motion to approve the application which fails to
pass because of sufficient votes, shall not be deemed to be a denial of an
application. The passage of a motion to deny the application is required in
order for an application to be denied. Additional extensions beyond the first
extension will require the approval by the applicant in writing.
   (G)   The Planning Commission shall hold the public hearing, and may table
the application for further investigation if necessary, or the Commission shall
recommend to the Council one of three actions: approval, conditional approval
or denial.
   (H)   No application of a property owner for an amendment to the text of
this chapter or the zoning map shall be considered by the Planning Commission
within the one-year period following a denial of the request, except the
Planning Commission may permit a new application, if, in the opinion of the
Planning Commission, new evidence or a change of circumstances warrant it.

hearing, a notice of the hearing shall be published in the official newspaper
of the city and like notification at least ten days prior to the hearing to the

Assessor’s current tax record shall be deemed sufficient for the location or
certification of ownership of the adjacent properties.

enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purpose already
permitted, nor substantially diminish and impair property values within the
immediate vicinity.

normal and orderly development and improvement of surrounding vacant property

with the use and enjoyment of adjacent property.
      (3)   To the extent feasible, back-flush water or water from pool
drainage shall be directed onto the owner's property or onto approved public
drainage ways, and shall not drain onto adjacent private land. Drainage onto
public streets or other public drainage ways shall require permission of the
appropriate local city officials. Pools may not be drained into the city
sanitary sewer system.
   (C)   The construction, plumbing and electrical work connected with any pool
shall conform to all applicable codes of the city.

§ 155.282 APPEAL FOR VARIANCE.
   (A)   Application for any adjustment permissible under the hardship
provision in § 155.281(E) shall be made to the Zoning Administrator in the form
of a written application for a permit to use the land or building or both, as
set forth in the application. No nonconforming use of neighboring lands,
structures or buildings in the same district, and no permitted use of lands,
structures or other buildings in other districts shall be considered ground for
the issuance of a variance.
   (B)   The application shall present a statement and adequate evidence
showing the following.
      (1)   That there are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or
conditions applying to the land, building, or use referred to in the
application, which circumstances or conditions do not apply
generally to land, building, or uses in the same zoning classification, and
that strict enforcement would cause undue hardship because of circumstances
unique to the individual property under consideration. Undue hardship is
defined in the definition of variance in § 155.006.
      (2)   That the granting of the application is necessary for the
preservation and employment of substantial property rights of the petitioner.
      (3)   That the reasons set forth in the application justify the granting
of the variance.
      (4)   That the variance is the minimum variance that will make possible
the reasonable use of land, building or structure.
      (5)   That the granting of the application will not, under the
circumstances of the particular case, materially affect adversely the health or
safety of persons residing or working in the neighborhood of the property of
the applicant, and will not, under the circumstances of the particular case, be
materially detrimental to the public welfare, or injurious to property or
improvements in the neighborhood.
      (6)   That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from
the actions of the applicant.
      (7)   That granting the application will not confer on the applicant any
special privilege that is denied by this chapter to other lands, structures, or
buildings in the same district.

Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 155.283 PUBLIC HEARING; NOTIFICATION.
   (A)   Application for any adjustment permissible under the provisions of
this subchapter shall be made to the Zoning Administrator, in the form of a
written application for a building permit to use the property or premises as
set forth in the application. An application for a variance shall be
accompanied by payment of a fee as established in § 155.269, in addition to the
regular building permit fee.
   (B)   All required information shall be submitted with the application, and
the Zoning Administrator shall review the application, and within ten business
days after receiving the application, he or she shall notify the applicant in
writing if the application is not complete, and advise the applicant as to what
additional information is required.
   (C)   When the Zoning Administrator determines the application to be
complete, the Zoning Administrator shall set the date for a public hearing, and
shall have notices of the hearing published in the legal newspaper, and shall
notify all property owners within 350 feet of the outer boundaries of the
property in question; not less than ten days and not more than 30 days prior to
the hearing. However, failure of any property owner to receive notification
shall not invalidate the proceedings at least once. The Council may waive the
mailed notice requirements for a city-wide amendment to this chapter initiated
by the Planning Commission or City Council. Notice of the hearings shall be
posted at the City Hall and in one other place at least ten days prior to the
public hearing, in addition to publishing the notice in the official newspaper.
This notice shall describe the particular amendment, date, time and place of
hearing. The current City Assessor’s current tax records shall be deemed
sufficient for the location or certification of ownership of the adjacent
properties.
   (D)   The city shall take action to approve or deny the application within
60 days of receiving a completed application. If the city cannot take action to
approve or deny the application within 60 days of receiving the completed
application, the city may make a one-time extension of the time for taking
action before the end of the initial 60-day period by providing written notice
of the extension, the reasons for the extension, and its anticipated length,
which may not exceed 60 days unless approved by the applicant in writing. A
valid reason for this extension may be that the city needs more time to
consider the application. A motion to approve the application which fails to
pass because of sufficient votes, shall not be deemed to be a denial of an
application. The passage of a motion to deny the application is required in
order for an application to be denied. Additional extensions beyond the first
extension will require the approval by the applicant in writing.
   (E)   Any person may appear or be represented by an agency or attorney.
   (F)   Within a reasonable time after the hearing, the Planning Commission
shall make its order deciding the matter and serve a copy of the order upon the
applicant or the petitioner by mail.

from the decision of the Administrative Official, and that recourse from the
decisions of the Board of Adjustment shall be to the City Council, then to the

subject to the terms of § 10.99. Each day that a violation continues shall
