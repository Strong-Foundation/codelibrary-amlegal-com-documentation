§ 1.10 CERTIFICATION OF MISDEMEANOR AS PETTY MISDEMEANOR.
   Subd. 1.   General Rule. Except as provided in Subd. 2. below, if the
prosecuting attorney believes it is in the interest of justice that the
defendant not be imprisoned if convicted, an alleged misdemeanor violation may
be treated as a petty misdemeanor. The prosecuting attorney shall certify that
belief to the Court at or before the time of arraignment or pretrial hearing.
The Court shall approve the certification motion but the defendant's consent to
the certification is not required. When an offense is certified as a petty
misdemeanor under this section, the defendant's eligibility for Court appointed
counsel must be evaluated as though the offense were a misdemeanor.
   Subd. 2.   Certain Violations Excepted. Subd. 1 above shall not apply to a
misdemeanor violation of M.S. §§ 169A.20, 609.224, 609.226, 609.324(3), 609.52,
617.23, or 609.2242, as amended, (or any ordinance that conforms in substantial
part to these state statutes). A violation of the state statutes, or ordinances
in conformity therewith, must be treated as a misdemeanor unless the defendant
consents to the certification of the violation as a petty misdemeanor.
   Subd. 3.   Use of Conviction for Enhancement. Notwithstanding any other law,
a conviction for a violation that was originally charged as a misdemeanor and
was treated as a petty misdemeanor under Subd. 1. above, or the Rules of
Criminal Procedure, may not be used as the basis for charging a subsequent
violation as a gross misdemeanor rather than a misdemeanor.
§ 1.11 TITLES.
   A title or caption to or in any chapter, section, subdivision, subparagraph
or other provision of the City Code is for convenience only and shall not
limit, expand or otherwise alter or control the content, wording or
interpretation thereof.
§ 1.12 REFERENCE TO A PUBLIC OFFICIAL.
   Wherever an appointed public official is referred to in the City Code, the
reference shall include the public official or his or her designee.
§ 1.13 ADMINISTRATIVE CITATIONS AND CIVIL PENALTIES.
   Subd. 1.   Purpose. The City Council finds that there is a need for
alternative methods of enforcing the City Code. While criminal fines and
penalties have been the most frequent enforcement mechanism, there are certain
negative consequences for both the city and the accused. The delay inherent in
that system does not ensure prompt resolution. Citizens resent being labeled as
criminals for violations of administrative regulations. The higher burden of
proof and the potential of incarceration do not appear appropriate for most
administrative violations. The criminal process does not always regard City
Code violations as being important. Accordingly, the City Council finds that
the use of administrative citations and the imposition of civil penalties is a
legitimate and necessary alternative method of enforcement. This method of
enforcement is in addition to any other legal remedy that may be pursued for
City Code violations.
   Subd. 2.   General Provisions.
      A.   A violation of a provision of the City Code is an administrative
offense, that may be subject to an administrative citation and civil penalties.
Each day a violation exists constitutes a separate offense.
      B.   An administrative offense may be subject to a civil penalty not
exceeding $1,000.
      C.   The City Council must adopt by resolution a schedule of fines for
offenses initiated by administration citation. The City Council is not bound by
that schedule when a matter is appealed to it for administrative review. The
City Council may adopt a schedule of fees to be paid to administrative Hearing
Officers.
      D.   The City Administrator must adopt procedures for administering the
administrative citation program.
   Subd. 3.   Administrative Citation.
      A.   A person authorized to enforce provisions of the City Code may issue
an administrative citation upon belief that a code violation has occurred. The
citation must be issued in person or by mail to the person responsible for the
violation or attached to the motor vehicle in the case of a vehicular offense.
The citation must state the date, time and nature of the offense, the name of
the issuing officer, the amount of the scheduled fine and the manner for paying
the fine or appealing the citation.
      B.   The person responsible for the violation must either pay the
scheduled fine or request a hearing within seven days after issuance. Payment
of the fine constitutes admission of the violation. A late payment fee of 10%
of the scheduled fine shall be imposed in accordance with Subd. 7.D. below.
   Subd. 4.   Administrative Hearing.
      A.   Hearing. Any person contesting an administrative offense pursuant to
this subdivision may, within seven days of the time of issuance of the notice,
request a hearing by a Hearing Officer who shall forthwith conduct an informal
hearing to determine if a violation has occurred.
      B.   Hearing Procedures. Notice of the hearing must be served in person
or by mail on the person responsible for the violation at least ten days in
advance, unless a shorter time is accepted by all parties. At the hearing, the
parties will have the opportunity to present testimony and question any
witnesses, but strict rules of evidence will not apply. The Hearing Officer
must tape record the hearing and receive testimony and exhibits. The Officer
must receive and give weight to evidence, including hearsay evidence, that
possesses probative value commonly accepted by reasonable and prudent people in
the conduct of their affairs.
      C.   Hearing Officer. A city employee designated in writing by the City
Administrator shall be the Hearing Officer. The Hearing Officer is authorized
to hear and determine any controversy relating to administrative offenses
provided for in this section.
      D.   Authority.
         1.   The Hearing Officer has the authority to determine that a
violation occurred, to dismiss a citation, to impose the scheduled fine and to
reduce, stay or waive a scheduled fine either unconditionally or upon
compliance with appropriate conditions. When imposing a penalty for a
violation, the Hearing Officer may consider any or all of the following
factors:
            a.   The duration of the violation;
            b.   The frequency or reoccurrence of the violation;
            c.   The seriousness of the violation;
            d.   The history of the violation;
            e.   The violator's conduct after issuance of the notice of
hearing;
            f.   The good faith effort by the violator to comply;
            g.   The economic impact of the penalty on the violator;
            h.   The impact of the violation upon the community; and
            i.   Any other factors appropriate to a just result.
         2.   a.   The Hearing Officer may exercise discretion to impose a fine
for more than one day of a continuing violation, but only upon a finding that:
               (1)   The violation caused a serious threat of harm to the
public health, safety or welfare; or
               (2)   The accused intentionally and unreasonably refused to
comply with the code requirement.
            b.   The Hearing Officer's decision and supporting reasons must be
in writing.
      E.   Failure to Attend. The failure to attend the hearing constitutes a
waiver of the violator's rights to an administrative hearing and an admission
of the violation. A Hearing Officer may waive this result upon good cause
shown. Examples of "good cause" are: death or incapacitating illness of the
accused; a court order requiring the accused to appear for another hearing at
the same time; and lack of proper service of the citation or notice of the
hearing. "Good cause" does not include: forgetfulness and intentional delay.
   Subd. 5.   Council Review.
      A.   Request for Review. The Hearing Officer's decision may be appealed
to the City Council by submitting a request in writing to the City Clerk within
ten days after the Hearing Officer's decision.
      B.   Notice. The appeal will be heard by the City Council after notice
served in person or by registered mail at least ten days in advance. The
parties to the hearing will have an opportunity to present oral or written
arguments regarding the Hearing Officer's decision.
      C.   Council Review. The City Council must consider the record, the
Hearing Officer's decision and any additional arguments before making a
determination. The Council is not bound by the Hearing Officer's decision, but
may adopt all or part of the officer's decision. The Council's decision must be
in writing.
      D.   Council Action. If the Council makes a finding of a violation, it
may impose a civil penalty not exceeding $1,000 per day per violation, and may
consider any or all of the factors contained in Subd. 4.D. of this chapter. The
Council may also reduce, stay or waive a fine unconditionally or based on
reasonable and appropriate conditions.
      E.   License Suspension or Revocation. In addition to imposing a civil
penalty, the Council may suspend or revoke a city-issued license, permit or
other approval associated with the violation.
   Subd. 6.   Judicial Review. An aggrieved party may obtain judicial review of
the decision of the Hearing Officer or the City Council by proceeding under a
writ of certiorari in District Court.
   Subd. 7.   Recovery of Civil Penalties.
      A.   If a civil penalty is not paid within the time specified, it will
constitute:
         1.   A lien on the real property upon which the violation occurred if
the property or improvements on the property was the subject of the violation
and the property owner was found responsible for that violation; or
         2.   A personal obligation of the violator in all other situations.
      B.   A lien may be assessed against the property and collected in the
same manner as taxes.
      C.   A personal obligation may be collected by appropriate legal means.
      D.   A late payment fee of 10% of the fine may be assessed for each 30-
day period, or part thereof, that the fine remains unpaid after the due date.
      E.   During the time that a civil penalty remains unpaid, a license,
permit or other city approval or authorization of any kind may not be granted
when sought by a violator or for property under the violator's ownership or
control.
      F.   Failure to pay a fine is grounds for suspending or revoking a
license related to the violation.
   Subd. 8.   Criminal Penalties.
      A.   The following are misdemeanors, punishable in accordance with state
law:
         1.   Failure, without good cause, to appear at a hearing that was
scheduled under Subd. 4. above;
         2.   Failure to pay a fine imposed by a Hearing Officer within 30 days
after it was imposed, or such other time as may be established by the Hearing
Officer, unless the matter is appealed under Subd. 5. above; and
         3.   Failure to pay a fine imposed by the City Council within 30 days
after it was imposed, or such other time as may be established by the City
Council.
      B.   If the final adjudication in the administrative penalty procedure is
a finding of no violation, then the city may not prosecute a criminal violation
in District Court based on the same set of facts. This does not preclude the
city from pursuing a criminal conviction for a violation of the same provision
based on a different set of facts. A different date of violation will
constitute a different set of facts.
   Subd. 9.   Disposition of Penalties. All penalties collected pursuant to
this section shall be deposited in the city's General Fund.
   Subd. 10.   Offenses and Penalties. Offenses which may be charged as
administrative offenses and the penalties for such offenses may be established
by resolution of the City Council from time to time. Copies of such resolutions
shall be maintained in the office of the City Administrator.
   Subd. 11.   Restitution.
      A.   Demand for Restitution. If the city incurs a loss as a direct result
of a violation of a provision of the City Code subject to this section, a
demand for restitution shall be made at the same time that the administrative
citation is issued. The demand must describe the items or elements of loss,
itemize the total dollar amounts of restitution claimed and specify the reasons
justifying these amounts.
      B.   Appeal. The person receiving such a demand for restitution may
challenge the demand in the manner provided for in Subds. 4. and 5. of this
section, but must do so by requesting a hearing within 30 days of receiving
written notification of the amount of restitution demanded. The hearing request
must be made in writing and filed with the City Administrator. A person may not
challenge the amount of the restitution demanded after the 30-day time period
has passed. A person may challenge the demand for restitution without
contesting the administrative offense. Notwithstanding the 30-day time period,
a person contesting the administrative offense must comply with the seven-day
time period contained in Subd. 4. above. Payment of the demanded restitution
constitutes an admission of liability.
      C.   Dispute; Evidentiary Burden; Procedures. At the hearing on the
restitution challenge, the person challenging the restitution shall have the
burden to produce evidence if the person intends to challenge the amount of
restitution or specific items of restitution or their dollar amounts. This
burden of production must include a detailed sworn affidavit of the person
setting forth all challenges to the restitution or items of restitution, and
specifying all reasons justifying dollar amounts of restitution which differ
from the amounts demanded by the city. The affidavit must be filed with the
City Administrator at least five business days before the hearing. A dispute as
to the proper amount or type of restitution must be resolved by the Hearing
Officer or City Council by the preponderance of the evidence. The burden of
demonstrating the amount of loss sustained by the city as a result of the
ordinance violation and the appropriateness of a particular type of restitution
is on the city.

   The City Charter controls the effective date and as to any dates that may be
passage dates and not effective dates contained below the sections of the code,
the effective date is the date that the ordinance creating the particular
section was published, pursuant to the Redwood Falls Charter provisions.
§ 1.15 ADOPTING FUTURE AMENDMENTS TO STATUTES AND RULES BY REFERENCE.

Ordinances, all future amendments to any state or federal rules and statutes
adopted by reference in this code shall be included by reference in the code as
if the amended statute or rule had been in existence at the time the code was
adopted.

city by and through the Council.

   Regular meetings of the Council shall be held on the first and third

§ 2.03 SPECIAL MEETINGS.
   Special meetings of the Council may be called by the Mayor or by any three
other members of the Council by writing filed with the City Administrator
stating the time, place and purpose of the meeting. Notice of a special meeting
shall be given by the City Administrator to each member of the Council by
mailing a copy of the filing to all members who did not sign or issue the call
at least three days prior to the time stated therein, or by personal service at
least 72 hours prior to the projected time of meeting. Special meetings may be
held without prior written notice to the Council when all Council members are
present at the meeting or consent thereto in writing before meeting of those
not present. Any such consent shall be filed with the City Administrator prior
to the beginning of the meeting. Any special meeting attended by all Council
members shall be a valid meeting for the transaction of any business that may
come before the meeting. Meetings of the Council which are adjourned from time
to time shall not be subject to the foregoing notice requirements; nor shall
special meetings which, in the judgment of the Council, require immediate
consideration to meet an emergency require the notice, but may be called by
telephone communication or any other expeditious means. In all such cases, the
members of the Council in attendance shall sign a waiver of notice which shall
be made a part of the minutes of the meeting. Notice to the public and to news
media shall be given as required by statute.

§ 2.06 RIGHT TO ADMINISTRATIVE APPEAL.
   If any person shall be aggrieved by any administrative decision of the City

statement setting forth the administrative decision to be challenged by the
appellant. At such hearing the appellant may present any evidence he or she
deems pertinent to the appeal, but the city shall not be required to keep a
verbatim record of the proceedings. The Mayor, or other officer presiding at
the hearing, may, in the interest of justice or to comply with time
requirements and on his or her own motion or the motion of the appellant, the
City Administrator, or a member of the Council, adjourn the hearing to a more
convenient time or place, but such time or place shall be fixed and determined
before adjournment so as to avoid the necessity for formal notice of
reconvening.
§ 2.07 RULES OF PROCEDURE FOR APPEALS AND OTHER HEARINGS.
   The Council may adopt by resolution certain written rules of procedure to be
followed in all administrative appeals and other hearings to be held before the
Council or other bodies authorized to hold hearings and determine questions

upon the fund. No claim against the city shall be allowed, except as otherwise
provided in this chapter, unless accompanied by an itemized invoice or voucher,

Motor Vehicles which shall be sufficient title to dispose of the vehicle. The

certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and claims of ownership.
Before the vehicle is issued a new certificate of title, it must receive a
motor vehicle safety check.
         3.   From the proceeds of the sale pursuant to this section, the city
shall reimburse itself for the cost of towing, preserving and storing the
vehicle, and all administrative, notice and publication costs incurred pursuant
to this subdivision. Any remainder from the proceeds of a sale shall be held

      F.   Contracts and Disposal.
         1.   The city may contract with any qualified person for collection,
storage, incineration, volume reduction, transportation or other services
necessary to prepare abandoned motor vehicles and other scrap metal for
recycling or other methods of disposal.
         2.   Where the city enters into a contract with a person duly licensed
by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, the Agency shall review the contract
to determine whether it conforms to the Agency's plan for solid waste disposal.
A contract that does so conform may be approved by the Agency. Where a contract
has been approved, the Agency may reimburse the city for the costs incurred
under the contract which have not been reimbursed.
         3.   If the city utilizes its own equipment and personnel for disposal
of the abandoned motor vehicle, it shall be entitled to reimbursement for the
cost thereof along with its other costs as herein provided.
   Subd. 2.   Disposal of Unclaimed Property.
      A.   Definition. The term "abandoned property" means tangible or
intangible property that has lawfully come into the possession of the city in

   Subd. 1.   Partial Prepayment of Assessments Permitted. After the adoption
of an assessment roll pursuant to M.S. Chapter 429, as amended from time to
time, and before certification of the assessment roll to the County Auditor,
the City Administrator or other authorized official, is authorized and directed
to accept partial prepayment of the assessment, but not less than 50% of the
total amount of any assessment, and reduce the amount certified to the County
Auditor accordingly. As provided by law, partial prepayment may be accepted
only during the 30-day period following approval of the assessment roll.
   Subd. 2.   Scope. This section shall apply to all assessment rolls which, on
the effective date hereof, have been adopted by the Council, but not yet

§ 2.83 COMMERCIAL REHABILITATION LOAN PROGRAM.
   Subd. 1.   Purpose. The Council finds that within the city there is a need
for a city program for rehabilitation of small and medium-sized commercial
buildings which are physically deteriorating and in need of rehabilitation and
that the provision of affordable loans to effect the rehabilitation of small
and medium-size commercial buildings will preserve and enhance the city's tax
base and will assist in the implementation of the Redwood Falls Comprehensive
Plan thereby protecting the health and safety and promoting the general welfare
of the community and its residents.
   Subd. 2.   Findings. The Council further finds and determines:
      A.   The city has carried out a commercial rehabilitation loan program in
conjunction with a grant received from the Department of Trade and Economic
Development in 1995 through its Small Cities Development Program;
      B.   The terms of the grant obligated to the city to use the income
received as a result of the program to address future commercial revitalization
needs;
      C.   Within the incorporated areas of the city there exists small and
medium-sized commercial buildings which are physically deteriorating, under-
used, economically inefficient and in need of rehabilitation in order to meet
applicable building codes;
      D.   Some owners of small and medium-sized commercial buildings are
unable to obtain rehabilitation loans because the loans are not available on
terms which the owners can afford or are not available to them on any terms
from time to time because of restrictions in the private lending market;
      E.   In carrying out the commercial rehabilitation loan program
referenced above, the city has learned that public participation with private
lenders in commercial rehabilitation loans enhances the lenders' willingness to
make loans to owners of or tenants in small and medium-sized commercial
buildings and by reducing interest charged on the public share of the loans
makes the combined loan affordable to the owners; and
      F.   The provisions of publicly assisted commercial rehabilitation loans
throughout the entire city under authority of M.S. § 469.184, as amended from
time to time, is essential to the physical rehabilitation of small and medium-
sized buildings within, and the economic revitalization of, the city's
neighborhood and downtown commercial areas on a comprehensive basis, in
accordance with the objectives and policies of the Redwood Falls Comprehensive
Plan, thereby stabilizing and increasing the municipal tax base and
contributing to the health, safety and general welfare as well as the
preservation of the quality of life of the residents of the city.
   Subd. 3.   Definitions. The following words and phrases, when used in this
chapter, shall have the meanings respectfully ascribed to them in this section.
      A.   The term "acceptable security" means a chattel or real property
mortgage on the property being rehabilitated and/or other area or personal
property, personal guarantee or other security acceptable to the participating
lender and the program administrator.
      B.   The term "participating lender" means a bank or other lending
institution authorized to make commercial loans under applicable federal or
state law, which is participating in program loans on a one-to-one matching
basis.
      C.   The term "program regulations" shall be those regulations as are set
forth in the document entitled City-Wide Commercial Area Rehabilitation Program
Guidelines, dated 2-6-2007, adopted by the City Council of even date with the
date of final adoption of the ordinance from which this section is derived, and
any amendments or revisions thereto, as may from time to time be adopted by the
City Council.
      D.   The term "small and medium-sized commercial buildings" means a
commercial building located in the city in a business or industrial district,
in the case of a small-sized building, shall be 60,000 square feet or less; and
in the case of a medium-sized building shall be 200,000 square feet or less.
   Subd. 4.   Loan Program.
      A.   Program Established. Pursuant to the authority of M.S. § 469.184, as
amended from time to time, there is hereby established a comprehensive
commercial rehabilitation loan program having citywide application to provide
secured loans to owners of small and medium-sized commercial buildings located
within the city for the purpose of rehabilitation of the buildings. In making
program loans, the following factors are to be considered:
         1.   The availability and affordability of private mortgage credit;
         2.   The availability and affordability of other governmental
programs;
         3.   Whether the building is required, pursuant to any court order,
statute or ordinance, to be repaired, improved or rehabilitated; and
         4.   Whether the proposed improvements will result in conformance with
buildings and zoning codes and improvements of the aesthetic quality and
economic viability and function of existing commercial areas.
      B.   Program Limitations.
         1.   The loan program shall be operated within the following statutory
limitations:
            a.   The terms and conditions of all loans made under the program
shall be fixed so that the sum of all repayments of principal and interest on
them, not then delinquent, and all fees and charges collected, together with
other sums to be contributed by the city, shall, over the duration of the
program, be estimated to be equal to or greater than the sum of all estimated
costs of the program, as determined by the program administrator and approved
by the governing body of the city, including administrative costs, mortgage
foreclosure costs and principal and interest payments on bonds issued to
finance the program to the extent not paid from bond proceeds;
            b.   No loan shall be made for a period exceeding 20 years;
            c.   No loan shall exceed 80% of the estimated market value of the
property to be rehabilitated upon completion of the rehabilitation, less the
principal balance of any prior mortgage existing on the property at the time
the loan is made; and
            d.   No loan shall be made in excess of $200,000 for the
rehabilitation of any particular small or medium-sized commercial building.

      A.   Loan Program Financing. The loan program shall be financed with the
repaid funds received from 1995 Small Cities Development Program Commercial
Rehabilitation Program, and may be financed by city revenue bonds or such other
funds as may from time to time be appointed for such purpose.
      B.   Revenue Bond Financing. In order to assist in financing the loan
program created by this chapter, the city may issue revenue bonds in accordance
with the provisions of M.S. § 469.184(8), as amended from time to time, and
secured in the manner provided in M.S. 469.184(10) and (11), as amended from
time to time. Proceeds of any such bond issue may be applied in accordance with
the provision of M.S. § 469.184(9), as amended from time to time.

working on any connection with the municipal utility systems, has violated any
requirement of the City Code relative thereto, or any connection therewith;
         2.   Any charge for a municipal utility service, or any other

days.
            c.   When it becomes necessary for the city to discontinue utility
service to a customer for nonpayment of bills, service will be reinstated only
after all bills for service then due have been paid, along with a turn-on
charge in an amount set by City Council.
         2.   There is fraud or misrepresentation by the owner of occupant in
connection with any application for service or delivery or charges therefor.

or calculations it shall be reinstalled and the deposit shall be retained by

WATER SERVICE
§ 3.30 RULES AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO WATER SERVICE.
   Subd. 1.   Deficiency of Water and Shutting Off Water. The city is not
liable for any deficiency or failure in the supply of water to customers
whether occasioned by shutting the water off for the purpose of making repairs
or connections or by any other cause whatever. In case of fire, or alarm of
fire, water may be shut off to insure a supply for fire fighting. In making
repairs or construction of new works, water may be shut off at any time and
kept off so long as may be necessary.
   Subd. 2.   Repair of Leaks. It is the responsibility of the consumer or
owner to maintain the water service from the curb stop into the house or other
building. In case of failure upon the part of any consumer or owner to repair
any leak occurring in his or her water service within 24 hours after oral or
written notice has been given to the owner or occupant of the premises, the
water may be shut off and will not be turned on until a reconnection charge has
been paid and the water service has been repaired. When the waste of water is
great or when damage is likely to result from the leak, the water will be
turned off if the repair is not proceeded with immediately.
   Subd. 3.   Increasing Size of Water Service. When it is desired to increase
the size of water service from the main, a new permit shall be taken out and
the regular tapping charge shall be made as if this were a new service.
   Subd. 4.   Service Pipes. Every service pipe must be laid in such manner as
to prevent rupture by settlement. The service pipe shall be placed not less
than eight feet below the surface in all cases so arranged as to prevent
rupture and stoppage by freezing. Frozen service pipes between the curb stop
and the building shall be the responsibility of the owner. Service pipes must
extend from the curb stops to the inside of the building; or if not taken into
a building then to the hydrant or other fixtures which they are intended to
supply. A valve, the same size as the service pipe, shall be placed close to
the inside wall of the building, ahead of the meter and well protected from
freezing. Type "K" copper tubing shall be used up to and including two-inch
services. Joints on copper tubing shall be flared and kept to a minimum. Not
more than one joint shall be used for a service up to 70 feet in length. All
joints shall be left uncovered until inspected. All services of more than two
inches in diameter shall be composed of cast iron mechanical joint pipe.
Minimum size connection with the water mains shall be three-fourths inch in
diameter for single-occupancy residences and one inch in diameter for all other
establishments.
   Subd. 5.   Private Water Supplies. No water pipe of the city water system
shall be connected with any pump, well, pipe, tank or any device that is
connected with any other source of water supply and when such are found, the
city shall notify the owner or occupant to disconnect the same and, if not
immediately done, the city water shall be turned off. Before any new
connections to the city system are permitted, the city shall ascertain that no
cross-connections will exist when the new connection is made. When a building
is connected to "city water" the private water supply may be used only for such
purposes as the city may allow.
   Subd. 6.   Prohibited Uses or Restricted Hours. Whenever the city shall
determine that a shortage of water threatens the city, it may entirely prohibit
water use or limit the times and hours during which water may be used from the
city water system for lawn and garden sprinkling, irrigation, car washing, air
conditioning and other uses or either or any of them. It is unlawful for any
water consumer to cause or permit water to be used in violation of the
determination after public announcement thereof has been made through the news
media specifically indicating the restrictions thereof.
   Subd. 7.   Private Fire Hose Connections. Owners of structures with self-
contained fire protection systems may apply for and obtain permission to
connect the street mains with hydrants, large pipes and hose couplings, for use
in case of fire only, at their own installation expense and at such rates as
the Council may adopt by resolution as herein provided.
   Subd. 8.   Opening Hydrants. It is unlawful for any person, other than
members of the Fire Department or other person duly authorized by the city, in
pursuance of lawful purpose, to open any fire hydrant or attempt to draw water
from the same or in any manner interfere therewith. It is also unlawful for any
person so authorized to deliver or suffer to be delivered to any other person
any hydrant key or wrench, except for the purposes strictly pertaining to their
lawful use.
   Subd. 9.   Unmetered Service. Unmetered service may be provided for
construction, flooding skating rinks and any other purpose. The service shall
be at a duly adopted rate. Where it is difficult or impossible to accurately
measure the amount of water taken, unmetered service may be provided and the
unmetered rate applied; provided, however, that, by acceptance thereof the
consumer agrees to have the city estimate the water used. In so estimating, the
city shall consider the use to which the water is put and the length of time of
unmetered service.
   Subd. 10.   Water Meters. All water meters shall be purchased by the
property owner and maintained by the city. All repairs of water meters not
resulting from normal usage shall be the responsibility of the property owner.
Any other meter in need of replacement shall be replaced with a remote type
which shall be furnished and maintained by the city. All water meters shall be
installed and controlled by the city and the cost of installation shall be the
responsibility of the property owner. Any remote type meter in need of
replacement by reason of normal usage shall be furnished and installed by the
city, thereafter, the city shall own the meter.
   Subd. 11.   Code Requirement. All piping, connections and appurtenances
shall be installed and performed strictly in accordance with the Minnesota
Plumbing Code. Failure to install or maintain the same in accordance therewith,
or failure to have or permit required inspections shall, upon discovery by the
city, be an additional ground for termination of water service to any consumer.
   Subd. 12.   Tampering With Water Meters. It is unlawful for any person other
than those duly authorized by the city to adjust the reading, disconnect the
recording mechanism or in any way deliberately damage any water meter or remote
meter. Upon installation of the meter and the remote meter, a seal shall be
placed upon the unit by a city employee. To the extent that the seal is broken
or there is other evidence of tampering with the meter or the remote, the owner
of the premises or the individual known to be personally responsible for the
tampering is guilty of violation of this section.
   Subd. 13.   Additional Rules and Regulations. The Council may, by
resolution, adopt such additional rules and regulations relating to placement,
size and type of equipment as it, in its discretion, deems necessary or
desirable. Copies of such additional rules and regulations shall be kept on

facility shall be determined and fixed in a "sewer service charge system"
developed according to the provisions of this section. Changes in sewer service
rates and charges shall be adopted by Council resolution and shall be published
in the local newspaper.
      E.   Revenues collected for sewer service shall be deposited in a
separate fund known as "The Sewer Service Fund". Income from revenues collected
will be expended to offset the cost of operation, maintenance and equipment
replacement for the facility and to retire the debt for capital expenditure.
      F.   Sewer service charges and the Sewer Service Fund will be
administered in accordance with the provisions of this section.
   Subd. 3.   Determination of Sewer Service Charges.
      A.   Identification.
         1.   Users of the wastewater treatment works shall be identified as
belonging to one of the following user classes:
            a.   Residential;
            b.   Commercial;
            c.   Industrial; and
            d.   Governmental (city).
         2.   The allocation of users to these categories for the purpose of
assessing user charges and debt service charges shall be the responsibility of
the City Administrator. Allocation of users to user classes shall be based on
the substantive intent of the definitions of these classes contained herein.
      B.   Classification. Each user shall pay operation, maintenance and
replacement costs in proportion of the user's proportionate contribution of
wastewater flows and loadings to the treatment plant, with the minimum rate for
loading of BOD and TSS being the rate established for concentrations of 200 mg/
l BOD and 250 mg/l TSS (i.e. normal domestic strength wastewater). Those
industrial users discharging segregated normal domestic strength wastewater
only can be classified as commercial users for the purpose of rate
determination.
      C.   Billable wastewater volume. The charges assessed residential users
and those users of other classes who discharge normal domestic strength
wastewater shall be established proportionately according to billable
wastewater volume. Billable wastewater volume shall be calculated as follows.
         1.   Residential Users. Billable wastewater volume for residential
users shall be calculated on the basis of monthly metered water usage.
         2.   Non-Residential Users.
            a.   The billable wastewater volume of non-residential users will
be determined in the same manner as for residential users. Except that if the
city determines that there are significant seasonal variations in the metered
water usage of non-residential users resulting in a proportionate increase in
wastewater volume; then billable wastewater volume shall be:
               (1)   Calculated on the basis of average metered water usage as
recorded throughout the year; and
               (2)   Calculated on the basis of wastewater flow meters.
            b.   The city may, as its discretion, require non-residential users
to install such additional water meters or wastewater flow meters as may be
necessary to determine billable wastewater volume.
      D.   Determination of User Charges. User charges for normal domestic
strength users shall be determined as follows.
         1.   Calculations of Unit Cost for Treatment of Normal Domestic
Strength Wastewater.
 
Uomr - Comr
       Tbwv
 
   Where:      Uomr = Unit cost for operation, maintenance and replacement in
$/100 feet 3 .
         Comr = Total Annual OM&R Costs (excluding billing and I and I).
         Tbwv = Total annual billable wastewater volume in 100 ft 3 .
         2.   Calculations of User Charge.
Uc = (Uomr x bwv) + Qfc
   Where:      Uomr = Unit cost for operation, maintenance and replacement in
$/100 ft 3 .
         bwv = Billable wastewater volume of a particular user in kgal.
         Qfc = Fixed charge per connection for I and I and billing costs per
month.
      E.   Particular Connection. The sewer service charge for a particular
connection shall be determined as follows:
SSC = Uc + Cc
   Where:      SSC = Sewer service charge.
         Uc = User charge.
         Cc = Charge per connection for debt service and capital construction
costs.
      F.   Additional charges. The sewer service charges established in this
section shall not prevent the assessment of additional charges to users who
discharge wastes with concentrations greater than normal domestic strength or
wastes of unusual character, or contractual agreements with the users, as long
as the following conditions are met.
         1.   The user pays operation, maintenance and replacement costs in
proportion to the user's proportionate contribution of wastewater flows and
loadings to the treatment plant, and no user is charged at a rate less than
that of normal domestic strength wastewater.
         2.   The measurements of such wastes are conducted according to the
latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater
in a manner acceptable to the city as provided for in this chapter.
         3.   A study of unit costs of collection and treatment processes
attributable to flow, BOD, TSS and other significant loadings shall be
developed for determining the proportionate allocation of costs to flows and
loadings for users discharging wastes of greater than normal domestic strength
or wastes of unusual character.
   Subd. 4.   Sewer Service Fund.
      A.   The city hereby establishes a Sewer Service Fund as an income fund
to receive all revenues generated by the sewer service charge system, and all
other income dedicated to the operation, maintenance, replacement and
construction of the wastewater treatment works, including taxes, special
charges, fees and assessments intended to retire construction debt.
      B.   The city also establishes the following accounts as income and
expenditure accounts within the Sewer Service Fund:
         1.   Operation and Maintenance Account;
         2.   Equipment Replacement Account; and
         3.   Debt Retirement Account.
      C.   All revenue generated by the sewer service charge system, and all
other income pertinent to the treatment system, including taxes and special
assessments dedicated to retire construction debt, shall be held by the City
Administrator separate and apart from all other funds of the city. Funds
received by the Sewer Service Fund shall be transferred to the "Operation and
Maintenance Account", the "Equipment Replacement Account" and the "Debt
Retirement Account" in accordance with state and federal regulations and the
provisions of this section.
      D.   Revenue generated by the sewer service charge system sufficient to
insure adequate replacement throughout the design or useful life, whichever is
longer, of the wastewater facility shall be held separate and apart in the
"Equipment Replacement Account" and dedicated to affecting replacement costs.
Interest income generated by the "Equipment Replacement Account" shall remain
in the "Equipment Replacement Account".
      E.   Revenue generated by the sewer service charge system sufficient for
operation and maintenance shall be held separate and apart in the "Operation
and Maintenance Account".
   Subd. 5.   Administration. The sewer service charge system and Sewer Service
Fund shall be administered according to the following provisions.
      A.   The City Administrator shall maintain a proper system of accounts
suitable for determining the operation and maintenance, equipment replacement
and debt retirement costs of the treatment works, and shall furnish the Council
with an auditor's report of the costs annually in June.
         1.   The Council shall annually determine whether or not sufficient
revenue is being generated for the effective operation, maintenance,
replacement and management of the treatment works, and whether sufficient
revenue is being generated for debt retirement. The Council will also determine
whether the user charges are distributed proportionately to each user in
accordance with this section and § 204(b)(2)(A) of the Federal Water Pollution
Control Act, being 33 U.S.C. § 1284, as amended.
         2.   The city shall thereafter, but not later than the end of the
year, reassess and as necessary revise the sewer service charge system then in
use to ensure the proportionality of the user charges and to ensure the
sufficiency of funds to maintain the capacity and performance to which the
facilities were constructed, and to retire the construction debt.
      B.   In accordance with federal and state requirements, each user will be
notified annually in conjunction with a regular billing of that portion of the
sewer service charge attributable to operation, maintenance and replacement.
      C.   In accordance with federal and state requirements, the City
Administrator shall be responsible for maintaining all records necessary to
document compliance with the sewer service charge system adopted.
      D.   Bills for sewer service charges shall be rendered on a monthly basis
succeeding the period for which the service was rendered and shall be due on
the date of rendering. Any bill not paid in full after the due date printed on
the bill will be considered delinquent. At that time, the city shall notify the
delinquent owner/occupant in writing regarding the delinquent bill and
subsequent penalty. The penalty shall be computed as 10% of the original bill
and any bill that becomes 60 days delinquent shall, upon written notice and
opportunity for hearing, be disconnected without further consideration. Service
may be restored after receipt of the amount owing, plus a service charge and an
additional deposit may be required.
      E.   Any additional costs caused by discharges to the treatment works of
toxics or other incompatible wastes, including the cost of restoring wastewater
treatment services, clean up and restoration of the receiving waters and
environs, and sludge disposal, shall be borne by the discharger(s) of the
wastes, at no expense to the city.
   Subd. 6.   Sewer Service Charge System Precedence. The sewer service charge
system shall take precedence over any terms or conditions of agreements or
contracts which are inconsistent with the requirements of § 204(b)(1)(A) of the
Act, being 33 U.S.C. § 1284, and Federal Regulation 40 C.R.F. (Code of Federal
Regulations) § 35.2140 of the Environmental Protection Agency's grant
regulations.
(Ord. 138, Second Series, passed 7-13-1988)
§ 3.42 STORM SEWER CHARGES.
   Subd. 1.   Creation of Storm Sewer Charge. Subject to the rules set forth
below, a monthly charge shall be made with the normal utility charges which
shall be entitled "storm sewer charge". The amount of this monthly charge shall
be established by resolution of the Council and may be amended from time to
time by further resolution of the Council.
   Subd. 2.   Basic Charge. All single-family residential properties will be
charged the basic rate, i.e., one REF-Residential Equivalency Factor.
   Subd. 3.   Properties Charged Greater Than One REF. Duplexes shall be
charged 1.2 REFs and four-plexes shall be charged 1.3 REFs. Any residential
development greater than a four-plex shall be considered commercial property.
All commercial property shall be calculated on an individual basis based upon
size and amount of run-off generated. Properties which have storm water
retention ponds will be given a 54.7% credit for that portion of the property
that is serviced by the pond.
   Subd. 4.   Exceptions to Charges. No city-owned property which is funded
through the General Fund will be charged a monthly fee. All city-owned property
which is funded through revenues will pay the equivalent commercial rate.
Undeveloped property having no hard surfaces will not be charged a monthly fee.
Any developed property that does not contribute run-off or does not generate
run-off related costs will not be charged a monthly fee. No privately-owned
property shall be exempt from charges on the basis it is vacant and unoccupied.
   Subd. 5.   Additional Fee Based on Off-Premises Benefits. The downtown
businesses in the Central Business District Zone who have inadequate or non-
existent off-street parking will be charged on a pro rata basis for the monthly
charges attributed to the municipal parking lots servicing those businesses.
   Subd. 6.   Use of Funds. Funds collected by the storm sewer utility charges
will be used to fund infrastructure replacement, operation and maintenance and
wetland mitigation. All new development or first time improvements will be
assessed their appropriate share of the costs.

a storm sewer or discharge through the curb and gutter to the street.
      E.   Prohibited Connections. No person shall make or maintain a
connection between any conductors used to carry clear water drainage into the
city's sanitary sewer system unless otherwise authorized under Subd. 2 F.
   Subd. 2.   Sump Pumps. Dwellings and other buildings and structures that
require a sump pump system to discharge excess water because of the
infiltration of water into basements, crawl spaces and the like shall obtain a
building permit, if required, and have a permanently installed discharge line

replacement. The discharge shall extend at least three feet outside of the
foundation wall.
      C.   Alternate Methods of Installation.
         1.   The discharge pipe may be connected directly to the municipal
underground storm sewer system provided the discharge is at a higher elevation
than the normal flow level and that an approved backflow prevention device is
installed.
         2.   The discharge may be connected directly to the municipal curb and
gutter system provided the pipe is placed under the sidewalk or boulevard and

compliance with this section. The inspection shall include, but is not limited
to: inspection of the property’s down spouts, eave troughs, rainspouts, yard
drains, perimeter drains, sump pumps, foundations drains, sanitary sewer
service lines, and the like. The owner of any dwelling, building, or other
structure shall have a period of 30 days to schedule an appointment for an
inspection from the date the city sends a written notice to the owner
requesting admittance to the owner's property for an inspection, to either
allow a city inspection of the property, or the owner may contract with a
licensed plumber to perform the inspection, and notify the city of the results
thereof. Upon completion of an inspection, the city inspector or a licensed
plumber hired at the sole expense of the owner, shall provide the owner a copy
of the inspection report. The report shall indicate whether or not the property
is in compliance with this section. If the property is not in compliance with
this section, the report shall indicate in detail all deficiencies discovered
and the required corrections in order to be in compliance with this section.
The owner shall have a period of 90 days from the date the owner is informed of
the deficiencies to obtain a building permit, if required, to disconnect the
sump pump or other prohibited discharge, to complete all the necessary
corrections as outlined in the inspection report and schedule a reinspection
with either the city inspector or licensed plumber to verify that the property
is now in compliance with this section. If there are any corrections outlined
in the inspection report that require the issuance of a building permit, then
the City Building Official shall conduct the reinspection for compliance with
all applicable city code requirements and shall provide the necessary
documentation to verify the property is in compliance. If the owner leases the
subject property or for any reason does not reside at the property, the owner
ultimately has the duty and responsibility to provide all notices related to
this section to every tenant of the property and to ensure compliance with the
inspection process and any necessary corrections, if so required. No lease or
other contract purporting to shift maintenance or repair obligations to a
tenant shall relieve owner's obligations to comply with these regulations.
Tenants in any property within the city have an obligation to cooperate with
the owner and the city, utilities and their designees with respect to the
completion of any required inspection or necessary corrections in order for the
owner to be in compliance with this section.

the city, and its designees, bearing proper credentials and identification
shall be permitted to enter all properties for the purposes of inspection,
observation, measurement, sampling and testing pertinent to the discharge to
any public sewer or natural outlet in accordance with the provisions of this
section. Sampling pertaining to industry will reflect the number of days an
industry is not operating as well as the days in operation and discharging
waste to a public sewer.
   Subd. 5.   Required Inspections. Inspections are required when one of the
following occurs:
      A.   The owner receives notice from the city that their property needs to
be inspected under the inspection program as referenced in this section.

inspected and in compliance with this section, then the City Inspector will set
a specific date and time for the inspection and will mail notice of the
scheduled inspection to the owner. If the owner is not present for the
scheduled inspection or refuses to allow the property to be inspected, the
owner shall be found in violation of this section and may be subject to the
surcharge as provided in Subd. 8 below.
      B.   Failure to Provide Access. If the owner or occupant fails to provide
sufficient access to the sanitary sewer service lateral within the dwelling,
building or structure, including removal of any obstacles so that the sanitary

compliance with this section, makes a prohibited connection or conducts an
installation in violation of this section shall immediately remove the
connection or correct the installation. Notice of the connection violation
shall be provided to the owner by hanging the notice on the premises, by
personal service, or by certified mail. If the connection violation is not
corrected within 30 days from receipt of the notice of the connection
violation, the owner shall be found in violation of this section and may be
subject to the surcharge as provided in Subd. 8 below.
      E.   Periodic Reinspection. The owner found not to be in conformance with
this section during periodic reinspections or during any other maintenance work
on the property shall be found in violation of this section and may be subject

there has been a violation of any provision of this section prior to the sale,
the seller is responsible for correcting the deficiencies prior to the sale,
unless the buyer has assumed such responsibility as provided in Subd. 7.B
below. Failure of a seller to disclose to a buyer that there are uncorrected
violations of this section is a violation of the city code. When correcting the
deficiencies, all necessary permits shall be obtained from the city. Upon
completion of the corrections, the City Inspector or a licensed plumber shall
reinspect the property to verify compliance and submit an affidavit of
compliance to the city.
      B.   Buyer Responsibilities. If a seller cannot correct the deficiencies
prior to the sale, the buyer must assume the responsibility tor correcting the

verify the corrections have been completed;
         3.   That the buyer holds the city harmless from liabilities and
claims if the buyer occupies the dwelling prior to corrections of the
deficiencies; and
         4.   That failure to correct the deficiencies is a violation of the
city code and the buyer may be subjected to the surcharge as provided in Subd.
8 below.
   Subd. 8.   Surcharge. A monthly surcharge in an amount duly adopted by the
City Council and set forth in the city's fee schedule shall be assessed against
any property on which clear water is discharged in violation of this section.
The monthly surcharge will be charged to the owner who will receive a monthly
billing statement from the city. The surcharge, as established by the City
Council, will be assessed for every month during which the owner is in
violation of this section.
   Subd. 9.   Nonpayment of Surcharge. If the surcharge is not received by the
city, the city reserves the right to assess the unpaid balance against the
property benefited and collected in a like manner, as are special assessments.

determination made pursuant to this section shall be addressed in writing to
the City Administrator within 30 days of the determination. Applications shall
at a minimum identify the property for which the appeal is sought, the name of

§ 5.02 APPLICATIONS AND LICENSES UNDER THIS CHAPTER - PROCEDURE AND
ADMINISTRATION.
   Subd. 1.   Application. All applications shall be made at the office of the
City Administrator upon forms prescribed by the city or, if by the
Commissioner, then together with such additional information as the Council may
desire. Information required may vary with the type of business organization
making application. All questions asked or information required by the
application forms shall be answered fully and completely by the applicant. The
applicant will also authorize the completion of a criminal history background
investigation as provided for in §
6.32 of this Code. Before any investigation is undertaken by the City Attorney,
the applicant must authorize the City Attorney in writing to undertake the
investigation and to release any information gathered during the investigation
as provided in §
6.32 of this Code. The written consent must fully comply with the provisions of
M.S. Chapter 13, as it may be amended from time to time, regarding the
collection, maintenance and use of the information.
   Subd. 2.   False Statements. It is unlawful for any applicant to
intentionally make a false statement or omission upon any application form. Any
false statement in such application, or any willful omission to state any
information called for on such application form shall, upon discovery of the
falsehood, work an automatic refusal of license, or if already issued, shall
render any license issued pursuant thereto void and of no effect to protect the
applicant from prosecution for violation of this chapter, or any part thereof.
    Subd. 3.   Application and Investigation Fees. At the time the initial
application is made, an applicant for a license under this chapter shall
accompany the application with payment of a fee to be considered an application
and investigation fee, non-refundable to the applicant, to cover the cost of
the city in processing the application and the investigation of the applicant.
No investigation fee shall be required of an applicant for a temporary beer
license.
   Subd. 4.   Action.
      A.   Granting. The Council may approve any application for the period of
the remainder of the then-current license year or for the entire ensuing
license year. All applications including proposed license periods must be
consistent with this chapter. Prior to consideration of any application for a
license, the applicant shall pay the license fee, and if applicable, pay the
investigation fee. Failure to pay any portion of a fee when due shall be cause
for revocation.
      B.   Issuing. If an application is approved, the City Administrator shall
forthwith issue a license pursuant thereto in the form prescribed by the city
or the Commissioner, as the case may be, and upon payment of the license fee.
All licenses shall be on a calendar year basis beginning January 1 and ending
December 31. Unless otherwise herein specified, license fees shall be prorated
on the basis of one-twelfth for each calendar month or part thereof remaining
in the then-current license year. Provided that, for licenses where the fee is
$100 or less, a minimum license fee equal to one-half of the annual license fee
shall be charged. Licenses shall be valid only at one location and on the
premises therein described.
      C.   Transfer. No license shall be transferable between persons. Any
change in individual ownership, incorporation or substitution of partners is a
transfer. No license shall be transferable to a different location without
prior consent of the Council and payment of the fee for a duplicate license. It
is unlawful to make any transfer in violation of this subparagraph.
      D.   Refusal and Termination. The Council may, in its sole discretion and
for any reasonable cause, refuse to grant any application. No license shall be
granted to a person of questionable moral character or business reputation.
Licenses shall terminate only by expiration or revocation.
      E.   Public Interest. No license under this chapter may be issued,
transferred or renewed if the results of any investigation show, to the
satisfaction of the Council, that the issuance, transfer or renewal would not
be in the public interest.
      F.   Revocation or Suspension. For any license granted under the
provisions of this chapter, the Council may revoke, suspend for a period not to
exceed 60 days, impose a civil fine not to exceed $2,000, or any combination of
these sanctions, for each violation on a finding that the licensee has failed
to comply with a statute, regulation or provision of the City Code relating to
alcoholic beverages, including any provision found in
Chapter 11 relating to outdoor patio areas. The Council shall revoke the
license upon conviction of any licensee or agent or employee of a licensee for
violating any law relating to the sale or possession of beer, wine or liquor
upon premises of the licensee, or if the revocation is mandatory by statute. If
it shall be made to appear at the hearing thereon that the violation was not
willful, the Council may order suspension; provided that, revocation shall be
ordered upon the third violation or offense. No suspension or revocation shall
take effect until the licensee has been afforded an opportunity for a hearing
before the Council, a committee of the Council or a hearing under the
Administrative Procedures Act, as may be determined by the Council in action
calling the hearing. The hearing shall be called by the Council upon written
notice to the licensee served in person or by certified mail not less than 15,
nor more than 30, days prior to the hearing date, stating the time, place and
purpose thereof. As additional restrictions or regulations on licensees under
this chapter and, in addition to grounds for revocation or suspension stated in
the City Code or statute, the following shall also be grounds for the action:
         1.   The licensee suffered or permitted illegal acts upon licensed
premises unrelated to the sale of beer, wine or liquor;
         2.   The licensee had knowledge of the illegal acts upon licensed
premises, but failed to report the same to police;
         3.   The licensee failed or refused to cooperate fully with police in
investigating the alleged illegal acts upon licensed premises; or
         4.   The activities of the licensee created a serious danger to public
health, safety or welfare.
      G.   Corporate Applicants and Licensees. A corporate applicant, at the
time of application, shall furnish the city with a list of all persons that
have an interest in the corporation and the extent of the interest. The list
shall name all shareholders and show the number of shares held by each, either
individually or beneficially for others. It is the duty of each corporate
licensee to notify the City Administrator in writing of any change in legal
ownership, or beneficial interest in such corporation or in such shares. Any
change in the ownership or beneficial interest in the shares entitled to be
voted at a meeting of the shareholders of a corporate licensee, which results
in the change of voting control of the corporation by the persons owning the
shares therein, shall be deemed equivalent to a transfer of the license issued
to the corporation, and any license shall be revoked 30 days after any such
change in ownership or beneficial interest of shares unless the Council has
been notified of the change in writing and has approved it by appropriate
action. The Council, or any officer of the city designated by it, may at any
reasonable time examine the stock transfer records and minute books of any
corporate licensee in order to verify and identify the shareholders, and the
Council or its designated officer may examine the business records of any other
licensee to the extent necessary to disclose the interest which persons other
than the licensee have in the licensed business. The Council may revoke any
license issued upon its determination that a change of ownership of shares in a
corporate licensee or any change of ownership of any interest in the business
of any other licensee has actually resulted in the change of control of the
licensed business so as materially to affect the integrity and character of its
management and its operation, but no such action shall be taken until after a
hearing by the Council on notice to the licensee.
   Subd. 5.   Duplicate Licenses. Duplicates of all original licenses under
this chapter may be issued by the City Administrator without action by the
Council, upon licensee's affidavit that the original has been lost. All
duplicate licenses shall be clearly marked "DUPLICATE".
   Subd. 6.   Posting. All licensees shall conspicuously post their licenses in
their places of business.
   Subd. 7.   Persons Disqualified.
      A.   No license under this chapter may be issued or renewed, to:
         1.   A person who within five years of the license application has
been convicted of any felony or a willful violation of a federal or state law
or local ordinance governing the manufacture, sale, distribution or possession
for sale or distribution of alcoholic beverages;
         2.   A person who has had an alcoholic beverage license revoked within
five years of the license application, or to any person who at the time of the
violation owns any interest, whether as a holder of more than 5% of the capital
stock of a corporate licensee, as a partner or otherwise, in the premises or in
the business conducted thereon, or to a corporation, partnership, association,
enterprise, business or firm in which any such person is in any manner
interested;
         3.   A person under the age of 21 years; or
         4.   A person not of good moral character and repute.
      B.   No person holding a license from the Commissioner as a manufacturer,
brewer or wholesaler may have a direct or indirect interest, in whole or in
part, in a business holding an alcoholic beverage license from the city.

restrictions, in addition to those stated in this chapter, upon any license as
it, in its discretion, may deem reasonable and justified.
§ 5.06 LIMITATION ON OWNERSHIP.
   No person shall be granted beer or liquor licenses at more than one
location. For the purpose of this section, any person owning an interest of 5%
or more of the entity to which the license is issued, or such ownership by a

are obtained as a part of the compliance check. No minor used in compliance
checks shall attempt to use a false identification misrepresenting the minor's
age, and all minors lawfully engaged in a compliance check shall answer all

   Subd. 7.   Violations and Penalties.
      A.   Criminal Penalties.
         1.   Upon discovery of a suspected violation, the violator shall be
issued a citation by the city police and given notice of his or her right to be
heard on the accusation. Each violation, and every day in which a violation
occurs or continues, shall constitute a separate offense. Any person found to
be in violation of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be
subject to the maximum penalty authorized by state law for a misdemeanor.
         2.   As an alternative to a misdemeanor prosecution, the city may
offer the accused violator a chance to pay an administrative fine as provided
in the fine schedule adopted and amended from time to time by the Council. If
the accused violator accepts the administrative option, he or she may pay the
fine to the city’s Deputy Clerk or he or she may, within ten days of the
notice, request an administrative hearing before the Council or authorized
hearing officer designated by the Council. If, after the hearing, the person is
found to be in violation of this section, he or she shall be ordered to pay the
fine. If a violator elects to pay the fine, or if he or she is acquitted of the
violation by the hearing officer, he or she shall not be subject to misdemeanor
prosecution for violation of the section. If the violator fails to pay the fine
within 90 days following the hearing, or 90 days following the last day to
request a hearing when a hearing has not been requested, the city may vacate
the civil action and proceed with the misdemeanor prosecution. At any time, the
accused violator may abandon his or her request to pursue the administrative
penalty and elect to have his or her case heard in court under the misdemeanor
prosecution. The city shall also have the right to refuse to offer the
administrative penalty and instead proceed directly with the misdemeanor
prosecution for a particular offense. If the accused violator accepts the
administrative option, no administrative fine shall be imposed pursuant to
Subd. 7.C. of this section.
         3.   In addition to any fine or other penalty, whether administrative,
civil or criminal, violation of this section by a licensee under this section
shall be grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license.
      B.   License Revocation, Suspension and Administrative Fine. The Council
may revoke or suspend for three days any license issued under this section and
shall impose a mandatory administrative fine of$300, as provided in the fine
schedule adopted and amended from time to time by the Council, upon a finding
that a licensee or its employee violated this section. In the event the city
finds that a licensee or its employee has violated this section twice within a
36-month period, the city may revoke or suspend for a period of six months and
shall impose a mandatory administrative fine of$600, as provided in the fine
schedule adopted and amended from time to time by the Council. A third or
subsequent offense at the same location within a 36-month period by a licensee
or employee shall subject the licensee to a mandatory administrative fine of
$1,000 and a seven-day suspension of the licensee’s authority to sell tobacco
at that location, and shall constitute a basis for a permanent revocation of
the licensee’s authority to sell tobacco at that location. No suspension or
revocation shall take effect until the licensee has received notice, served
personally or by certified mail, of the alleged violation and has been afforded
an opportunity for a hearing pursuant to § 2.06 of this code. A decision of the
Council that a violation has occurred must be in writing. Unless the licensee
requests review of the order imposing an administrative fine, the penalty is
due and payable on the thirty-first day after the order was received. All
administrative fines shall be payable to the city.
      C.   Administrative fine for other individuals. In addition to any fine
or other penalty, whether administrative or criminal, other individuals, other
than minors regulated by Subd. 7.D. below, found to be in violation of this
section shall be charged an administrative fine of $50 and required to attend
an instructional program regarding the requirements of the tobacco retail
licensing ordinance. No penalty may be imposed until the individual has
received notice, served personally or by certified mail, of the alleged
violation and an opportunity for a hearing before a person authorized by the
licensing authority to conduct a hearing. Any decision that a violation has
occurred must be in writing.
      D.   Minors. Minors who unlawfully purchase or attempt to purchase
licensed products shall be charged an administrative fine of $50. Any second or
subsequent violation of this section by a minor shall result in the imposition
of an administrative fine of $100. In addition to any fine or other penalty,
whether administrative or criminal, any minor found to be in violation of this
section shall be provided with notification of any tobacco-related programs,
courses or classes offered within the community which are designed to provide
education on the harmful effects of the use of tobacco or tobacco products and/
or instruction on smoking cessation.
      E.   Statutory penalties. If the administrative penalty for violations
against licensed retailers under Subd. 7.B. authorized to be imposed by M.S. §
461.12 as it may be amended from time to time, differ from that established in
this section, then the higher penalty will prevail.
   Subd. 8.   Exceptions and defenses.
      A.   Nothing in this section prevents the provision of tobacco or
tobacco-related devices to any person as part of an indigenous practice or a
lawfully recognized religious, spiritual, or cultural ceremony or practice.
      B.   It is an affirmative defense to a violation of this section for a
person to have reasonably relied on proof of age as described by state law.

   Subd. 2.   Imposition of Tax. There is hereby imposed a tax of 3% on the
rent charged by an operator for providing lodging to any person after 10-1-
1990. The tax shall be stated and charged separately and shall be collected by
the operator from the lodger. The tax collected by the operator shall be a debt
owed by the operator to the city and shall be extinguished only by payment to
the city. In no case shall the tax imposed by this section upon an operator
exceed the amount of tax which the operator is authorized and required by this
section to collect from a lodger.
   Subd. 3.   Collections. Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this
section at the time the rent is paid. The tax collections shall be deemed to be
held in trust by the operator for the city. The amount of tax shall be
separately stated from the rent charged for the lodging and those persons
paying the tax shall receive a receipt of payment from the operator.
   Subd. 4.   Advertising No Tax. It is unlawful for any operator to advertise,
or hold out or state to the public or any customer, directly or indirectly,
that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator,
or that it will not be added to the rent or that, if added, it or any part
thereof will be refunded. In computing the tax to be collected, amounts of tax
less than $0.01 shall be considered an additional cent.
   Subd. 5.   Payment and Returns.
      A.   The taxes imposed by this section shall be paid by the operator to
the city monthly not later than 15 days after the end of the month in which the
taxes were collected. At the time of payment, the operator shall submit a
return upon the forms and containing the information as the City Administrator
may require. The return shall contain the following minimum information:

tax.
      B.   The operator may offset against the taxes payable with respect to
any reporting period, the amount of taxes imposed by this section previously
paid as a result of any transaction, the consideration for which became
uncollectible during the reporting period, but only in proportion to the
portion of the consideration which became uncollectible.
   Subd. 6.   Examination of Return, Adjustments, Notices and Demands. The City
Administrator shall, after return is filed, examine the same and make any
investigation or examination of the records and accounts of the person making
the return deemed necessary for determining its correctness. The tax computed
on the basis of the examination shall be the tax to be paid. If the tax due is
found to be greater than that paid, the excess shall be paid to the city ten
days after receipt of a notice thereof given either personally or sent by
registered mail to the address shown on the return. If the tax paid is greater
than the tax found to be due, the excess shall be refunded to the person who
paid the tax to the city within ten days after determination of the refund.
   Subd. 7.   Refunds. Any person may apply to the City Administrator for a
refund of taxes paid for a prescribed period in excess of the amount legally
due for that period; provided that, no application for refund shall be
considered unless filed within one year after the tax was paid, or within one
year from the filing of the return, whichever period is the longer. The City
Administrator shall examine the claim and make and file written findings
thereon denying or allowing the claim in whole or in part and shall mail a
notice thereof by registered mail to the person at the address stated upon the
return. If the claim is allowed in whole or in part, the City Administrator
shall credit the amount of the allowance against any taxes due under this
section from the claimant and the balance of the allowance, if any, shall be
paid by the City Administrator to the claimant.
   Subd. 8.   Failure to File a Return.
      A.   If any operator required by this section to file a return shall fail
to do so within the time prescribed, or shall make, willfully or otherwise, an
incorrect, false or fraudulent return, the operator shall, upon written notice
and demand, file the return or corrected return within five days of receipt of
the written notice and shall at the same time pay any tax due on the basis
thereof. If the person shall fail to file the return or corrected return, the
City Administrator shall make a return or corrected return, for the person from
the knowledge and information as the City Administrator can obtain, and assess
a tax on the basis thereof, which tax (less any payments theretofore made on
account of the tax for the taxable period covered by the return) shall be paid
within five days of the receipt of written notice and demand for the payment.
Any such return or assessment made by the City Administrator shall be prima
facie correct and valid and the person shall have the burden of establishing
its incorrectness or invalidity in any action or proceeding in respect thereto.
      B.   If any portion of a tax imposed by this section, including penalties
thereon, is not paid within 30 days after it is required to be paid, the City
Attorney may institute the legal action as may be necessary to recover the
amount due plus interest, penalties, the costs and disbursements of any action.
      C.   Upon a showing of good cause, the City Administrator may grant an
operator one 30-day extension of time within which to file a return and make
payment of taxes as required by this section provided that interest during the
period of extension shall be added to the taxes due at the rate of 10% per
annum.
   Subd. 9.   Penalties.
      A.   If any tax imposed by this section is not paid within the time
herein specified for the payment, or any extension thereof, there shall be
added thereto a specific penalty equal to 10% of the amount remaining unpaid.
      B.   In case of any failure to make and file a return within the time
prescribed by this section, unless it is shown that the failure is not due to
willful neglect, there shall be added to the tax, in addition to the 10%
specific penalty provided in Subd. 9.A. above, 10% if the failure is for not
more than 30 days with an additional 5% for each additional 30 days or fraction
thereof during which the failure continued, not exceeding 25% in the aggregate.
If the penalty as computed does not exceed $10, a minimum penalty of $10 shall
be assessed. The amount so added to any tax shall be collected at the same time
and the same manner and as a part of the tax unless the tax has been paid
before the discovery of the negligence, in which case the amount so added shall
be collected in the same manner as the tax.
      C.   If any person willfully fails to file any return or make any payment
required by this section, or willfully files a false or fraudulent return, or
willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any such tax or payment
thereof, there shall also be imposed as a penalty an amount equal to 50% of any
tax (less any amounts paid on the basis of the false or fraudulent return)
found due for the period to which the return related. The penalty imposed by
this subdivision shall be collected as part of the tax, and shall be in
addition to any other penalties provided by this section.
      D.   All payments received shall be credited first to penalties, next to
interest and then to the tax due.
      E.   The amount of tax not timely paid, together with any penalty
provided by this section, shall bear interest at the rate of 8% per annum from
the time the tax should have been paid until paid. Any interest and penalty
shall be added to the tax and be collected as part thereof.
      F.   In addition to any other penalties provided for hereunder, the
Council may, subject to the provisions set forth in this section, suspend or
revoke any license or permit issued by the city to the operator of the
facility.
   Subd. 10.   Administration of Tax. The City Administrator shall administer
and enforce the assessment and collection of the taxes imposed by this section.
The City Administrator shall cause to be prepared blank forms for the returns
and other documents required by this section and shall distribute the same
throughout the city and furnish them on application, but failure to receive or
secure them shall not relieve any person from any obligation required of him or
her under this section.
   Subd. 11.   Examine Records. The City Administrator and those persons acting
on behalf of the City Administrator authorized in writing by the City
Administrator, may examine the books, papers and records of any operator in
order to verify the accuracy of any return made, or if no return was made, to
ascertain the tax as provided in this section. Every such operator is directed
and required to give to the City Administrator or to his or her duly authorized
agent or employee the means, facilities and opportunity for the examination and
investigations as are hereby authorized.
   Subd. 12.   Contract With State. The City Administrator is authorized to
confer with the Minnesota Commissioner of Taxation to the end that an agreement
between the city and the Commissioner of Taxation may be entered into for the
purpose of providing for the administration and collection of the taxes imposed
by this section. Such an agreement shall not become effective until presented
to the Council for its approval and, when so approved, the tax imposed by this
section shall be collected and administered pursuant to the terms of the
agreement.

payment, or who shall refuse to permit the City Administrator or any duly
authorized agents or employees to examine the books, records and papers under
his or her control, or who shall willfully make any incomplete, false or
fraudulent return shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
   Subd. 14.   Use of Proceeds. The 95% of the proceeds obtained from the
collection of taxes pursuant to this section shall be used in accordance with
M.S. § 469.190, as the same may be amended from time to time, to fund a local
convention or tourism bureau for the purpose of marketing and promoting the
city as a tourist or convention center. The city may use up to 5% of the
proceeds obtained hereunder to defray the costs and expenses of collection and
administration of the tax. The city may contract with the person or
organizations as it deems proper and necessary to establish and operate a
tourism and convention bureau.

for any taxes or fees past due.
      D.   When the city revokes a license, the revocation shall continue for
one year and the licensee shall not be issued a sexually-oriented business
license for one year from the date the revocation became effective. If,
subsequent to revocation, the city finds that the basis for the revocation has
been corrected or abated, the applicant may be granted a license if at least 90
days have elapsed since the date the revocation became effective.
      E.   After denial of an application, or denial of a renewal of an

license to another, nor shall a licensee operate a sexually-oriented business
under the authority of a license at any place other than the address designated
in the application.
   Subd. 10.   Severability. In the event any section, subdivision, clause,
phrase or portion of this section is for any reason held illegal, invalid or
unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, the portion shall be
deemed a separate, distinct and independent provision, and the holding shall
not affect the validity of the remainder of this section. It is the legislative
intent of the City Council that this section would have been adopted if such
illegal provision had not been included or any illegal application had not been
made.

after the snow or ice has ceased to be deposited.
   Subd. 2.   City to Remove Snow and Ice. The city may cause to be removed
from all public sidewalks, beginning 24 hours after snow or ice has ceased to
fall, all snow or ice which may be discovered thereon, and it shall keep a

the accumulations were found and removed. Beginning 12 hours after the snow or
ice has ceased to be deposited, the city may give notice to the homeowner or
tenant that the city may remove same at the cost of the owner or tenant
beginning 24 hours after the snow or ice has ceased to fall. In addition, in
the event that the city does remove the snow or ice because of the failure of
the owner or tenant to do so, the city shall notify the owner or tenant that

ceased to fall or accumulate without further notice and charge them back for
the removal.
   Subd. 3.   Cost of Removal to be Assessed. The City Administrator shall, on

or in such a manner as to cause a hazard to travel without adequate
arrangements for the immediate removal thereof; and it is also a petty
misdemeanor for any person not acting under a contract with the city to dump

is removed only from the sidewalks in those areas which are specifically
defined as the downtown business district and East Bridge Street from Minnesota

contemplated improvements, the contemplated date of beginning of work, and the
length of time required to complete the same; provided that, no permit shall be
required for any such improvement ordered installed by the Council. All
applications shall be referred to the Public Works Project Coordinator and no
permit shall be issued until approval has been received from the authorized
city personnel. All such applications shall contain an agreement by the
applicant to be bound by this chapter, and plans and specifications consistent
with the provisions of this chapter and good engineering practices shall also

of roadway surfacing, sidewalk and curb and gutter improvements, including curb
cuts, shall be strictly in accordance with specifications and standards on file

with the specifications and standards, but this shall not place a continuing
burden upon the city to inspect or supervise the work.
   Subd. 5.   Unlawful Act. It is unlawful to fail to construct any of these
items in accordance with the specifications and standards duly adopted by the
Council.

subdivision shall extend, but not by way of limitation, to depositing grease,
oil and other fuel or lubricants in such places, and to place a motor vehicle
with essential parts (as defined in Minnesota Statutes) removed, except the

spring cleanup periods, persons shall be permitted to rake, throw and/or
deposit the leaves, grass or tree limbs in the gutters or at the edges of any
street or other public place that is adjoining their property. Any violation of
this section is hereby declared to be a nuisance and upon three-days' written
notice to the owner, as the owner is shown by the records of the Redwood County
Auditor or the taxpayer of record as shown by the records of the Redwood County
Treasurer, the city shall be entitled to remove the leaves, grass or tree limbs
which have been deposited in the street or public place during the prohibited
periods and charge the owner for the costs. In the event that the owner fails
to pay the costs after billing, the city may collect the costs together with
reasonable attorney's fees by suing the owner in a court of competent
jurisdiction, or in the alternative, by certifying the costs of removal as any
other special assessment upon the land from which the leaves, grass or tree
limbs were removed.
   Subd. 5.   Signs and Other Structures. It is a misdemeanor for any person to
place or maintain a sign or other structure in the traveled or untraveled
portion of any street or other public property without first having obtained a

industrial enterprises, special permission allowing an applicant to erect and
maintain signs overhanging the street may be granted upon such terms and
conditions as may be set forth in the zoning or construction provisions of the
City Code.
   Subd. 6.   Continuing Violation. Each day that any person continues in
violation of this section shall be a separate offense and punishable as such.

of this section, the Council may impose such insurance or bonding conditions
thereon as it, considering the projected danger to public or private property
or to persons, deems proper for safeguarding such persons and property. The

action arising by reason of the obstruction.

he or she may deem necessary to determine estimated cost of repair, such as
back-filling, compacting, resurfacing and replacement, and the conditions as to
the time of commencement of work, manner of procedure and time limitation upon
such excavation. The foregoing estimated costs shall include permanent and
temporary repairs due to weather or other conditions, and the cost of the
investigation shall be included in the estimate. Payment of the estimated costs
shall be made before the permit is issued.
   Subd. 3.   Protection of the City and the Public.
      A.   Non-Completion or Abandonment. Work shall progress expeditiously to
completion in accordance with any time limitation placed thereon so as to avoid

performed in accordance therewith, or shall cease or be abandoned without due
cause, the city may, after six-hours' notice in writing to the holder of the
permit of its intention to do so, correct the work, fill the excavation and
repair the public property and the cost thereof shall be paid by the person
holding the permit.
      B.   Insurance. Prior to commencement of the work described in the
application, the applicant shall furnish the city satisfactory evidence in

not less than $100,000 for any person, $300,000 for any occurrence and property
damage insurance of not less than $25,000, issued by an insurance company
authorized to do business in the state on which the city is named as a co-
insured.
      C.   Indemnification. Before issuance of a permit, the applicant shall,
in writing, agree to indemnify and hold the city harmless from any liability

of the work, or any expense whatsoever incurred by the city incident to a claim
or action brought or commenced by any person arising therefrom.

refund (without interest) to, the permit holder, as the case may be.
   Subd. 7.   Alternate Method of Charging. In lieu of the above provisions

interfere with the right of any person, corporation or municipality owning or
having control of any electric light or telephone pole or lines existing upon

and Shrubs. Every owner of property abutting on any street shall cause the
grass and weeds to be cut from the line of the property nearest to the street
to the center of the street. If the grass or weeds in such a place attain a
height in excess of six inches it shall be prima facie evidence of a failure to
comply with this subdivision. Every owner of property abutting on any street
shall, subject to the provision herein requiring a permit therefor, trim, cut
and otherwise maintain all trees and shrubs from the line of the property
nearest to the street to the center of the street.

§ 7.23 RIGHT-OF-WAY MANAGEMENT.
   Subd. 1.   Findings and Purpose.
      A.   The city holds the rights-of-way within its geographical boundaries
as an asset in trust for its citizens. The city and other public entities have
invested millions of dollars in public funds to build and maintain the rights-
of-way. It also recognizes that some persons, by placing their equipment in the
right-of-way and charging the citizens of the city for goods and services
delivered thereby, are using this property held for the public good. Although
the services are often necessary or convenient for the citizens, the persons
receive revenue and/or profit through their use of public property. Although
the service delivery facilities are in most cases a necessary and proper use of
right-of-way, the city hereby seeks to regulate and manage the uses pursuant to
applicable state law.
      B.   To provide for the health, safety and well-being of its citizens,
and to ensure the structural integrity of its streets and the appropriate use
of the rights-of-way by all users, the city strives to keep its rights-of-way
in a state of good repair and free from unnecessary encumbrances. Although the
general population bears the financial burden for the upkeep of the rights-of-
way, one of the causes for the early and excessive deterioration of its rights-
of-way is frequent excavation.
      C.   This section imposes reasonable regulations on the placement and
maintenance of equipment currently within its rights-of-way or to be placed
therein at some future time. It is intended to complement the regulatory roles
of state and federal agencies. Under this section, persons disturbing and
obstructing the rights-of-way will bear a fair share of the financial
responsibility for their integrity. Finally, this section provides for recovery
of the city's costs associated with managing its rights-of-way.
   Subd. 2.   Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, as used
herein, have the following meanings.
      A.   The term "city cost" means the actual cost incurred by the city for
public rights-of-way management; including, but not limited to, costs
associated with registering applicants; issuing, processing, and verifying
right-of-way permit applications; inspecting job sites and restoration
projects; maintaining, supporting, protecting or moving facilities during
public right-of-way work; determining the adequacy of right-of-way restoration;
restoring work inadequately performed; mapping of "as built" locations of
facilities located in rights-of-way; and revoking right-of-way permits; and
performing all other tasks required by this section, including other costs the
city may incur in managing the provisions of this section.
      B.   The term "degradation" means the accelerated depreciation of the
right-of-way caused by excavation in or disturbance of the right-of-way,
resulting in the need to reconstruct the right-of-way earlier than would be
required if the excavation did not occur.
      C.   The term "degradation cost" means money paid to the city to cover
the cost associated with a decrease in the useful life of a public right-of-way
caused by excavation.
      D.   The term "emergency" means a condition that:
         1.   Poses a clear and immediate danger to life or health, or of a
significant loss of property; or
         2.   Requires immediate repair or replacement in order to restore
service to a customer.
      E.   The terms "equipment" or "facilities" mean any tangible thing in any
right-of-way; but shall not include boulevard plantings or gardens planted or
maintained in the right-of-way between a person's property and the street curb.
      F.   The term "excavate" means to dig into or in any way remove or
physically disturb or penetrate any part of a right-of-way.
      G.   The term "permit" means a permit issued pursuant to this section.
      H.   The term "permit holder" means any person to whom a permit to
excavate or place equipment or facilities in a right-of-way has been granted by
the city under this section.
      I.   The term "registrant" means any person who has or seeks to have its
facilities or equipment located in any right-of-way.
      J.   The terms "restore" or "restoration" mean the process by which the
right-of-way and surrounding area, including pavement and foundation, is
returned to the condition that existed before the commencement of the work.
      K.   The term "restoration cost" means money paid to the city by a
permittee to cover the cost of restoration.
      L.   The term "right-of-way" means the surface and space above and below
a public roadway, highway, street, cartway, bicycle lane and public sidewalk in
which the city has an interest, including other dedicated rights-of-way for
travel purposes and utility easements owned by the city for city utility
purposes.
      M.   The terms "service" or "utility service" include, but is not limited
to:
         1.   Those services provided by a public utility as defined in M.S. §
216B.02(4) and (6), as amended from time to time;
         2.   Telecommunications, pipeline, community antenna television, fire

information. For purposes of this section, a cable communication system defined
and regulated under M.S. Chapter 238, as amended from time to time, and
telecommunication activities related to providing natural gas or electric
energy services are not telecommunications right-of-way users.

      N.   Excavations, trenches and jacking pits shall be protected when
unattended to prevent entrance of surface drainage;
      O.   All backfilling must be placed in six inch layers at optimum
moisture compacted with the objective of attaining 100% of AASHO (American
Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials) density. Compaction
shall be accomplished with hand, pneumatic or vibrating compactors as
appropriate;
      P.   Backfill material shall consist of the excavated soils that have
been removed during excavation. The materials shall be segregated and
backfilled in the same manner as removed; provided, the material moisture is
capable of obtaining optimum compaction. If the backfill material is too wet,
then granular material may be substituted at the direction of authorized city
personnel. All backfill must replace "in kind" the materials removed. All
organic materials must be replaced with granular material as directed by
authorized city personnel;
      Q.   Compacted backfill shall be brought to street grade and crowned at
the center not more than one inch;
      R.   Street and pedestrian traffic shall be maintained throughout

   Subd. 7.   Repair and Restoration.
      A.   Schedule. The work to be done under the permit, and the repair and
restoration of the right-of-way as required herein, must be completed within
the dates specified in the permit, increased by as many days as work could not
be done because of extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the permit
holder, when work was prohibited as unseasonable or unreasonable or when
extended by authorized city personnel. In addition to repairing its own work,
the permit holder must restore the general area of the work, and the
surrounding areas, including the paving and its foundations, to the condition
that existed before the commencement of the work, but only to the extent the
permit holder disturbed the surrounding areas.
      B.   General Standards. The permit holder shall perform repairs and
restoration according to the standards and with the materials specified by
authorized city personnel. The authorized city personnel shall have the
authority to prescribe the manner and extent of the restoration and may do so
in written procedures of general application or on a case-by-case basis. The
authorized city personnel in exercising this authority shall be guided by the
following standards and consideration:
         1.   The number, size, depth and duration of the excavations,
disruptions or damage to the right-of-way;
         2.   The traffic volume carried by the right-of-way; the character of
the neighborhood surrounding the right-of-way;
         3.   The pre-excavation condition of the right-of-way; the remaining
life-expectancy of the right-of-way affected by the excavation;
         4.   Whether the relative cost of the method of restoration to the
permit holder is in reasonable balance with the prevention of an accelerated
depreciation of the right-of-way that would otherwise result from the
excavation, disturbance or damage to the right-of-way; and
         5.   The likelihood that the particular method of restoration would be
effective in slowing the depreciation of the right-of-way that would otherwise
take place.
      C.   City Restoration. The permit holder may request that the city
restore the right-of-way. The permit holder shall pay to the city, in advance,
a cash deposit equaling 150% of the estimated restoration cost. The restoration
cost shall be estimated by authorized city personnel and shall include an
estimate of the degradation cost. The estimate of the degradation cost shall be
based upon criteria adopted by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission.
Following completion of the restoration, any funds in excess of the actual
restoration cost and the degradation cost shall be returned to the permit
holder.
      D.   Guarantees. The permit holder shall guarantee its work and shall
maintain it for 24 months following its completion. During this 24-month
period, it shall, upon notification from authorized city personnel, promptly
correct all restoration work to the extent necessary, using the method required
by authorized city personnel.
   Subd. 8.   Permit Limitations. Permits issued pursuant to this section are
valid only for the area of the right-of-way specified in the application and
the permit, and only for the dates so specified. No work shall be extended
beyond the permitted area or dates without a new permit being procured. The
authorized city personnel may extend the completion date of the work in
accordance with Subd. 7.A. above.
   Subd. 9.   Denial of Permit. The authorized city personnel may deny a permit
due to the following:
      A.   Failure to register pursuant to Subd. 3. above;
      B.   A proposed excavation within a street or sidewalk surface that has
been constructed or reconstructed within the preceding five years unless
authorized city personnel determines that no other locations are feasible or
when necessitated by an emergency;
      C.   The applicant has failed to comply with or correct inadequacies of
previous permits;
      D.   The proposed schedule for the work would conflict or interfere with
an exhibition, celebration, festival or any other similar event;
      E.   The right-of-way would become unduly congested due to the proposed
facilities and equipment when combined with other uses in the right-of-way as
provided in Subd. 14.C. below;
      F.   Businesses or residences in the vicinity will be unreasonably
disrupted by the work;
      G.   The proposed schedule conflicts with scheduled total or partial
reconstruction of the right-of-way; and
      H.   The applicant fails to comply with the requirements of this section
or other sections of this Code.
   Subd. 10.   Emergency Work.
      A.   A registrant may proceed to take whatever actions are necessary to
respond to an emergency. Within two business days after the occurrence of the
emergency the registrant shall apply for the necessary permits, pay the fees
associated therewith and fulfill the rest of the requirements necessary to
bring itself into compliance with this section for the actions it took in
response to the emergency.
      B.   If the authorized city personnel becomes aware of an emergency, the
authorized city personnel shall attempt to contact the local representative of
each registrant affected, or potentially affected, by the emergency. In any
event, the authorized city personnel may take whatever action deemed necessary
to respond to the emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the registrant
whose facilities or equipment occasioned the emergency.
   Subd. 11.   Revocation of Permits. The authorized city personnel may revoke
any permit, without a fee refund, if there is a substantial breach of the terms
and conditions of any statute, this Code, rule or regulation or any condition
of the permit which the substantial breach shall continue uncured for ten
calendar days after the issuance of a written order of authorized city
personnel. A substantial breach of a permit holder shall include, but shall not
be limited to, the following:
      A.   The violation of any material provision of the permit;
      B.   An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the permit,
or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon the city
or its citizens;
      C.   Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a
permit;
      D.   The failure to maintain the required bonds and insurance;
      E.   The failure to complete the work in a timely manner; or
      F.   The failure to correct a condition indicated on an order issued by

   Subd. 12.   Appeal.
      A.   Filing of Appeal.

         2.   The notice must be filed with 20 days of the action causing the
appeal.
      B.   Notice of Hearing. The Council shall hear the appeal not later than
30 days after the date the appeal is filed. Notice of the date, time, place and
purpose of the hearing shall be mailed to the appellant not less than ten days
before the date of the hearing.
      C.   Hearing and Decision. The Council shall, at the hearing, hear and
consider any evidence offered by the appellant, the authorized city personnel
and anyone else wishing to be heard. After hearing the oral and written views
of all interested persons, the Council shall issue a written decision.
   Subd. 13.   Mapping. Within 120 days following completion of any work
pursuant to a permit, the registrant shall provide authorized city personnel
accurate maps and drawings certifying the "as-built" location of all facilities
and equipment installed, owned and maintained by the registrant. The maps and
drawings shall indicate both the horizontal and vertical location of all
facilities and equipment and shall be provided in a format consistent with the
city's mapping system. Failure to provide maps and drawings in accordance with
this subdivision shall be grounds for revoking the permit holder's
registration.
   Subd. 14.   Location of Facilities and Equipment.
      A.   Undergrounding by Telecommunications Right-of-Way Users. Any new
construction and the installation of new equipment and replacement of old
equipment of telecommunication right-of-way users shall be underground or
contained within buildings or other structures in conformity with applicable
codes. Telecommunications right-of-way users may attach equipment and
facilities to existing poles and structures maintained by a service or utility
service with the owner's permission.
      B.   Corridors. The authorized city personnel may assign specific
corridors within the right-of-way, or any particular segment thereof as may be
necessary, for each type of equipment installation currently permitted or
anticipated to be permitted in the future. All permits issued by the authorized
city personnel involving the installation or replacement of equipment shall
designate the proper corridor for the equipment at issue.
      C.   Limitation of Space. To protect health and safety, the authorized
city personnel shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new
or additional equipment within the right-of-way if there is insufficient space
to accommodate all of the requests of registrants or persons to occupy and use
the right-of-way. In making the decisions, the authorized city personnel shall
strive to the extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users
of the right-of-way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the
public interest, the public's needs for the particular utility service, the
condition of the right-of-way, the time of year with respect to essential
utilities, the protection of existing equipment in the right-of-way and future
city plans for public improvements and development projects which have been
determined to be in the public interest.
      D.   Preservation of Corridor Space in the Right-of-Way for Future
Installations. To adequately plan for future demand on the right-of-way by
users, the authorized city personnel may reserve corridor space within the
right-of-way for equipment to be installed at a point of time in the future
even though it is not currently permitted.
   Subd. 15.   Relocation.
      A.   Relocation for City Purposes. A registrant shall promptly but in no
event more than 120 days of the city's request, permanently remove and relocate
at no charge to the city, any facilities or equipment if and when made
necessary by a change in the grade, alignment or width of any right-of-way,
vacation of any right-of-way, by the construction, maintenance or operation of
any city facilities or to protect the public health, safety and welfare. The
registrant shall restore any rights-of-way to the condition it was in prior to
removal and relocation. No fees shall be required of the permittee for work
done under this paragraph.
      B.   Undergrounding of Relocated Telecommunications Facilities. A
telecommunications right-of-way user shall relocate all above ground facilities
and equipment to underground locations at its own cost and expense at the
city's request when:
         1.   The city requires the relocation of all telecommunications
facilities and equipment to underground locations; or
         2.   Structures or poles to which the registrant's facilities or
equipment is attached are abandoned or removed by the owner of the structures
or poles.
   Subd. 16.   Right-of-Way Vacation.
      A.   Reservation of Right. If the city vacates a right-of-way which
contains the equipment of a registrant, and the vacation does not require the
relocation of registrant facilities and equipment, the city shall reserve, to
and for itself and all registrants having facilities and equipment in the
vacated right-of-way, the right to install, maintain and operate any facilities
and equipment in the vacated right-of-way and to enter upon the vacated right-
of-way at any time for the purpose of reconstruction, inspecting, maintaining
or repairing the same.
      B.   Relocation of Equipment. The other person or persons must pay the
relocation costs:
         1.   If the vacation requires the relocation of registrant facilities
and equipment;
         2.   If the vacation proceedings are initiated by the registrant, the
registrant must pay the relocation costs;
         3.   If the vacation proceedings are initiated by the city, the
registrant must pay the relocation costs unless otherwise agreed to by the city
and the registrant; or
         4.   If the vacation proceedings are initiated by a person or persons
other than the registrant or permit holder.
   Subd. 17.   Abandoned and Unusable Equipment.
      A.   Discontinued Operations. A registrant who has determined to
discontinue its operations in the city must either:
         1.   Provide information satisfactory to the authorized city personnel
that the registrant's obligations for its equipment in the right-of-way under
this section have been lawfully assumed by another registrant; or
         2.   Submit to the authorized city personnel an action plan for the
removal or abandonment of equipment and facilities. The authorized city
personnel shall require removal of the facilities and equipment if the
authorized city personnel determine the removal is necessary to protect the
public health, safety and welfare, authorized city personnel may require the
registrant to post a bond in an amount sufficient to reimburse the city for
reasonably anticipated costs to be incurred in removing the facilities and
equipment.
      B.   Abandoned Facilities Equipment. Facilities and equipment of a
registrant located on the surface of, or above a right-of-way, or on city
property which remains unused for a period of two years shall be deemed to be
abandoned. The abandoned equipment is deemed to be a nuisance. The city may
exercise any remedies or rights available including, but not limited to:
         1.   Abating the nuisance; or
         2.   Requiring removal of the equipment or facilities by the
registrant or the registrant's successor in interest.
      C.   Removal of Underground Equipment. Any registrant who has unusable
and abandoned underground facilities or equipment in any right-of-way shall
remove it from that right-of-way during the next scheduled excavation, to the
extent the facilities or equipment is uncovered by the excavation unless this
requirement is waived by authorized city personnel.
   Subd. 18.   Indemnification and Liability.
      A.   Limitation of Liability. By reason of the acceptance of a
registration or the grant of a right-of-way permit, the city does not assume
any liability:
         1.   For injuries to persons, damage to property or loss of service
claims by parties other than the registrant or the city; or
         2.   For claims or penalties of any sort resulting from the
installation, presence, maintenance or operation of equipment by registrants or
activities of registrants.
      B.   Indemnification. By registering with authorized city personnel, a
registrant agrees, or by accepting a permit under this section, a permit-holder
is required, to defend, indemnify and hold the city whole and harmless from,
all costs, liabilities and claims for damages of any kind arising, out of the
construction, presence, installation, maintenance, repair or operation of its
equipment, or out of any activity undertaken in or near a right-of-way, whether
or not any act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed or prohibited
by a right-of-way permit. It further agrees that it will not bring, nor cause
to be brought, any action, suit or other proceeding claiming damages, or
seeking any other relief against the city for any claim nor, for any award
arising out of the presence, installation, maintenance or operation of its
equipment, or any activity undertaken in or near a right-of-way, whether or not
the act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed or prohibited by a
right-of-way permit. The foregoing does not indemnify the city for its own
negligence except for claims arising out of or alleging the city's negligence
where the negligence arises out of or is primarily related to the presence,
installation, construction, operation, maintenance or repair of the equipment
by the registrant or on the registrant's behalf, including, but not limited to,
the issuance of permits and inspection of plans or work. This section is not,
as to third parties, a waiver of any defense or immunity otherwise available to
the registrant or to the city; and the registrant, in defending any action on
behalf of the city, shall be entitled to assert in any action every defense or
immunity that the city could assert in its own behalf.
   Subd. 19.   Franchise Holders. If there is a conflict in language between
the franchise of a person holding a valid franchise agreement with the city and
this section, the terms of the franchise shall prevail.
   Subd. 20.   Effective Date. This section shall be in full force and effect
upon publication.
   Subd. 21.   Violation a Misdemeanor. Every person who violates a section,
subdivision, paragraph, item, clause, part or any provision of this chapter
when performing an act thereby prohibited or declared unlawful, or fails to act
when the failure is thereby prohibited or declared unlawful and, upon
conviction thereof, shall be punished as for a misdemeanor except as otherwise
stated in specific provisions thereof.

§ 10.16 SOCIAL HOST.
   Subd. 1.   Purpose and Findings. The City Council intends to discourage
underage possession and consumption of alcohol, even if done within the
confines of a private residence, and intends to hold persons criminally
responsible who host events or gatherings where persons under 21 years of age
possess or consume alcohol regardless of whether the person hosting the event
or gathering supplied the alcohol. The City Council finds that:
      A.   Events and gatherings held on private or public property where
alcohol is possessed or consumed by persons under the age of 21 are harmful to
those persons and constitute a potential threat to public health requiring
prevention or abatement.
      B.   Prohibiting underage consumption acts to protect underage persons,
as well as the general public, from injuries related to alcohol consumption,
such as alcohol overdose or alcohol-related traffic collisions.
      C.   Alcohol is an addictive drug which if used irresponsibly could have
drastic effects on those who use it as well as those who are affected by the
actions of an irresponsible user.
      D.   Often events or gatherings involving underage possession and
consumption occur outside the presence of parents. However, there are times
when the parent(s) is/are present and condone the activity and in some
circumstances provide the alcohol.
      E.   Even though giving or furnishing alcohol to an underage person is a
crime, it is difficult to prove; and an ordinance is necessary to help further
combat underage consumption.
      F.   A deterrent effect will be created by holding a person criminally
responsible for hosting an event or gathering where underage possession or
consumption occurs.
   Subd. 2.   Authority. This section is enacted pursuant to M.S. § 145A.05,
Subd. 1, as amended from time to time.

which contains 0.5% or more of alcohol by volume and which is fit for beverage
purposes either alone or when diluted, mixed, or combined with other
substances.
      C.   The term "event or gathering" means any group of three or more
persons who have assembled or gathered together for a social occasion or other
activity.

at the event or gathering to be criminally responsible.

§ 10.42 VACANT STRUCTURES.
   Vacant structures and land. Vacant structures and premises thereof or vacant
land shall be maintained in a clean, safe, secure and sanitary condition as
provided herein so as to not be hazardous to the health, safety, and welfare of
the public and so as to not constitute a public nuisance.
   Subd. 1.   Securing. Any vacant structure open at windows or doors, if
unguarded, shall be deemed to be a hazard to the health, safety, and welfare of
the public and a public nuisance within the meaning of this section and shall
be made safe and secure immediately by boarding the openings. Boarding must be
done with sound materials which are securely fastened to the structure and
painted with a color consistent with the adjacent surfaces.
   Subd. 2.   Emergency Securing. The city may take steps to immediately secure
a vacant building at their discretion in emergency circumstances. Any costs
associated with securing the building shall be assessed to property taxes.
   Subd. 3.   Maintenance. The premises of a vacant structure shall be
maintained in an appropriate manner including, but not limited to, mowing of
yard areas; removal of weeds from parking areas, drives, medians, and
landscaping; collection and removal of debris; and watering and maintaining
landscaping and yard.
   Subd. 4.   Occupancy. Any vacant structure which has had window or door

utilities at his or her discretion in emergency circumstances.
(Ord. 54, Fourth Series, passed 12-6-2016)
§ 10.43 DISEASED TREES AND STUMPS.
   Subd. 1.   Declaration of Policy. The health of the trees in the city is
threatened by shade tree pests, and the loss or ill health of trees growing
upon public and private property substantially depreciates the value of
property within the city and impairs the safety, good order, general welfare
and convenience of the public. In addition to and in accordance with M.S. §§
89.001, 89.01, and 89.51-89.64, the provisions of this section are adopted as
an effort to control and prevent the spread of these shade tree pests.
   Subd. 2.   Jurisdiction. The city shall have control of all street trees,
shrubs, and other plantings now or hereafter in any street, park, public right-
of-way or easement, or other public place within the city limits, and shall
have the power to plant, care for, maintain, remove, and replace such trees,
shrubs, and other plantings as regulated by the City of Redwood Falls Boulevard
Tree Policy, a copy of which is retained at City Hall.
   Subd. 3.   Definition, Control Measures and Control Area of a Shade Tree
Pest.
      A.   Oak Wilt Disease.
         1.   Definition. Oak wilt disease is a shade tree pest and is defined
as any living or dead tree, log, firewood, limb, branch, stump, or other
portion of a tree from any species of the genus Quercus existing within the
control area defined that has bark attached and that exceeds three inches in
diameter or ten inches in circumference and contains to any degree any spore or
reproductive structures of the fungus Ceratocystis fagacearum.
         2.   Control Measures. Control measures that may be taken to abate oak
wilt disease are:
            a.   Installation of a root graft barrier. A root graft barrier can
be ordered installed to prevent the underground spread of oak wilt disease. The
city will mark the location of the root graft barrier. The barrier disrupts
transmission of the fungus within the shared vascular systems of root grafted
trees. The barrier is created by excavating or vibratory plowing a line at
least 42 inches deep between any oak tree infected with oak wilt disease and
each nearby and apparently healthy oak tree within 50 feet of the infected
tree.
            b.   Removal and disposal of trees.
               (1)   On property that is zoned residential and commercial the
city may mark for removal trees that have the potential to produce spores of
the fungus Ceratocystis fagacearum. After, and in no case before, the
installation of the root graft barrier and no later than May 1 of the year
following infection, all marked trees must be felled. The stump from such
felled trees must not extend more than three inches above the ground or, if
taller, must be completely debarked. If, however, after the city prescribes the
location for a root graft barrier, the city determines that installation of the
barrier is impossible because of the presence of pavement or obstructions such
as a septic system or utility line, the city may mark for removal all oak trees
whether living or dead, infected or not and located between an infected tree
and the marked barrier location. These marked trees must be felled and disposed
of no later than May 1 of the year following infection. The stump from such
felled trees must not extend more than three inches above the ground or, if
taller, must be completely debarked.
               (2)   On all other property, the city may mark for removal all
oak trees whether living or dead, infected or not and located between an
infected tree and the marked barrier location. These marked trees must be
felled and disposed of no later than May 1 of the year following infection. The
stump from such felled trees must not extend more than three inches above the
ground or, if taller, must be completely debarked.
               (3)   All wood more than three inches in diameter or ten inches
in circumference from such felled trees must be disposed of by burying,
debarking, chipping, or sawing into wane-free lumber, or by splitting into
firewood, stacking the firewood, and immediately covering the woodpile with
unbroken four-mill or thicker plastic sheeting that is sealed into the ground
until Oct. 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the tree
was felled, or by burning before May 1 of the year following infection. Wood
chips from infected trees may be stockpiled or immediately used in the
landscape.
         3.   Control Area. The control area for oak wilt disease is all lands
within the boundaries of the city.
      B.   Emerald Ash Borer.
         1.   Definition. Emerald ash borer is a shade tree pest and is defined
as an insect that attacks and kills ash trees. The adults are small, iridescent
green beetles that live outside of trees during the summer months. The larvae
are grub- or worm-like and live underneath the bark of ash trees.
         2.   Control Measures. Control measures that may be taken to abate
emerald ash borer are those provided in the document, Minnesota Emerald Ash
Borer Science Advisory Group Recommendations on Preparing for Emerald Ash Borer
in Minnesota.
         3.   Control Areas. The control area for emerald ash borer is all
lands within the boundaries of the city.
      C.   Dutch Elm Disease.
         1.   Definition. Dutch elm disease is a shade tree pest and is defined
as a disease of elm trees caused by the fungus Ophiostoma ulmi or Ophiostoma
novo-ulmi, and includes any living or dead tree, log, firewood, limb, branch,
stump, or other portion of a tree from any species of the genus Ulmus existing
within the control area defined that has bark attached and that exceeds three
inches in diameter or ten inches in circumference and could contain bark
beetles or any spore or reproductive structures of the fungus Ophiostoma ulmi
or Ophiostoma novo-ulmi.
         2.   Control Measures. Control measures that may be taken to abate
Dutch elm disease are:
            a.   Use of fungicide. Fungicides may be effective in preventing
Dutch elm disease when injected into living trees that do not already show
symptoms of Dutch elm disease. Fungicide injections on private lands are
optional and, if performed, are at the landowner's expense.
            b.   Removal and disposal of trees. Prompt removal of diseased
trees or branches reduces breeding sites for elm bark beetles and eliminates
the source of Dutch elm disease fungus. Trees that wilt before July 15 must be
removed within 20 days of detection [alternative: 30 days]. Trees that wilt
after July 15 must be removed by April 1 of the following year. Diseased trees
not promptly removed will be removed by the city at the landowner's expense.
Wood may be retained for use as firewood or saw logs if it is debarked or
covered from April 15 to Oct. 15 with four-mill plastic. The edges of the cover
must be buried or sealed to the ground.
         3.   Control Areas. The control area for Dutch elm disease is all
lands within the boundaries of the city.
   Subd. 4.   Declaration of a shade tree pest. The Council may by ordinance
declare any vertebrate or invertebrate animal, plant pathogen, or plant in the
community threatening to cause significant damage to a shade tree or community
forest, as defined by M.S. § 89.001, to be a shade tree pest and prescribe
control measures to effectively eradicate, control, or manage the shade tree
pest, including necessary timelines for action.
   Subd. 5.   Shade tree pest are unlawful. It is unlawful for any person to
permit any shade tree pest as defined in this section to remain on any premises
the person owns or controls within the city. The nuisance may be abated as
provided in this section and the owner cited per §
10.69 Subds. 1. and 2.
   Subd. 6.   Reporting discovery of shade tree pest. Any owner or occupier of
land or any person engaged in tree trimming or removal who becomes aware of the
existence of a shade tree pest as defined under Subd. 3. shall report the same
to the city.
   Subd. 7.   Tree inspector. The Council may appoint a tree inspector to
coordinate the activities of the city relating to the control and prevention of
damage by shade tree pests. The tree inspector will recommend to the Council
the details of any program for the declaration, control, and prevention of
shade tree pests. The tree inspector is authorized to enforce or cause to be
enforced the tasks incident to such a program adopted by the Council. The term
"tree inspector" includes any person designated by Council or the tree
inspector to carry out activities authorized in this section.
   Subd. 8.   Inspection and application of control measures.
      A.   The tree inspector is authorized to inspect premises and places
within the city to determine whether shade tree pests exist thereon and to
investigate all reported incidents of shade tree pests. The tree inspector is
authorized to take all reasonable measures to prevent the maintenance of shade
tree pests and may enforce the provisions relating to abatement in this
section. Diagnosis of shade tree pests may be by the presence of commonly
recognized symptoms; by tests as may be recommended by the commissioner of the
Minnesota Department of Agriculture or the commissioner of the Minnesota
Department of Natural Resources; or other reliable means.
      B.   Except in situations of imminent danger to human life and safety,
the tree inspector shall not enter private property for the purpose of
inspecting or preventing maintenance of a shade tree pest without the
permission of the owner, resident, or other person in control of the property,
unless the tree inspector has obtained a warrant or order from a court of
competent jurisdiction authorizing the entry.
      C.   No person, firm, or corporation shall interfere with the tree
inspector or with anyone acting under the tree inspector's authority while
engaged in activities authorized by this section.
   Subd. 9.   Abatement procedure. Except as provided in Subd. 12., whenever a
tree inspector determines with reasonable certainty that a shade pest is being
maintained or exists on premises in the city, the tree inspector is authorized
to abate the shade tree pest according to the procedures in this Subd. 9.
      A.   The tree inspector will notify in writing the owner of record or
occupant of the premises that a shade tree pest exists and order that the shade
tree pest be terminated or abated. The notice may be given in person or by
mail. Failure of any party to receive the mail does not invalidate the service
of the notice. A copy of the notice shall be filed with the City Clerk.
      B.   The notice of abatement shall state that unless the shade tree pest
is abated by the owner or occupant, it will be abated by the city at the
expense of the owner or occupant. The notice shall specify the control measures
to be taken to abate the shade tree pest, and provide a reasonable amount of
time to abate the shade tree pest. The notice will also state that the owner or
occupant has the right to appeal the determination that a shade tree pest
exists by submitting a request in writing to the City Clerk within seven days
after service of the notice, or before the date by which abatement must be
completed, whichever comes first.
      C.   If no timely appeal is submitted, and the control measures
prescribed in the notice of abatement are not complied with within the time
provided by the notice or any additional time granted, the tree inspector or
designated person shall have the authority to obtain permission or an
administrative search warrant, enter the property, and carry out abatement in
accordance with the notice of abatement.
   Subd. 10.   High-cost abatement. If the tree inspector determines that the
cost of abating a shade tree pest will exceed $5,000 based on a reasonable,
good faith estimate, the written notice referred to in Subd. 9. must provide
that if the shade tree pest is not abated within the reasonable amount of time
provided, the matter will be referred to the City Council for a hearing. The
date, time, and location of the hearing must be provided in the notice.
   Subd. 11.   Appeal procedure. If the City Clerk receives a written request
for a hearing on the question of whether a shade tree pest exists, the City
Council shall hold a hearing within 21 calendar days following receipt by the
Clerk of the written request. At least ten days notice of the hearing shall be
given to the individual who made the written request for the hearing. The
Council may modify the abatement notice or extend the time by which abatement
must be completed. Each owner, agent of the owner, occupant, and lienholder of
the subject property or properties in attendance, if any, shall be given the
opportunity to present evidence at the hearing. After holding the hearing, the
City Council may issue an order requiring abatement of the shade tree pest.
   Subd. 12.   Abatement procedure in event of imminent danger.
      A.   If the tree inspector determines that the danger of infestation to
other shade trees is imminent, and delay in control measures may put public
health, safety, or welfare in immediate danger, the tree inspector may provide
for abatement without following Subd. 9. or 10. The tree inspector must
reasonably attempt to notify the owner or occupant of the affected property of
the intended action and the right to appeal the abatement and any cost recovery
at the next regularly scheduled City Council meeting.
      B.   Nothing in this section shall prevent the city, without notice or
other process, from immediately abating any condition that poses an imminent
and serious hazard to human life or safety.
   Subd. 13.   Recovery of cost of abatement; liability and assessment.
      A.   The owner of premises on which a nuisance has been abated by the
city shall be personally liable for the cost to the city of the abatement,
including administrative costs. As soon as the work has been completed and the
cost determined, the City Clerk or other official shall prepare a bill for the
cost and mail it to the owner. Thereupon the amount shall be immediately due
and payable at the office of the City Clerk.
      B.   After notice and hearing, as provided in M.S. § 429.061 (which may
be amended from time to time), the City Clerk shall, on or before Sept. 1 next
following abatement of the nuisance, list the total unpaid charges as well as
other charges for current services to be assessed under M.S. § 429.101 against
each separate lot or parcel to which the charges are attributable. The City
Council may then certify the charges against the property to the County Auditor
for collection along with current taxes the following year or in annual
installments as the City Council may determine in each case.

      A.   It shall be unlawful for any person to keep or harbor a dog which
habitually barks or cries. Habitual barking shall be defined as barking for
repeated intervals of at least five minutes with less than one minute of
interruption. The barking must also be audible off of the owner's or
caretaker's premises.
      B.   Any police officer may enter onto private property and seize any
barking dog; provided that the following conditions exist:

   Subd. 16.   Dangerous Dogs. No person may own, possess, keep, harbor,
maintain or otherwise have a dangerous dog in the city.
      A.   Notice of Potentially Dangerous or Dangerous Dogs. If, after an
investigation conducted by a peace officer, it is determined that a dog is
potentially dangerous or dangerous according to the criteria described in Subd.
1. the Police Department will serve a notice of intent to declare the dog
potentially dangerous or dangerous on the owner of the dog in question. This
notice shall inform the owner of this designation, the basis for the
determination, the procedures for contesting the designation as described in
Subd. 16.B. and the result of the failure to contest the designation as
described in Subd. 16.H.
      B.   Contesting Declaration of Dangerous or Potentially Dangerous Dogs.
If the owner of a dog has received a notice of intent to declare a dog as a
potentially dangerous or dangerous dog, the owner may request that a hearing be
conducted to determine whether or not such a designation is justified. This
request must be made in writing and delivered to the Police Department within
14 days of receipt of the notice of intent to declare a dog as potentially
dangerous or dangerous.
      C.   Initial Review. Upon receipt of the request, the Police Department
will forward the request along with all necessary supporting documentation to
the City Attorney. The City Attorney will make an initial review of the
evidence surrounding the notice to determine if there is sufficient evidence
supporting the designation to convene a hearing of the Animal Control Review
Panel. If there is insufficient evidence supporting the designation, the City
Attorney shall withdraw the designation and none of the requirements of this
section applying to dangerous or potentially dangerous dogs shall apply to the
dog in question. If there is sufficient evidence that the Review Panel could
uphold the designation, the City Attorney will cause this notice to be brought
to the attention of the Review Panel that will conduct the hearing.
      D.   Hearing Procedure. This Review Panel will consist of two Council
members as they become available, and an elector who resides within the city.
The Panel will schedule a hearing and may call witnesses and review documents
as needed to make a determination on the issue. Owners shall have the right to
present evidence on their behalf and to cross-examine any witnesses. A simple
majority of the members of the Panel is necessary for a finding that the dog is
either dangerous or potentially dangerous. The burden of proof is on the Police
Department. A finding supporting a designation of dangerous or potentially
dangerous dog must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence. The decision
of the Panel shall be in writing and shall indicate the reasons for the
findings. A copy of the findings shall be provided to the Police Department and
the dog owner.
      E.   Effect of Findings that Dog is Potentially Dangerous or Dangerous.
If the Panel finds there is sufficient basis to declare a dog as potentially
dangerous or dangerous, that finding will serve as notice to the owner that the
dog is in fact a potentially dangerous or dangerous dog. Within 14 days after
the owner has received notice that the dog is dangerous, the owner must cause
the animal to be humanely destroyed or removed from the city limits.
         1.   Within 14 days after the owner has received notice that the dog
is dangerous, the owner must cause the animal to be humanely destroyed or
removed from the city limits.
         2.   An owner that has received notice that a dog is dangerous or
potentially dangerous shall not allow the dog to use or be present within the
Redwood Falls City Dog Park. A person who violates this subdivision is guilty
of a petty misdemeanor.   
      F.   Appeal. If the owner of the dog disputes the decision of the Review
Panel, the owner shall have the right to appeal the decision to the City
Council, The appeal must be filed with the City Clerk within 14 days of the
Panel's ruling. If the owner of the dog disputes the findings of the City
Council, the owner may appeal to the Minnesota Court of Appeals as provided by
state law.
      G.   Mayor to Appoint Veterinarian and Substitute Panel Members. The
Mayor of the city may appoint a veterinarian to serve on the Hearing Panel on a
voluntary basis in lieu of the elector. The appointment shall continue in
effect until the appointee resigns or is replaced by the Mayor. In the event
the veterinarian is temporarily unavailable or has a personal interest in the
outcome of the proceeding, the Mayor may appoint another veterinarian to
replace the initial appointee on the Panel. In addition, in the event the City
Council President or relevant Council member is temporarily unavailable or has
a personal interest in the outcome of the proceeding, the Mayor may appoint
other members of the City Council or city staff to sit in their place.
      H.   Failure to Contest Notice of Intent to Declare.
         1.   If the owner of a dog receives a notice from the Police
Department of the intent to declare the dog as potentially dangerous or
dangerous, and the owner fails to contest that notice within 14 days, the owner
shall be considered as having forfeited the right to the hearing described in
Subd. 16.D. and as having consented to the designation of the dog as
potentially dangerous or dangerous by default.
         2.   The Police Department will then issue a declaration of dangerous
or potentially dangerous dog to the owner. Within 14 days after the owner has
received notice that the dog is dangerous, the owner must cause the animal to
be humanely destroyed or removed from the city limits.
      I.   Seizure of Dangerous Dogs and Violations. The peace officer shall
immediately seize any dangerous dog and/or issue a citation to the owner of any
dangerous dog if within 14 days after the owner has received notice that the
dog is dangerous, the dog is not humanely destroyed or removed from the city
limits.
      J.   Exemptions. Dogs may not be declared potentially dangerous or
dangerous if the threat, injury or damage was sustained by a person:
         1.   Who was at the time of injury committing or attempting to commit
a willful trespass or other tort or crime upon the premises occupied by the
dog;
         2.   Who was provoking, tormenting, teasing, abusing or assaulting the
dog or who can be shown to have repeatedly, in the past, provoked, tormented,

who brings an animal into the city is subject to this section.

Subd. 15. whenever a peace officer has reasonable cause to believe that a
particular animal presents a clear and immediate danger to residents of the
city because it is infected with rabies or because of a clearly demonstrated
vicious nature, the officer, after making reasonable attempts to impound the
animal, may summarily destroy the animal.
   Subd. 19.   Obstructing. No person shall tamper, hinder or interfere with
any live trap set for the purpose of capturing cats found to be running at
large, or break open any trap, or attempt to do so, or to take or let out any
cat captured therein. A violation of this section shall constitute a petty
misdemeanor punishable by a fine not to exceed $300 or that amount which may be
lawfully prescribed by a municipality for an ordinance violation that is
defined as a petty misdemeanor.
   Subd. 20.   Quarantine of Unvaccinated Animal. The owner of an animal that
inflicts a bite on a human shall provide to the Police Department evidence that
the animal is current on its rabies vaccination. The Police Department may
seize and hold the animal at the Shelter for a period of not less than ten days
if evidence of a current rabies vaccination is not presented or otherwise of
record. If the animal is owned by a resident of the city, the animal may be
reclaimed by the owner upon payment of impounding, boarding and immunization
fees; if the animal is a dog, the owner must also provide proof of current
licensure or purchase a dog license. If the animal is owned by a person not a
resident of the city, the animal may be reclaimed by the owner upon payment of
impounding, boarding fees and immunization fees. Any animal impounded pursuant
to this section cannot be reclaimed or released until such time that the animal
has been immunized for rabies. In the event any dog, cat, or other impounded
animal is unclaimed after the expiration of any applicable redemption or
quarantine period set forth in Minnesota Statues or Redwood Falls City
Ordinances, whichever is longer, they shall become the property of the Shelter
and may be disposed of, adopted, or sold in its sole discretion. All proceeds
from the disposition of such animals shall be the sole property of the Shelter,
including any proceeds received from any animals disposed of in accordance with
M.S. § 35.71.

provision of this section, division, paragraph, or provision of this chapter is
guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished by a fine not to exceed $1,000 or
imprisonment for not more than 90 days, or both, plus the costs of prosecution
in either case except as otherwise stated in specific provisions hereof. Each
day's violation after notice thereof shall constitute a separate offense.
   Subd. 2.   Civil Penalties. Any violation of this section, division,

(Ord. 54, Fourth Series, passed 12-6-2016)
§ 10.69 ABATEMENT PROCEDURE.
   Subd. 1.   Procedure. Whenever the peace officer or other designated
official determines that a public nuisance or violation of this chapter is
being maintained or exists on the premises in the city, the official shall
notify in writing the owner of record or occupant of the premises of such fact
and order that the nuisance be terminated or abated. The notice shall be by
certified or registered mail. The notice of violation shall specify the steps
to be taken to abate the nuisance and the time within which the nuisance is to
be abated, not to exceed 30 days. If the notice of violation is not complied
with within the time specified, the official shall report that fact forthwith
to the City Council. Thereafter, the City Council may, after notice to the
owner or occupant and an opportunity to be heard, determine that the condition
identified in the notice of violation is a nuisance and further order that if
the nuisance is not abated within
the time prescribed by the City Council, the city may take any and all action
necessary to abate said nuisance immediately and may assess to the landowner
any and all costs incurred therein, including legal fees and costs, and said
assessment shall be a specific lien against any real estate owned by said
landowner.
   Subd. 2.   Notice. Written notice of the violation; notice of the time,
date, place, and subject of any hearing before the City Council; notice of the
City Council order; and notice of motion for summary enforcement hearing shall
be served by a peace officer or designated official on the owner of record or
occupant of the premises either in person or by certified or registered mail.
If the premises is not occupied, the owner of record is unknown, or if the
owner of record or occupant refuses to accept notice, notice of the violation
shall be served by posting it on the premises.
   Subd. 3.   Emergency procedure; summary enforcement. In cases of emergency,
where delay in abatement required to complete the procedure and notice
requirements as set forth in Subds. 1. and 2. of this section will permit a
continuing nuisance to unreasonably endanger public health, safety, or welfare,
the City Council may order summary enforcement and abate the nuisance. To
proceed with summary enforcement, the peace officer or other designated
official shall determine that a public nuisance exists or is being maintained
on premises in the city and that delay in abatement will unreasonably endanger
public health, safety, or welfare. The officer or designated official shall
notify in writing the occupant or owner of the premises of the nature of the
nuisance, whether public health, safety, or welfare will be unreasonably
endangered by delay in abatement required to complete the procedure set forth
in Subds. 1. and 2. of this section and may order that the nuisance be
immediately terminated or abated. If the nuisance is not immediately terminated
or abated, the City Council may order summary enforcement and abate the
nuisance.
   Subd. 4.   Immediate abatement. Nothing in this section shall prevent the
city, without notice or other process, from immediately abating any condition
that poses an imminent and serious hazard to human life or safety.
   Subd. 5.   Judicial remedy. Nothing in this section shall prevent the city
from seeking a judicial remedy when no other adequate administrative remedy
exists.
   Subd. 6.   Personal liability. The owner of the premises on which a nuisance
has been abated by the city, or a person who has caused a public nuisance on
property not owned by that person, shall be personally liable for the cost to
the city of the abatement, including administrative costs. As soon as the work
has been completed and the cost determined, the City Clerk or other city
official shall prepare a bill for the cost and mail it to the owner. Thereupon
the amount shall be immediately due and payable at the office of the City
Clerk.
   Subd. 7.   Assessment. After notice and hearing as provided in M.S. §
429.061, as it may be amended from time to time, if the nuisance is a public
health or safety hazard on private property, the accumulation of snow and ice
on public sidewalks, the growth of weeds on private property or outside the
traveled portion of streets, or unsound or insect-infected trees, the City
Clerk shall, on or before September 1 next following abatement of the nuisance,
list the total unpaid charges along with all other such charges as well as
other charges for current services to be assessed under M.S. § 429.101 against
each separate lot or parcel to which the charges are attributable. The City
Council may then spread the charges against the property under that statute and
any other pertinent statutes for certification to the County Auditor and
collection along with current taxes the following year or in annual
installments, not exceeding ten, as the City Council may determine in each
case.

§ 11.08 ABATEMENT.
   Subd. 1.   Procedure. If the notice of violation, as described in §
11.07, is not complied with within the time specified, the code officer shall
report that fact forthwith to the City Administrator. Thereafter, an
administrative hearing by the City Hearing Officer shall be set, pursuant to
City Code §
1.13, Subd. 4. The owner or occupant shall be provided with at least 10 days’
notice of the hearing. The hearing notice shall be served on the owner or
occupant as provided in §
11.07, Subd. 3. At the hearing, the owner or occupant shall be provided an
opportunity to provide testimony, present evidence, and question witnesses.
After the hearing, the Hearing Officer may issue Findings of Fact and Abatement
Order providing for the city to abate the violation. The abatement order shall
be executed as soon as practicable thereafter under the supervision of the code
officer. Any abatement order issued by the Hearing Officer may be appealed
pursuant to City Code §
1.13, Subd. 5. and §
11.12, Subd. 2., to the City Council. City Council review of the Hearing
Officer’s abatement order shall follow the same rules and procedures as
outlined in City Code §
1.13, Subd. 5.(A) to (C). If the Council upholds the abatement order, an
aggrieved party may obtain judicial review of the Council’s decision by
proceeding under a writ of certiorari in District Court. The writ must be filed
within 10 days of the Council’s decision. If the violation is not abated within
the time prescribed by the City Council, the city may take any and all action
necessary to abate said violation immediately and may assess to the landowner
any and all costs incurred therein, including legal fees and costs, and said
assessment shall be a specific lien against any real estate owned by said
landowner.
   Subd. 2.   Emergency procedure; summary enforcement. In cases of emergency,
where delay in abatement required to complete the procedure and notice
requirements, as set forth in §
11.07 and Subd. 1. of this section, will permit a continuing violation to
unreasonably endanger public health, safety, or welfare, the City Council may
order summary enforcement and abate the violation. To proceed with summary
enforcement, the code officer or other designated official shall determine that
a violation of this Code exists or is being maintained on premises in the city
and that delay in abatement will unreasonably endanger public health, safety,
or welfare. The code officer or designated official shall attempt to notify in
writing the occupant or owner of the premises of the nature of the violation
and the city’s intention to seek summary enforcement and the time and place of
the City Council meeting to consider the question of summary enforcement. The
City Council shall determine whether or not the condition identified in the
notice to the owner or occupant is a violation of this code and whether public
health, safety or welfare will be unreasonably endangered by delay in abatement
required to complete the procedure set forth in §
11.07 and Subd. 1. of this section, and may order that the nuisance be
immediately terminated or abated. If the nuisance is not immediately terminated
or abated, the City Council may order summary enforcement and abate the
nuisance.
   Subd. 3.   Immediate abatement. Nothing in this section shall prevent the
city, without notice or other process, from immediately abating any condition
that poses an imminent and serious hazard to human life or safety.
   Subd. 4.   Judicial remedy. Nothing in this section shall prevent the city
from seeking a judicial remedy when no other adequate administrative remedy
exists.
   Subd. 5.   Personal liability. The owner of the premises on which a
violation of this code has been abated by the city, or a person who has caused
a violation on property not owned by that person, shall be personally liable
for the cost to the city of the abatement, including administrative costs. As
soon as the work has been completed and the cost determined, the City Clerk or
other city official shall prepare a bill for the cost and mail it to the owner.
Thereupon the amount shall be immediately due and payable at the office of the
City Clerk.
   Subd. 6.   Assessment. After notice and hearing as provided in M.S. §
429.061, as it may be amended from time to time, if the violation of this code
is a public health or safety hazard on private property, the accumulation of
snow and ice on public sidewalks, the growth of weeds on private property or
outside the traveled portion of streets, unsound or insect-infected trees,
installation or repair of water service lines, or required inspection relating
to a municipal housing maintenance code violation, the City Clerk shall, on or
before September 1 next following abatement of the violation, list the total
unpaid charges along with all other such charges as well as other charges for
current services to be assessed under M.S. § 429.101 against each separate lot
or parcel to which the charges are attributable. The City Council may then
spread the charges against the property under that statute and any other
pertinent statutes for certification to the County Auditor and collection along
with current taxes the following year or in annual installments, not exceeding
ten, as the City Council may determine in each case.

§ 11.09 UNSAFE STRUCTURES AND EQUIPMENT.
   Subd.1.    General. When a structure or equipment is found by the code
officer to be unsafe, or when a structure is found unfit for human occupancy,
or is found unlawful, such structure shall be condemned pursuant to the
provisions of this code.
      A.   Unsafe structures. An unsafe structure is one that is found to be
dangerous to the life, health, property or safety of the public or the
occupants of the structure by not providing minimum safeguards to protect or
warn occupants in the event of fire, or because such structure contains unsafe
equipment or is so damaged, decayed, dilapidated, structurally unsafe, or of
such faulty construction or unstable foundation, that partial or complete
collapse is possible.
      B.   Unsafe equipment. Unsafe equipment includes any boiler, heating
equipment, elevator, moving stairway, electrical wiring or device, flammable
liquid containers, or other equipment on the premises or within the structure,
which is in such disrepair or condition that such equipment is a hazard to
life, health, property, or safety of the public or occupants of the premises or
structure.
      C.   Structure unfit for human occupancy. A structure is unfit for human
occupancy whenever the code officer finds that such structure is unsafe,
unlawful, or because of the degree to which the structure is in disrepair or
lacks maintenance, is unsanitary, vermin or rat-infested, contains filth and
contamination, or lacks ventilation, illumination, sanitary or heating
facilities or other essential equipment required by this code, or because the
location of the structure constitutes a hazard to the occupants of the
structure or to the public.
      D.   Unlawful structure. An unlawful structure is one found in whole or
in part to be occupied by more persons than permitted under this code, or was
erected, altered or occupied contrary to law.
      E.   Dangerous structure or premises. For the purpose of this code, any
structure or premises that have any or all of the conditions or defects
described below shall be considered dangerous:
         1.   Any door, aisle, passageway, stairway, exit, or other means of
egress that does not conform to the approved building or fire code of the
jurisdiction as related to the requirements for existing buildings.
         2.   The walking surface of any aisle, passageway, stairway, exit, or
other means of egress is so warped, worn loose, torn or otherwise unsafe as to
not provide safe and adequate means of egress.
         3.   Any portion of a building, structure or appurtenance that has
been damaged by fire, earthquake, wind, flood, deterioration, neglect,
abandonment, vandalism, or by any other cause to such an extent that it is
likely to partially or completely collapse, or to become detached or dislodged.
         4.   Any portion of a building, or any member, appurtenance, or
ornamentation on the exterior thereof that is not of sufficient strength or
stability, or is not so anchored attached or fastened in place so as to be
capable of resisting natural or artificial loads of one and one half the
original designed value.
         5.   The building or structure, or part of the building or structure,
because of dilapidation, deterioration, decay, faulty construction, the removal
or movement of some portion of the ground necessary for the support, or for any
other reason, is likely to partially or completely collapse, or some portion of
the foundation or underpinning of the building or structure is likely to fail
or give way.
         6.   The building or structure, or any portion thereof, is clearly
unsafe for its use and occupancy.
         7.   The building or structure is neglected, damaged, dilapidated,
unsecured, or abandoned so as to become an attractive nuisance to children who
might play in the building or structure to their danger, becomes a harbor for
vagrants or criminals or enables persons to resort to the building or structure
for committing a nuisance or an unlawful act.
         8.   Any building or structure has been constructed, exists, or is
maintained in violation of any specific requirement or prohibition applicable
to such building or structure provided by the approved building or fire code of
the jurisdiction, or of any law or ordinance to such an extent as to present
either a substantial risk of fire, building collapse or any other threat to
life and safety.
         9.   A building or structure, used or intended to be used for dwelling
purposes, because of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, decay, damage,
faulty construction or arrangement, inadequate light, ventilation, mechanical
or plumbing system, or otherwise, is determined by the code officer to be
unsanitary, unfit for human habitation or in such a condition that is likely to
cause sickness or disease.
         10.   Any building or structure, because of a lack of sufficient or
proper fire resistance rated construction, fire protection systems, electrical
system, fuel connections, mechanical system, plumbing system or other cause, is
determined by the code officer to be a threat to life or health.
         11.   Any portion of a building remains on a site after the demolition
or destruction of the building or structure or whenever any building or
structure is abandoned so as to constitute such building or portion thereof as
an attractive nuisance or hazard to the public.
   Subd. 2.   Closing of vacant structures.
      A.   If the structure is vacant and unfit for human habitation and
occupancy, and is not in danger of structural collapse, the code officer is
authorized to post a placard of condemnation on the premises and order the
structure closed up so as not to be an attractive nuisance. Upon failure of the
owner to close up the premises within the time specified in the order, the code
officer shall cause the premises to be closed and secured through any available
public agency or by contract or arrangement by private persons and the cost
thereof shall be charged against the real estate upon which the structure is
located and shall be a lien upon such real estate and may be collected by any
other legal resource.
      B.   Any vacant structure open at windows or doors, if unguarded, shall
be deemed to be a hazard to the health, safety, and welfare of the public and
shall be made safe and secure immediately by boarding the openings. Boarding
must be done with sound materials, which are securely fastened to the structure
and pained with a color consistent with the adjacent surfaces.
      C.   Any vacant structure, which has had window or door openings closed
by boarding, shall not be reoccupied until such openings have been secured by
proper windows or doors.
      D.   Authority to disconnect service utilities. The code officer shall
have the authority to authorize disconnection of utility service to the
building, structure or system regulated by this code and the referenced codes
and standards set forth in §
11.09 in case of emergency where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to
life or property or when such utility connection has been made without
approval. The code officer shall notify the serving utility and, whenever
possible, the owner and occupant of the building, structure or service system
of the decision to disconnect prior to taking such action. If not notified
prior to disconnection the owner or occupant of the building structure or
service system shall be notified in writing as soon as practical thereafter.
   Subd. 3.   Notice. Whenever the code officer has condemned a structure or
equipment under the provisions of this section, notice shall be posted in a
conspicuous place in or about the structure affected by such notice and served
on the owner or the person or persons responsible for the structure or
equipment in accordance with §
11.07. If the notice pertains to equipment, it shall also be placed on the
condemned equipment. The notice shall be in the form prescribed in §
11.07.
   Subd. 4.   Placarding.
      A.   Upon failure of the owner or person responsible to comply with the
notice provisions within the time given, the code officer shall post on the
premises or on defective equipment a placard bearing the word "condemned" and a
statement of the penalties provided for occupying the premises, operating the
equipment or removing the placard.
      B.   Placard removal. The code officer shall remove the condemnation
placard whenever the defect or defects upon which the condemnation and
placarding action were based have been eliminated. Any person who defaces or
removes a condemnation placard without the approval of the code officer shall
be subject to the penalties provided by this code.
   Subd. 5.   Prohibited occupancy. Any occupied structure condemned and
placarded by the code officer shall be vacated as ordered by the code officer.
Any person who shall occupy placarded premises or shall operate placarded
equipment, and any owner or any person responsible for the premises who shall
let anyone occupy placarded premises or operate placarded equipment shall be
liable for the penalties provided by this code.
   Subd. 6.   Abatement methods. The owner, operator, or occupant of a
building, premises, or equipment deemed unsafe by the code officer shall abate
or cause to be abated or corrected such unsafe conditions either by repair,
rehabilitation, demolition, or by other approved corrective action.
   Subd. 7.   Record. The code officer shall cause a report to be filed on an
unsafe condition. The report shall state the occupancy of the structure and the
nature of the unsafe condition.
(Ord. 69, Fourth Series, passed 4-6-2021)
§ 11.10 EMERGENCY MEASURES.
   Subd. 1.   Imminent danger. When, in the opinion of the code officer, there
is imminent danger of failure or collapse of a building or structure which
endangers life, or when any structure or part of a structure has fallen and
life is endangered by the occupation of the structure, or when there is actual
or potential danger to the building occupants or those in the proximity of any
structure because of explosives, explosive fumes or vapors, or the presence of
toxic fumes, gases or materials, or operation of defective or dangerous
equipment, the code officer is hereby authorized and empowered to order and
require the occupants to vacate the premises forthwith. The code officer shall
cause to be posted at each entrance to such structure a notice reading as
follows: "This structure is unsafe and its occupancy has been prohibited by the
code officer.” It shall be unlawful for any person to enter such structure
except for the purpose of securing the structure, making the required repairs,
removing the hazardous condition, or of demolishing the same.
   Subd. 2.   Temporary safeguards. Notwithstanding other provisions of this
code, whenever, in the opinion of the code officer, there is imminent danger
due to an unsafe condition, the code officer shall order the necessary work to
be done, including the boarding up of openings, to render such structure
temporarily safe whether or not the legal procedure herein described has been
instituted; and shall cause such other action to be taken as the code officer
deems necessary to meet such emergency.
   Subd. 3.   Closing streets. When necessary for public safety, the code
