Infrastructure Fund which is to be administered to preserve the principal and
continue additional growth of the fund. This subchapter establishes a program
which will benefit current and future citizens and is intended to assist future
generations as well. It is the intent of this section that the Heritage
Infrastructure Fund be preserved and maintained for future generations.

welfare, or

portion of such consideration which became uncollectible.
('72 Code, § 285:25) (Ord. 1986-536(A), passed 7-28-86)
§ 34.27 EXAMINATION OF RETURN ADJUSTMENTS, NOTICES AND DEMANDS.
   The Director may rely upon the Minnesota sales tax return filed by the
operator with the State of Minnesota in determining the accuracy of a return
filed under this subchapter. The Director may after a return is filed, examine
the same and make any investigation or examination of the records and accounts
of the person making the return deemed necessary for determining its
correctness. The tax computed on the basis of such examination is the tax to be
paid. If the tax due is found to be greater than that paid, such excess must be
paid to the city within ten days after receipt of a notice thereof given either
personally or sent by registered mail to the address shown on the return. If
the tax paid is greater than the tax found to be due, the excess must be
refunded to the person who paid the tax to the city within ten days after
determination of such refund.

§ 34.28 REFUNDS.
   The person may apply to the Director for a refund of taxes paid for a
prescribed period in excess of the amount legally due for that period, provided
that no application for refund will be considered unless filed within one year
after such tax was paid, or within one year from the filing of the return,
whichever period is the longer. The Director must examine the claim and make
and file written findings thereon denying or allowing the claim in whole or in
part and must mail a notice thereof by registered mail to the person at the
address stated upon the return. If the claim is allowed in whole or in part,
the Director must credit the amount of the allowance against any taxes due
under this subchapter from the claimant and the balance of the allowance, if
any, must be paid by the Director to the claimant.
('72 Code, § 285:35) (Ord. 1986-536(A), passed 7-28-86)
§ 34.29 FAILURE TO FILE A RETURN.
   (A)   If an operator required by this subchapter to file a return fails to
do so within the time prescribed, or makes, willfully or otherwise, an
incorrect, false, or fraudulent return, the operator must, upon written notice
and demand, file the return or corrected return within five days of receipt of
written notice and must at the same time pay any tax due on the basis thereof.
If the person fails to file a return or corrected return, the Director must
make a return or corrected return, for the person from the knowledge and
information as the Director can obtain, and assess a tax on the basis thereof,
which tax (less any payments theretofore make on account of the tax for the
taxable period covered by such return) must be paid upon within five days of
the receipt of written notice and demand for such payment. Any such return or
assessment made by the Director must be prima facie correct and valid, and the
person has the burden of establishing its incorrectness or invalidity in any
action or proceeding in respect thereto.
   (B)   If any portion of a tax imposed by this subchapter, including
penalties thereon, is not paid within 30 days after it is required to be paid,
the City Attorney may institute such legal action as may be necessary to
recover the amount due plus interest, penalties, the costs and disbursements of
any action.
   (C)   Upon a showing of good cause, the Director may grant an operator one
30 day extension of time within which to file a return and make payment of
taxes as required by this subchapter provided that interest during such period
of extension must be added to the taxes due at the rate of 10% per annum.
('72 Code, § 285:40) (Ord. 1986-536(A), passed 7-28-86)
§ 34.30 DELINQUENT TAXES.
   (A)   If any tax imposed by this subchapter is not paid within the time
herein specified for the payment, or any extension thereof, there is to be
added thereto a specific penalty equal to 10% of the amount remaining unpaid.
   (B)   In case of any failure to make and file a return within the time
prescribed by this subchapter, unless it is shown that such failure is not due
to willful neglect, there is to be added to the tax in addition to the 10%
specific penalty provided in division (A) above, 10% if the failure is for not
more than 30 days with an additional 5% for each additional 30 days or fraction
thereof during which such failure continues, not exceeding 25% in the
aggregate. If the penalty as computed does not exceed $10, a minimum penalty of
$10 must be assessed. The amount so added to any tax must be collected at the
same time and the same manner and as a part of the tax unless the tax has been
paid before the discovery of the negligence, in which case the amount so added
must be collected in the same manner as the tax.
   (C)   If any person willfully fails to file any return or make any payment
required by this subchapter, or willfully files a false or fraudulent return or
willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any such a tax or payment
thereof, there must also be imposed as a penalty an amount equal to 50% of any
tax (less any amounts paid on the basis of such false or fraudulent return)
found due for the period to which such return related. The penalty imposed by
this division must be collected as part of the tax, and is in addition to any
other penalties provided by this subchapter.
   (D)   All payments received must be credited first to penalties, next to
interest, and then to the tax due.
   (E)   The amount of tax not timely paid, together with any penalty provided
by this section, bears interest at the rate of 8% per annum from the time such
tax should have been paid until paid. Any interest and penalty must be added to
the tax and be collected as part thereof.
('72 Code, § 285:45) (Ord. 1986-536(A), passed 7-28-86)
§ 34.31 ADMINISTRATION OF TAX.
   The Director administers and enforces the assessment and collection of the
taxes imposed by this subchapter. The Director shall cause to be prepared blank
forms for the returns and other documents required by this subchapter and must
distribute the same throughout the city and furnish them on application, but
failure to receive or secure them does not relieve a person from any obligation
required of the person under this subchapter unless it can be established that
the required forms were not available from the city.

operator is directed and required to give to the Director or to the Director’s
duly authorized agent or employee the means, facilities and opportunity for
such examinations and investigations as are hereby authorized.

approval and when so approved the tax imposed by this subchapter shall be
collected and administered pursuant to the terms of the agreement.
('72 Code, § 285:60) (Ord. 1986-536(A), passed 7-28-86)
§ 34.34 VIOLATIONS.
   A person who willfully fails to make a return required by this subchapter;
or who fails to pay the tax after written demand for payment, or who fails to
remit the taxes collected or any penalty or interest imposed by this subchapter
after written demand for such payment or who refuses to permit the Director or
any duly authorized agents or employees to examine the books, records and
papers under the person’s control, or who willfully makes any incomplete, false
or fraudulent return is guilty of a misdemeanor.

days prior written notice of the date, time and place of the hearing.
   (D)   At the hearing, the petitioner must be given an opportunity to show
cause why the notice, order or determination should be modified or withdrawn.
The petitioner may be represented by counsel of petitioner's choosing at
petitioner's own expense.
   (E)   The hearing must be conducted by the City Manager or the City
Manager’s designee, provided only that the person conducting the hearing must
not have participated in the drafting of the order, notice or determination for
which review is sought.
   (F)   The person conducting the hearing must make written findings of fact
and conclusions based upon the applicable sections of this chapter and evidence
presented. The person conducting the hearing may affirm, reverse or modify the
notice, order or determination made by the director.

be appealed to the City Council. A petitioner seeking to appeal a decision must
file a written notice of appeal with the City Clerk within ten days after the
decision has been mailed to the petitioner. The matter will thereupon be placed
on the Council agenda as soon as is practical. The Council must then review the
findings of fact and conclusions to determine whether they were correct. Upon a
determination by the Council that findings and conclusions were incorrect, the
Council may modify, reverse or affirm the decision of the City Manager or the
City Manager’s designee upon the same standards as set forth in division (F) of
this section.

CHAPTER 37: ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES
Section
   
37.01   Purpose
   
37.02   Administrative citations and civil penalties
   
37.03   Administrative offenses; schedule of fines and fees
   
37.04   Administrative citation
   
37.05   Administrative hearing - automatic stay
   
37.06   Administrative review
   
37.07   Judicial review
   
37.08   Recovery of civil penalties
   
37.09   Criminal penalties
   
37.10   Applicable laws
§ 37.01 PURPOSE.
   The City Council finds that there is a need for alternative methods of
enforcing the city code. While criminal fines and penalties have been the most
frequent enforcement mechanisms, there are certain negative consequences for
both the city and the public. The delay inherent in that system does not ensure
prompt resolution. Citizens resent being labeled criminals for violations of
administrative regulations. The higher burden of proof and the potential of
incarceration do not appear appropriate for most administrative violations. The
criminal process does not always regard city code violations as important.
Accordingly, the City Council finds that the use of administrative citations
and the imposition of civil penalties is a legitimate and necessary alternative
method of enforcement. This method of enforcement is in addition to any other
legal remedy which may be pursued for city code violations.
('72 Code, § 903:10) (Ord. 1998-881, passed 7-22-98)
§ 37.02 ADMINISTRATIVE CITATIONS AND CIVIL PENALTIES.
   This chapter governs administrative citations and civil penalties for
violations of the city code.
('72 Code, § 903:20) (Ord. 1998-881, passed 7-22-98)
§ 37.03 ADMINISTRATIVE OFFENSES; SCHEDULE OF FINES AND FEES.
   (A)   A violation of any provision of the city code is an administrative
offense, which may be subject to an administrative citation and civil penalties
pursuant to this subchapter. Each day a violation exists constitutes a separate
offense.
   (B)   An administrative offense may be subject to a civil penalty not
exceeding $2,000.
   (C)   The City Council must adopt by resolution a schedule of recommended
fines for offenses initiated by administration citation. The City Council is
not bound by that schedule when a matter is appealed to it for administrative
review.
   (D)   The City Council may adopt a schedule of fees to be paid to
administrative hearing officers.
   (E)   The City Manager must adopt written procedures for administering the
administrative citation program.
('72 Code, § 903:40) (Ord. 1998-881, passed 7-22-98)
§ 37.04 ADMINISTRATIVE CITATION.
   (A)   A person authorized to enforce provisions of the city code may issue
an administrative citation upon belief that a code violation has occurred. The
citation must be issued in person or by first class mail to the person
responsible for the violation or attached to the motor vehicle in the case of a
vehicular offense. The citation must state the date, time, and nature of the
offense, the identity of the person issuing the citation, the amount of the
scheduled fine, and the manner for paying the fine or appealing the citation.
   (B)   The person responsible for the violation must either pay the scheduled
fine or request a hearing within 14 days after issuance of the citation. A
hearing must be conducted within 30 days after a request or within 30 days
after a responsible person fails to return the automatic stay agreement
pursuant to §
37.05(F)(8). Hearings exceeding 30 days may be granted by the Administrative
Enforcement Program Coordinator for good cause. Payment of the fine constitutes
admission of the violation. A late payment fee of 10% of the scheduled fine
amount will be imposed in accordance with §
37.08.
('72 Code, § 903:50) (Ord. 1998-881, passed 7-22-98; Am. Ord. 2012-1136, passed
3-26-12)
§ 37.05 ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING - AUTOMATIC STAY.
   (A)   The City Council must periodically approve a list of persons, from
which the City Manager or designated agent will randomly select a hearing
officer to hear and determine a matter for which a hearing is requested. A
person who has been issued a citation has the right to request, no later than
five days before the date of the hearing, that the assigned hearing officer be
removed from the case. One such request for each case will be granted
automatically by the City Manager or designated agent. A subsequent request
must be directed to the assigned hearing officer who will decide whether the
hearing officer can fairly and objectively review the case. The person issuing
the citation may request the removal of a hearing officer only if the hearing
officer cannot fairly and objectively review the case. If such a finding is
made, the officer must remove that officer from the case, and the City Manager
or designated agent must assign another hearing officer. The hearing officer is
not a judicial officer but is a public officer as defined by M.S. § 609.415.
The hearing officer must not be an employee of the city. The City Manager or
designated agent must establish a procedure for evaluating the competency of
the hearing officers, including comments from citizens and city staff. These
reports must be provided to the City Council.
   (B)   Upon the hearing officer’s own initiative or upon written request of
an interested party demonstrating the need, the officer may issue a subpoena
for the attendance of a witness or the production of books, papers, records or
other documents that are material to the matter being heard. The party
requesting the subpoena is responsible for serving the subpoena in the manner
provided for civil actions and for paying the fees and expenses of any witness.
A person served with a subpoena may file an objection with the hearing officer
promptly but no later than the time specified in the subpoena for compliance.
The officer may cancel or modify the subpoena if it is unreasonable or
oppressive. A person who, without just cause, fails or refuses to attend and
testify or to produce the required documents in obedience to a subpoena is
guilty of a misdemeanor. Alternatively, the party requesting the subpoena may
seek an order from district court directing compliance.
   (C)   Notice of the hearing must be served in person or by mail on the
person responsible for the violation at least ten days in advance, unless a
shorter time is accepted by all parties. At the hearing, the parties will have
the opportunity to present testimony and question any witnesses, but strict
rules of evidence do not apply. The hearing officer must record the hearing and
receive testimony and exhibits. The officer must receive and give weight to
evidence, including reliable hearsay evidence, which possesses probative value
commonly accepted by reasonable and prudent people in the conduct of their
affairs.
   (D)   The hearing officer has the authority to determine that a violation
occurred, to dismiss a citation, to impose the scheduled fine, and to reduce,
stay, or waive a scheduled fine either unconditionally or upon compliance with
appropriate conditions. When imposing a penalty for a violation, the hearing
officer may consider any or all of the following factors:
      (1)   The duration of the violation;
      (2)   The frequency or recurrence of the violation;
      (3)   The seriousness of the violation;
      (4)   The history of the violation;
      (5)   The violator’s conduct after issuance of the notice of hearing;
      (6)   The good faith effort by the violator to comply;
      (7)   The economic impact of the penalty on the violator;
      (8)   The impact of the violation upon the community; and
      (9)   Any other factors appropriate to a just result.
   (E)   The hearing officer may exercise discretion to impose a fine for more
than one day of a continuing violation, but only upon a finding that the
violation caused a serious threat of harm to the public health, safety, or
welfare or that the accused intentionally and the unreasonably refused to
comply with the code requirement. The hearing officer’s decision and supporting
reasons must be in writing.
      (1)   The failure to pay the fine or request a hearing within seven days
after the citation, or the failure to attend the hearing, constitutes a waiver
of the violator’s rights to an administrative hearing and is an admission of
the violation. A hearing officer may waive this result upon good cause shown.
Examples of “good cause”: death or incapacitating illness of the accused; a
court order requiring the accused to appear for another hearing at the same
time; and lack of proper service of the citation or notice of the hearing.
“Good cause” does not include: forgetfulness and intentional delay.
      (2)   The decision of the hearing officer is final without any further
right of administrative appeal, except for matters subject to administrative
review under §
37.06. In a matter subject to administrative review under §
37.06, the hearing officer’s decision may be appealed to the City Council by
submitting a request in writing to the City Manager or designated agent within
seven days after the hearing officer’s decision.
   (F)   If a person who receives an administrative citation requests an
administrative hearing, the Administrative Enforcement Program Coordinator will
grant an automatic stay of the fine for one year if the following conditions
are met:
      (1)   No same or similar code violations have occurred at the property
within the previous 24 months.
      (2)   No code violations currently exist at the property as determined by
city staff.
      (3)   The code violation does not constitute an immediate health or
safety hazard.
      (4)   The responsible party agrees to allow city staff to enter all areas
of the property for which the administrative citation was issued for purposes

§ 71.02 UNREASONABLE ACCELERATION.
   (A)    UNREASONABLE ACCELERATION OF A MOTOR VEHICLE is hereby defined as
acceleration which unnecessarily breaks traction between a tire or tires and
the driving surface, thereby causing a prolonged squealing or screeching sound.
Prolonged squealing or screeching sound shall constitute prima facie evidence
of unreasonable acceleration.

§ 71.03 USE OF ENGINE OR TRANSMISSION BRAKING DEVICES.
   (A)   Findings. The City Council of the City of Brooklyn Park finds that the
use of engine or transmission braking devices or methods (a/k/a "jake braking"
or "dynamic braking") within the city limits creates unusual and excessive
noise that unreasonably disturbs and annoys residents. The prohibition of such
devices and methods is necessary to protect the health, safety and public
welfare.
   (B)   Prohibition. No person may slow a vehicle by a device, method or
practice known as engine braking or transmission braking, also referred to as
"jake braking" or "dynamic braking," whereby rapid downshifting of a vehicle's
engine or a compression release device is used in lieu of applying a vehicle's
wheel brakes, causing loud noises to emit from the vehicle's engine and exhaust
system. Such braking by any motor vehicle on any public highway, street,
parking lot or alley within the City of Brooklyn Park is declared to be a
public nuisance and is prohibited.
   (C)   Emergency vehicles. The foregoing provision does not apply to
emergency vehicles.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 90.01 DISPOSITION OF ABANDONED PROPERTY.
   (A)   Procedure. Except for vehicles impounded pursuant to §
90.18 of this Chapter, all property lawfully coming into possession of the city
will be disposed of as provided in this section which is adopted pursuant to
M.S. § 471.195, as it may be amended from time to time. Vehicles impounded
pursuant to §
90.18 of this Chapter will be disposed of according to the procedures of §§
90.15 et seq.
   (B)   Storage. The department of the city acquiring possession of the

inadequate, the department may arrange for storage at a privately-owned
facility.
   (C)   Claim by owner. The owner may claim the property by exhibiting
satisfactory proof of ownership and paying the city any storage or maintenance
costs incurred by it. A receipt for the property must be obtained upon release
to the owner.
   (D)   Sale. If the property remains unclaimed in the possession of the city
for 60 days, the property will be sold to the highest bidder at a public
auction conducted by the Chief of Police or Chief’s designee after two weeks’
published notice setting forth the time and place of the sale and the property
to be sold. If the auction is to be held by way of an on-line auction service
on the internet, an advertisement will be published in the city's designated
newspaper two weeks prior to sale with the internet address of the auction and
a general list of the property to be sold. The City of Brooklyn Park will also
advertise on the city's designated website with a link to the internet auction
service.
   (E)   Disposition of proceeds. The proceeds of the sale will be placed in
the general fund of the city. If the former owner makes application and
furnishes satisfactory proof of ownership within six months of the sale, the
former owner will be paid the proceeds of the sale of the property less the
costs of storage and the proportionate part of the cost of published notice and
other costs of the sale.

ABANDONED VEHICLES
§ 90.15 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   The presence of abandoned vehicles, junk vehicles, inoperable
vehicles, and abandoned property unlawfully kept on property in the city
constitutes a public health and safety hazard because they can harbor disease,
provide harborage and breeding places for vermin, and present physical dangers
to the well-being of children and other residents. The presence of these
vehicles and abandoned property constitutes a blight on the landscape and
therefore becomes a detriment to the environment and general welfare of the
residents. In many instances these vehicles and abandoned property are kept on
property by the owners of the property themselves, occupants, or by others with
the consent of the property owner. It is necessary to adopt regulations that
are more stringent than those contained in M.S. Ch. 168B for the removal of
these types of vehicles and abandoned property.
   (B)   M.S. Ch. 168B, and Minn. Rules Ch. 7035, as they may be amended from
time to time, are hereby adopted by reference. Sections
90.15 through
90.25 of this code are adopted under the authority of M.S. § 168B.09, Subd. 2,
as it may be amended from time to time. If any of these provisions are less
stringent that the provisions of M.S. Ch. 168B or Minn. Rules Ch. 7035, as it
may be amended from time to time, the statute or rule shall take precedence.

   (A)   Sale after 15 days. An impounded vehicle is eligible for disposal or
sale under §
90.23, 15 days after notice to the owner, if the vehicle is determined to be:
      (1)   A junk vehicle, except that it may have a valid, current
registration plate and still be eligible for disposal or sale under this
subdivision; or
      (2)   An abandoned vehicle.
   (B)   Sale after 45 days. An impounded vehicle is eligible for disposal or
sale under §
90.23, 45 days after notice to the owner, if the vehicle is determined to be an
unauthorized vehicle.
§ 90.20 NOTICE OF TAKING AND SALE.
   (A)   Contents; notice given within five days. When an impounded vehicle is
taken into custody, the city or impound lot operator taking it into custody
must give notice of the taking within five days. The notice must:
      (1)   Set forth the date and place of the taking; the year, make, model
and serial number of the impounded motor vehicle if the information can be
reasonably obtained; and the place where the vehicle is being held;
      (2)   Inform the owner and any lienholders of their right to reclaim the
vehicle under §
90.21; and
      (3)   State that failure of the owner or lienholders to exercise their
right to reclaim the vehicle and contents within the appropriate time allowed
under §
90.19 is deemed a waiver by them of all right, title and interest in the
vehicle and contents and a consent to the transfer of title to and disposal or
sale of the vehicle and contents pursuant to §
90.23.
   (B)   Notice by mail or publication. The notice must be sent by mail to the
registered owner, if any, of an impounded vehicle and to all readily
identifiable lienholders of record. The Department makes this information
available to impound lot operators for notification purposes. If it is
impossible to determine with reasonable certainty the identity and address of
the registered owner and all lienholders, the notice will be published once in
a newspaper of general circulation in the area where the motor vehicle was
towed from or abandoned. Published notices may be grouped together for
convenience and economy.
   (C)   Unauthorized vehicles; notice. If an unauthorized vehicle remains
unclaimed after 30 days from the date the notice was sent under division (B) of

applicable under §
90.19, after the date of the notice required by §
90.20.
   (B)   Lienholders. Nothing in this chapter is to be construed to impair any
lien of a garage keeper under the laws of this state, or the right of a
lienholder to foreclose. For the purposes of this section, GARAGE KEEPER is an
operator of a parking place or establishment, an operator of a motor vehicle
storage facility, or an operator of an establishment for the servicing, repair
or maintenance of motor vehicles.
§ 90.22 OPERATOR'S DEFICIENCY CLAIM; CONSENT TO SALE.
   (A)   Deficiency claim. The nonpublic impound lot operator has a deficiency

   (A)   Auction or sale.
      (1)   If an abandoned or unauthorized vehicle and contents taken into
custody by the city or any impound lot is not reclaimed under §
90.21, it may be disposed of or sold at auction or sale when eligible pursuant
to §§
90.20 and
90.21.
      (2)   The purchaser must be given a receipt in a form prescribed by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles which will be sufficient title to dispose of the
vehicle. The receipt must also entitle the purchaser to register the vehicle
and receive a certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and claims of
ownership. Before a vehicle is issued a new certificate of title, it must
receive a motor vehicle safety check.
   (B)   Unsold vehicles. Abandoned or junk vehicles not sold by the city or
public impound lots pursuant to division (A) of this section must be disposed
of in accordance with §
90.24.
   (C)   Sale proceeds; public entities. From the proceeds of a sale under this
section by the city or public impound lot of an abandoned or unauthorized motor
vehicle, the city will reimburse itself for the cost of towing, preserving and
storing the vehicle, and all administrative, notice and publication costs
incurred in handling the vehicle pursuant to this chapter. Any remainder from
the proceeds of a sale must be held for the owner of the vehicle or entitled
lienholder for 90 days and then must be deposited in the treasury of the city.
   (D)   Sale proceeds; nonpublic impound lots. The operator of a nonpublic
impound lot may retain any proceeds derived from a sale conducted under the
authority of division (A) of this section. The operator may retain all proceeds

suspected contraband or other items that likely would be subject to forfeiture
in a criminal trial must be turned over to the appropriate law enforcement
agency.
§ 90.24 DISPOSAL AUTHORITY.
   The city may contract with others or may utilize its own equipment and
personnel for the inventory of impounded motor vehicles and abandoned scrap
metal and may utilize its own equipment and personnel for the collection,
storage and transportation of these vehicles and abandoned scrap metal. The
city may utilize its own equipment and personnel only for the collection and
storage of not more than five abandoned or unauthorized vehicles without
advertising for or receiving bids in any 120-day period.
§ 90.25 CONTRACTS; REIMBURSEMENT BY MPCA.
   (A)   MPCA review and approval. If the city proposes to enter into a
contract with a person licensed by the MPCA pursuant to this section or a
contract pursuant to section §
90.24, the MPCA may review the proposed contract before it is entered into by
the city, to determine whether it conforms to the MPCA's plan for solid waste
management and is in compliance with MPCA rules. A contract that does so
conform may be approved by the MPCA and entered into by the city. Where a
contract has been approved, the MPCA may reimburse the city for the costs
incurred under the contract that have not been reimbursed under §
90.23. Except as otherwise provided in §
90.24, the MPCA shall not approve any contract that has been entered into
without prior notice to and request for bids from all persons duly licensed by
the MPCA to be a party to a disposal contract pursuant to M.S. § 116.07, as it
may be amended from time to time; does not provide for a full performance bond;
or does not provide for total collection and transportation of abandoned motor
vehicles, except that the MPCA may approve a contract covering solely
collection or transportation of abandoned motor vehicles where the MPCA
determines total collection and transportation to be impracticable and where
all other requirements herein have been met and the unit of government, after
proper notice and request for bids, has not received any bid for total
collection and transportation of abandoned motor vehicles.
   (B)    The city may perform work. If the city utilizes its own equipment and
personnel pursuant to its authority under §
90.24, and the use of the equipment and personnel conforms to the MPCA's plan
for solid waste management and is in compliance with MPCA rules, the city may
be reimbursed by the MPCA for reasonable costs incurred which are not
reimbursed under §
90.23.
   (C)   The city required to contract work. The MPCA may demand that the city
contract for the disposal of abandoned motor vehicles and other scrap metal
pursuant to the MPCA's plan for solid waste disposal. If the city fails to
contract within 180 days of the demand, the MPCA, through the Department of
Administration and on behalf of the city, may contract with any person duly
licensed by the MPCA for the disposal.

bears no identification which reasonably reveals its ownership, the Animal
Control Officer shall impound the animal in the pound for a period of at least
seven days. Immediately upon impounding an animal, reasonable efforts shall be
made to notify the owner and inform the owner of the animal's confinement and
the procedures for release of the animal to the owner. Any animal impounded,
with the exception of a potentially dangerous dog or dangerous dog or a dog
that has inflicted substantial or great bodily harm upon a person, may be
reclaimed by the owner within five days after such impoundment. Before the
owner shall be permitted to recover possession of the animal, the owner shall
pay the impound facility all required fees and costs of impoundment. An animal
that is not redeemed by its owner within five days after impounding may be
euthanized and disposed of in a sanitary manner by the Animal Control Officer.

§ 92.14 QUARANTINE.
   An animal that has bitten a person will immediately be euthanized, if
required to test for rabies as determined by state or county health agencies,
as recommended by the Center for Disease Control, or at the request of the
owner. An animal not euthanized under this section must be quarantined by a
responsible person designated by the Chief of Police, or by the owner, if all
other sections of this chapter are met, as approved by the Animal Control
Officer for a period of ten days and must be kept apart from other animals.
Upon completion of the ten-day requirement the animal must be examined by a
veterinarian, designated by this municipality, to determine if the animal has a
disease which may have been transmitted by such bite, such impound and
examination are the expense of the animal owner. Upon the expiration of the ten
days, if the required and satisfactory examination by a licensed veterinarian
occurs, the quarantine will be lifted. If during the course of the quarantine,
it is determined that the animal may be afflicted with an infectious disease,
the Animal Control Officer must take immediate action to determine conclusively
if such a disease is present in the animal, up to and including euthanasia and
testing of the animal. Any animal which has been bitten by a rabid animal must
be euthanized or impounded and kept in the same manner for a period of six
months; provided that if the animal, which has been bitten by a rabid animal,
has been vaccinated at least three weeks before such bite and within one year
of such bite and if it is again immediately vaccinated, then the animal must be
confined or impounded for a period of 40 days before it is released. This
section does not apply to a dog serving in the city’s Police Department as a
part of its canine patrol or to a dog that has inflicted substantial or great
bodily harm on a human being on public or private property without provocation,

as a dangerous dog. The owner must provide evidence that the dog's behavior has
changed due to the dog's age, neutering, environment, completion of obedience
training that includes modification of aggressive behavior, or other factors.
If Animal Control finds sufficient evidence that the dog's behavior has
changed, the city may rescind the dangerous dog classification. The owner of
the dog shall be notified in writing of the review results within ten business
days of receipt of the request.
   (E)   Seizure of dangerous dogs.  The city may seize any dangerous dog if

with notice of the dog's seizure. A dangerous dog seized under this section may
be reclaimed by the owner upon payment of impound and boarding fees and
presenting proof that all requirements of this section are being met. A
dangerous dog that is not reclaimed within seven days of the date of the notice
may be disposed of as provided in this section and the dog's owner shall be
responsible for any costs incurred in the confinement and disposal of the dog.
   (F)   Destruction of dangerous dogs.  The Chief of Police or the Chief of
Police's designee, after having been advised that a dog has inflicted
substantial or great bodily harm on a human being on public or private property
without provocation; inflicted multiple bites on a human on public or private
property without provocation; bit multiple human victims on public or private
property in the same attack without provocation; bit a human on public or
private property without provocation in an attack where more than one dog

      (2)   If the dog's owner requests a hearing for determination as to the
dangerous nature of the dog, the hearing shall be held before an impartial
hearing officer selected by the Chief of Police from a list of persons approved

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 96.01 ROUTING OF TRAFFIC.
   (A)   The permittee must provide all traffic control for the proposed work
and take appropriate measures to assure that during the performance of the
excavation work traffic conditions are maintained as nearly normal as
practicable at all times so as to cause as little inconvenience as possible to
the occupants of the abutting property and to the general public. The City
Engineer or other duly authorized employees may permit the closing of streets
to all traffic for a period of time prescribed in the permit if it is deemed
necessary. The permittee must route and control traffic including its own
vehicles. All traffic control must conform to the latest version of the
Minnesota Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MMUTCD) including all
appendices. Traffic control for work zones in the public right-of-way are
separated into three categories: short term, long term, and roadway closure.
   (B)   The following steps must be taken by the permittee for each category:
      (1)   Short term (less than 12 hours).
         (a)   Obtain an approved right-of-way permit;
         (b)   Use appropriate traffic control plan from Appendix B of MMUTCD;
         (c)   Notify the City Engineer upon the removal of traffic control
devices and completion of the work.
      (2)   Long term (12 hours or more).
         (a)   Submit and receive approval of a traffic control plan;
         (b)   Obtain an approved right-of-way permit;
         (c)   Notify the City Engineer at least one day in advance of the
implementation of the plan;
         (d)   Monitor and maintain the traffic control devices daily;
         (e)   Notify the City Engineer upon the removal of the traffic control
devices and completion of the work.
      (3)   Roadway closure.
         (a)   Submit and receive approval of a detour and traffic control
plan;
         (b)   Obtain an approved right-of-way permit;
         (c)   Post notification signs of roadway closure and notify police,
fire, emergency response, and other roadway users at least one week in advance
to the closing of any street;
         (d)   Notify the City Engineer at least two days in advance of the
implementation of the plan;
         (e)   Monitor and maintain the traffic control devices daily;
         (f)   Obtain all other state, county, or municipal permits required;
         (g)   In the case that there are no existing streets to utilize as a
detour route, the permittee must construct all detours at its expense and in a
manner approved by the City Engineer;
         (h)   Notify the City Engineer, police, fire, and emergency response
upon the removal of the traffic control devices and completion of the work.

Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 96.02 OBSTRUCTION AND IMPAIRMENT OF FIRE HYDRANTS AND FIRE-PROTECTION
EQUIPMENT.
   The excavation work must be performed and conducted so as not to interfere
or obstruct fire hydrants, Fire Department inlet connections or fire-protection
system control valves in a manner that would prevent such equipment or fire
hydrants from being immediately discernible. The Fire Department must not be
deterred or hindered from gaining immediate access to fire-protection equipment
or hydrants. Materials or obstructions must not be placed within 15 feet of
fire-protection equipment or hydrants.
('72 Code, § 650:17) (Am. Ord. 1995-779, passed 4-24-95)
Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 96.03 PROTECTION OF TRAFFIC, UTILITIES, PROPERTY, AND THE LIKE.
   (A)   Protection of traffic. The permittee must stockpile excavated
materials in a manner as to not encroach upon any streets, sidewalks,
trailways, or sight distances for intersections. If stockpiling interferes with
facilities as stated above, the permittee must employ the use of traffic
control devices as stated in §
96.01 of this chapter. Adequate planking for sidewalk and trailway pedestrian
crossings must be placed in a manner as approved by the City Engineer and OSHA
trench safety standards. If a sidewalk or trailway must be closed off, the
permittee must utilize traffic control devices to delineate the work zone and
show an alternate route. In the case that there are no existing facilities to
use as an alternate route, the permittee must construct a detour at its expense
and in a manner approved by the City Engineer.
   (B)   Removal and protection of utilities. The permittee must not interfere
with any existing utility without the written consent of the City Engineer and
the utility company or person owning the utility. If it becomes necessary to
remove an existing utility this must be done by its owner. No utility owned by
the city will be moved to accommodate the permittee unless the cost of such
work is borne by the permittee. The cost of moving privately owned utilities
must be similarly borne by the permittee unless it makes other arrangements
with the person owning the utility. The permittee must support and protect by
timbers or otherwise all pipes, conduits, poles, wires or other apparatus which
may be in any way affected by the excavation work and do everything necessary
to support, sustain and protect them under, over, along or across said work. In
case any of the pipes, conduits, poles, mires or apparatus should be damaged,
they must be repaired by the agency or person owning them and the expense of
such repairs will be charged to the permittee, and its bond will be liable
therefor. The permittee is responsible for any damage done to any public or
private property by reason of the breaking of any water pipes, sewer, gas pipe,
electric conduit or other utility and its bond is liable therefor. The
permittee must inform itself as to the existence and location of all
underground utilities by contacting the Gopher State One Call System or other
similar service as approved by the City Engineer and protect the same against
damage.
   (C)   Protection of adjoining property. The permittee must at all times and
at its own expense preserve and protect from injury any adjoining property by
providing proper foundations and taking other measures suitable for the
purpose. The permittee must, at its own expense shore up and protect all
buildings, walls, fences or other property likely to be damaged during the
progress of the excavation work and is responsible for all damage to public or
private property or highways resulting from its failure properly to protect and
carry out said work. Whenever it may be necessary for the permittee to trench
through any lawn area, the sod must be carefully cut and rolled and replaced
after ditches have been backfilled as required in this chapter. All
construction and maintenance work must be done in a manner calculated to leave
the lawn area clean of earth and debris and in a condition as equal to or
better to that which existed before such work began. The permittee must not
remove even temporarily any trees or shrubs which exist in parking strip areas
or easements across private property without first having notified and obtained
the consent of the property owner, or in the case of public property the
appropriate department or official having control of the property.
   (D)   Protective measures. The permittee must erect such fence, railing or
barriers about the site of the excavation work as will prevent danger to
persons using the city street or sidewalks, and such protective barriers must
be maintained until the work is completed or the danger removed. At twilight
there must be placed upon the place of excavation and upon any excavated
materials or structures or other obstructions to streets suitable and
sufficient lights which must be kept burning throughout the night during the
maintenance of the obstructions. It is unlawful for anyone to remove or tear
down the fence or railing or other protective barriers or any lights provided
there for the protection of the public.
('72 Code, §§ 650:18 - 650:24) (Am. Ord. 1995-779, passed 4-24- 95)
Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 96.04 ATTRACTIVE NUISANCE.
   It is unlawful for the permittee to suffer or permit to remain unguarded at
the place of excavation or opening any machinery, equipment or other device
having the characteristics of an attractive nuisance likely to attract children
and hazardous to their safety or health.
('72 Code, § 650:26) (Am. Ord. 1995-779, passed 4-24-95)
Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 96.05 CARE OF EXCAVATED MATERIAL.
   (A)   All material excavated from trenches and piled adjacent to the trench
or in any street must be piled and maintained in such manner as not to endanger
those working in the trench, pedestrians or users of the streets, and so that
as little inconvenience as possible is caused to those using streets and
adjoining property.
   (B)   Where the confines of the area being excavated are too narrow to
permit the piling of excavated material beside the trench, such might be the
case in a narrow alley, the City Engineer has the authority to require that the
permittee haul the excavated material to a storage site and then rehaul it to
the trench site at the time of backfilling. It is the permittee's
responsibility to secure the necessary permission and make all necessary
arrangements for all required storage and disposal sites.
('72 Code, § 650:28) (Am. Ord. 1995-779, passed 4-24-95)
Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 96.06 DAMAGE TO EXISTING IMPROVEMENTS.
   All damage done to existing improvements during the progress of the
excavation work must be repaired by the permittee. Materials for such repair
must conform with the requirements of any applicable code or ordinance. If upon
being ordered the permittee fails to furnish the necessary labor and materials
for such repairs, the City Engineer has the authority to cause the necessary
labor materials to be furnished by the city and the cost will be charged
against the permittee, and the permittee is also liable on its bond therefor.
('72 Code, § 650:30) (Am. Ord. 1995-779, passed 4-24-95)
Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 96.07 PROPERTY LINES AND EASEMENTS.
   Property lines and limits of easements must be indicated on the plan of
excavation submitted with the application for the excavation permit and it is
the permittee's responsibility to confine excavation work within these limits.

Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 96.08 CLEAN-UP.
   As the excavation work progresses all streets and private properties must be
thoroughly cleaned of all rubbish, excess earth, rock, and other debris
resulting from such work. All clean-up operations at the location of the
excavation must be accomplished at the expense of the permittee and must be
completed to the satisfaction of the City Engineer. From time to time as may be
ordered by the City Engineer and in any event immediately after completion of
the work, the permittee must at its own expense clean up and remove all refuse
and unused materials of any kind resulting from the work and upon failure to do
so within 24 hours after having been notified to do so by the City Engineer,
the work may be done by the City Engineer and the cost thereof charged to the
permittee and the permittee is also liable for the cost thereof under the
surety bond provided hereunder.

Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 96.09 PROTECTION OF WATER COURSES.
   The permittee must provide for the flow of all water courses, sewers or
drains intercepted during the excavation work and must replace the same in as
good condition as it found them or must make such provisions for them as the
City Engineer may direct. The permittee must not obstruct the gutter of any
street but must use all proper measures to provide for the free passage of
surface water. The permittee must make provision to take care of all surplus
water, muck, silt, slickings or other run-off pumped from excavations or
resulting from sluicing or other operations and must be responsible for any
damage resulting from its failure to so provide.
('72 Code, § 650:36) (Am. Ord. 1995-779, passed 4-24-95)
Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 96.10 BREAKING THROUGH PAVEMENT.
   (A)   Whenever it is necessary to break through existing pavement for
excavation purposes and where trenches are to be four feet or over in depth,
the pavement in the base must be removed to at least six inches beyond the
outer limits of the sub-grade that is to be disturbed in order to prevent
settlement, and a six-inch shoulder of undisturbed material must be provided in
each side of the excavated trench.
   (B)   The face of the remaining pavement must be approximately vertical. A
power-driven concrete saw must be used so as to permit complete breakage of
concrete pavement or base without rugged edges. Asphalt paving must be scored
or otherwise cut in a straight line. No pile driver may be used in breaking up
the pavement.

§ 96.12 BACKFILLING.
   Backfilling in any street opened or excavated pursuant to an excavation
permit issued hereunder must be compacted to a degree equivalent to the
requirements as outlined in the city's standard detail specifications for
excavation and restoration procedures. Compacting must be done by mechanical
tampers or vibrators as required by the soil in question and sound engineering
practices generally recognized in the construction industry.
('72 Code, § 650:42) (Am. Ord. 1995-779, passed 4-24-95)
Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 96.13 ROCK EXCAVATING AND BACKFILL MATERIAL.
   Whenever any excavation for the laying of pipe is made through rock, the
pipe must be laid six inches above the rock bottom of the trench and the space
under, around and six inches above the pipe must be backfilled with clean river
sand, non- corrosive soil or one-quarter inch minus gravel. Broken pavement,
large stones, and debris must not be used in the backfill. Use of frozen
backfill is prohibited, in any case.

Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 96.14 RESTORATION OF SURFACE.
   (A)   The permittee must restore the surface of all streets, broken into or
damaged as a result of the excavation work, to its original condition in
accordance with the specifications of the City Engineer. The permittee may be
required to place a temporary surface over openings made in paved traffic
lanes. Except when the pavement is to be replaced before the opening of the cut
to traffic, the fill above the bottom of the paving slab must be made with
suitable material well tamped into place and this fill must be topped with a
minimum of at least one inch of bituminous mixture which is suitable to
maintain the opening in good condition until permanent restoration can be made.
The crown of the temporary restoration must not exceed one inch above the
adjoining pavement. The permittee must exercise special care in making such
temporary restorations and must maintain the restorations in safe traveling
condition until such time as permanent restorations are made. The asphalt which
is used must be in accordance with the City Engineer specifications.
   (B)   Permanent restoration of the street must be made by the permittee in
strict accordance with the specifications prescribed by the City Engineer to
restore the street to its original and proper condition, or as near as may be.
   (C)   Acceptance or approval of any excavation work by the Engineer does not
prevent the city from asserting a claim against the permittee and/or its surety
under the surety bond required hereunder for incomplete or defective work if
discovered within 12 months from the completion of the excavation work. The
City Engineer's presence during the performance of any excavation work does not
relieve the permittee of its responsibilities hereunder.
('72 Code, § 650:52) (Am. Ord. 1995-779, passed 4-24-95)
Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 96.15 TRENCHES IN PIPE LAYING.
   Except by special permission from the City Engineer, no trench may be

   Permits for excavations will be issued in writing and the permit must be
kept on the site of the work while it is in progress in the custody of the
individual in charge, and must be exhibited upon request made by any city
official or police officer.
('72 Code, § 650:04) (Am. Ord. 1995-779, passed 4-24-95)
§ 96.43 FEE.
   Before a permit is issued, the applicant requesting the permit must pay a
fee in the amount set forth in the Appendix to this code to the city's cashier
for each location covered by the permit. Each transverse excavation and each
150 feet or portion thereof of longitudinal excavation is deemed a location.

§ 96.44 SURETY BOND.
   (A)   Before an excavation permit as herein provided is issued, the
applicant must deposit with the City Engineer a surety bond in the minimum
amount of $5,000 payable to the city.
   (B)   The required surety bond must:
      (1)   Be with good and sufficient surety;
      (2)   Be by a surety company authorized to transact business in the State
of Minnesota;
      (3)   Be dated and signed by an authorized officer of the principal and
by a representative of the surety (attorney-in- fact);
      (4)   Be conditioned upon the permittee's compliance with this chapter
and to secure and hold the city, its officials, and employees harmless against
any and all claims, damages, liabilities, losses, actions, suits, judgments, or
other costs arising from the excavation and other work covered by the
excavation permit or for which the city, Council or any city employee may be
made liable by reason of any accident or injury to persons or property through
the fault of the permittee either in not properly guarding the excavation or
for any other injury resulting from the negligence of the permittee, and
further conditioned to fill up, restore and place in good and safe condition as
near as may be to its original condition, and to the satisfaction of the City
Engineer or other duly authorized employee, all openings, and excavations made
in streets, and to maintain any street where excavation is made in as good
condition for the period of 12 months after the work is done, usual wear and
tear excepted as it was in before the work was done. Any settlement of the
surface within the one-year period is deemed conclusive evidence of defective
backfilling by the permittee. Nothing herein contained is construed to require
the permittee to maintain any repairs to pavement made by the city if such
repairs should prove defective. Recovery on such bond for any injury or
accident must not exhaust the bond but it must in its entirety cover any or all
future accidents or injuries during the excavation work for which it is given.
In the event of any suit or claim against the city by reason of the negligence
or default of the permittee, upon the city's giving written notice to the
permittee of such suit or claim, any final judgment against the city requiring
it to pay for such damage is conclusive upon the permittee and surety. An
annual bond may be given under this provision which must remain in force for
one year conditioned as above, in the amount specified above and in other
respects as specified above but applicable as to all excavation work in streets
by the principal in such bond during the term of one year from the date;
      (5)   Be described as a permit bond to carry on the business of
excavations within the public right-of-way or easements of the city for the
tapping, installation, modification, or construction of utilities, driveways,
or streets.
      (6)   Be identified with a reference or claim number;
      (7)   Identify the principal (contractor) and the surety company;
      (8)   Identify the principal and the surety company both as being bound
to the owner (city);
      (9)   Be an amount as specified on the permit. The dollar amounts should
be identified numerically in addition to being written out with words;
      (10)    Have a corporate seal which clearly identifies the surety
company;
      (11)    Pay all damages imposed upon it for violation of any federal or
state law, city or county ordinance, or conditions of any permit issued
thereunder;
      (12)    Indemnify any person who suffers a loss through violation by said
principal of any federal or state law, city or county ordinance, or conditions
of any permit issued thereunder;
      (13)    Guaranty to replace or perform again in a faithful and adequate
manner all work and materials not in accordance with the applicable federal or
state law, city or county ordinance, and permits;
      (14)    Indemnify any person for whose benefit the applicable federal or
state law, city or county ordinance specifically provides indemnification;
      (15)    Faithfully satisfy all judgements based on tort liability which

§ 97.01 PURPOSE.
   (A)   It is the purpose of this chapter to prohibit the uncontrolled growth
of vegetation, while permitting the planting and maintenance of landscaping or
garden treatments that add diversity and a richness to the quality of life.
There are reasonable expectations regarding the maintenance of vegetation
because vegetation that is not maintained may threaten public health, safety,
and order, and may decrease adjacent property values. It is also in the
public's interest to encourage diverse landscaping and garden treatments,
particularly those that restore native vegetation, which requires less moisture
and places a lower demand on the public's water resources.
   (B)   The city recognizes the value of a healthy urban forest to its
residence and visitors. Trees benefit the city's natural environment by
protecting against wind and water erosion, providing a natural buffer between
land uses, supplying shade and insulation that increases energy conservation,
and adding to the habitat for wildlife. Further, trees are a community asset.
They improve privacy, increase livability standards among residents, and add
value to property. The city works to enhance, preserve and protect the urban
forest within its boundaries by promoting and establishing the growth of new
trees, ensuring proper and adequate tree maintenance, and monitoring the
removal all public trees. The following sections provide regulations and
standards for the planting, maintenance and removal of shade trees within the
city.
   (C)   Further the Council may by ordinance declare any vertebrate or
invertebrate animal, plant pathogen, or plant in the community threatening to
cause significant damage to a shade tree or community forest, as defined by
M.S. § 89.001, to be a shade tree pest and prescribe control measures to
effectively eradicate, control, or manage the shade tree pest, including
necessary timelines for action. Such known diseases and pests currently include
Dutch Elm Disease, Oak Wilt, Emerald Ash Borer and Gypsy Moth. It is the intent
of this section to also include any yet unknown pests and to include them
immediately when identified by the Commissioner of Agriculture. It has further
been determined that the loss of elm, ash and oak trees growing upon private
and public property would substantially depreciate the value of property within
the city and impair the safety, good order, general welfare and convenience of
the public. It is declared to be the intention of the Council to control and
prevent the spread of these diseases and this section is enacted for that
purpose.

§ 97.20 WEED AND GRASS MAINTENANCE AND ELIMINATION; DUTY OF OWNER.
   (A)   In determining whether a violation of this chapter exists, the
following factors must be considered by the City Manager or designated agent:
      (1)   The weeds or grasses endanger the public health, safety, or welfare
including whether the weeds or grasses create a general aesthetic depreciation
of the neighborhood; or
      (2)   The weeds are noxious as defined herein.
   (B)   If a violation is declared, it is the duty of every owner of property
including property abutting any public street or alley to cause all grass and
weeds to be kept cut to the center of such platted street or alley, including
the public boulevard. If the grass or weeds in such a place are eight inches or
more in height it is prima facie evidence of a violation of this chapter.
   (C)   Exemptions. The following items are exempted from the grass and weed
requirements in this chapter:
      (1)   The portion of any privately or publicly-owned lot or tract of land
in the city that contains a ponding area, drainage way, or public water wholly

         (a)   The owner of the property described in (C)(1) may establish a
strip of vegetation between the normal water level and the high water level
along the ponding area, drainage way, or public water of not more than 20 feet.
This strip of vegetation may be allowed to grow to any height and will not be
declared a nuisance under this chapter. However, the owner of the property is
required to control or eradicate noxious weeds. No grasses or weeds below the
normal water level of the ponding area, drainage way or public water will be
declared a nuisance under this chapter.
      (2)   The portion of any privately or publicly-owned lot or tract of land
in the city that contains an area with side slopes of 25% or greater wholly or
partially within its legal boundary.
      (3)    Parks and natural areas owned by the city and rights-of-way owned
and maintained by the county and state.
      (4)   Any area established as a managed natural landscape:
         (a)   Managed natural landscapes may include plants and grasses eight
inches or more in height and which have gone to seed, but may not include any
weeds or noxious weeds and must be maintained so as to not include unintended
vegetation; and
         (b)   Managed natural landscapes may not include any plantings, which
due to location and manner of growth constitute a hazard to the public or may
cause injury or damage to persons or property when such growth is in violation
of other applicable sections of city code; and
         (c)   The area is established and maintained in accordance with
generally accepted practices; and
         (d)   Managed natural landscapes shall not include turf-grass lawns
left unattended for the purpose of returning to a natural state; and
         (e)   A buffer strip not less than three feet from side and rear
property lines must be maintained when a managed natural landscape covers more
than 25% of the landscaped area of the entire yard. A buffer strip is not,
however, required if:
            1.   A fully opaque fence at least four feet in height is installed
along the lot line adjoining the managed natural landscape area;
            2.   The adjacent property is not being used for residential
purposes; or
            3.   The adjacent residential property also contains a managed
natural landscape area covering more than 25% of the landscaped area of the
entire yard.
         (f)   That while a managed natural landscape is being established and
covers more than 25% of the landscaped area of the entire yard, a sign must be
posted on the property in a location likely to be seen by the public, advising
that a managed natural landscape is being established. The sign must be no
smaller than eight inches square and no larger than one foot square, displayed
no higher than three feet, and set back five feet from the property line. If
the managed natural landscape covers less than 25% of the landscaped area of
the entire yard a sign is not required.
      (5)   Pasture land that is currently being used for the exercise or
feeding of domestic hoofed animals and is surrounded by a permanent fence that
separates the pasture from property used for other purposes, is at least five
acres in size, and undeveloped with any habitable building.
      (6)   Vacant parcels of land larger than five acres in size, (undeveloped
with any habitable building) with a physical barrier to separate the vacant
land from developed adjacent properties. If a physical barrier does not exist,
a 15-foot transition strip of land on that property which is mowed or otherwise
maintained is required next to the developed adjacent properties. A 15-foot
transition strip must also be mowed and maintained along all public right-of-
ways, streets, trails and alleys.
      (7)   Platted lots located in subdivisions where 50% or less of the lots
have been developed provided:
         (a)   A 15-foot transition strip must be mowed and maintained along
all public right-of-ways, streets, trails and alleys.
         (b)   Vacant lots located adjacent to developed properties must comply
with this chapter.

   (A)   Public tree care. The city shall have the right to plant, prune,
maintain, and remove trees, plants, and shrubs within the public right-of-ways
and on public grounds as may be necessary to insure public safety or to
preserve or enhance the symmetry and beauty of such right-of-ways and public
grounds. This does not prohibit the planting of "street trees" by adjacent
property owners providing that the planting and maintenance of said trees is in
accordance with Operations & Maintenance Department Forestry and Public
Easement Maintenance Policies.
   (B)   Street tree selection. The official street tree species authorized for

§ 97.45 SHADE TREE DISEASE CONTROL, PREVENTION, PEST CONTROL AND ABATEMENT.
   (A)   Dutch Elm Disease. The City Tree Inspector shall inspect premises and
places within the designated Dutch Elm disease control area of the city as many
times as practical or necessary to determine whether the disease exists.
      (1)   Elm Trees. Dutch Elm infected trees shall be those trees that show
any stage of infection. Property owners with trees identified as infected with
Dutch Elm from March 10 through September 15 shall be made to remove these elm
trees within 20 days of the notification. Property owners issued notifications
on infected trees from September 15 through March 10, shall have elm trees
removed prior to April 1.
      (2)   Elm Wood. Dutch Elm infected wood, logs, or stumps shall be
disposed of by burning, chipping, or removal to an authorized disposal site or
if retained shall be debarked by April 1st. The stockpiling and storage of elm
logs with the bark intact shall only be allowed during the period of September
15 through April 1st.
   (B)   Oak Wilt. The City Tree Inspector shall inspect premises and places
within the designated Oak Wilt control area of the city as many times as
practical or necessary to determine whether any disease exists.
      (1)   Oak trees. All oak trees within the designated Oak Wilt control
area of the city diagnosed as having Oak Wilt should be isolated from
neighboring healthy oak trees of the same species by chemical or mechanical
disruption of common root systems to prevent root graft transmission of the Oak
Wilt fungus.
      (2)   To control overland spread of Oak Wilt, the pruning of oaks shall
be avoided during the most susceptible period of infection, from April 15 until
July 1. If wounding is unavoidable during this period, as in the aftermath of a
storm or when the tree interferes with utility lines, the person or entity
pruning shall immediately apply a non-toxic tree wound dressing.
         (a)   Red Oaks. To prevent the Oak Wilt fungus from producing spores
and to prevent overland spread of this fungus, any diseased material of the red
oak group that wilt in July and August of one year shall be removed from both
private and public property by April 1st of the following year.
            1.   Any branch greater than two inches in diameter of the red oak
group determined to be hazardous and not salvaged shall be disposed of by
burning, chipping, or removal to an authorized dump site prior to April 1st of
the year following the appearance of symptoms. Dead standing red oaks that have
advanced beyond the potential for spore production need not be removed except
where they constitute a hazard to life or property as determined by the City
Tree Inspector.
            2.   Stumps of trees of the red oak group removed due to Oak Wilt
shall be completely covered, removed or debarked to the ground line to
eliminate all possibilities of spore formation and overland disease spread.
         (b)   White Oaks. Trees of the white oak group (i.e. white oak, bur
oak, bicolor oak) diagnosed as having Oak Wilt should be isolated by root graft
disruption as stated in §
97.45(D) (Root Graft Disruption).
      (3)   Oak Wood. Any hazardous oak wood to be used as fuel wood or to be
salvaged for other purposes must be debarked or completely covered by heavy
plastic (4 mil or greater) from April 15 until July 1 of the year following the
appearance of symptoms. After July 1 the wood does not need to be covered.
   (C)   Diagnosis. Diseased shade trees shall be identified by generally
accepted field symptoms such as wilting, yellowing of leaves, and/or staining
of wood under bark. The Minnesota Department of Agriculture tree disease
laboratory or other laboratories capable of performing such services approved
by the Minnesota Commissioner of Agriculture shall do confirmation testing,
when determined to be necessary by the City Tree Inspector.
   (D)   Root graft disruption (barriers) at property boundaries. If the City
Tree Inspector finds that Dutch Elm disease or Oak Wilt threatens to cross
property boundaries or disease control area boundaries, the City Tree Inspector
may require root graft disruption to prevent the spread of disease. If plowing
or trenching is not possible due to terrain, location or buried utilities, the
City Tree Inspector may require alternate control measures. These control
measures will be in accordance with current technology and plans as may be
recommended by the Minnesota Department of Agriculture, Pesticide and Disease
Control, M.S. Chapter 1505. If, however, after the City Tree Inspector
identifies the location for the installation of a barrier or alternate control
measure, the City Tree Inspector further determines that the installation of
the barrier or alternate control measure is impossible because of the presence
of pavement or obstructions such as a septic system or other underground
utilities, the City Tree Inspector may mark for removal all oak trees whether
living or dead, infected or not and located between an infected tree and the
marked barrier location. These marked trees must be felled and disposed of no
later than May 1 of the year following inspection. The stump from such felled
trees must not extend more than three inches above the ground or, if taller,
must be completely debarked. Expenses related to the installation of such
barriers and/or the removal of these trees is at the expense of the property
owner.
      (1)   The charge, or any portion thereof, for any necessary root graft
barriers or other control measures may be assessed against the property on
which the root graft barriers or other control measures are placed.
      (2)   Because Oak Wilt is a community problem and because Oak Wilt
control may benefit an entire neighborhood, the City Tree Inspector will
require neighborhood participation, shall encourage cooperation, including cost

nuisance is being maintained or exists on a property, the City Manager must
give written notice through service by regular or certified mail, by posting a
notice on the property, or by personal delivery to the owner of or person in
control of the property on which the public nuisance is located. When the
property is occupied, service upon the occupant is deemed service upon the
owner. Where the property is unoccupied or abandoned, service may be by regular
or certified mail to the last known owner of record of the property or by
posting on the property. The notice must provide:

§ 99.07 PROHIBITING DISCHARGES INTO THE SANITARY SEWER SYSTEM.
   (A)   Water from any roof, surface, ground water sump pump, footing tile,
swimming pool, or other natural precipitation must not be discharged into the
sanitary sewer system. Dwellings and other buildings and structures which
require, because of infiltration or water into basements, crawl spaces, and the
like, a sump pump discharge system or other device intended to convey clear
water must have a permanently installed discharge line which must not at any
time discharge water into a sanitary sewer system. A permanent installation is
one which provides for year round discharge capability to either the outside of
the dwelling, building, or structure, or is connected to the city storm sewer
or discharges through the curb and gutter to the street. It consists of a rigid
discharge line without valving or quick connections for altering the path of
discharge, and if connected to the city storm sewer line, include a check valve
and an air gap located in a small diameter structure as shown in the city's
standard plates.

      (2)   If no assessment has been levied for such construction costs, that
proceedings for levying such assessment have been or will be commenced in due
course; or
      (3)   That the cost of construction for the public sewer system has been
paid by the developer or builder platting the lot or tract of land; this does
not include lots or tracts of land served by the public sewer system and which
were not a part of the plat or tract developed; or
      (4)   If no assessment has been levied, and no assessment proceedings
will be completed in due course, and the developer or builder of the lot or
tract has not paid the cost of improving the lot or tract of land, that the

paid, no such permit to connect to the public sewer system will be issued,
unless the applicant pays an additional connection fee which will be equal to
the portion of the cost of construction of the public sewer system which would
be assessable against the lot or tract to be served by the connection. The
assessable cost is to be determined by the City Engineer, upon the same basis
per front foot or lot unit as any assessment previously levied against other
property for the public sewer system, or if no such assessment has been levied,
upon the basis of the uniform charge per front foot or lot unit which may have
been or which will be charged for similar connections with the public sewer
system, determined on the basis of the total assessable cost of the main
allocated on a frontage or lot unit basis.

indirectly into the city sanitary sewer system and which discharges only normal
sewage into such system.
   (B)   Effective on the first day of February 1999 and on the first day of
each calendar year thereafter for all sewage produced in the billing quarter by
city sanitary sewer system users, sanitary sewer charges for each quarter year
are established by the resolution establishing fees and charges as set forth in
the Appendix to this code.
   (C)   Basis of rates and charges.
      (1)   The residential rates established are to provide sanitary sewer
charges based on a service charge plus a usage charge based on the amount of
water metered during the winter quarter or actual use if less. Customers may at
their written direction be allowed to use the water meter readings for each
quarter as a basis for calculating usage.
      (2)   All metered residential units (residential means single-family,
two-family, townhouses or any complex of housing units which have individual
sewer and water connections for each unit) include a service charge per quarter
plus the usage to the nearest measured unit times the usage charge rate. Non-
metered residential units are charged a flat service charge per quarter.
       (3)   Multi-family, industrial, commercial and institutional charges are
based on the water meter reading for each quarter.
      (4)   All metered commercial, multi-family, industrial and institutional
units are the service charge per quarter times the meter equivalent plus the
usage to the nearest measured unit times the usage charge rate. Non-metered
multi-family, commercial, institutional and industrial units are charged the
appropriate service charge per quarter based on the water meter size which
would be needed if the property were to be connected to the municipal water
system plus a reasonable estimate of the water consumed per quarter.
   (D)   Meters. The city will install water meters on non-metered residential
properties at the request of the property owner, for a charge for sanitary
sewer metering only, in an amount as established by the fee resolution set
forth in the Appendix to this code.

free from unnecessary encumbrances.
   (B)   This subchapter imposes reasonable regulation on the placement and
maintenance of facilities and equipment currently within the city's rights-of-
way or to be placed therein at some future time. It is intended to complement
the regulatory roles of state and federal agencies. Under this subchapter,
persons excavating and obstructing the rights-of-way will bear financial
responsibility for their work through the recovery of out-of-pocket and
projected costs from persons using the public rights-of-way.
   (C)   This subchapter shall be interpreted consistently with 1997 Session
Laws, Chapter 123, substantially codified in M.S. §§ 237.16, 237.162, 237.163,
237.79, 237.81, and 238.086 (the “Act”) and the other laws governing applicable
rights of the city and users of the right-of-way. This subchapter shall also be
interpreted consistent with Minn. Rules 7819.0050, et seq. where possible. To
the extent that any provision of this subchapter cannot be interpreted
consistently with the Minn. Rules, the interpretation most consistent with the
Act and other applicable statutory and case law is intended.

§ 102.28 PERMIT REQUIREMENT.
   (A)   Permit required. Except as otherwise provided in this code, no person
may obstruct or excavate any right-of-way without first having obtained the
appropriate right-of-way permit from the city to do so.
      (1)   An excavation permit is required by a registrant to excavate that
part of the right-of-way described in such permit and to hinder free and open
passage over the specified portion of the right-of-way by placing facilities
described therein, to the extent and for the duration specified therein.
      (2)   An obstruction permit is required by a registrant to hinder free
and open passage over the specified portion of the right-of-way by placing
equipment described therein on the right-of-way, to the extent and for the
duration specified therein. An obstruction permit is not required if a person
already possesses a valid excavation permit for the same project.
      (3)   A small wireless facility permit is required by a registrant to
erect or install a wireless support structure, to collocate a small wireless
facility, or to otherwise install a small wireless facility in the specified
portion of the right-of-way, to the extent specified therein, provided that

use, unless lawfully revoked.
      (4)   Other permits may be required for persons in accordance with
Chapter 96. (See §
102.25(C)).
      (5)   Permits for installation, repair or otherwise work on above-ground
facilities within the meaning of M.S. § 237.163, Subd. 6(b)(4) will be
obstruction permits, notwithstanding the need for excavation, provided the
excavation is augered or hand-dug for the purpose of placing a pole-type
structure.
   (B)   Permit extensions. No person may excavate or obstruct the right-of-way
beyond the date or dates specified in the permit unless (i) such person makes a
supplementary application for another right- of-way permit before the
expiration of the initial permit, or requests a verbal extension, and (ii) a
new permit or permit extension is granted. Verbal extensions may be granted by
the Director for a period no greater than 48 hours or for emergencies.
   (C)   Delay penalty. In accordance with Minn. Rule 7819.1000, Subp. 3, the
city shall establish and impose a delay penalty for unreasonable delays in
right-of-way excavation, obstruction, patching, or restoration. The delay
penalty shall be established from time to time by City Council resolution. A
delay penalty will not be imposed for delays due to force majeure, including
inclement weather, civil strife, acts of God, or other circumstances beyond the
control of the applicant.
   (D)   Permit display. Permits issued under this subchapter shall be
conspicuously displayed or otherwise available at all times at the indicated
work site and shall be available for inspection by the city.
   (E)   Routine maintenance not requiring excavation. Routine obstructions are
permitted without separate notice and separate compensation for such projects.

§ 102.30 ISSUANCE OF PERMIT; CONDITIONS.
   (A)   Permit issuance. If the applicant has satisfied the requirements of
this subchapter, the city shall issue a permit within five business days of
receiving a completed application.
   (B)   Conditions. The city may impose reasonable conditions upon the
issuance of the permit and the performance of the applicant thereunder to
protect the health, safety and welfare or when necessary to protect the right-
of-way and its current use.
      (1)   Small wireless facility conditions. In addition to division (B)
above, the erection or installation of a wireless support structure, the
collocation of a small wireless facility, or other installation of a small
wireless facility in the right-of-way, shall be subject to the following
conditions: A small wireless facility shall only be collocated on the
particular wireless support structure, under those attachment specifications,
and at the height indicated in the applicable permit application.
      (2)   No new wireless support structure installed within the right-of-way
shall exceed 50 feet in height without the city's written authorization,
provided that the city may impose a lower height limit in the applicable permit
to protect the public health, safety and welfare or to protect the right-of-way
and its current use, and further provided that a registrant may replace an
existing wireless support structure exceeding 50 feet in height with a
structure of the same height subject to such conditions or requirements as may
be imposed in the applicable permit.
      (3)   No wireless facility may extend more than ten feet above its
wireless support structure.
      (4)   Where an applicant proposes to install a new wireless support
structure in the right-of-way, the city may impose separation requirements
between such structure and any existing wireless support structure or other
facilities in and around the right-of-way.
      (5)   Where an applicant proposes collocation on a decorative wireless
support structure, sign or other structure not intended to support small
wireless facilities, the city may impose reasonable requirements to accommodate
the particular design, appearance or intended purpose of such structure.
      (6)   Where an applicant proposes to replace a wireless support
structure, the city may impose reasonable restocking, replacement, or
relocation requirements on the replacement of such structure.
   (C)   Notification. The permittee shall notify in writing in a form approved
by the Director all residents specified by the Director whose property is
adjacent to the right-of-way where the proposed work is to be done indicating
start and completion dates. Written notification is not required for routine
obstruction and maintenance projects described in §
102.28(E).
   (D)   Small wireless facility agreement. A small wireless facility shall
only be collocated on a small wireless support structure owned or controlled by
the city, or any other city asset in the right-of-way, after the applicant has
executed a standard small wireless facility collocation agreement with the
city. The standard collocation agreement may require payment of the following:
      (1)   Up to $150 per year for rent to collocate on the city structure;
      (2)   $25 per year for maintenance associated with the collocation;
      (3)   A monthly fee for electrical service as follows:

         (b)   $182 per radio node over 100 maximum watts; or
         (c)   The actual costs of electricity, if the actual cost exceed the
foregoing.
The standard collocation agreement shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of,
the required small wireless facility permit, provided, however, that the
applicant shall not be additionally required to obtain a license or franchise
in order to collocate. Issuance of a small wireless facility permit does not
supersede, alter or affect any then-existing agreement between the city and
applicant.
   (E)   Action on small wireless facility permit applications.
      (1)   Deadline for action. The city shall approve or deny a small
wireless facility permit application within 90 days after filing of such
application. The small wireless facility permit, and any associated building
permit application, shall be deemed approved if the city fails to approve or
deny the application within the review periods established in this section.
      (2)   Consolidated applications. An applicant may file a consolidated
small wireless facility permit application addressing the proposed collocation
of up to 15 small wireless facilities, or a greater number if agreed to by a
local government unit, provided that all small wireless facilities in the
application:
         (a)   Are located within a two-mile radius;
         (b)   Consist of substantially similar equipment; and
         (c)   Are to be placed on similar types of wireless support
structures.
In rendering a decision on a consolidated permit application, the city may
approve some small wireless facilities and deny others, but may not use denial
of one or more permits as a basis to deny all small wireless facilities in the
application.
      (3)   Tolling of deadline. The 90-day deadline for action on a small
wireless facility permit application may be tolled if:
         (a)   The city receives applications from one or more applicants
seeking approval of permits for more than 30 small wireless facilities within a
seven-day period. In such case, the city may extend the deadline for all such
applications by 30 days by informing the affected applicants in writing of such
extension.
         (b)   The applicant fails to submit all required documents or
information and the city provides written notice of incompleteness to the
applicant within 30 days of receipt the application. Upon submission of
additional documents or information, the city shall have ten days to notify the
applicant in writing of any still-missing information.
         (c)   The city and a small wireless facility applicant agree in
writing to toll the review period.

§ 102.32 RIGHT-OF-WAY PATCHING AND RESTORATION.
   (A)   Timing. The work to be done under the excavation permit, and the
patching and restoration of the right-of-way as required herein, must be
completed within the dates specified in the permit, increased by as many days
as work could not be done because of circumstances beyond the control of the
permittee or when work was prohibited as unseasonal or unreasonable under §
102.35.
   (B)   Patch and restoration. Permittee must patch its own work. The city may
choose either to have the permittee restore the surface and subgrading portions
of right-of-way or to restore the surface portion of right-of-way itself in
which the city will be reimbursed through the permittees bond. Patching must be
completed within 48 hours of the excavation within the street.
      (1)   Permittee restoration. If the permittee restores the right-of-way
itself, it shall at the time of application for an excavation permit post a
construction performance bond in accordance with the provisions of Minn. Rule
7819.3000.
      (2)   City restoration. If the city restores the surface portion of
right-of-way, permittee shall pay the costs thereof within 30 days of billing.
If, following such restoration, the pavement settles or otherwise fails for
reasons not caused by city's failure to properly restore, the permittee shall
pay to the city, within 30 days of billing, all costs associated with
correcting the defective work.
      (3)   Degradation fee in lieu of restoration. In lieu of right-of-way
restoration, a right-of-way user may elect to pay a degradation fee. However,
the right-of-way user shall remain responsible for replacing and compacting the
subgrade and aggregate-based material in the excavation and the degradation fee
shall not include the cost to accomplish these responsibilities.
   (C)   Standards. The permittee shall perform patching and restoration
according to the standards and with the materials specified by the city and
shall comply with Minn. Rule 7819.1100.
   (D)   Duty to correct defects. The permittee shall correct defects in
patching, or restoration performed by permittee or its agents. Upon
notification from the city, permittee shall correct all restoration work to the
extent necessary, using the method required by the city. Unless otherwise
agreed to by the Director, said work shall be completed within 14 calendar days
of receipt of the notice from the city, not including days during which work
cannot be done because of circumstances constituting force majeure or days when
work is prohibited as unseasonal or unreasonable under §
102.35.
   (E)   Failure to restore. If the permittee fails to restore the right-of-way
in the manner and to the condition required by the city, or fails to
satisfactorily and promptly complete all restoration required by the city, the
city shall notify the permittee in writing of the specific alleged failure or
failures and shall allow the permittee 48 hours from receipt of said written
notice to cure said failure or failures, unless otherwise extended by the
Director. In the event the permittee fails to cure, the city may at its option
perform the necessary work and permittee shall pay to the city, within 30 days
of billing, the cost of restoring the right-of-way. If permittee fails to pay
as required, the city may exercise its rights under the construction
performance bond.

excavate or obstruct the right-of-way at the same place and time.
   (B)   Shared fees. Registrants who apply for permits for the same
obstruction or excavation, which the city does not perform, may share in the
payment of the obstruction or excavation permit fee. In order to obtain a joint
permit, registrants must agree among themselves as to the portion each will pay
and indicate the same on their applications.
   (C)   With city projects. Registrants who join in a scheduled obstruction or
excavation performed by the city, whether or not it is a joint application by
two or more registrants or a single application, are not required to pay the
excavation or obstruction and degradation portions of the permit fee, but a
permit would still be required.

§ 102.34 SUPPLEMENTARY APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   Limitation on area. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the area
of the right-of-way specified in the permit. No permittee may do any work
outside the area specified in the permit, except as provided herein. Any
permittee which determines that an area greater than that specified in the
permit must be obstructed or excavated must before working in that greater area
(i) make application for a permit extension and pay any additional fees
required thereby, and (ii) be granted a new permit or permit extension.
   (B)   Limitation on dates. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the dates
specified in the permit. No permittee may begin its work before the permit
start date or, except as provided herein, continue working after the end date.
Except in the case of verbal extensions, if a permittee does not finish the
work by the permit end date, it must apply for a new permit for the additional
time it needs, and receive the new permit or an extension of the old permit
before working after the end date of the previous permit. This supplementary
application must be submitted before the permit end date.

§ 102.35 OTHER OBLIGATIONS.
   (A)   Compliance with other laws. Obtaining a right-of-way permit does not
relieve permittee of its duty to obtain all other necessary permits, licenses,
and authority and to pay all fees required by the city or other applicable
rule, law or regulation. A permittee shall comply with all requirements of
local, state and federal laws, including M.S. §§ 216D.01, et seq. (Gopher One
Call Excavation Notice System). A permittee shall perform all work in
conformance with all applicable codes and established rules and regulations,
and is responsible for all work done in the right-of-way pursuant to its
permit, regardless of who does the work.
   (B)   Prohibited work. Except in an emergency, or with the approval of the
city, no right-of-way obstruction or excavation may be done when seasonally
prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable for such work.
   (C)   Interference with right-of-way. A permittee shall not so obstruct a
right-of-way that the natural free and clear passage of water through the
gutters or other waterways shall be interfered with, unless otherwise approved
by the Director. Private vehicles of those doing work in the right-of-way may
not be parked within or next to a permit area, unless parked in conformance
with city parking regulations. The loading or unloading of trucks must be done
solely within the defined permit area unless specifically authorized by the
permit.
   (D)   Traffic control. A permittee shall implement traffic control measures
in the area of the work and shall use traffic control procedures in accordance
with the most recent manuals on uniform traffic control, traffic control
devices and traffic zone layouts published by the State of Minnesota, the city
may require a traffic control plan prior to issuance of a permit.

§ 102.38 INSPECTION.
   (A)   Site inspection. Permittee shall make the work site available to the
city and to all others as authorized by law for inspection at all reasonable
times during the execution of and upon completion of the work.
   (B)   Authority of director.
      (1)   At the time of inspection the Director may order the immediate
cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the life, health, safety
or well-being of the public.
      (2)   The Director may issue an order to the permittee to correct any
work that does not conform to the terms of the permit or other applicable
standards, conditions, or code. If the work failure is a “substantial breach”
within the meaning of M.S. § 237.163, Subd. 4(c), the order shall state that
failure to correct the violation will be cause for revocation of the permit
after a specified period determined by the Director. The permittee shall
present proof to the Director that the violation has been corrected within the
time period set forth by the Director in the order. Such proof shall be
provided no later than the next business day following the day of completion.
If such proof has not been presented within the required time, the Director may
revoke the permit pursuant to §
102.41.
(Ord. 2003-1005, passed 10-20-03; Am. Ord. 2017-1225, passed 12-4-17)
§ 102.39 WORK DONE WITHOUT A PERMIT.
   (A)   Emergency situations. Each registrant shall immediately notify the
Director of any event regarding its facilities that the registrant considers to
be an emergency. The registrant may proceed to take whatever actions are
necessary to respond to the emergency. Within two business days after the
occurrence of the emergency, unless the Director allows a longer time, the
registrant shall apply for the necessary permits, pay the fees associated
therewith and fulfill the rest of the requirements necessary to bring itself
into compliance with this subchapter for the actions it took in response to the
emergency. If the Director concludes that a registrant is required to perform
work at the facility solely because of an emergency created by another
registrant and the work is performed in the immediate area of the emergency
work, the Director may waive the permit otherwise required by the registrant(s)
called to the emergency created by another party. If the city becomes aware of
an emergency regarding a registrant's facilities, the city will contact the
registrant's emergency phone number as registered with the city or listed in
the phone directory. The city will make the area safe, as necessary. If there
is no response from the registrant, the city may take whatever action it deems
necessary to respond to the emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the
permittee or registrant whose facilities occasioned the emergency.
   (B)   Non-emergency situations. Except in an emergency, any person who,
without first having obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or excavates a
right-of-way must subsequently obtain a permit, pay an unauthorized work permit
fee in an amount established from time to time by the City Council, deposit
with the city the fees necessary to correct any damage to the right-of-way and
comply with all of the requirements of this subchapter.
(Ord. 2003-1005, passed 10-20-03; Am. Ord. 2017-1225, passed 12-4-17)
§ 102.40 SUPPLEMENTARY NOTIFICATION.
   If the obstruction or excavation of the right-of-way begins later or ends
sooner than the date given on the permit, permittee shall notify the city of
the accurate information as soon as this information is known.
(Ord. 2003-1005, passed 10-20-03; Am. Ord. 2017-1225, passed 12-4-17)
§ 102.41 REVOCATION OF PERMITS.
   (A)   Substantial breach. The city reserves its right to revoke any right-
of-way permit, without a fee refund, if there is a substantial breach of the
terms and conditions of any statute, ordinance, rule or regulation, or any
material condition of the permit. A substantial breach by permittee shall
include, but shall not be limited to, the following:
      (1)   The violation of any material provision of the right-of-way permit;
      (2)   An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the right-
of-way permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit
upon the city or its citizens;
      (3)   Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a
right-of-way permit;
      (4)   The failure to complete the work in a timely manner; unless a
permit extension is obtained or unless the failure to complete work is due to
reasons beyond the permittee's control; or
      (5)   The failure to correct, in a timely manner, work that does not
conform to a condition indicated on an order issued pursuant to § 120.30.
   (B)   Written notice of breach. If the city determines that the permittee
has committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any statute,
ordinance, rule, regulation or any condition of the permit the city shall make
a written demand upon the permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall
state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. A
substantial breach, as stated above, will allow the city to place additional or
revised conditions on the permit to mitigate and remedy the breach.
   (C)   Response to notice of breach. Within a time established by the
Director following permittee's receipt of notification of the breach, permittee
shall provide the city with a plan to cure the breach, acceptable to the city.
Permittee's failure to submit a timely and acceptable plan, or permittee's
failure to timely implement the approved plan, shall be cause for immediate
revocation of the permit.
   (D)   Reimbursement of city costs. If a permit is revoked, the permittee
shall also reimburse the city for the city's reasonable costs, including
restoration costs and the costs of collection and reasonable attorneys' fees
incurred in connection with such revocation.
(Ord. 2003-1005, passed 10-20-03; Am. Ord. 2017-1225, passed 12-4-17)
§ 102.42 MAPPING DATA.
   Each registrant and permittee shall provide mapping information in a form
required by the city in accordance with Minn. Rules 7819.4000 and 7819.4100.
(Ord. 2003-1005, passed 10-20-03; Am. Ord. 2017-1225, passed 12-4-17)
§ 102.43 UNDERGROUNDING.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to promote the health, safety
and general welfare of the public and is intended to foster (i) safe travel
over the right-of-way, (ii) non-travel related safety around homes and
buildings where overhead feeds are connected and (iii) orderly development in
the city. Location and relocation, installation and reinstallation of
facilities in the right-of-way or in or on other public ground must be made in
accordance with this section. This section is intended to be enforced
consistently with state and federal law regulating right-of-way users,
specifically including but not limited to M.S. §§ 161.45, 237.162, 237.163,
300.03, 222.37, 238.084 and 216B.36 and the Telecommunications Act of 1996, 47
U.S.C. § 253.
   (B)   Undergrounding of facilities. Facilities newly installed, constructed
or otherwise placed in the public right-of-way or in other public property held
in common for public use must be located and maintained underground pursuant to
the terms and conditions of this section and in accordance with applicable
construction standards, subject to the exceptions below. Above-ground
installation, construction, modification, or replacement of meters, gauges,
transformers, street lighting, pad mount switches, capacitor banks, re-closers
and service connection pedestals shall be allowed. The requirements of this
section shall apply equally outside of the corporate limits of the city
coincident with city jurisdiction of platting, subdivision regulation or
comprehensive planning as may now or in the future be allowed by law.
   (C)   Undergrounding of permanent replacement, relocated or reconstructed
facilities. If the city finds that one or more of the purposes set forth in
division (A) would be promoted, the city may require a permanent replacement,
relocation or reconstruction of a facility of more than 300 feet to be located,
and maintained underground, with due regard for seasonal working conditions.
For purposes of this section, reconstruction means any substantial repair of or
any improvement to existing facilities. Undergrounding may be required whether
a replacement, relocation or reconstruction is initiated by the right-of-way
user owning or operating the facilities, or by the city in connection with (1)
the present or future use by the city or other local government unit of the
right-of-way or other public ground for a public project, (2) the public health
or safety, or (3) the safety and convenience of travel over the right-of-way.
   (D)   Exceptions to undergrounding. The following exceptions to the strict
application of this section shall be allowed upon the conditions stated:
      (1)   Transmission lines. Above-ground installation, construction, or
placement of those facilities commonly referred to as “high voltage
transmission lines” shall be allowed unless the Council requires undergrounding
of the facilities after providing the right-of-way user notice and an
opportunity to be heard. This provision shall not be construed as waiving the
requirements of any other ordinance or regulation of the city as the same may
apply to any such proposed project.
      (2)   Technical/economic feasibility; promotion of policy. Above-ground
installation, construction, or placement of facilities shall be allowed in
residential, commercial and industrial areas where the Council, following
consideration and recommendation by the Planning Commission, finds that:
         (a)   Underground placement would place an undue financial burden upon
the landowner, ratepayers, or right-of-way user or would deprive the landowner
of the preservation and enjoyment of substantial property rights; or,
         (b)   Underground placement is impractical or not technically feasible
due to topographical, subsoil or other existing conditions which adversely
affect underground facilities placement; or
         (c)   The right-of-way user clearly and convincingly demonstrates that
none of the purposes under division (A) would be advanced by underground
placement of facilities on the project in question, or the city determines on
its own review that undergrounding is not warranted based on the circumstances
of the proposed undergrounding.
      (3)   Temporary service. Above-ground installation, construction, or
placement of temporary service lines shall only be allowed:
         (a)   During new construction of any project for a period not to
exceed 24 months;
         (b)   During an emergency in order to safeguard lives or property
within the city;
         (c)   For a period of not more than seven months when soil conditions
make excavation impractical.
   (E)   Developer responsibility. All owners, platters, or developers are
responsible for complying with the requirements of this section, and prior to
final approval of any plat or development plan, shall submit to the Director
written instruments from the appropriate right-of-way users showing that all
necessary arrangements with said users for installation of such facilities have
been made.
(Ord. 2003-1005, passed 10-20-03; Am. Ord. 2017-1225, passed 12-4-17)
§ 102.44 LOCATION AND RELOCATION OF FACILITIES.
   (A)   Placement, location, and relocation of facilities must comply with the
Act, with other applicable law, and with Minn. Rules 7819.3100, 7819.5000 and
7819.5100, to the extent the rules do not limit authority otherwise available
to cities.
      (1)   Relocation notification procedure. The Director shall notify the
utility owner at least three months in advance of the need to relocate existing
facilities so the owner can determine if relocation or replacement is required
and plan any required work. The Director shall provide a second notification to
the owner one month before the owner needs to begin the relocation. The utility
owner shall begin relocation of the facilities within one month of the second
notification. To the extent technically feasible, all utilities shall be
relocated within one month or in a time frame determined by the Director. The
Director may allow a different schedule if it does not interfere with the
city's project. The utility owner shall diligently work to relocate the
facilities within the above schedule.
      (2)   Delay to city project. The Director shall notify the utility owner
if the owner's progress will not meet the relocation schedule. If the owner
fails to meet the relocation schedule due to circumstances within the utility's
control, the city may charge the utility owner for all costs incurred by the
city because the relocation is not completed in the scheduled timeframe.
      (3)   Joint trenching. All facilities shall be placed in appropriate
portions of right-of-way so as to cause minimum conflict with other underground
facilities. When technically appropriate and no safety hazards are created, all
utilities shall be installed, constructed or placed within the same trench.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, gas and electric lines shall be placed in
conformance with Minn. Rules 7819.5100, Subd. 2, governing safety standards.
   (B)   Corridors. The city may assign a specific area within the right-of-
way, or any particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of
facilities that are or, pursuant to current technology, the city expects will
be located within the right-of-way. All excavation, obstruction, or other
permits issued by the city involving the installation or replacement of
facilities shall designate the proper corridor for the facilities at issue. A
typical crossing section of the location for utilities may be on file at the
Director's office. This section is not intended to establish “high density
corridors.” Any registrant who has facilities in the right- of-way in a
position at variance with the corridors established by the city may remain at
that location until the city requires facilities relocation to the corridor
pursuant to relocation authority granted under Minn. Rules 7819.3100 or other
applicable law.
   (C)   Limitation of space. To protect the public health, safety, and welfare
or when necessary to protect the right-of-way and its current use, the city
shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional
facilities within the right-of-way. In making such decisions, the city shall
strive to the extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users
of the right-of-way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the
public interest, the public's needs for the particular utility service, the
condition of the right-of-way, the time of year with respect to essential
utilities, the protection of existing facilities in the right-of-way, and
future city plans for public improvements and development projects which have
been determined to be in the public interest.
   (D)   Service laterals. All permits issued for the installation or repair of
service laterals, other than minor repairs as defined in Minn. Rules 7560.0150,
Subp. 2, shall require the permittee's use of appropriate means of establishing
the horizontal locations of installed service laterals and the service lateral
vertical locations in those cases where the director reasonably requires it.
Permittees or their subcontractors shall submit to the director evidence
satisfactory to the director of the installed service lateral locations.
Compliance with this subdivision and with applicable Gopher State One Call law
and Minnesota Rules governing service laterals installed after December 31,
2005 shall be a condition of any city approval necessary for:
      (1)   Payments to contractors working on a public improvement project
including those under M.S. Chapter 429; and
      (2)   City approval under development agreements or other subdivision or
site plan approval under M.S. Chapter 462. The director shall reasonably
determine the appropriate method of providing such information to the city.
Failure to provide prompt and accurate information on the service laterals
installed may result in the revocation of the permit issued for the work or
future permits to the offending permittee or its subcontractors.
(Ord. 2003-1005, passed 10-20-03; Am. Ord. 2017-1225, passed 12-4-17)
§ 102.45 PRE-EXCAVATION FACILITIES LOCATION.
   In addition to complying with the requirements of M.S. §§ 216D.01, et seq.
(One Call Excavation Notice System) before the start date of any right-of-way
excavation, each registrant who has facilities or equipment in the area to be
excavated shall be responsible to mark the horizontal placement of all said
facilities, to the extent technically feasible. To the extent its records
contain such information, each registrant shall provide information regarding
the approximate vertical location of their facilities to excavators upon
request. Nothing in this section is meant to limit the rights, duties and
obligations of the facility owners or excavators as set forth in M.S. §
216D.01, et seq.
(Ord. 2003-1005, passed 10-20-03; Am. Ord. 2017-1225, passed 12-4-17)
§ 102.46 INTERFERENCE BY OTHER FACILITIES.
   When the city does work in the right-of-way in its governmental right-of-way
management function and finds it necessary to maintain, support, or move a
registrant's facilities to carry out the work without damaging registrant's
facilities, the city shall notify the local representative as early as is
reasonably possible. The city costs associated therewith will be billed to that
registrant and must be paid within 30 days from the date of billing. Each
registrant shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any facilities in the
right-of-way which it or its facilities damages.
(Ord. 2003-1005, passed 10-20-03; Am. Ord. 2017-1225, passed 12-4-17)
§ 102.47 RIGHT-OF-WAY VACATION; RESERVATION OF RIGHT.
   If the city vacates a right-of-way that contains the facilities of a
registrant, the registrant's rights in the vacated right-of-way are governed by
Minn. Rules 7819.3200.
(Ord. 2003-1005, passed 10-20-03; Am. Ord. 2017-1225, passed 12-4-17)
§ 102.48 INDEMNIFICATION AND LIABILITY.
   By registering with the city, or by accepting a permit under this
subchapter, a registrant or permittee agrees to defend and indemnify the city
in accordance with the provisions of Minn. Rule 7819.1250.
(Ord. 2003-1005, passed 10-20-03; Am. Ord. 2017-1225, passed 12-4-17)
§ 102.49 ABANDONED FACILITIES.
   (A)   Discontinued operations. A registrant who has decided to discontinue
all or a portion of its operations in the city must provide information
satisfactory to the city that the registrant’s obligations for its facilities
in the right-of-way under this subchapter have been lawfully assumed by another
registrant.
   (B)   Removal. Any registrant who has abandoned facilities in any right-of-
way shall remove them from that right-of-way pursuant to Minn. Rule 7819.3300,
unless the requirement is waived by the Director.
(Ord. 2003-1005, passed 10-20-03; Am. Ord. 2017-1225, passed 12-4-17)
§ 102.50 APPEAL.
   A right-of-way user that: (1) has been denied registration; (2) has been
denied a permit; (3) has had permit revoked; or (4) believes that the fees
imposed are not in conformity with M.S. § 237.163, Subd. 6 may have the denial,
revocation, or fee imposition reviewed, upon written request, by the City
Council. The City Council shall act on a timely written request at its next
regularly scheduled meeting. A decision by the City Council affirming the
denial, revocation, or fee imposition will be in writing and supported by
written findings establishing the reasonableness of the decision.

that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical
integrity of the watercourse.
(Ord. 2017-1217, passed 7-10-17)
§ 104.10 INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES.
   Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES storm
water discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof
of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the City
Council prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4.
(Ord. 2017-1217, passed 7-10-17)
§ 104.11 MONITORING OF DISCHARGES.
   (A)   Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have storm
water discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction
activity.
   (B)   Access to facilities.
      (1)   The city or their designee shall be permitted to enter and inspect
facilities subject to regulation under this chapter as often as may be
necessary to determine compliance with this chapter. If a discharger has
security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance
before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary
arrangements to allow access to representatives of the city.
      (2)   Facility operators shall allow the city ready access to all parts
of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and
copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to
discharge storm water, and the performance of any additional duties as defined
by state and federal law.
      (3)   The city shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility
such devises as are necessary in the opinion of the city to conduct monitoring
and/or sampling of the facility's storm water discharge.
      (4)   The city has the right to require the discharger to install
monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devises used to measure
stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
      (5)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the city and shall not be replaced.
The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
      (6)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the city access to a permitted
facility are a violation of a storm water discharge permit and of this chapter.
A person who is the operator of the facility with a NPDES permit to discharge
storm water associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the
person denies the city reasonable access to the permitted facility for the
purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this chapter.
      (7)   If the city has been refused access to any part of the premises
from which stormwater is discharged, and the city is able to demonstrate
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or
that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection
and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any
order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and
welfare of the community, then the city may seek issuance of a search warrant
from any court of competent jurisdiction.

§ 104.12 BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.
   The city will adopt requirements identifying best management practices
(BMPs) of any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to
pollution or contamination of storm water, the storm drain system, or waters of
the U.S. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment
shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm
drain system or watercourses through the use of these structural and non-
structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premise,
which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to
implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and non-structural
BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate
storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES
permit authorizing the discharge of storm water associated with industrial
activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliant with the
provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a storm water pollution
prevention plan (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the
NPDES permit.
(Ord. 2017-1217, passed 7-10-17)
§ 104.13 NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS.
   Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of
materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants
discharging into storm water, the storm drain system, or water of the U.S. said
person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and
cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials
said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the
occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of non-
hazardous materials, said person shall notify the city in person or by phone or
facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by
phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the city
within three business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited
materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or
operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of
the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records
shall be retained for at least three years.
(Ord. 2017-1217, passed 7-10-17)
§ 104.14 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Notice of violation. 
      (1)   Whenever the city finds that a person has violated a prohibition or
failed to meet a requirement of this chapter, the city may order compliance by
written notice of violation to the responsible person. The notice of violation
shall contain:
         (a)   The name and address of the alleged violator;
         (b)   The address when available or a description of the building,
structure or land upon which the violation is occurring, or has occurred;
         (c)   A statement specifying the nature of the violation;
         (d)   A description of the remedial measures necessary to restore
compliance with this chapter in a time schedule for the completion of such
remedial action;
         (e)   A statement of the penalty or penalties that shall or may be
assessed against the person to whom the notice of violation is directed;
         (f)   A statement that the determination of violation may be appealed
to the city by filing a written notice of appeal within 15 days of service of
notice of violation; and
         (g)   A statement specifying that, should the violator fail to restore
compliance within the established time schedule, the work will be done by the
city or their designee and the expense thereof shall be charged to the
violator.
      (2)   Such notice may require without limitation:
         (a)   The performance of monitoring, analysis, and reporting;
         (b)   The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;
         (c)   That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease
and desist;
         (d) The abatement or remediation of storm water pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property;
         (e)   Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation costs;
         (f)   The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.

alternative compensatory action, such as storm drain stenciling, attendance at
compliance workshops, creek cleanup, etc.
   (C)   Suspension of MS4 access.
      (1)   Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The
city may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when
such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which
presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or
to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the United
States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an
emergency, the city may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or
minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United States, or to minimize
danger to persons.
      (2)   Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have their MS4 access
terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The
city will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The
violator may petition the city for reconsideration and a hearing. A person
commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated
pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the city.
   (D)   Criminal prosecution. Any person that has violated or continues to
violate this chapter shall be liable to criminal prosecution to the fullest
extent of the law, and shall be subject to a criminal penalty of $1,000 per
violation per day and/or imprisonment for a period of time not to exceed 90

of the decision of the municipal authority upholding the decision of the city,
then representatives of the city shall enter upon the subject private property
and are authorized to take any and all measures necessary to abate the
violation and/or restore the property. It shall be unlawful for any person,
owner, agent or person in possession of any premises to refuse to allow the
government agency or designated contractor to enter upon the premises for the

property owner may file a written protest objecting to the amount of the
assessment within 15 days. If the amount due is not paid within a timely manner
as determined by the decision of the municipal authority, the charges shall
become a special assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on
the property for the amount of the assessment. Any person violating any of the
provisions of this chapter shall become liable to the city by reason of such
violation.
(Ord. 2017-1217, passed 7-10-17)

for a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the person from
activities which would create further violations or compelling the person to
perform abatement or remediation of the violation.
(Ord. 2017-1217, passed 7-10-17)
§ 104.19 VIOLATIONS DEEMED A PUBLIC NUISANCE.
   In addition to the enforcement processes and penalties provided, any
condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of
this Chapter is a threat to public health, safety, and welfare, and is declared
and deemed a nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored at the
violator's expense, and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or otherwise compel
the cessation of such nuisance may be taken.

§ 107.01 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   The City Council of the city is enacting this chapter to help prevent
the spread of graffiti vandalism and to establish a program for the removal of
graffiti from public and private property.
   (B)   The Council finds that graffiti is a public nuisance and destructive
of the rights and values of property owners as well as the entire community.
Graffiti perpetrators are often associated with other criminal activities,
including violent crimes. Unless the city acts to remove graffiti from public
and private property, the graffiti tends to remain. Other properties then
become the target of graffiti and entire neighborhoods are affected and become
less desirable places in which to be, all to the detriment of the city.
   (C)   The City Council intends, through the adoption of this chapter, to
provide additional enforcement tools to protect public and private property
from acts of graffiti vandalism and defacement of public and private property.
The council does not intend for this chapter to conflict with any existing
anti-graffiti state laws or "criminal damage to property" laws.
(Ord. 2002-972, passed 5-13-02)
§ 107.02 DEFINITIONS.

§ 107.03 PROHIBITED ACTS.
   (A)   Defacement. It is unlawful for any person to apply graffiti to any
natural or man-made surface on any publicly owned property or, without the
permission of the owner or occupant, on any privately owned property.
   (B)   Possession of graffiti implements. Unless otherwise authorized by the
owner or occupant, it is unlawful for any person to possess any graffiti
implement while:
      (1)   Within 200 feet of any graffiti located in or on a public facility,

(Ord. 2002-972, passed 5-13-02)
Penalty, see § 107.99
§ 107.04 GRAFFITI AS NUISANCE.
   (A)   Declaration. The existence of graffiti on public or private property
in violation of this chapter is expressly declared to be a public nuisance and,
therefore, is subject to the removal and abatement provisions specified in this
chapter.
   (B)   Duty of property owner. It is the duty of both the owner of the
property to which the graffiti has been applied and any person who may be in
possession or who has the right to possess such property to at all times keep
the property clear of graffiti.
   (C)   Repeat violations. If a property is subject to three or more
occurrences of graffiti within a year, application of anti-graffiti material of
a type and nature that is acceptable to the city may be required for each of
the publicly viewable surfaces after notification by the city, or imposed
during improvements or construction activities to the site as determined by the
city.
(Ord. 2002-972, passed 5-13-02)
Penalty, see § 107.99
§ 107.05 REMOVAL OF GRAFFITI.
   (A)   By perpetrator. The city may require any person applying graffiti on
public or private property to either remove or pay for all costs for removal of
the graffiti within 24 hours after notice by the city or property owner. The
removal must be performed in a manner prescribed by the city, with materials
and colors compatible with existing surfaces, and to a comparable or improved
condition before the graffiti application as determined by the city. Where
graffiti is applied by a person under 18 years old, the parents or legal
guardian will also be responsible for such removal or for payment for the costs
of removal. Failure of any person to remove graffiti or pay for the removal
will constitute an additional violation of this chapter.
   (B)   By property owner or city. In lieu of the procedure set forth in
division (A), the city may order that the graffiti be removed by the property
owner or any person who may be in possession or who has the right to possess
such property, pursuant to the nuisance abatement procedure herein. Graffiti
removal and corrections must be performed with materials and colors compatible
with existing surfaces as determined by the city. If the property owner or
responsible party fails to remove offending graffiti within the time specified
by the city, the city may commence abatement and cost recovery proceedings for
the graffiti removal in accordance with this chapter.
(Ord. 2002-972, passed 5-13-02)
§ 107.06 ABATEMENT PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Abatement by city. If the owner, occupant, or other responsible party
does not comply with the notice within the time specified, the city may abate
the public nuisance.
   (B)   Notice and Hearing. The following notification must be conducted prior
to city abatement of the public nuisance. Whenever it is determined that a
public nuisance is being maintained or exists on a property, the Manager or
authorized designee must give ten day's written notice through service by mail,
by posting a notice on the property, or by personal delivery to the owner of or
person in control of the property on which the public nuisance is located. When
the property is occupied, service upon the occupant is deemed service upon the
owner. Where the property is unoccupied or abandoned, service may be by mail to
the last known owner of record of the property or by posting on the property.
The notice must state:
      (1)   A description of the public nuisance;
      (2)   That the public nuisance must be corrected within ten days of the
service of the notice;
      (3)   That if the public nuisance is not properly removed or corrected as
ordered, the public nuisance will be abated by the city and the costs of
abatement will be specially assessed to the property taxes;
      (4)   That the owner of or person in control of the property on which the
public nuisance is located may in writing request a hearing before the City
Manager or authorized designee.
   (C)   Hearing, action. If a hearing is requested during the ten-day period,
the City Manager or authorized designee must promptly schedule the hearing, and
no further action on the abatement of the public nuisance may be taken until
the manager's decision is rendered. At the conclusion of the scheduled hearing,
the manager or authorized designee may cancel the notice to remove or correct
the public nuisance, modify the notice, or affirm the notice to remove or
correct the public nuisance. If the notice is modified or affirmed, the public
nuisance must be disposed of in accordance with the city's written order.
   (D)   Summary abatement. The enforcing officer may provide for abating a
public nuisance without following the procedure required in division (B) when:
      (1)   There is an immediate threat to the public health or safety;
      (2)   There is an immediate threat of serious property damage;
      (3)   A public nuisance has been caused by private parties on public
property; or
      (4)   Any other condition exists that violates state or local law and
that is a public health or safety hazard.
   A reasonable attempt must be made to notify the owner, occupant, or other
responsible party of the intended action and the right to appeal the abatement
and cost recovery at the next regularly scheduled City Council meeting.
   (E)   Cost recovery. The owner of property on which a nuisance has been
abated by the city, or a person who has caused a public nuisance on property
not owned by that person, is personally liable to the city for the cost of the
abatement, including administrative costs. As soon as the work has been
completed and the cost determined, an appropriate official will prepare a bill
for the cost and mail it to the owner or other responsible party. The amount is
immediately due and payable to the city.
   (F)   Assessment. If the cost, or any portion of it, has not been paid
within 30 days after the date of the bill, the council may certify the unpaid
cost against the property to which the cost is attributable in accordance with
the process set forth in §
94.07 of this Code.
(Ord. 2002-972, passed 5-13-02)
§ 107.99 PENALTIES.
   (A)   Any violation of this section is a misdemeanor, punishable in
accordance with state law.
   (B)   Any violation of this chapter may be subject to civil penalties in
accordance with
Chapter 37 of the city code.
   (C)   This chapter is not intended to prohibit a private property owner from
seeking additional penalties or remedies.

CHAPTER 108: STORM SEWER UTILITY
Section

108.02   Findings and purpose
   
108.03   System established
   
108.04   Rates and charges
   
108.05   Use of revenues
§ 108.01 STATUTORY AUTHORITY.
   M.S. § 444.075 ("the Act"), authorizes cities to impose just and reasonable
charges for the use and availability of storm sewer facilities ("charges"). By
this chapter, the city elects to exercise such authority.
(Ord. 2002-981, passed 11-25-02)
§ 108.02 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
   In providing for such charges, the following findings and determinations are
made:
   (A)   In the exercise of its governmental authority and in order to promote
the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare, the city has
constructed, operated and maintained a storm sewer system (the "system"). This
chapter is adopted in the further exercise of such authority.
   (B)   The system, as constructed, heretofore has been financed and paid for
through the imposition of special assessments and ad valorem taxes. Such
financing methods were appropriate to the circumstances at the time they were
used. It is now necessary and desirable to provide an alternative method of
recovering some or all of the future costs of operating, maintaining and
improving the system through the imposition of charges as provided in this
section.
   (C)   In imposing charges, it is necessary to establish a methodology that
undertakes to make them just and equitable. Taking into account the status of
completion of the system, past methods of recovering system costs, and other
relevant factors, it is determined that it would be just and equitable to
assign responsibility for some or all of the future costs of operating,
maintaining and improving the system on the basis of the expected storm water
runoff from the various parcels of land within the city.
   (D)   Assigning costs and making charges based upon expected typical storm
sewer runoff cannot be done with mathematical precision but can only be
accomplished within reasonable and practical limits based upon use.
(Ord. 2002-981, passed 11-25-02)
§ 108.03 SYSTEM ESTABLISHED
   A city storm sewer system is hereby established. The system consists of all
storm sewer conduits, manholes and catch basins, ditches and ponds within the
public right-of-way and storm sewer conduits, manholes and catch basins in
public purpose easements as of January 1, 2003, and any additional storm sewer
facilities acquired by the city in the future.
(Ord. 2002-981, passed 11-25-02)
§ 108.04 RATES AND CHARGES.
   (A)   Land use rate calculation. Rates and charges for the use and
availability of the system are to be determined through the use of a
"residential equivalent factor" which is defined as the ratio of the average
volume of surface water runoff coming from one acre of land subjected to a
particular use, to the average volume of runoff coming from one acre of land
subject to typical single-family residential use within the city during a
standard rainfall event. All developed single-family parcels shall be
considered to have an acreage of one-third acre per unit. Calculations for
stormwater utility rates for various land uses are based upon their residential
equivalent factor (REF). The REF values for various land uses are as follows:
 
Land Use Class                              REF
Single Family Residential                   1.00
Townhouse/Two-Family Residential            1.20
Multi-Family Residential (Four-plex and up) 1.30
Business                                    2.10
Industrial                                  2.40
School/Church                               1.00
 
   (B)   Calculation of fees. The service charge to be billed each billing unit
shall be a fair and equitable share of the total costs of the system. Further,
service charges shall be apportioned to similar land uses of property
similarly. From time to time the City Council shall adopt a resolution
establishing a class charge rate calculation table for all billing units. These
quarterly charges shall be listed in the City Code Appendix fee resolution
table.
   (C)   Other land uses. Other land uses not listed in the City Code Appendix
class charge rate calculation table are to be classified by the City Manager or
authorized designee, by assigning them to the classes most nearly like the
listed uses, from the standpoint of probable hydrologic response. Appeals from
the City Manager or authorized designee's determination of the proper
classifications may be made to the City Council in the same manner as other
appeals from administrative determinations.
   (D)   Adjustment of charges. The City Council may by resolution, from time
to time, adopt policies providing for the adjustment of charges for parcels or
grounds of parcels, based upon data supplied by affected property owners,
demonstrating an actual runoff volume substantially different from the
calculation being used for the class of parcel or parcels. The adjustment may
be made only after receiving the recommendation of the City Manager or
authorized designee and may not be made effective retroactively. If the
adjustment would have the effect of changing the calculation for all or
substantially all of the land uses in a particular classification, however,
such adjustment must be accomplished by amending the class charge rate
calculation table found within the City Code Appendix.
   (E)   Excluded lands. A charge for system availability of service will not
be made against land which is either (i) public streets right-of-way, or
railroad road right-of-way or (ii) vacant and unimproved, or fallow, with
substantially all of its surface having vegetation as ground cover, and (iii)
city owned land.
   (G)   Supplying information. The owner, occupant or person in charge of any
premises must supply the city with such information as the city may reasonably
request related to the use, development and area of the premises. Willful
failure to provide such information or to falsify it is a violation of this
subsection.
   (H)   Estimated charges. If the owner, occupant or person in charge of any
premises fails or refuses to provide the information requested, as provided
above, the charge for such premises must be estimated and billed in accordance
with such estimate, based upon information then available to the city.
   (I)   Billings and collections. Storm sewer service charges shall be placed
on the utility accounts of property for the use and availability of the system
and are payable quarterly in accordance with usual and customary practices in
rendering of water and sanitary sewer bills.
   (J)   Penalties and remedies for delinquency or default in paying billings.
Penalties and remedies for late payments or non-payment of billings are the
same as those applicable to billings rendered for water and sanitary sewer
service. In the event a bill becomes delinquent, the City Council may cause the
delinquent charges to become a lien against the property served by certifying
to the Hennepin County Taxpayers Services Division the amount of such
delinquent bill in accordance with the Act.
(Ord. 2002-981, passed 11-25-02)
§ 108.05 USE OF REVENUES
   Revenues received from charges are to be placed in a separate storm sewer
utility enterprise fund and used to pay the normal, reasonable and current
costs of operating, maintaining, and improving water quality within the system.
Revenues from time to time received in excess of such costs may be used to
finance improvements to and betterments of the storm sewer utility and other
utility enterprise funds.

109.03   Rates and charges
109.01   STATUTORY AUTHORITY.
   M.S. Chapter 429 ("the Act"), authorizes cities to impose charges for the
operation of a street/signal lighting system. By this chapter, the city elects
to exercise such authority.
(Ord. 2002-983, passed 11-25-02)
109.02   SYSTEM ESTABLISHED.
   A city street/signal lighting system is established. The system consists of
all street lighting facilities, whether owned by the city or other, for which
the city purchases and supplies electrical energy. A street/signal lighting
service district is hereby established. The district includes all property
within the city.
(Ord. 2002-983, passed 11-25-02)
109.03 RATES AND CHARGES:
   (A)   Billing unit. Service charges for parcels of land shall be based on
land use. The billing unit for residential parcels zoned or used as residential
shall be a dwelling unit; single-family residential unit or townhouse/two
family residential unit or multi-family residential unit. The billing unit for
parcels zoned or used as other zoning classifications shall be street front
lineal foot.
   (B)   Calculation of fees. The service charge to be billed each billing unit
shall be a fair and equitable share of the total costs of the system. Further,
service charges shall be apportioned to similar classes of property similarly.
From time to time the City Council shall adopt a resolution establishing a
class charge rate calculation table for all billing units. These quarterly
charges shall be listed in the City Code Appendix fee resolution table.
   (C)   Billings and collections. Street/signal lighting service charges shall
be placed on the utility accounts of all property and are payable quarterly in
accordance with usual and customary practices in rendering of water and
sanitary sewer bills.
   (D)   Adjustment of charges. If an owner or person responsible for paying
the street/signal lighting service charge questions the correctness of such a
charge, such person may have the determination of the charge reviewed by
written request to the City Manager. Such request shall be made within 30 days
of the mailing of the bill in question. The City Manager shall have the
authority to recompute the charge.
   (E)   Penalties and remedies for delinquency or default in paying billings.
Any street/signal lighting service charges in excess of 90 days past due on
October 1 of any year may be certified to the Hennepin County Taxpayer Services
Manager for collection with real estate taxes as a special assessment. An
administrative charge of $25 shall be added to each street/signal lighting
service charge so certified. In addition, the city may bring a civil action or
to take other legal remedies to collect unpaid charges.

§ 110.05 PROCEDURE FOR ISSUANCE OF LICENSES.
   (A)   On receipt of an application for a license the City Manager or
Manager's designee must transmit the same together with license bond and copy
of receipt for license fee to the Chief of Police or other department
responsible therefor, who must cause investigation to be made of the
qualifications of the applicant and the City Manager or Manager's designee must
determine: (1) whether the premises where the licensed activity is located is
in compliance with all laws, ordinances and regulations applicable to the
property; and (2) whether the applicant has complied with all requirements of
the ordinance under which the license is to be issued and which requirements
are prerequisites to the issuance of the license. For purposes of this section,
the term PREMISES means the address of the location where the licensed activity
takes place. Unless the subdivision of the ordinance pursuant to which the
license is to be issued requires issuance of the license by the Council, the
City Manager or Manager's designee shall issue the license upon determination
that the prerequisites have been complied with, but if the City Manager or
Manager's designee shall have determined that the prerequisites have not been
complied with the City Manager or Manager's designee shall deny the application
for issuance of the license. If any ordinance requires issuance of a license by
the Council, the application must be referred, together with a report of the
investigation and determination with respect to the applicant and the
applicant's compliance with the requirements of the ordinance, to the Council.
The Council must thereupon consider the report and findings and may grant or
deny the license. The applicant for any license which has been denied by the
City Manager or Manager's designee may appeal the decision of the City Manager
or Manager's designee to the Council by filing, with the City Manager or
Manager's designee, within ten days after receipt of notice of the denial, a
request for review by the Council of such determination by the City Manager or
Manager's designee. The City Manager or Manager's designee shall thereupon
refer the request to the Council at its next regular meeting, at which time the
Council shall hear the applicant and review the determination of the City
Manager or Manager's designee and may grant or deny the license.
   (B)   Upon determination of the Council that a license is to be issued the
determination must be transmitted to the City Manager or Manager's designee who
shall issue the license certificate in duplicate under the municipal corporate
seal and deliver one copy to the applicant and retain the other in the license
book as a part of the official records.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 112.001 LIABILITY INSURANCE FOR SELLERS OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR, 3.2 PERCENT
MALT LIQUOR AND WINE.
   (A)   Every person licensed to sell at retail intoxicating liquor, 3.2
percent malt liquor or wine at on-sale in the city must, after March 1, 1983,
demonstrate proof of financial responsibility with regard to liability imposed
by M.S. § 340A.409, to the City Clerk or the City Clerk’s designee and to the
Commissioner of Public Safety as a condition of the issuance or renewal of the
person's license.
   (B)   Proof of financial responsibility may be given by filing:
      (1)   (a)   A certificate that there is in effect an insurance policy or
pool providing the following minimum coverages:
            1.   $50,000 because of bodily injury to any one person in any one
occurrence, and, subject to the limit for one person, in the amount of $100,000
because of bodily injury to two or more persons in any one occurrence and in
the amount of $10,000 because of injury to or destruction of property of others
in any one occurrence. Hotels and motels having 200 rooms or more are required
to have minimum coverage of $500,000 because of bodily injury for one or more
persons.
            2.   $50,000 for loss of means of support of any one person, any
one occurrence, and, subject to the limit for one person, $100,000 for loss of
means of support of two or more persons in any one occurrence. Hotels and
motels having 200 or more are required to have minimum coverage of $500,000
because of bodily injury for one or more persons.
            3.   The certificate must provide that no payment of any claim by
the insurance company shall in any manner decrease the coverage provided for in
respect to any other claim or claims brought against the insured or company
thereafter.
         (b)   A bond of a surety company with minimum coverages as provided in
subsection (a); or
         (c)   A certificate of the State Treasurer that the licensee has
deposited with the State Treasurer $100,000 in cash or securities which may be
purchased by savings banks or for trust funds having a market value of
$100,000.
      (2)   The licensee must provide the certificate and proof to the City
Clerk or designee at the time of application for a new license or renewal of
the existing license. The certificate of insurance must show that all coverages
meet or exceed the requirements of M.S. § 340A.409 and that the insurance
company cannot cancel the insurance until at least ten days written notice of
the cancellation has been served upon the city. If a new certificate of
insurance is not filed with the City Clerk during the ten day period after
notice of cancellation, the license to sell at retail intoxicating, 3.2 percent
malt liquor or wine is to be suspended until a new certificate of insurance is
filed with the City Clerk and the Minnesota Commissioner of Public Safety.
      (3)   The City Clerk is authorized to waive the foregoing insurance
requirements for 3.2 percent malt liquor and wine licenses if the licensee
files an affidavit from a certified public accountant to show that sales are
less than the amounts set forth in M.S. § 340A.409, Subd. 4. The licensee must
also file a written commitment with the City Clerk or designee that if sales
exceed such amounts, the licensee will not continue to sell 3.2 percent malt
liquor or wine until the licensee has filed a certificate of insurance meeting
the requirements set forth in this section.
('72 Code, §825:00) (Ord. 1983-420(A), passed 5-9-83; Am. Ord. 1986-535(A),
passed 7-28-86; Am. Ord. 1997-841, passed 3-24-97; Am. Ord. 2005-1052, passed

§ 112.002 INSPECTION OF PREMISES.
   The applicant must at all times permit the health officers and
representatives of the Police and Fire Departments to inspect and examine the
place of business described in the application, together with all appliances,
instruments or equipment used or to be used in the conduct of the business for
which the license is sought, and any refusal on the part of the applicant to
permit such inspection or any false statement in the application is sufficient
ground for the refusal to issue such license or to revoke the same after
issuance thereof.
('72 Code, § 810:50)
§ 112.003 MAINTENANCE OF ORDER AND CONDUCT ON LICENSED PREMISES.
   (A)   The City Council finds that the serving and consumption of alcoholic
beverages in any establishment holding an on-sale intoxicating liquor license,
an on-sale wine license, or an on-sale 3.2 percent malt liquor license can
contribute to increased acts of disorderly conduct. These acts of disorderly
conduct result in a greater demand on city services, negatively impact the
livability of the city, and have an adverse impact on the health, safety and
welfare of city residents. The City Council further finds that the holders of
on-sale intoxicating liquor licenses and on-sale 3.2 percent malt liquor
licenses need to be responsible for managing their establishments in a manner
that does not contribute to acts of disorderly conduct by their customers,
employees, or agents. For the purposes of this chapter, the term ESTABLISHMENT
means the licensed premises and all portions of the property where the licensed
premises is located, and the term LICENSEE means the holder of an on-sale
intoxicating liquor license or the holder of an on-sale 3.2 percent malt liquor
license.
   (B)   Maintenance of order. Each licensee must comply with the following
provisions.
      (1)   A licensee is responsible for the conduct at its establishment and
the conditions of sobriety and order of all persons at the establishment. The
act of any employee or agent of the licensee is deemed to be the act of the
licensee, and the licensee is liable for all penalties set forth in this
chapter or state law equally with the employee. The licensee is deemed to have
knowledge of any acts of disorderly conduct identified in this section
occurring at the establishment.
      (2)   No licensee or any other person shall sell, give, barter, furnish
or dispose of in any manner, directly or indirectly, any alcoholic beverage or
3.2 percent malt liquor, in any quantity, for any purpose whatsoever, to any
obviously intoxicated person. An obviously intoxicated person shall not be
allowed to enter a licensed premise. For purposes of this section, OBVIOUSLY
INTOXICATED PERSON means a person who is presently impaired, mentally,
physically, or emotionally, as a result of the presence of alcohol in the
person's body and such impairment is obvious to a reasonable person. Evidence
of an obviously intoxicated person includes, but is not limited to, the odor of
intoxicants on the person's breath, bloodshot eyes, dilated pupils, stumbling,
staggering, slurred speech, or other symptom commonly associated with
intoxication.
      (3)   A licensee must require that all of its employees or agents who
serve alcoholic beverages or who provide security at the establishment
successfully complete an annual program of server and security training. Such
program of server and security training must be approved by the Brooklyn Park
Police Department. A licensee must annually submit proof to the Brooklyn Park
Police Department that an approved program was successfully completed by each
employee or agent who serves alcoholic beverages or who provides security at
the establishment.
      (4)   Employees or agents of licensees must not consume alcoholic
beverages while working, or work while obviously intoxicated.
      (5)   A licensee or any of its employees or agents shall not sell, offer
to sell, or deliver to any person more than two alcoholic beverages for a
single price or increase the volume of intoxicating liquor or 3.2 percent malt
liquor in an alcoholic beverage without proportionately increasing the price
charged for the alcoholic beverage. Special pricing on drinks, commonly
referred to as "happy hour," may only be offered between the hours of 12:00
noon and 11:00 p.m. Temporary promotional pricing; i.e., pricing associated
with a specific event, is allowed after 11:00 p.m. as long as the temporary
promotional pricing is also offered during other hours of operation on the same
day. Beer, wine, or liquor samplings are allowed as permitted by state law.
      (6)   A licensee or any of its employees or agents must engage in
responsible serving practices. Sales of pitchers of alcoholic beverages are
allowed, provided there are at least two persons intending to consume the
pitcher of alcoholic beverages. The sale of a single serving of an alcoholic
beverage which, when consumed, would, by itself, result in an alcohol
concentration of .08 or more is not allowed.
      (7)   (a)   A licensee or any of its employees or agents must not:
            1.   Encourage or permit customers to conduct games or contests
that involve drinking;
            2.   Award prizes to customers based on alcohol consumption; or
            3.   Award prizes of alcohol to customers.
         (b)   Alcoholic beverages must not be included as part of a charge for
admission to the licensed premises.
      (8)   A licensee or any of its employees or agents must require patrons
and occupants of the establishment to conduct themselves in such a manner as to
not cause any portion of the establishment to be disorderly, as defined in
division (C) of this section or defined elsewhere in the city code or in state
law.
      (9)   Employees or agents of a licensee or any person providing
entertainment or working for or on behalf of a licensee, whether compensated or
not, must act in accordance with federal, state and local laws, statutes,
ordinances, regulations and rules, including any conditions associated with the
liquor license. Conduct by any of those persons at the establishment will be
considered to be, and treated as, the act or conduct of the licensee for the
purpose of imposing penalties or other sanctions against a licensee.
   (C)   A licensee is responsible for acts of disorderly conduct by persons
occupying its establishment when a licensee knows or has reason to know of acts
of disorderly conduct by persons occupying its establishment or when a licensee
manages its establishment in a manner that contributes to acts of disorderly
conduct by persons occupying its establishment. For purposes of this section,
the following types of conduct at an establishment are disorderly:
      (1)   Unlawful possession, delivery, or purchase of a controlled
substance, as set forth in M.S. §§ 152.01 et seq. and
Chapter 135 of this code;
      (2)   Disorderly conduct, as set forth in M.S. § 609.72 and §
134.15 et seq. of this code;
      (3)   Unlawful sale of intoxicating liquor or 3.2 percent malt liquor as
set forth in M.S. Chapter 340A and §§
112.030 through
112.069 of this code;
      (4)   Homicide and suicide, as set forth in M.S. §§ 609.18 through
609.215;
      (5)   Criminal sexual conduct, as set forth in M.S. §§ 609.342 through
609.3451;
      (6)   Prostitution or acts relating to prostitution including housing
individuals engaged in prostitution as set forth in M.S. §§ 609.321,
Subdivision 9, and 609.324;
      (7)   Unlawful use or possession of a firearm at an establishment as set
forth in M.S. §§ 609.66 et seq. and
Chapter 136 of this code;
      (8)   Assault as set forth in §
134.01 of this code;
      (9)   Contributing to the delinquency of a minor as defined in M.S.
Chapter 260B;
      (10)   Sexual and labor trafficking crimes as set forth in M.S. §§
609.281 through 609.284;
      (11)   Interference with a police officer as set forth in M.S. § 609.50;
      (12)   Terroristic threats as set forth in M.S. § 609.713;
      (13)   Unlawful assembly as set forth in M.S. § 609.715;
      (14)   Riots as set forth in M.S. § 609.71;
      (15)   Interfering with phone calls for emergency assistance as set forth
in M.S. § 609.78;
      (16)   Gambling as set forth in M.S. §§ 609.75 through 609.76;
      (17)   Crime committed for the benefit of a gang as set forth in M.S. §
609.229;
      (18)   Racketeering as set forth in M.S. § 609.903; or
      (19)   Any other conduct deemed disorderly by the city or other law
enforcement agency.
   (D)   Upon a determination by the City Manager that any act or conduct
described in divisions (B) or (C) of this section, or any other act of
disorderly conduct as provided for elsewhere in the city code or in state law,
has occurred at an establishment, the City Manager will provide notice of the
conduct to the owner of the establishment and to the licensee directing them to
take action to prevent future incidents.
   (E)   If another act or conduct described in divisions (B) or (C) of this
section, or any other act or conduct prohibited elsewhere in the city code or
in state law, occurs within 12 months after an incident for which notice was
provided under division (D) of this section, the owner and licensee will be
notified and will be required to participate in a Problem Solving Conference
(PSC). The PSC will be scheduled and conducted by the City Manager. The purpose
of the PSC is to develop a plan of action to ensure that a future incident does
not occur at the establishment. The PSC must be approved by the City Manager. A
licensee must participate in the PSC within five business days of the notice.
   (F)   If a third act or conduct described in divisions (B) or (C) of this
section, or any other act or conduct prohibited elsewhere in the city code or
in state law, occurs within 12 months after either of the two previous
incidents, the City Manager will notify the owner and licensee of the third
incident and will require the owner and licensee to submit a written report of
the actions taken, and proposed to be taken, to prevent further incidents. The
written report must be submitted to the City Manager no later than ten business
days after notice of the third incident is mailed or delivered to the licensee.
The written report must also detail all actions taken by the licensee in
response to all previous incidents for which notices were sent to the licensee.
   (G)   After the third act or conduct described in divisions (B) or (C) of
this section, or any other act or conduct prohibited elsewhere in the city code
or in state law, the City Council may deny, revoke, suspend, or not renew the
license, or may apply any other sanction provided by law. The owner and
licensee shall be provided with written notice of a hearing before the City
Council to consider such denial, revocation, suspension, non-renewal, or
sanction. Such written notice must specify all incidents of disorderly conduct
and violations under this section, and must state the date, time, place and
purpose of the hearing. The hearing must be held no less than ten business days
and no more than 30 days after giving such notice.
   (H)   Upon a decision to revoke, deny or not renew a license, the owner or
licensee will not be eligible to apply for any new license for a period of one
year. Any person who has had two or more licenses revoked, suspended, denied or
not renewed will not be eligible to apply for any new licenses for a period of
two years.
   (I)   A determination that an act or conduct described in divisions (B) or
(C) of this section, or any other act or conduct prohibited elsewhere in the
city code or in state law, has occurred at an establishment must be made based
upon a fair preponderance of the evidence. It is not necessary that criminal
charges be brought in order to support a determination by the City Council that
any such act or conduct has occurred at the establishment. The fact of
dismissal or acquittal of any such criminal charge does not operate as a bar to
an adverse license action under this section.
   (J)   Enforcement actions provided in this section are not exclusive, and
the City Council may take any action with respect to a licensee as is
authorized by the city code or state or federal law. This may include a PSC as
well as an immediate license suspension where there has been a determination by
the City Council that continued operation poses a risk to public safety. If the
City Council finds that a licensee failed to participate in a PSC, then this
failure is grounds for a license suspension.
   (K)   The City Council may postpone or discontinue any enforcement action,
including an action to deny, revoke, suspend, or not renew a license, if the
owner and licensee have taken appropriate measures to prevent further
violations or instances of disorderly conduct.
   (L)   All notices given by the city under this section must be personally
served on the owner and licensee or sent by first class mail to the owner and
licensee's last known addresses.
   (M)   Any person whose license is denied, revoked, suspended, or not renewed
under this section shall have the right to appeal that decision by petitioning
the Minnesota Court of Appeals for a writ of certiorari pursuant to M.S.
Chapter 606.

and additional direct costs associated with the investigation will be billed to
the applicant(s). The minimum investigating fee is not subject to refund. If
the expenses of the investigation relating to any application exceed the
minimum investigating fee, the city must notify the applicant of this fact and
require the applicant to pay an additional investigating fee which the City
Manager deems necessary to complete its investigation of the applicant. The
applicant must pay such an additional investigating fee within five days of
being so notified. If such additional investigating fee is not paid within such
five-day period, the city shall discontinue consideration of the application.
   (C)   Each application must contain a provision on the application in bold
print indicating that any withholding of information or the providing of false
or misleading information will be grounds for denial or revocation of a liquor
license. Any changes in the information provided on the application or provided
during the investigation must be brought to the attention of the City Council
by the applicant or licensee. If the changes take place during the
investigation, the data must be provided to the Chief of Police or the City
Manager in writing and they must report the changes to the City Council.
Failure to report the changes by the applicant or the licensee may result in a
denial or a revocation of a license.
   (D)   The Council, in its sole discretion and for any reasonable cause, may
refuse to grant any license. Licenses will not be issued to a person who has
any of the following:
      (1)   Has a felony conviction;
      (2)   Who has previous convictions in the past five years of illegal
sales of alcohol or alcoholic beverages, including but not limited to sales to
minors;
      (3)   Has not properly filed personal and/or business tax returns;
      (4)   Has had a liquor license from any city, county, or state revoked
within five years of the pending license application.

§ 112.033 REGULATION.
   (A)   No off-sale liquor license may be issued except in a commercial or
business use district.
   (B)   All licensees must prove to the Council that they are financially
responsible and of good moral character. Financial data submitted as a part of
the application must provide complete information to satisfy the City Council
that the applicants have financial capital to commence business and to operate
the business. The City Council is concerned that lack of capital could lead to
sales practices which are contrary to the general welfare of the community.
   (C)   The number of “off-sale” licenses is limited to allow no more than one
such license for every 4,000 residents. This provision does not apply to
combination on and off-sale licenses. No more than 12 "off-sale" liquor
licenses may be issued for property located south of 93rd Avenue.
   (D)   In a new area being opened to commercial development or if a new
structure is being built in an existing commercial or business use district, or
if an existing structure is being remodeled to house a new on-sale and/or off-
sale license, the applicant/licensee must agree as a condition of acquiring the
license that all construction must be completed within a specified time but in
no event shall said time exceed a reasonable period as determined by the
Council at the time of Council approval. A date for completion of construction
shall be included at the time of issuance of a license. Failure to have
completed construction and to have obtained a certificate of occupancy and to
be in operation within the specified time results in automatic revocation of
the license. The applicant/licensee must then be required to file an
application for a new license, provide all data required for any new licensee
and complete the entire licensing process. Upon the issuance of a license and
the opening date established, the business must remain open and operational. If
the business closes for more than 30 consecutive days the license shall be
revoked unless it is closed by a circumstance out of the control of the
business owner (fire, tornado, etc.).

§ 112.034 BOND REQUIRED.
   A bond with a corporate surety must accompany each application for a
license. If the application is for a “Sunday sale” special license, such bond
requirement may be met by a separate bond or by the inclusion thereof in an
existing “on-sale” bond when accompanied by a proper endorsement or certificate
showing inclusion of “Sunday sales.” In the case of an application for license
for “on-sale” or “Sunday sale” or both, the application must be accompanied by
a corporate surety bond in the sum of $4,000; or in lieu of such bond, cash or
bonds of the United States of a market value of $4,000 may be deposited with
the Treasurer on the same conditions as provided in the penalty clause of the
required surety bond. In the case of an application for an “off-sale” license,
a similar surety bond or cash or United States bond equivalent is required, but
the amount of such bond is $2,000 and must be approved by the State Department
of Public Safety.
('72 Code, § 805:25)
§ 112.035 BOND CONDITIONS.
   All such bonds must be conditioned as follows:
   (A)   That the licensee will obey the law relating to such licensed
premises.
   (B)   That the licensee will pay to the City of Brooklyn Park when due all
license fees, penalties, and other charges provided by law.
   (C)   That in the event of any violation of the provisions of any law
relating to the retail “off-sale” and retail “on-sale” and retail “Sunday sale”
of intoxicating liquor, such bond must be forfeited to the city.
   (D)   That the licensee will pay to the extent of the principal amount of
the bond any damages for death or injury caused by or resulting from the
violation of any provision of law relating thereto, and in such cases recovery
under this division may be had from the surety of this bond. The amount
specified in the bond is declared to be a penalty, the amount recoverable to be
measured by the actual damages; provided, however, that in no case is the
surety to be liable for any amount in excess of the penal amount of the bond.
   (E)   All such bonds are for the benefit of the City of Brooklyn Park and
all persons suffering damages by reason of the breach of the conditions of this
subchapter or state statutes.
   (F)   If the applicant files cash or United States government bonds, as
permitted in this section, the Finance Director must execute a receipt therefor
and a copy of the receipt must be filed with the Clerk or designee. If
government bonds are filed, the licensee is permitted to clip and take all
interest bearing coupons thereto attached as they become due.
('72 Code, § 805:30) (Am. Ord. 2004-1013, passed 5-10-04)
§ 112.036 LICENSE FEES.
   (A)   All license fees as established by the Council from time to time must
be paid at the time of filing the application.
   (B)   In the case of licenses granted for premises where construction is not
yet completed, the Council may grant the license but the Clerk or designee must
not issue the license until the construction is completed in accordance with
the plans and specifications approved by the Council. The fee for the license
is one-half of the license fee from the date of approval until liquor sales
actually commence on the licensed premises. When sales commence, the full fee
is to become effective prorated on a quarterly basis. In no event may a reduced
fee apply for a licensed establishment under construction for a period of
longer than 12 months from the date of Council approval, the full fee is to be
paid for the balance of the construction period.
   (C)   The City Council may, in its discretion, prorate any or all license
fees as it considers appropriate under the circumstances including, but not
limited to, when a license is issued for an unexpired portion of a license
year.
('72 Code, § 805:40) (Am. Ord. 1972-122(A), passed 8-28-72; Am. Ord. 2002-971,

Cross-reference:
   License fees, see Appendix
§ 112.037 GRANTING OF LICENSE.
   The Council must cause an investigation to be made of all the
representations set forth in the application. An opportunity must be given at a
regular or special meeting of the Council to any person to be heard for or
against the granting of any license. After the investigation and approval of
the required bond, the Council must grant or refuse such license at its
discretion; provided that no “off-sale” license becomes effective until it,
together with the bond, has the approval of the State Department of Public
Safety. All licensed premises must have the license posted in a conspicuous
place therein at all times. No license may be transferable either as to
licensee or premises without the approval of the Council and also the State
Department of Public Safety in the case of “off-sale” licenses.
('72 Code, § 805:45)
§ 112.038 NEW LICENSE HEARING.
   No license for the sale of intoxicating liquor “on-sale,” “off-sale” or
“Sunday sale” may be hereafter granted by the Council unless the license is a
renewal of a license previously granted at the same location to the same
licensee, until a public hearing is conducted by the Council after published
notice in the official newspaper at least ten days in advance of the hearing.
('72 Code, § 805:50)
§ 112.039 APPLICATION REFERRED TO POLICE CHIEF.
   (A)   All applications for a license must be referred to the Chief of Police
and to such other departments as the Council deems necessary for verification
and investigation of the facts set forth in the application. The Chief of
Police must cause to be made such investigation of the information required in
this subchapter as is necessary and must make a written recommendation and
report to the Council and the report must include a list of all violations of
federal or state law or municipal ordinance. The Chief of Police is directed to
trace the assets of the applicant individual, partnership or major stockholders
of a corporation. This requirement is waived for corporations traded on the New
York, American Stock Exchange, National Association of Securities Dealers
National Market System or is a publicly held or traded corporation where no one
individual has more than 25% of the stock ownership. In this investigation the
Chief or the Chief’s designated agent must require the applicant to provide
substantiating documentation regarding the funds available for operation of the
on-sale or off-sale licensee's liquor operation. The Council may order and
conduct such additional investigation as it deems necessary.
   (B)   The requirement that the Chief of Police trace the applicant's assets
has been waived for certain corporations as set forth above. In lieu of an
investigation of the principals in the business, these publicly held
corporations must designate with their application a manager or operator who
shall be legally responsible for compliance with all federal, state, and local
laws relating to the sale of intoxicating or 3.2 percent malt liquors. The
named manager or operator who shall be responsible must agree in writing to
accept service of any legal process relating to the operation of the licensed
premises. The person responsible must have on file with the city at all times
their current address where service of process will be accepted. At the time of
the original application or at any time thereafter when the responsible manager
or operator is changed, the Chief of Police must conduct a criminal
investigation (not a financial investigation) to determine that the responsible
manager or operator meets the city's standards applicable to obtaining a
license and subject to all the fees and requirements set forth in §§
112.032 and
112.035 of this code. The City Council must at its sole discretion approve or
decline to approve the manager or operator to operate a public corporation's
premises licensed to sell intoxicating malt liquor.
('72 Code, § 805:55) (Am. Ord. 1981-371(A), passed 12-14-81; Am. Ord. 1993-728,
passed 7-12-93; Am. Ord. 1997-841, passed 3-24-97; Am. Ord. 2001-960, passed
11-26-01)
§ 112.040 NOTICE; GRANTING.
   Upon receipt of the written report and recommendation by the Chief of
Police, the information and data must be reviewed by the City Manager to
determine that it is complete. The City Council must then be provided in
writing a complete report regarding the application and the investigation. The
City Council may request that the applicant(s) appear at a City Council Meeting
to discuss informally the applications and all relevant data. Within 20 days
thereafter, the Council must instruct the Clerk to cause to be published in the
official newspaper ten days in advance a notice of a hearing to be held,
setting forth the day, time and place when the hearing will be held, the name
of the applicant, the premises where the business is to be conducted, the
nature of the business, and such other information as the Council may direct.
At the hearing, opportunities must be given to any person to be heard for or
against the granting of the license. After it has conducted the public hearing,
the Council must grant or refuse the application at its discretion.
('72 Code, § 805:60) (Am. Ord. 1981-371(A), passed 12-14-81)
§ 112.041 CONDITIONS OF LICENSE.
   All licenses granted hereunder are granted subject to the following
conditions, all other conditions of this chapter, and subject to all other
ordinances of the city applicable thereto and to all regulations promulgated by
the State Department of Public Safety and all statutes of the State of
Minnesota applicable thereto:
   (A)   Every licensee must be responsible for the conduct of the licensee’s
place of business and the conditions of sobriety and order therein. No “on-
sale” dealer nor “Sunday sale” dealer shall sell liquor by the bottle or
container for removal from the premises. No dealer license for “off-sale” shall
permit the consumption of any liquor on such licensed premises except that off
sale licensed stores may provide samples of malt liquor, wine, liqueurs, and
cordials which the licensee currently has in stock and is offering for sale to
the general public without obtaining an additional license, provided the malt
liquor, wine, liqueur, and cordial samples are dispensed at no charge and
consumed on the licensed premises during the permitted hours of off-sale in a
quantity less than 100 milliliters of malt liquor per variety per customer, 50
milliliters of wine per variety per customer and 25 milliliters of liqueur or
cordial per variety per customer.
   (B)   It is unlawful to sell intoxicating liquor to any minor. A license
must not be granted to a minor and a person under 18 years of age must not be
employed in any room constituting the place in which intoxicating liquors are
sold at retail “on-sale” or “Sunday sale,” except that persons under 18 years
of age may be employed as musicians or to perform the duties of busboy or
dishwashing services in places defined as a restaurant, hotel or motel. Persons
under 18 years of age may be employed as waiters or waitresses at a restaurant,
hotel or motel where only wine is sold, provided that the person under the age
of 18 may not serve or sell any wine. The licensee must not permit any person
under 18 years of age to loiter or remain in the room where intoxicating liquor
is being sold or served unless accompanied by the minor’s parent or legal
guardian. A person 18, 19 or 20 years old may enter an establishment licensed
under this chapter to:
      (1)   Perform work for the establishment, including the serving of
alcoholic beverages, unless otherwise prohibited by M.S. § 340A.412,
Subdivision 10;
      (2)   Consume meals; and
      (3)   Attend social functions that are held in a portion of the
establishment where liquor is not sold.
   (C)   An “on-sale” or “Sunday sale” licensee must not keep, possess or
operate, or permit the keeping, possession or operation of, on the premises or
in any room adjoining the licensed premises controlled by the licensee, any
slot machine, dice, or other gambling device or apparatus, nor permit any
gambling therein, except as authorized by the city pursuant to M.S. Chapter
349, or as amended, nor permit the licensed premises or any room in the same or
in any adjoining building directly or indirectly under the licensee's control,
to be used as a resort for prostitutes or other disorderly persons.
   (D)   A license must not be issued to any person not a citizen of the United
States, nor to any person not of good moral character and repute, nor to any
person who has been convicted of any willful violation of any law of the United
States or the State of Minnesota within the past five years, or of any of the
local ordinances with regard to the manufacture, sale, distribution or
possession for sale or distribution of intoxicating liquor within the past five
years, nor to any person whose license under this chapter is revoked for any
willful violation of such laws or ordinances.
   (E)   Except as otherwise permitted in state law, a license must not be
granted to any manufacturer or distiller of intoxicating liquor, nor to anyone
interested in the ownership or operation of any such place, nor to a person
operating a licensed place owned by a manufacturer, distiller, or exclusive
wholesale distributing agent unless such interest was acquired at least six
months prior to January 1, 1934; and equipment or fixtures in any licensed
place must not be owned in whole or in part by any manufacturer or distiller.
   (F)   (1)   No more than one off-sale license may be directly or indirectly
issued or granted to one person or to one management within the city. It is
unlawful for a person, partnership or corporation to knowingly have or possess
a direct or indirect interest in more than one “off-sale” license in the city.
“On-sale” licenses may be issued for the sale of intoxicating liquor in hotels,
clubs, restaurants and establishments for “on-sale” of liquor exclusively.
“Sunday sale” licenses may be issued to hotels or restaurants as defined in
M.S. § 340A.101 and which have facilities for serving not less than 30 guests
at one time and to which “on-sale” licenses have been issued or may be issued
hereafter for the sale of intoxicating liquor. “Off-sale” licenses are issued
only to proprietors or exclusive liquor stores. No “off-sale” licenses may be
issued to any applicant unless the applicant shows that the proposed location
of the exclusive liquor store has a minimum of 1,000 square feet of floor space
in a building which meets all building codes and building ordinances. Off-sale
liquor stores in operation as of the date of this chapter change may continue
to operate in their existing facilities as a non-conforming use until such time
as they are transferred to a different location and subject to the same
standards as set forth in this code. The existing facilities which do not meet
the standards of this chapter must be treated as a non-conforming use and are
subject to the provisions of this code.
      (2)   The term INTEREST includes any pecuniary interest in the ownership,
operation, management, or profits of a retail liquor establishment, but does
not include: bona fide loans; bona fide rental agreements; bona fide open
accounts or other obligations held with or without security arising out of the
ordinary and regular course of business of selling or leasing merchandise,
fixtures or supplies to such establishment, an interest in a corporation owning
or operating a hotel but having at least 150 or more rental units holding a
liquor license in conjunction therewith; or ten percent or less interest in any
other corporation holding a license. A person who receives monies from time to
time directly or indirectly from a licensee, in the absence of a bona fide
consideration therefor and excluding bona fide gifts or donations, is deemed to
have a pecuniary interest in such retail license. In determining “bona fides”
the reasonable value of the goods or things received as consideration for any
payment by the licensee and all other facts reasonably tending to prove or
disprove the existence of any purposeful scheme or arrangement to evade the
prohibitions of this chapter must be considered.
   (G)   All premises where any license hereunder is granted must be open to
inspection by any police or health officer or other properly designated officer
or employee of the city at any time during which the place so licensed is open
to the public for business.
   (H)   A license must not be granted within 300 feet of any school, early
childhood development center, licensed nursery or daycare facility, or
religious institution. A license may be granted within 300 feet of any of the
above listed uses if the licensed premises and the listed uses are located
within the same zoning district. The measurement must be made from building to
building and not from the property lines.
   (I)   (1)   Every room, place or premises wherein such liquor is permitted
to be or is sold, including any café, restaurant, or dining room operated in
connection therewith, or as part thereof, pursuant to an “on-sale” license,
must be closed and kept closed to the public on every day between the hours of
2:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m. During those hours, it is unlawful for a person or
persons to be or remain upon or within, such room, place on premises for any
purpose whatsoever, except that the owner or licensee, or the owner or
licensee’s agents or servants or employees may be and remain therein and
thereon for the purpose only of cleaning, preparation of meals, necessary
repairs, or other work in connection therewith, or as watchperson. An exception
to the foregoing statement applies to hotels, restaurants, and clubs where
portable bars are temporarily set up in dining rooms, club rooms, or other
areas which are open to the public and which are used only on a temporary
basis. Portable or temporary bars located on the licensed premises must have
all liquor removed and/or places under lock and key within the above designated
hours or all intoxicating liquor must be returned to a central location where
the liquor is stored and which is closed to the public during the hours stated
above.
      (2)   Nothing herein prohibits a hotel dining room, a restaurant, a
bowling center, or a club from serving or selling food during hours that the
sale of liquor is prohibited if the liquor is removed from display and placed
in a locked enclosure or room that is inaccessible to the public during the
hours stated above.
   (J)   (1)   It is unlawful for intoxicating liquor to be drunk or consumed
from the licensed premises during the times when the sale of intoxicating
liquors is prohibited by state law or as such state law is modified by
ordinance. During those hours and at those times no intoxicating liquor in any
quantity whatsoever shall be served, kept, displayed or permitted to be on or
in any table, booth, bar or other place in such licensed premises, except the
stock of liquors stored therein during such times on the premises in such
portions thereof as are accessible only to the licensee and his or her
employees. Temporary or portable bars located as outlined in division (J) of
this section hereof must have all liquor removed from sight and placed under
lock and key or returned to a central storage area during the hours when the
sale of liquor is prohibited.
      (2)   Nothing herein prohibits a hotel dining room, a restaurant, or a
club from serving or selling food during hours that the sale of liquor is
prohibited if the liquor is removed from display, covered or stored and is not
visible to the public.
   (K)   As a condition to the granting of an “on-sale” or “Sunday sale”
license where sale of food and such other articles is permitted by the Council,
the Council may by resolution restrict, the sale and consumption of liquor at
any place so licensed to tables where food is served to patrons purchasing and
consuming said liquor, and may prohibit or limit the sale or consumption of
liquor at a bar, and may prohibit the maintenance of a bar on the premises
where liquor is displayed or dispensed.
   (L)    An “on-sale,” “Sunday sale,” or “off-sale” license is not effective
beyond the compact and contiguous space named in the license granted, except
that the Council may permit sales of liquor with meals in additional dining
rooms open to the public and specified in the license where meals are regularly
served to guests therein.
   (M)   It must be a condition of every license heretofore or hereafter issued
hereunder to a corporation that the Clerk or designee be furnished by the
licensee with a correct list of all stockholders of the corporation to whom the
license is issued and the number of shares held by each, either individually or
beneficially for others; and it is the continuing duty of each corporate
licensee to promptly notify the Clerk or designee of any change in ownership or
beneficial interest of such shares. Any change of ownership or beneficial
interest of shares of stock entitled to be voted at any meeting of the
stockholders of such corporation which results in change in voting control of
the corporation by the persons owning shares of stock therein is deemed
equivalent to a transfer of the license issued to such corporation, and any
such licenses must be revoked and terminated 30 days after any such change in
ownership or beneficial interest of shares, unless the Council is notified of
such change in writing and has approved thereof. The Council or any officer of
the city designated by it may at any reasonable time examine the stock transfer
records and minute books of any corporate licensee in order to verify the names
of stockholders and persons voting at meetings of such corporation, and the
Council may cancel and terminate any license issued hereunder to a corporation
upon determination by the Council that any change of ownership of stock in such
corporate licensee has actually resulted in change of control of such
corporation so as to materially affect the integrity and character of its
management and its operation of an “on sale,” “Sunday sale,” or “off-sale”
liquor business, provided that no such action must be taken until after a
hearing by the Council on ten days notice to the licensee.
   (N)   The City Council finds that the sale and/or presence of alcoholic
beverages by the drink and adult entertainment occurring on the same premises
can increase disorderly conduct and can result in incidents of prostitution,
public masturbation, indecent exposure, and/or sexual assault. In order to
protect the health, safety, and welfare of city residents, and pursuant to the
City Council's authority to regulate alcoholic beverages under M.S. Chapter
340A and the Twenty-First Amendment to the United States Constitution, it is
unlawful for an on-sale licensee under this code to permit the following kinds
of conduct on the licensed premises or in areas adjoining the licensed premises
where the following kinds of conduct can be seen by patrons of the licensed
premises:
      (1)   The performance of acts or simulated acts of sexual intercourse,
masturbation, sodomy, bestiality, oral copulation or flagellation; or
      (2)   The actual or simulated touching, caressing, or fondling on the
breast, buttocks, anus, or genitals; or
      (3)   The actual or simulated displaying of the pubic hair, anus, vulva,
or genitals; or
      (4)   The displaying of films, videos, still pictures, electronic
reproduction, or any other visual reproduction of image depicting the acts
described in (1) through (3) above; or
      (5)   The presentation of any female in such manner or attire as to
expose to view any portion of the breast below the top of the areola, or any
simulation thereof.
      (6)   It is unlawful for the licensee or their agent to allow or permit
to remain in or about the licensed premises any person who performs acts as set
forth in (1) through (5) above.
      (7)   The violation of any of the provisions of this chapter by the
licensee or their employees agents constitutes grounds for the suspension or
revocation of any and all intoxicating liquor, 3.2 percent malt liquor, or wine
licenses issued to the premises or to the licensee.

   A room, place or premise where intoxicating liquor is permitted to be sold
under an “on-sale,” “off-sale,” “Sunday sale” or “club license” and including a
café, restaurant or dining room operated in connection therewith, must be
closed to the public during the times when the sale of liquor is prohibited by
state law. During those hours, it is unlawful for a person or persons to be
allowed to be or remain within such room, place or premise, for any purpose
whatsoever, except that the owner or licensee, the owner or licensee’s agents,
servants, or employees, may be and remain therefor the purpose only of
cleaning, preparation of meals, necessary repairs, or other work in connection
therewith.

§ 112.043 RESTRICTIONS ON CONSUMPTION.
   In any place licensed for “on-sale,” the liquor sold must be served and

must sit to be served. It is unlawful for liquor to be sold or consumed on a
public highway or in an automobile.

to, suspension, revocation, denial, or non-renewal of the license. No portion
of the license fee paid shall be returned upon suspension, revocation, denial
or non-renewal.

      (1)   A tenant of a housing unit who believes the new owner has not
provided the tenant the notifications required under this section may submit a
notice of violation to the city. The purpose of the notice is to inform the
city of an alleged violation of this section to assist the city in determining
whether to impose an administrative penalty provided for in this section. The
city is not required to take any particular action in response to a notice of

city, not the tenant. Filing a notice of violation does not prohibit the tenant
from pursuing any remedy available to the tenant under law.

that steps be taken to prevent further violations.
   (D)   If a second instance of disorderly use of a rental dwelling occurs
within the 12-month period following an incident for which a notice in
paragraph (C) of this section was given, the City Manager must notify the
owner/licensee of the violation and must also require the owner/licensee to
submit a written report of the actions taken, and proposed to be taken to
prevent further disorderly use. This written report must be submitted to the
City Manager within ten business days of receipt of the notice of disorderly
use and must detail all actions taken by the owner/licensee in response to all
notices of disorderly use within the preceding 12 months.
   (E)   (1)   If a third instance of disorderly use of a rental dwelling
occurs within the 12-month period following any two previous instances of
disorderly use for which notices were given, the City Manager must notify the
owner/licensee of the violation and must also require the owner/licensee to
submit a written report of the actions taken, and proposed to be taken, to
prevent further disorderly use. The 12-month period begins on the date of the
police report generated in response to the first instance of disorderly use.
The written report must be submitted to the City Manager within ten business
days of receipt of the notice of disorderly use and must detail all actions
taken in response to all notices of disorderly use within the preceding 12
months.
      (2)   After the third instance of disorderly use, the City Manager may
deny, revoke, suspend or not renew the license for the premises. Before such an
action, the City Manager must give to the owner/licensee written notice of a
hearing before the City Hearing Officer to consider such denial, revocation,
suspension or non-renewal. Such written notice must specify all violations of
this section, and must state the date, time, place and purpose of the hearing.
The hearing must be held no less than ten days and no more than 30 days after
giving such notice.
      (3)   Following the hearing, the City Manager may deny, revoke, suspend

necessary to accomplish the purposes of this section.
      (4)   Appeals of any decision made by the City Manager must be filed in
Hennepin County District Court.

violations of this section, the owner/licensee will not be eligible for any new
rental licenses for a period determined by the City Manager, but not to exceed
one year. Any person who has had two or more licenses revoked, suspended,
denied or not renewed for violations of this section, will not be eligible for
any new rental licenses for a period determined by the City Manager, but not to

   (F)   No adverse license action shall be imposed where the instance of
disorderly use occurred during the pendency of eviction proceedings (unlawful
detainer) or within 30 days of notice given to a tenant to vacate the premises
where the disorderly use was related to conduct by that tenant or by other
occupants or guests of the tenant's unit. Eviction proceedings are not a bar to
adverse license action, however, unless they are diligently pursued by the
licensee.
   (G)   A determination that a rental dwelling has been used in a disorderly
manner as described in paragraph (A) of this section shall be made upon a fair
preponderance of the evidence to support such a determination. It is not
necessary that criminal charges be brought in order to support a determination
of disorderly use nor does the fact of dismissal or acquittal of such a
criminal charge operate as a bar to adverse license action under this section.
   (H)   All notices given by the city under this section must be personally
served on the owner/licensee, sent by certified mail to the owner/licensee's
last known address or, if neither method of service effects notice, by posting
on a conspicuous place on the rental dwelling.
   (I)   Enforcement actions provided in this section are not exclusive, and
the City Manager may take any action with respect to a licensee, a tenant, or a
rental dwelling as is authorized by the city code, state or federal law. The
City Manager may postpone or discontinue any enforcement action, including an
action to deny, revoke, suspend, or not renew a license, if it appears that the
owner/licensee has taken appropriate measures to prevent further instances of
disorderly use.

than ten days from the date of the notice. At the hearing, the owner/licensee
may present witnesses in their defense. The Hearing Officer may give due regard
to the frequency and seriousness of violations, the ease with which such

and shall issue written findings.

licensee will not be eligible for any new rental licenses for a period
determined by the City Manager, but not to exceed one year.

Revocation, suspension or non-renewal of a license will not excuse the owner/
licensee from compliance with all terms of this section for as long as any
units in the rental dwelling are occupied.

revocation, suspension or non-renewal is a misdemeanor and grounds for

representative, employee or lessee or the condition of their rental dwelling is
detrimental to the public health, sanitation, safety and general welfare of the
community at large or residents of the rental dwelling as to constitute a
nuisance, fire hazard or other unsafe or dangerous condition and thus give rise
to an emergency, the City Manager has the authority to summarily condemn or
close off individual units or such areas of the rental dwelling. Notice of
summary condemnation must be posted at the location of the rental dwelling
license and at the units or areas affected and shall indicate the units or
areas affected. Upon notice of summary condemnation, the City Manager may deny,
revoke, suspend or decline to renew the license for all or any part or parts of
the rental dwelling or may impose terms and conditions as necessary to remedy
the nuisance, fire hazard, or other unsafe or dangerous condition.

PAWNBROKERS
§ 119.01 PURPOSE.
   The City Council finds that pawnbrokers can provide an opportunity for the
commission and concealment of crimes, because such businesses have the ability
to receive and transfer stolen property easily and quickly. The City Council
also finds that consumer protection regulation is warranted with transactions
involving pawnbrokers. The purpose of this subchapter is to prevent pawn
businesses from being used as facilities for the commission of crimes and to
assure that such businesses comply with basic consumer protection standards,
thereby protecting the public health, safety, and general welfare of the
residents of the city. It is also the purpose of this section to help the
Police Department regulate such businesses and to decrease and stabilize costs
associated with the regulation of the pawn industry and to assist the Police
Department in the identification of criminal activities in the pawn industry
through the timely collection and sharing of pawn transaction information.
('72 Code, § 468:00) (Ord. 1997-843, passed 3-24-97)

the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.

license may be transferred to a different location or a different person. In
the case of the death of a licensee, the personal representative of the
licensee may continue operation of the business for not more than 90 days after

existing license that is more than six months past due, will pay an
investigation fee as set forth in the Appendix to this code at the time an

city's investigation of the applicant(s). The applicant(s) will pay such an
additional investigation fee within five days of being so notified. If such
additional investigation fee is not paid within the five day period, the city
will cease consideration of the application. Nonpayment of any additional
investigation fees required will be grounds for denial of the application.

cocaine, marijuana, or other deleterious, hallucinogenic, toxic or controlled
substances except nicotine and other substances found naturally in tobacco or

intention of this provision to ban the sale of lawfully manufactured cigarettes
or other products subject to this chapter.
      (4)   By means of self-service display. All licensed products must be
stored behind the sales counter, in a locked case, in a storage unit, or in
another area not freely accessible to the general public. Any retailer selling
licensed products at the time this chapter is adopted must comply with this
section within 90 days of the effective date of this chapter. This provision
does not apply to tobacco shops that have an entrance door opening directly to

issued photographic identification containing the bearer's date of birth that
the purchaser is at least 21 years of age. Verification is not required for a
person over the age of 30. That the person appeared to be 30 years of age or
older does not constitute a defense to a violation of this division.
      (2)   Signage. Notice of the legal sales age, age verification
requirement, and possible penalties for underage sales must be posted
prominently and in plain view at all times at each location where licensed
products are offered for sale. The required signage, which will be provided to

employees, or any persons acting on their behalf, in regard to the sale, offer
to sell, or furnishing of licensed products on the licensed premises. The sale,
offer to sell, or furnishing of any licensed product by an employee is

with state law, the city will conduct a compliance check that involves the
participation of a person at least 17 years of age, but under the age of 21 to
enter the licensed premises to attempt to purchase licensed products. Prior
written consent from a parent or guardian is required for any person under the
age of 18 to participate in a compliance check. Nothing in this section

   Nothing in this chapter prohibits a native Indian from furnishing tobacco,
tobacco products or tobacco related devices to an Indian under the age of 21

chapter for a person to have reasonably relied on proof of age as described by

the accused violator. Likewise, if the hearing officer finds that no violation
occurred or finds grounds for not imposing any penalty, the findings must be
recorded and a copy provided to the acquitted accused violator. The decision of
the hearing officer is final, subject to an appeal as described in division (A)
(5) of this section.
      (5)   Appeals. Appeals of any decision made by the hearing officer must
be filed in the Hennepin County district court within ten business days of the
date of the decision.
      (6)   Misdemeanor prosecution. Nothing in this section prohibits the city

persons under the age of 21, public health officials, court personnel, and
other interested parties to determine an appropriate remedy for persons under

associated with a business logo attached to the vehicle; marketing or
advertising associated with the overall appearance of the vehicle; the

§ 126.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The purpose of this section is to regulate the sale of legalized adult-use
of any product that contains tetrahydrocannabinol and that meets the
requirements to be sold for human or animal consumption under M.S. § 151.72 for
the following reasons:
   (A)   By enacting 2022 Session Law Chapter 98, Article 13, the Minnesota
Legislature amended M.S. § 151.72 to allow the sale of certain products
containing tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).
   (B)   The new law does not prohibit municipalities from adopting and
enforcing local ordinances to regulate THC product businesses including, but
not limited to, local zoning and land use requirements and business license
requirements.
   (C)   The National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine note that
the growing acceptance, accessibility, and use of THC products, including for
medical purposes, have raised important public health concerns, while the lack
of aggregated knowledge of cannabis-related health effects has led to
uncertainty about the impact of its use.
   (D)   The city recognizes the danger THC use presents to the health,
welfare, and safety of youth in Brooklyn Park.
   (E)   The Minnesota Legislature recognized the danger of THC product use
among the public at large by setting potency and serving size requirements.
   (F)   The Minnesota Legislature recognized the danger of THC product use
among youth by prohibiting the sale of any product containing THC to those
under the age of 21, requiring that edible THC products be packaged without
appeal to children and in child-resistant packaging or containers.
   (G)   State law authorizes the Board of Pharmacy to adopt product and
testing standards in part to curb the illegal sale and distribution of THC
products and ensure the safety and compliance of commercially available THC
products in the State of Minnesota.
   (H)   The city has the opportunity to be proactive and make decisions that
will mitigate this threat and reduce exposure of young people to the products
or to the marketing of these products and improve compliance among THC product
retailers with laws prohibiting the sale or marketing of THC products to youth.
   (I)   A local regulatory system for THC product retailers is appropriate to
ensure that retailers comply with THC product laws and business standards of
the city to protect the health, safety, and welfare of our youth and most
vulnerable residents.
   (J)   A requirement for a THC product retailer license will not unduly
burden legitimate business activities of retailers who sell or distribute THC
products to adults but will allow the city to regulate the operation of lawful
businesses to discourage violations of state and local THC product-related
laws.
   (K)   In making these findings and enacting this chapter, it is the intent
of the city to ensure responsible THC product retailing, allowing legal sale
and access without promoting increases in use, and to discourage violations of
THC product-related laws, especially those which prohibit or discourage the
marketing, sale or distribution of THC products to youth under 21 years of age.
(Ord. 2022-1286, passed 12-5-22)

designated official, the licensee has the right to appeal that decision to the
City Council.
   (I)   Issuance as privilege and not a right. The issuance of a license
issued under this chapter is a privilege and does not entitle the license
holder to automatic renewal of the license.
(Ord. 2022-1286, passed 12-5-22)

      (2)   The applicant is prohibited by federal, state, or other local law,
ordinance, or other regulation from holding a license.

other regulation relating to the licensed products.
      (4)   The applicant has had a license to sell licensed products suspended

applicant has or had an interest in another premises authorized to sell
licensed products, whether in the city or in another jurisdiction, that has had

      (7)   The applicant fails to provide any information required on the
application or provides false or misleading information. Any false statement on
an application, or any willful omission of any information called for on such

to protect the applicant from prosecution for violation of this chapter, or any
part thereof.
   (C)   No license shall be granted or renewed for operation on any premises
on which real estate taxes, assessments, or other financial claims of the city
or of the state are due, delinquent, or unpaid. If an action has been commenced
pursuant to the provisions of M.S. Chapter 278, questioning the amount or
validity of taxes, the council may, on application by the licensee, waive
strict compliance with this provision; no waiver may be granted, however, for
taxes, or any portion thereof, which remain unpaid for a period exceeding one
year after becoming due unless such one-year period is extended through no
fault of the licensee.

for finding a violation and the penalty to be imposed under division (B) of
this section, must be recorded in writing, a copy of which must be provided to

The City Council will consult with educators, parents, guardians, persons under
the age of 21, public health officials, court personnel, and other interested
parties to determine an appropriate remedy for persons under the age of 21 in
the city in the best interest of the underage person. The remedies for persons

affected by the actions of the irresponsible user.
         (b)   Events and gatherings held on private or public property where
alcohol is possessed or consumed by persons under the age of 21 are harmful to
those persons and constitute a potential threat to public health, safety, and

§ 134.05 ACCESS TO MULTI-UNIT HOUSING STRUCTURES BY UNITED STATES CENSUS BUREAU
EMPLOYEES.
   (A)   Declaration; purpose.
      (1)   The United States Constitution directs a decennial census count of
all persons living in the United States.
      (2)   Complete, accurate census data is of critical importance to all
residents of Brooklyn Park for equal political representation, fair
distribution of federal and state funding, and sound planning and investment in
infrastructure, real estate, business development, and public policy and
programming.
      (3)   During the decennial census, the United States Census Bureau
conducts Non-Response Follow-up Operations (NRFU), when employees of the United
States Census Bureau visit households that have not yet submitted a census
form.
      (4)   Renters and others who live in multi-unit housing structures have
historically been at higher risk of being undercounted in the decennial census,
with the number of renter households in an area being the most influential
variable affecting an area's census self-response rate; in other words, the
more renters in an area, the lower the self-response rate of that area.
      (5)   The risk of an undercount is compounded in areas with high
concentrations of communities that have been consistently undercounted in the
past and who are more likely to be renters, including low income households,
communities of color, Native American/ American Indian communities, immigrants
and refugees, and young people.
      (6)   Multi-unit housing structures can be difficult for Census Bureau
employees to enter due to security barriers.
      (7)   It is critical that Census Bureau employees have access to multi-
unit housing structures during the decennial census, so they can reach
households that have not yet participated.
      (8)   13 U.S. Code § 223 authorizes Census Bureau employees to access
"any hotel, apartment house, boarding or lodging house, tenement, or other
building."
   (B)   It is unlawful for a person, either directly or indirectly, to deny
access to an apartment building, dormitory, nursing home, manufactured home
park, other multi-unit structure used as a residence, or an area in which one
or more single-family dwellings are located on private roadways to employees of
the United States Census Bureau who display current, valid Census Bureau
credentials and who are engaged in official census counting operations during
the Census Bureau's standard operational hours of 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. (local
time) during the decennial census.
   (C)   Census Bureau employees granted access must be permitted to leave
census materials in an orderly manner for residents at their doors, except that
the manager of a nursing home may direct that the materials be left at a
central location within the facility.
   (D)   This section does not prohibit:
      (1)   Denial of admittance into a particular apartment, room,
manufactured home, or personal residential unit;
      (2)   Denial of permission to visit certain persons for valid health
reasons, in the case of a nursing home or a Registered Housing with Services
Establishment providing assisted-living services meeting the requirements of
M.S. § 144G.03, Subd. 2;
      (3)   Limiting visits to a reasonable number of census employees;
      (4)   Requiring a prior appointment or notification to gain access to the
structure; or
      (5)   Denial of admittance to or expulsion of an individual employee from
a multi-unit housing structure for good cause.

§ 150.02 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   This chapter is established to protect and promote the health, safety,
general welfare and order within the City of Brooklyn Park through the
establishment of a comprehensive and impartial series of standards, regulations
and procedures governing the type, numbers, size, structure, location, height,
lighting, erection, maintenance, use and/or display of devices, signs or
symbols serving as a visual communicative media to persons situated within or
upon public rights-of-way or properties.
   (B)   The provisions of this chapter are intended to establish an
opportunity for effective communication, and a sense of concern for visual
amenities on the part of those designing, displaying or otherwise utilizing
needed communicative media of the types regulated by this chapter; while at the
same time, assuring that the public is not endangered, annoyed or distracted by
the unsafe, disorderly, indiscriminate or unnecessary use of such communicative
media.
   (C)   The city’s sign code is not intended to and does not restrict speech
on the basis of its content, viewpoint, or message. Any provision in this code
that permits speech by reason of the type of sign, identity of the sign user or
otherwise, shall permit any type of speech or message on the sign. No part of
this code shall be construed to favor commercial speech over non-commercial
speech. To the extent that any provision of this code is ambiguous, the term
shall be interpreted to not regulate on the basis of speech content and the
interpretation resulting in the least restriction on the content of the sign
message shall prevail.

§ 150.08 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Purpose. Pursuant to M.S. § 462.357, Subd. 6, as it may be amended
from time to time, the City Council, acting as a Board of Appeals and
Adjustments, may issue variances from the provisions of this zoning code. A
variance is a modification or variation of the provisions of this zoning code
as applied to a specific piece of property.
   (B)   Review standards.
      (1)   Variances shall only be permitted:
         (a)   When they are in harmony with the general purposes and intent of
the chapter; and
         (b)   When the variances are consistent with the Comprehensive Plan.
      (2)   Variances may be granted when the applicant for the variance
establishes that there are practical difficulties in complying with the zoning
code. Practical difficulties, as used in connection with the granting of a
variance, means that:
         (a)   The property owner proposes to use the property in a reasonable
manner not permitted by the zoning code;
         (b)   The plight of the landowner is due to circumstances unique to
the property not created by the landowner;
         (c)   The variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character
of the locality; and
         (d)   Economic considerations alone do not constitute practical
difficulties.

sign, without first obtaining a permit(s) from the Sign Code Administrator and
making payment of the fee required. Application for permits must be made upon
application forms provided by the City of Brooklyn Park and must be accompanied
by:
      (1)   A site plan drawn to scale based on and accompanied by a
certificate of survey, or on a certificate of survey, showing the relation of
the sign to the nearest buildings, private and public streets, right-of-ways

is designed for live and dead loads including wind velocity in the amount
required by all ordinances of the city. Electrical permits will be required by

   (B)   Permit issued if application in order. It is the duty of the Sign Code
Administrator, upon the filing of the application for a permit, to examine such
plans and specifications and other data, and the premises upon which the sign
is proposed to be erected, and if it appears that the proposed structure is in
compliance with all other laws and ordinances of Brooklyn Park, the Sign Code
Administrator must then issue the permit. If the work authorized under a permit
has not been completed within 90 days after the date of issuance, the permit
will become null and void.
   (C)   Permit fees. Every applicant, before being granted a permit hereunder,
must pay to the city the permit fee for each sign regulated by this code in an
amount as established by the fee resolution, set forth in the Appendix to this
code.
   (D)   Permit revocable at any time. All rights and privileges acquired by
obtaining a permit under the provisions of this chapter or any amendment
thereto are mere licenses, revocable for cause at any time by the Council, and
all such permits must contain this provision.

conditioned that the licensee will pay all permit fees required under this
chapter, pay any fines imposed upon the licensee for violation thereof, will

from or related to the erection or maintenance of any sign in the city by the

permit but are exempted from any fee.

comply with the standards herein set forth within 14 days after the mailing

or legal action may be taken to force compliance with this chapter. The Sign
Code Administrator must refuse to approve and the City of Brooklyn Park must
refuse to issue a permit to any permittee or owner who refuses to pay costs so
assessed.
      (3)   The Sign Code Administrator may cause any sign or other advertising
structure which is a safety hazard to persons to be removed summarily and
without notice. The Sign Code Administrator may cause any temporary sign
erected not in conformance with the sign ordinance to be removed summarily and
without notice or legal action may be taken to force compliance with this
chapter.
   (B)   Painting required. The owner of any sign as defined and regulated by
this chapter is required to have the sign and sign structure properly painted
upon order of the Sign Code Administrator. It is the intent of this provision
that the sign appearance does not create a blighting influence upon the

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.001 PURPOSE.
   (A)   This chapter may hereafter be known and cited as the “Brooklyn Park
Subdivision Code.”
   (B)   The process of dividing raw land into home sites, or separate parcels
for other uses, is one of the most important factors in the growth of any
community. Few activities have a more lasting effect upon its appearance and
environment. Once the land has been subdivided and the streets, homes and other
structures have been constructed, the basic character of this permanent
addition to the community has become firmly established. It is then virtually
impossible to alter its basic character without substantial expense. In most
subdivisions, roads and streets must be maintained and various public services
must be provided. The welfare of the entire community is thereby affected in
many important respects. It is, therefore, to the interest of the general
public, the developer, and the future owners that subdivisions be conceived,
designed and developed in accordance with sound rules and proper standards.
   (C)   All subdivisions of land hereafter submitted for approval must fully
comply, in all respects, with the regulations set forth herein. It is the
purpose of these regulations to:
      (1)   Encourage well planned, efficient, and attractive subdivisions by
establishing reasonable standards for design and construction;
      (2)   Provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of
residents by requiring properly designed streets, park land, and adequate
sanitary sewer, storm sewer and water service;
      (3)   Place the cost of improvements against those benefitting
financially from their construction; and
      (4)   Secure the rights of the public with respect to public lands and
waters.
   (D)   The Council of the City of Brooklyn Park deems these regulations to be
necessary for the preservation of the health, safety and general welfare of
this community. These regulations have been developed under the authority
contained in M.S. § 462.358, and are supplemented by appropriate sections of §
150.01, as indicated.
('72 Code, § 345:00) (Am. Ord. 1984-447(A), passed 4-9-84; Am. Ord. 2024-1304,

subdivision of land for that person or for others.
   SUBDIVISION. The division of an area, parcel or tract of land into two or
more parcels, tracts, lots, or long-term leasehold interests where the creation
of the leasehold interest necessitates the creation of streets, roads, or

combination thereof, except those divisions when a new street is being created
by a governmental agency which results in a division of a parcel of land. The
term includes resubdivision and, when appropriate to the context, relates to
the process of subdividing or to the land subdivided or for adjustments in
boundary lines.
('72 Code, § 345:02) (Am. Ord. 1984-447(A), passed 4-9-84; Am. Ord. 1992-705,
passed 9-14-92)
§ 151.003 PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS.
   Before dividing any tract of land into two or more lots or parcels, or
adjusting any boundaries not covered by M.S. § 462.352, Subd. 12, the
procedures set forth in this chapter must be followed.
('72 Code, § 345:04)
Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 151.004 PRE-APPLICATION PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Prior to the preparation of a preliminary plat, the subdividers or
owners must meet with the Administrator and other appropriate officials in
order to be made fully aware of all applicable ordinances, regulations and
plans in the area to the subdivided. At this time, or at subsequent informal
meetings, the subdivider must submit a general sketch plan of the proposed
subdivision and drainage plan. The sketch plan can be presented in simple form
but must show any zoning changes which would be required, and must show that
consideration has been given to the relationship of the proposed subdivision to
existing community facilities that would serve it, to neighboring subdivisions
and development, and to the topography of the site. The Administrator may
require the subdivider to provide an area-wide concept platting plan for all
neighboring properties if deemed necessary for coordinated planing.
   (B)   The subdivider is urged to avail the subdivider of the advice and
assistance of the city staff in order to facilitate the approval of the
preliminary plat. However, such advice should not be construed to predict final
action by the City Council.
('72 Code, § 345:06)
§ 151.005 PROCEDURE, PRELIMINARY PLAT, FEES AND DEPOSIT.
   (A)   (1)   After the pre-application meeting, the subdivider must file with
the Department of Community Development an application completed in compliance
with all city regulations and 20 copies of the preliminary plat which has been
prepared in accordance with the regulations set forth in this chapter. At the
time of submission of the preliminary plat, a non-refundable subdivision filing
fee and a minimum subdivision cash escrow as established in the fee resolution,
set forth in the Appendix to this code, must be paid in cash to the City
Treasurer. The fee will be placed in the general fund and the cash escrow must
be held in a special subdivider's cash escrow account credited to the
subdivider. Costs of city services, legal expenses and materials provided in
reviewing and processing of the preliminary plat will be charged to the
subdivider's cash escrow account and must be credited to the City of Brooklyn
Park. The fees and costs to be paid by the subdivider are not contingent upon
approval or denial of the preliminary plat or final plat.
      (2)   The Council must promulgate and adopt a set of rules, regulations
and fees for services rendered by city personnel, and the rules, regulations
and fee schedules are on file with the City Clerk for inspection. A copy
thereof must be furnished upon request to the subdivider. The city must itemize
all time, services and materials billed to any subdivider's cash escrow
account. The subdivider making the deposit(s) in the subdivider's cash escrow
account must upon request, be furnished a copy of the itemized charges.
      (3)   If, at any time, the balance in the subdivider's cash escrow
account is depleted to less than 5% of the originally required cash escrow
amount, the subdivider must deposit additional funds in the subdivider's cash
escrow account in an amount as determined by the Planning Director and City
Engineer, sufficient to cover all costs to be incurred by the city in
implementing the platting process. Any balance remaining in the account upon
completion of all platting conditions must be returned to the depositor by the
Finance Department after all claims and charges thereto have been paid and
after approval by City Council.
      (4)   Park dedication in the form of land or cash will be computed prior
to approval of preliminary plat; however any amount of cash in lieu of
dedication of land must be collected prior to the time the final plat is
released for recording.
   (B)   The planning staff must refer copies of the preliminary plat to the
Engineering Department. An engineering review will be made and a written report
attached prior to forwarding to the Planning Commission.
   (C)   The planning staff must refer copies of the preliminary plat to the
Parks and Recreation Department. A park and recreation staff review will be
made, as needed, and forwarded to the planning staff prior to forwarding an
overall staff report to the Planning Commission.
   (D)   The planning staff must refer copies of the preliminary plat to the
Planning Commission. The planning staff will arrange for a public hearing to be
held within 45 days of the filing date. The required legal publication must be
made and notices must be sent to all property owners of record within 350 feet
of the exterior boundary of the proposed plat.
   (E)   The subdivider or a duly authorized representative must attend the
Planning Commission meetings at which this proposal is scheduled for
consideration.
   (F)   (1)   The Planning Commission and City Council must study the
practicability of the preliminary plat taking into consideration the
requirements of the city. Particular attention must be given, but not limited
to, the arrangement, location, and width of streets, their relation to the
topography of the land, flood plain regulations, water supply, sewage disposal,
drainage, lot sizes and arrangement, the present and future development of
adjoining lands, and the requirements of the comprehensive plan, and the zoning
ordinance.
      (2)   The Planning Commission must study and must make recommendations
and the City Council must consider the following: whether the proposed
subdivision is consistent with applicable specific area plans or the
comprehensive plan; whether the design is consistent with applicable
development plans or policies; whether the physical characteristics of the
site, including but not limited to, topography, vegetation, susceptibility to
erosion, siltation, flooding and water storage or retention and flood plain
regulations, are suitable for the type and/or density of development or use
contemplated; the environmental impact of the subdivision design or proposed
improvements; whether the design of the subdivision or the type of improvement
is consistent with easements of record or easements established by judgment of
a court; traffic considerations; and any other aspect affecting the public
health, safety or welfare. The Planning Commission may recommend and the City
Council may approve reasonable conditions on the plat to negate any problem
areas.
   (G)   At the public hearing all persons interested in the proposed plat must
be heard and the Planning Commission must within 30 days of the closing of the
hearing, recommend approval, modify, or recommend disapproval of the
preliminary plat or waiver of platting and submit to the City Council, the
applicant and the City Manager, their findings and recommendations. The City
Council must act upon the preliminary plat and send written notification of
their action to the applicant. Failure of the governing body to act within 120
days of the filing of an application in complete compliance with the ordinance
is deemed approval of the plat. The grounds for any refusal to approve a plat
must be set forth by the Council in a resolution and reported to the applicant
in writing. Should the subdivider desire to amend the preliminary plat as
approved by the Council, the subdivider must submit the amended plat following
the original procedure set forth, except for the public hearing and fees unless
the Planning Commission considers the scope of the revisions to constitute a
new plat, then the hearing and fees are required.
('72 Code, § 345:08) (Am. Ord. 1975-215(A), passed 12-8-75; Am. Ord. 1984-447
(A), passed 4-9-84; Am. Ord. 1994-756, passed 5-9- 94)
§ 151.006 PROCEDURE; FINAL PLAT.
   (A)   The subdivider, within one year, unless extensions are granted by the
City Council by resolution, after the approval of the preliminary plat, must
file with the Director of Community Development, 15 copies of the final plat
prepared by a land surveyor duly registered in the State of Minnesota. Failure
of the subdivider to submit the final plat within those times designated by
City Council resolutions will cause the preliminary and final plats to become
null and void.
   (B)   The subdivider must also submit to the City Attorney, at the same
time, an up-to-date certified abstract of title or registered property abstract
and such other evidence as the City Attorney may require showing title or
control of the land by the subdivider.
   (C)   The subdivider must have incorporated all changes or modifications
required by the City Council, but in all other respects the final plat must
conform to the preliminary plat.
   (D)   If the subdivider requests that any special assessments which have
been levied against the property described be divided and allocated to the
respective lots in the proposed plats, the Department of Public Works must
estimate the clerical cost of preparing a revised assessment roll, filing the
same with the County Auditor, and making such division and allocation, and upon
approval by the City Manager of such estimated cost, the same must be paid by
the subdivider to the Finance Department from the subdivider's escrow account.
   (E)   The required utility layout must be submitted by the subdivider to the
City Engineer for the City Engineer's cost estimate. A copy of the City
Engineer's report must be submitted to the Director of Community Development
for the preparation of the contract required in §
151.089 of this chapter.
   (F)   The Director of Community Development, upon receipt of the final plat,
must retain one copy of the final plat for the Director's records, and must:
      (1)   Refer 14 copies of the final plat to the Administrative Review
Committee, who must review the final plat with respect to its conformance with
the approved preliminary plat.
      (2)   Refer the current abstract of title or registered property abstract
to the City Attorney for the Attorney's examination and report. The City
Attorney's written report must be submitted to the Director of Community
Development within 30 days of its receipt by the Attorney.
      (3)   Obtain a written report or statement from the Finance Director
certifying the payment by the subdivider of all fees due the city pursuant to
this chapter.
   (G)   The City Council must, by resolution, authorize the Mayor and City
Manager to sign the final plat.
   (H)   If a report from the Director of Community Development indicates, in
the Director of Community Development's judgment, there is a substantial
deviation in the final plat from the approved preliminary plat, the City
Council may determine if the submission represents a new plat. If the
submission does represent a new plat, the City Council must deny the final plat
and direct the subdivider to resubmit the subdivider's proposal following
preliminary plat requirements.
   (I)   The subdivider must, if the final plat is signed by the Mayor and City
Manager, record the final plat with the County Recorder or the Registrar of
Titles within 180 days of the date of the Council resolutions approving the
final plat, or within 180 days after the plat is considered approved by reason
of the City Council's failure to act within the 120 day statutory period. Any
plat not filed and recorded in accordance with this section becomes null and
void.
   (J)   Changes, erasures, modifications or revisions must not be made in any
final plat after approval has been given by the City Council and endorsed in
writing on the plat, unless the plat is first resubmitted to the City Council
and that body approves any modifications. In the event that any such final plat
is recorded without complying with this requirement, the same is considered
null and void and the City Council must institute proceedings to have the plat
stricken from the records of the city.

§ 151.007 PROCEDURES FOR TIME EXTENSIONS.
   (A)   (1)   If a time extension is to be requested, for a preliminary or
final plat as previously approved by the City Council, the one year extension
must be requested and must appear on a City Council agenda for approval within
one year of the date of the original Council approval of the plat or last
Council action to extend that approval. A time extension request which
encounters delays in the review process and through no fault of the applicant
cannot be scheduled for Council action as anticipated may proceed through the
process to final resolution without jeopardy.
      (2)   The provisions of this division do not apply to original Council
approvals or time extensions granted prior to the effective date of this
chapter. All original Council approvals or time extensions granted subsequent
to the effective date of this chapter are bound by the provisions of this
division.
   (B)   This request must be reviewed by the Planning Commission and a
recommendation forwarded to the City Council addressing such items as potential
conflicts with the comprehensive plan or specific area plans; potential
conflicts with policy changes; changing transportation conditions and sidewalk
policies; or applicable changes to any city, state or federal ordinances.
   (C)   The city staff may recompute park dedication fees and other financial
guarantees as required by the city code to reflect current cost estimates.
These revised costs must be included in the time extension resolution.
   (D)   Any negative escrow amounts must be paid and the escrow amount must be
brought up to current minimum requirements with the request for time extension.
   (E)   A current property owners list from Hennepin County must be submitted
every two years based upon the original date of Council approval only in
instance where such lists are necessary for the notification of owners of
property not lying within the Brooklyn Park corporate limits but within the
standard notification area.

§ 151.009 REGISTERED LAND SURVEYS.
   It is the intention of this chapter that all registered land surveys in the
city must be presented to the Planning Commission in the form of a preliminary
plat and in accordance with the standards set forth in this chapter for
preliminary plats. A registered land survey must be treated as any other
subdivision, and the Planning Commission must approve the arrangement, sizes,
and relationships of proposed tracts and such registered land surveys and
tracts to be used as easements or roads must be dedicated as in any other plat
or division. Unless such approvals in accordance with the standards set forth
in this chapter have been obtained, building permits will be withheld for
building on tracts which have been so subdivided by registered land surveys
without compliance with the ordinance and Council approval. The City Council
may refuse to take over tracts, streets, roads or to improve, repair or
maintain any such tracts or areas unless so approved.
('72 Code, § 345:88)
§ 151.010 CONVEYANCE BY METES AND BOUNDS.
   (A)   No conveyance of land, in which the land conveyed is described by
metes and bounds or by reference to a plat made after the effective date of
this chapter which has not been approved as provided herein, and no conveyance
which results in the division of a platted lot will be made or recorded unless
the parcel described in the conveyance and the residue parcel meet the
following standards:
      (1)   Was a separate parcel of record April 1, 1945, or the date of
adoption of subdivision regulations by the city under Minnesota Laws of 1945,
Chapter 287, whichever is the later;
      (2)   Was the subject of a written agreement to convey entered into prior
to such time and was recorded in the office of the County Recorder or the
Registrar of Titles within one year thereafter; or
      (3)   Was a separate parcel of not less than two and one-half acres in
area and 150 feet in width on January 1, 1966; or
      (4)   Was a separate parcel of not less than five acres in area and 300
feet in width on July 1, 1980; or
      (5)   Is a single parcel of commercial or industrial land of not less
than five acres and having a width of not less than 300 feet and its conveyance
does not result in the division of the parcel into two or more lots or parcels,
any of which is less than five acres in area or 300 feet in width; or
      (6)   Is a single parcel of residential or agricultural land of not less
than 20 acres and having a width of not less than 500 feet and its conveyance
does not result in the division of the parcel into two or more lots or parcels,
any one of which is less than 20 acres in area or 500 feet in width.
   (B)   In any case in which compliance with the foregoing restrictions will
create an unnecessary hardship and failure to comply does not interfere with
the purpose of the subdivision regulations, the City Council may waive such
compliance by adoption of a resolution to that effect pursuant to §§
151.100 et seq., and other provisions of these subdivision regulations. All
requests for waivers require a public hearing and must follow the same
procedure as required in public hearings for plats.

   (A)   With respect to parcels of land not subject to the provisions of M.S.
§ 462.358, Subd. 4b, and §
151.010 of this chapter, a building or structure must not be constructed or
erected on such parcels, nor must any building permit be issued for such
construction or erection, unless such parcels have access to a public street
which has been dedicated to and accepted by the city. This provision does not
apply if the structure is to be used solely for agricultural purposes and the
property is served by a private street or private easement.
   (B)   This requirement may be waived by the City Council if the Council
makes the following findings:
      (1)   That the proposed structure is located on a properly designed
private street, as approved by the City Engineer; and
      (2)   The development is not in conflict with the city's growth
management principles.

the approval of the final plat by the city.
   (B)   No plan will be approved for a subdivision which includes any area
subject to periodic flooding or which contains extremely poor drainage
facilities which would make adequate drainage of the streets and lots
impossible, unless the subdivider agrees to make improvements which will, in
the opinion of the City Engineer, make the area completely safe for occupancy
and provide adequate street and lot drainage and is not in conflict with the
city's flood plain regulations.

DESIGN STANDARDS
§ 151.055 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   The Planning Commission and the City Council, in their review of the
preliminary plat, will take into consideration the requirements of the
community and the best use of the land being subdivided.
   (B)   The subdivision must conform to the adopted zoning ordinance and must
be in substantial conformance to the goals and policies set forth in the
comprehensive plan.
   (C)   The arrangement, character, extent, width, and location of all streets
must be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, to
reasonable circulation of traffic, to topographic conditions, to runoff of
storm water, to public convenience and safety, and in their appropriate
relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets.
Wherever possible and necessary, the arrangement of streets in new subdivisions
must provide for the continuation of existing streets in adjoining areas. Where
adjoining unsubdivided areas may be subdivided, the arrangement of streets in a
new subdivision must make provision for the proper projection of streets into
adjoining areas by carrying the new streets to the boundaries of the new
subdivision at appropriate locations.
   (D)   No street dedications will be accepted which require a crossing of a
railroad, collector street, minor arterial, or intermediate arterial unless
sufficient land is dedicated to provide for approaches sufficient for grade
crossing or safe intersections.
   (E)   Mailbox design. The subdivider shall submit design details and plans
for mailboxes on all new residential plats. Mailboxes shall be similar in
design and be architecturally consistent with homes in the subdivision.

Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 151.056 STREETS.
   (A)   Widths. Street right-of-way widths must be as shown on the
comprehensive plan and where not shown therein, must be not less than as
follows:
      (1)   Principal Arterial: variable.
      (2)   "A" or "B" Minor Arterial: 100 feet.
      (3)   Class I Collector: 80 feet.
      (4)   Class II Collector: 70 feet (may be adjusted upwards as necessary
at intersection with arterial).
      (5)   Local street: 60 feet.
      (6)   Commercial and/or industrial street: 80 feet.
   (B)   Intersections. Insofar as practical streets must intersect at right
angles. The angle formed by the intersection of two streets must be not less
than 60 degrees. Intersections having more than four corners are prohibited.
Intersections must not be closer than 150 feet as measured from centerline to
centerline.
   (C)   Deflections. When connecting street lines deflect from each other at
any point by more than ten degrees, they must be connected by a curve with a
radius of not less than 100 feet, except in those cases specifically approved
by the City Council.
   (D)   Gradients. All center line gradients must be at least 0.5 percent and
must not exceed the following:
      (1)   Arterial streets and collector streets: four percent;
      (2)   Subdivision streets and frontage roads: six percent.
   (E)   Vertical curves. Different connecting street gradients must be
connected with vertical curves. Minimum length in feet of these curves must be
30 times the algebraic difference in the percent of grade of the two adjacent
slopes.
   (F)   Street jogs. Street jogs with center line offsets of less than 150
feet are prohibited as measured from centerline to centerline.
   (G)   Subdivision streets. Subdivision streets must be laid out so that
their use by through traffic will be discouraged.
   (H)   Cul-de-sacs. The maximum length of a street terminating in a cul-de-
sac must be 600 feet, measured from the center line of the street or origin to
the center of the cul-de-sac and must have a radius of 60 feet.
   (I)   Access to collectors or arterials. In the case where a proposed plat
is adjacent to a collector arterial street, the applicant is advised not to
direct vehicle or pedestrian access from individual lots to such thoroughfares.
Where possible, the subdivider must attempt to provide access to all lots via
subdivision streets.
   (J)   Platting of small tracts. In the platting of small tracts of land
fronting on arterials where there is no convenient access to existing entrances
and where access from such plat would be closer than one-quarter mile from an
existing access point, every effort must be made in such plats for the
connection of roads to neighboring land. As the neighboring land is platted and
developed, and access becomes possible at a preferred location, direct access
will be prohibited.
   (K)   Half streets. Half streets are prohibited except where it will be
practical to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining
property is subdivided, in which case the dedication of a half street may be
permitted. The probable length of time elapsing before dedication of the
remainder will be considered in this direction.
   (L)   Private streets. Private streets are not permitted and public
improvements will not be approved for any private street unless approved by the
City Council as part of a conditional use permit for an overall development
plan.
   (M)    Hardship to owners of adjoining property. The street arrangements
must not be such as to cause hardship of adjoining property in platting their
own land and providing convenient access to it.
   (N)   Dedication of streets. Except for private streets as designated in
§ 151.056, all proposed streets shown on the plat must be offered for
dedication as public streets.

line of any water course or drainage channel whether or not shown in the
comprehensive plan, to a width sufficient to provide proper maintenance and
protection and to provide for storm water runoff and installation and
maintenance of storm sewers. Where necessary, drainage easements corresponding
with lot lines must be provided. Such easements for drainage purposes must not
be less than five feet in width, each side of the lot line. Except where an
overall drainage and utility development plan for subdivisions have been
approved by the City Engineer, all lots must be graded in such a manner to
avoid additional drainage encroachment onto adjacent properties. This
restriction applies during, as well as after, construction is completed.
   (C)   Dedication. All easements must be dedicated for the required uses by
appropriate language on the plat, as required by M.S. § 505.03, Subd. 1.
('72 Code, § 345:52)
Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 151.059 BLOCKS.
   (A)   Length. The maximum length of a block is1,500 feet and the minimum
length is 400 feet. Blocks over 900 feet long may require pedestrian ways at
least ten feet wide at their approximate center. The use of additional
pedestrian ways to schools, parks and other destinations may be required.
   (B)   Arrangements. A block must be so designed as to provide two tiers of
lots unless it adjoins a railroad, collector or arterial street system, or
other types of barriers in the form of schools, parks, major developments,
corporate limits or other major uses, where it may have a single tier of lots.
('72 Code, § 345:55)
§ 151.060 LOTS.
   (A)   Location. All lots must abut for their full frontage on a publicly
dedicated street.
   (B)   Size. The lot dimensions must be such as to comply with the minimum
lot areas specified in the zoning ordinance. Lot square footages must be
designated on the preliminary plat. A letter must accompany the final plat,
certified by an engineer or surveyor, stating that all lot sizes meet plat
requirements.
   (C)   Transition lots. When platting is adjacent to incompatible land uses,
except parks, depth of lots must be increased to allow for space, berming or
other landscaping techniques to buffer each land use.
   (D)   Side lot lines. Side lines of lots must be substantially at right
angles to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines.
   (E)   Water courses. Lots abutting upon a water course, drainageways,
channel, or stream must have sufficient depth and width to provide a minimum
area of land not subject to flooding equal to the minimum lot dimensions
specified in the zoning ordinance for the district in which the lots are
located.
   (F)   Drainage. Lots must be graded so as to provide drainage away from
building locations. All landscaping features, such as retaining walls, and
filling or grading, within drainage and utility easements must be reviewed and
approved by the City Engineer and the City Manager.
   (G)   Natural features. In the subdividing of land, due regard must be shown
for all natural features, such as tree growth, water courses, historic spots,
or similar conditions, and plans must be adjusted to preserve those which will
add attractiveness and stability to the proposed development.
   (H)   Lot remnants. All remnants of lots below minimum size left over after
subdividing of a larger tract must be added to adjacent lots rather than
allowed to remain as unusable or non-conforming parcels.
   (I)   Adequate setbacks. All plats with lots or tracts abutting on collector
or arterial streets must have adequate width and depth to provide for the
minimum setbacks to build in accordance with all city codes.
   (J)   Minimum rear lot line. Where practical, all lots should have a minimum
of 30 feet in width at the rear lot line.
   (K)   Double frontage lots. Double frontage (lots with frontage on two
parallel streets) or reverse frontage lots are not permitted except where lots
back against a collector or arterial street. Such lots must have additional
depth to allow for screening and/or planting along the back lot line in
accordance with the Zoning Code, Environmental Quality. Vehicular access may be
restricted as a condition of the plat.
   (L)   Cul-de-sac lots. If the front line of any lot is a curve or partly a
curve with a radius of 175 feet, the frontage for purposes of minimum
requirements, will be measured at the building line. In addition thereto, the
front footage of the front lot line will be 60 feet or as modified under
special procedure provisions as established by the zoning ordinance.

§ 151.061 PUBLIC SITES AND OPEN SPACE AND PARK LAND DEDICATION.
   (A)   Public sites and open spaces. Where a proposed park, playground, or
other public site shown on the adopted comprehensive plan or official map is
embraced in part or in whole by a boundary of a proposed subdivision, and such
public sites are not dedicated to the city, such public ground must be shown as
reserved land on the preliminary plat to allow the city the opportunity to
consider and take action toward acquisition of such public ground or park by
purchase or other means prior to approval of the final plat.
   (B)   Park land dedication.
      (1)   In every plat, replat or subdivision of land allowing development
for residential, commercial, industrial, or other uses or combination thereof,
or where a waiver is granted, a reasonable portion of such land and/or cash
must be set aside and dedicated by the tract owner or owners to the general
public as open space for park and playground purposes, public open space for
park and playground purposes, public open space or public ponds, except where
adjustment to lot lines do not create additional lots.
      (2)   A minimum of ten percent of the buildable land to be used for
residential, multiple-family residential, or uses other than commercial
business or industrial purposes, is deemed a reasonable portion. BUILDABLE LAND
means the gross acreage of all property in the proposed plat or subdivision
excluding wetlands designated by federal or state agencies and those classified
by the Wetland Conservation Act. The land must be suitable for public use as
parks and playgrounds or for one of the aforedescribed purposes and the city is
not required to accept land which will not be usable for parks and playground
or which would require extensive expenditures on the part of the public to make
them usable. The city has the option to require cash contribution in lieu of
setting aside dedicated land or in requiring a part of the land as a parkland
dedication and the balance of the land value in cash. Any such cash
contribution will be a set amount determined annually based on a minimum of ten
percent of the total fair market land value of the land within such plat,
replat, waiver or subdivision, for residential and multiple-family residential
uses. The amount is then established by equating the fair market value to a per
unit fee based on the net density. In establishing the amount of land to be
dedicated or preserved or the amount of the cash contribution, the city will
give due consideration to the open space, recreational, or common areas and
facilities proposed by the applicant to be open to the public.
      (3)   Any park dedication money so paid to the city must be placed in a
special fund. The money shall be used only for:
         (a)   The acquisition of land for parks and playgrounds;
         (b)    Development of existing park and playground sites or
facilities;
         (c)   Redevelopment or rehabilitation of existing park and playground
sites or facilities; or
         (d)   Debt retirement in connection with land previously acquired for
parks and playgrounds.
      (4)   The city must require a minimum cash park dedication for commercial
or industrial plats or waivers of 5% of fair market land value. However, where
the City Council deems it in the public interest (i.e. comprehensive plan or
flood plain ordinance), it may require a minimum land dedication of five
percent of the commercial or industrial land to be subdivided in lieu of a cash
dedication. The lands must be indicated on the city's comprehensive plan or
amendments, or must be designated on specific area plans for flood plain
preservation, parks, trails, public open space or any combination thereof.
      (5)   Any lands which obtain a waiver of the subdivision requirements are
subject to these regulations for the land being subdivided.
      (6)   Park dedication determinations (cash or land) are made by the city
at the time of presentation of preliminary plats. If land is the required
contribution, the property must be deeded to the city at the time of final plat
approval. If cash in lieu of land is required, the amount will be determined
upon the amounts set forth in this chapter in place at the time of application
for final plat and paid as a part of the approval of the final plat.
      (7)   For purposes of this section, FAIR MARKET LAND VALUE is defined as
the market value of the land within such plat, replat, or subdivision as of the
date the preliminary plat, replat, or subdivision is presented to the City
Council for approval. The City Assessor must establish values in the same
manner as the Assessor determines the market value of the land for tax
purposes, excluding, in determining such value, all value added to such land by
improvements other than utilities, streets, and other public improvements
serving such land, but including in such determination the highest and best use
for which the land can be used under the existing zoning districts.
      (8)   The city must annually review the here and after stated fees and
determine that they are consistent with current “fair market land values.” The
required park dedication fees must be established after review of current
values by the City Assessor, who must advise the City Council of current values
for the different zoning classifications.
      (9)   Land areas dedicated as park land must be based on the
comprehensive plan, the Mississippi River Critical Area Plan, or subsequent
localized planning studies.
      (10)   Upon the advice of the City Assessor, the park dedication fees are
as established by the fee resolution set forth as an Appendix to this code.
      (11)   Park land dedication or a cash contribution is not required on an
existing residential parcel that is being subdivided if park land dedication on
the parcel has previously been satisfied or if a house will remain on the
parcel after it has been subdivided. Park land dedication or a cash
contribution will be required for any new lots created by the subdivision.

ROAD NAMING AND HOUSE NUMBERING
§ 151.070 ROAD DESIGNATIONS.
   (A)   The use of avenue, parkway, trail, drive, boulevard, way, court,
terrace and circle suffixes must be used in identifying location and direction
of roads.
   (B)   Roads must be designated as follows:
      (1)   Roads that run north and south are alphabetical avenues or
terraces.
      (2)   Roads that run east and west are numerical avenues, trails or ways.
      (3)   Roads that both originate and terminate on the same street, avenue
or boulevard, are circles.
      (4)   Cul-de-sacs (dead ends) are named courts.
      (5)   A road must have only one name for its entire length.
      (6)   Two roads must not be named alike, that is, have the same name or
have similar sounding names.
      (7)   The name of a road may change only if the road changes direction 45
degrees or more at the point of deviation.
      (8)   All private roads must be labeled lanes and must maintain numerical
and alphabetical sequence.
      (9)   Meandering roads must be labeled boulevard, drive or parkway.
      (10)    If the proposed street is an extension of an existing named
street that name must be used. In all other cases the name of any street
previously used within the county must not be used, unless such use is
consistent with the county or community street naming system.
      (11)    The above named requirements may be modified in cases where the
Fire and/or Police Departments recommend modifications to facilitate their
providing for the safety of occupants of the subdivided lands. In some areas,
changing the name of a street would confuse rather than assist the Fire and
Police Departments.
('72 Code, § 345:61(1))
§ 151.071 HOUSE NUMBERING SYSTEM.
   The standard method of assigning house numbers to each side of the street is
as follows:
   (A)   On the east and west avenue, the even numbers to be assigned to the
north side of the avenue and the odd numbers assigned to the south side of the
avenue.
   (B)   On the north and south avenue, the even numbers to be assigned to the
east side of the avenue and the odd numbers assigned to the west side of the
avenue.
   (C)   On avenues with a deviation of more than 45 degrees from the north-
south base line, the even numbers to be assigned to the north side of the
avenue and the odd numbers assigned to the south side of the avenue.
   (D)   On avenues with a deviation of 45 degrees or less from the north side
base line, the even numbers to be assigned to the east side of the avenue and
the odd number to be assigned to the west side of the avenue.
   (E)   Circle streets are assigned numbers in staggered sequence to the
number sequence of the drive, avenue or parkway on which it originates and
terminates.
   (F)   Dead end roads are assigned numbers as if the road continued through,
beginning with the smallest number of sequence at the road origin.
   (G)   Courts are assigned numbers conforming to the numerical sequence of
the drive, avenue or parkway on which it originates.
   (H)   On a street that deviates 45 degrees or more (measured at the point of
deviation) the number sequence will change accordingly.
   (I)   One-family dwellings and duplexes: one number will be assigned to each
residential unit determined by the location of the principal entrance.
   (J)   Multiple-family dwellings: a number will be assigned to the entire
structure with individual numbers or letters assigned to each dwelling unit
starting with the number “1.” Multiple dwelling units consisting of two or more
floors must designate each floor starting from the bottom up in a sequential
order.
   (K)   Hotels and motels: a number will be assigned to the front entrance of
the hotel and motel with individual numbers of letters assigned to each unit
starting with the number “1.”
   (L)   Business structures: a number will be assigned to each entrance, but
only one number per building establishment for each street frontage.

a number determined by the location of the fronting entrance measured from the
preceding grid line.
   (N)   Blocks: a structure located on the entire length or width of a grid
block will be assigned a number determined by the location of the fronting
entrance.
   (O)   Corner lots: a structure located on a corner lot will be assigned a
number determined by the principal entrance. If the structure is so located
that it would be considered fronting on either street, then it would be
assigned a number determined by the north-south number sequence.
   (P)   Each principal building or structure must display address numbers.
Address numbers must be a minimum of four inches in height. Address numbers
must be placed on the structure with an unobstructed view from the street.
Numbers must be illuminated, reflectorized or of a contrasting color to the
background. Background must maintain a minimum six inch perimeter around
numbers.

REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS
§ 151.085 PURPOSE.
   M.S. § 462.358, Subd. 2A, authorizes the city to condition approval of the
subdivision of property on the construction and installation of certain
utilities. The intent of this section is to specifically set out the required
improvements which promote and protect the public health, safety and general
welfare. The city reserves the right to require additional improvements if
deemed necessary by circumstances and conditions unique to these particular
lands. No subdivision of land is allowed unless storm sewer, sanitary sewer and
a municipal water supply are constructed to serve the area being divided unless
some other ordinance or statute specifically authorizes said division.
('72 Code, § 345:64) (Am. Ord. 1984-447(A), passed 4-9-84)
§ 151.086 LISTED AND DESCRIBED.
   Prior to the approval of a final plat by the City Council, the subdivider
must have agreed in the manner set forth below to install, in conformity with
utility construction plans approved by the City Engineer and in conformity with
all applicable standards and ordinances of the City of Brooklyn Park, the
improvements on the site, as described in this section as follows:
   (A)   Monuments. Monuments of a permanent character as required by M.S. §
505.02, must be placed at each corner or angle on the outside boundary of the
subdivision and pipes or steel rods must be placed at each corner of each lot
and each intersection of street center lines.
   (B)   Streets and alleys. The full width of the right-of-way of each street
and alley dedicated in the plat must be graded and improved. All streets and
alleys must have an adequate sub-base and must be improved with an all-weather
permanent surface in accordance with the design standards specified by the
Minnesota Department of Transportation Specifications for Highway Construction
on file in the office of the City Engineer. Boulevard areas must be sodded
including those areas under state and county jurisdiction.
   (C)   Curb and gutter. A concrete curb and gutter must be installed on both
sides of each street dedicated in the plat.
   (D)   Water supply.
      (1)   Water mains must be provided to serve the subdivision by extension
of an existing community system. Service connections must be stubbed into the
property line and all necessary fire hydrants must also be provided. Extensions
of the public water supply system must be designed so as to provide public
water in accordance with the standards of the City of Brooklyn Park.
      (2)   In areas being platted for rural estate development with large
lots, as specified in the zoning ordinance, individual wells must be provided
on each lot, properly placed in relationship to the individual sewage disposal
facilities on the same and adjoining lots. Well location plans must be
submitted for approval to the Building Department.
   (E)   Sewage disposal.
      (1)   Sanitary sewer mains and service connections must be installed to
serve all the lots in the subdivision and must be connected to the public
system.
      (2)   In areas being platted for rural estate development with large
lots, as specified in the zoning ordinance, individual on-site sewage disposal
facilities must be provided for each lot, properly located with reference to
the wells on the same and adjoining lots, and the disposal facilities on
adjacent lots. The subdivider must have made and submit the results of tests to
ascertain subsurface soil, rock and ground water conditions in such a
subdivision. Plans for individual on-site facilities must be submitted for the
approval of the City Engineer and the Building Department and must comply with
all requirements of the Minnesota Department of Health.
   (F)   Drainage. The grade and drainage requirements for each plat must be
established by the City Engineer at the expense of the applicant. Every plat
presented for final signature must be accompanied by a certificate of the City
Engineer that the grade and drainage requirements have been met. In an area not
having municipal storm sewer trunk service, the applicant is responsible,
before platting, to provide for a storm water disposal plan, without damage to
properties outside the platted area, and the storm water disposal plan must be
submitted to the City Engineer who must report to the Council on the
feasibility of the plan presented. No plat will be approved before an adequate
storm water disposal plan is presented to and approved by the City Engineer and
City Council. The use of dry wells for the purpose of storm water disposal is
prohibited.
   (G)   Landscaping.
      (1)   Two trees, balled and burlapped, must be planted or exist within
the front yard setback of each newly created single family lot and must be at
least two and one-half inch caliper as measured in accordance with the most
current edition of American Standard for Nursery Stock. Two trees, balled and
burlapped, of one and one-half inch caliper may be substituted for one of the
required two and one-half inch trees. Trees must not be planted within public
rights-of-way except by specific City Council approval.
      (2)   The city contains a number of cottonwood trees which are weed trees
and which have a tuft of cotton hairs on the seed. These tufts of cotton hairs
become airborne and float to other properties, fouling up air conditioning
units and other mechanical devices which need to breathe, and are a general
nuisance. Cottonwood trees or members of the cottonwood tree family which have
these tufts of cotton hairs on their seeds must not planted in the subdivision
or in the city, and the subdivider is encouraged to remove any such trees which
are located within the subdivision.
   (H)   Traffic control and street signs. Traffic control signs pursuant to
M.S. § 169.06 and street signs of standard design approved by the City of
Brooklyn Park must be installed at each street intersection or at such other
locations within the subdivision as designated by the Director of Public Works.
   (I)   Shorelines. Where a subdivision includes any portion of the shoreline
of a meandered stream, or river, no less than 5 percent of the portion of the
shoreline lying within a subdivision may be dedicated for use by the public
along with sufficient land to allow access to a publicly dedicated street. This
land may be a part of, or equal to, the percent of land or cash requirement per
acre required for dedication as public land under §
151.071 of this chapter.
   (J)   Public utilities. All utility lines for franchised utility services
must be placed underground and may be placed in the street right-of-way or
adjacent easements. However, first consideration for the placement of all
franchised utilities will be within easements along rear lot lines. Allowances
are made for appurtenances and associated equipment such as surface mounted
transformers, pedestal mounted terminal boxes and meter cabinets. All above-
ground equipment associated with the provision of franchised utility services
within newly created subdivisions must be screened from ground level view when
such equipment is adjacent to and/or visible from a public right-of- way. Live
plant material, which at maturity will provide the necessary screening, must be
used for this purpose.
   (K)   Street lights. Street lights must be installed per city specifications
at all intersections and at other locations as required by the City Engineer.
The city strongly encourages the use of decorative lighting fixtures.
   (L)   Sidewalks. All plats with lots or tracts abutting on principal
arterials, "A" or "B" minor arterials, Class I and II collectors, or commercial
and/or industrial streets must have concrete sidewalks installed on both sides
of the dedicated street right-of-way in accordance with city specifications.
Sidewalks will be required on one side of the right-of-way of local streets
where it is necessary to provide linkages to proposed or existing trail systems
or sidewalks, resulting in a continuous pedestrian network within and between
subdivisions. However, sidewalks will not be required on residential cul-de-sac
streets which do not exceed 600 feet in length.
   (M)    Driveways. In all subdivisions the subdivider must provide concrete
or bituminous driveways in accordance with the following standards:
      (1)   There must be installed a concrete or bituminous driveway extending
from the back of the curb or from the edge of the service street to the garage
floor or garage floor apron for each lane or lanes of vehicular access to the
street. If a building permit is issued and no garage is to be constructed, the
concrete or bituminous driveway must be completed to the depth of the front
yard setback as established in the zoning code of the city.
      (2)   No curb or driveway opening into any public street may be made
unless the aforesaid construction of concrete or bituminous apron is installed
in accordance with the preceding subdivision.
      (3)   All concrete or bituminous driveways must be constructed in
accordance with the city specifications and reference therein to the Minnesota
Department of Transportation Specifications for Highway Construction. The plans
and specifications are on file in the office of the City Engineer.
   (N)   Walkways-pedestrian ways. Walkways must be incorporated into
subdivisions for the purpose of enhancing pedestrian travel through and between
subdivisions, to provide linkages to residential sidewalk systems and to
enhance the quality of life through their value as residential and recreational
amenities. Walkway locations must be determined by the City Council in
accordance with these guidelines. Installation of a walkway should be completed
by the developer prior to the sale of the abutting properties and designated on
the approved plat as a walkway easement. Specifications for location and
construction are as follows:
      (1)   Public walkway to a park or school must be provided at a separation
distance of no greater than 1,000 feet from another existing or proposed
walkway or sidewalk access. Exact distance is at the discretion of the City
Council.
      (2)   Walkways must be constructed of bituminous or concrete material in
accordance with city specifications.
      (3)   Fencing or shrubs will be considered at the discretion of the City
Council.
      (4)   The unsurfaced area within the walkway easement must be sodded.
      (5)   The minimum corridor width for all trails and walkways must be at
least 30 feet.
      (6)   Walkways must be maintained by the city in cooperation with the
adjacent property owner unless otherwise agreed to as part of an approved
conditional use permit development.
   (O)   Sodding of single family lots. All lots for new single family homes
must be sodded from the public curb to the rear property line except as
follows:
      (1)   In the R-1 District.
      (2)   Existing native plant communities. Existing native plant
communities and ecosystems maintained in the natural state do not require sod.
Native plant communities may be reestablished as a part of site development.
      (3)   Contiguous, undeveloped areas which have been disturbed during
construction and are equal to or larger than one-third of the total size area
must be seeded and maintained as a minimum. Disturbed areas less than one-third
of the total area must be sodded and maintained. Within these undeveloped areas
the following must be sodded: berms, swales, drainage ponds with slopes greater
than four to one; and on corner lots all green areas in the yard abutting the
public right-of-way from the front street curb to the rear property line and
from the side street curb to the existing building setback.
      (4)   All open areas of the site not sodded or used as gardens must be
planted with an approved ground cover. Ground cover must be planted in such a
manner as to present a finished appearance and reasonably complete coverage
within 12 months after planting with proper erosion control during plant
establishment. Exceptions include areas designated as wetland, existing wooded
areas or undisturbed areas containing natural vegetation, all of which must be
maintained free of foreign and noxious materials as defined in
Chapter 97 of this code.
      (5)   Landscape rock and mulch may be substituted for sod in shrub and
flower planting beds and building maintenance strips.

§ 151.087 PAYMENT FOR INSTALLATION.
   The required improvements to be furnished and installed by the subdivider,
which are listed and described above, are to be furnished and installed at the
sole expense of the subdivider and at no expense to the city provided, however,
that in the case of an improvement the cost of which would, by general policy
of the city, be assessed only in part to the improved property and the
remaining cost paid out of general tax levy, the City Council may make
provision for payment of a portion of the cost by the city. If any improvement
installed within the subdivision will be of substantial benefit to lands beyond
the boundaries of the subdivision, the City Council may make provision for
causing a portion of the cost of the improvement representing the benefit to
such lands to be assessed against the same and in such case the subdivider will
be required only to pay for such portions of the whole cost of the improvements
as will represent the benefit to the property within the subdivision.
('72 Code, § 345:67)
§ 151.088 ENTRYWAY SIGNS; DEDICATION AND MAINTENANCE.
   For every plat or subdivision of land in which there is to be placed a
permanent entryway identification sign, a homeowners association or similar
body shall be established to assume sole responsibility for the construction
and maintenance of such sign(s). Estimated costs for sign construction shall be
incorporated into the calculation of on-site development bonds.

§ 151.089 AGREEMENT PROVIDING FOR PROPER INSTALLATION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Prior to installation of any required improvements, the subdivider
must enter into a development contract prepared by the city and must submit the
sureties required by §
151.090 of this chapter.
   (B)   The development contract shall require the subdivider to furnish and
construct the improvements at the sole cost of the subdivider and in accordance
with the plans and specifications approved by the City Council. The development
contract shall provide for sufficient funds to be escrowed to cover the cost of
construction. The City Engineer may require the developer to have their
contractor or subcontractor coordinate the work to be done under the contract
and also coordinate any other work being done or contracted by the city in the
vicinity.
   (C)   In accordance with the terms of the contract, the subdivider must
provide sureties to the city as set forth in §
151.090 of this chapter. A reduction to the sureties prior to the recording of
the final plat may be granted to the subdivider, at the subdividers request,
based on completion of part or all of the off-site improvements which have been
accepted and approved by the city. If any work begins prior to final platting,

a cash bond escrow to be held in a non- interest bearing account, and 95% of
the total shall be posted as cash, an irrevocable letter of credit, a
subdivision bond or a performance bond. This financial security must be
automatically renewed and shall not expire until released by the city. This
surety must be filed with the city prior to release of the final plat for
recording.
         (b)   Items covered by this surety must include, but not be limited
to, landscaping as required by resolution, mailboxes, utility repair,
adjustment and lot grading, as well as costs for any entryway sign. These
financial guarantees are for all of the improvements to be furnished and
installed by the subdivider, pursuant to the development contract, and which
have not been completed prior to filing of the final plat.
         (c)   The city is entitled to reimburse itself out of the cash bond
escrow for any cost and expense incurred by the city for completion of the work

the city, held in a non-interest bearing special subdivider's cash escrow
account, and credited to the subdivider. The engineering/administrative escrow

charged to the engineering/administrative escrow account and must be credited
to the City of Brooklyn Park.
      (3)   The Council must promulgate and adopt a set of rules, regulations
and fees for services rendered by city personnel, and the rules, regulations
and fee schedules must be on file with the City Clerk for inspection. A copy
thereof must be furnished upon request to the subdivider. The city must itemize
all time, services and materials billed to any subdivider's cash escrow
account. The subdivider making the deposit(s) in the subdivider's cash escrow
account must, upon request, be furnished a copy of the itemized charges.
      (4)   If, at any time, the balance in the engineering/administrative
escrow account is depleted to less than 5% of the originally required cash
escrow amount, the subdivider must deposit additional funds in the account in
an amount as determined by the City Manager, sufficient to cover all costs to
be incurred by the city in processing the final plat.

and accepted, all cash escrow monies, for that portion accepted by the city,
may be reduced by the City Council and full or partial payment be returned to

('72 Code, § 345:79)
VARIANCES
§ 151.100 VARIANCES GENERALLY.
   (A)   The City Council may grant a variance from the regulations contained
in this chapter following a finding that all of the following conditions exist:
      (1)   There are unique circumstances or conditions affecting the
property, such that the strict application of the provisions of this chapter
would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of the applicant’s land.
      (2)   The variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a
substantial property right of the petitioner.
      (3)   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
welfare or injurious to the other property in the territory in which the
property is situated and will not have an adverse effect upon traffic or
traffic safety.
   (B)   In making this finding, the City Council must consider the nature of
the proposed use of the land and existing use of the land in the vicinity, the
number of persons who reside or work in the area, and the probable effect of
the proposed variance upon traffic conditions in the vicinity.
   (C)   In granting variances as herein provided, the Council must prescribe
conditions that it deems desirable or necessary to protect the public interest.
In making a determination, the Council must find that:
      (1)   The proposed project will constitute a desirable and stable
community development.
      (2)   The proposed project will be in harmony with adjacent areas.
   (D)   The application for any variance must be made in writing and addressed
to the Planning Commission and the City Council and must be submitted to the
Department of Community Development. The application must include the specific
variances requested, the location of those variances and how it varies from the
provisions of the chapter. The written application must be submitted to the
Planning Commission for their advice and recommendation and the Planning
Commission must report on the provisions set forth above. The Planning
Commission must submit their recommendations to the City Council within 60 days
after receiving the written application and required exhibits from the
Department of Community Development.
('72 Code, § 345:85) (Am. Ord. 1984-447(A), passed 4-9-84)
§ 151.101 FEES.
   Applications for variances, subdivisions, or waivers from the subdivision
regulations must be accompanied by a fee as established by the City Council and
§
151.014 of this chapter.
('72 Code, § 345:86) (Ord. 1972-123(A), passed 8-28-72)
§ 151.102 VARIANCE FOR CERTAIN HOMESTEADS.
   (A)   Purpose. The city has been a leader in the development of planning
controls in the metropolitan area. The city was developed and has continued to
develop with agricultural lands and large parcels of land located north of 85th
Avenue North. The city recognizes that certain parcels and lands were divided
and developed prior to the adoption of modern subdivision and zoning ordinances
and that certain residents are burdened with parcels of land too large for a
normal homestead but too small to create a viable or economic agricultural
unit. This section regulates parcels of land less than 20 acres. It is
determined that parcels of land which meet the following criteria are eligible
for a one time variance pursuant to procedures set forth in §
151.100:
      (1)   Are larger than five acres in size.
      (2)   Have a homestead constructed prior to January 1, 1974.
      (3)   Can be divided with a residue parcel at least five acres in size.
The residue parcel as herein referred to and described must not be the parcel
upon which the homestead is located.
      (4)   The parcel with the homestead structure must meet the zoning
requirements of 13,500 square foot lot with 100 feet of street frontage and
setback requirements for the district in which it is located.
      (5)   No more than one non-conforming use may be created.
      (6)   Homestead as used herein refers to a structure used as a dwelling
and not to the tax status of the parcel.
   (B)   Variances and non-conforming use. Variances granted for the
aforedescribed purpose will result in the creation of one non-conforming parcel
containing a structure built prior to January 1, 1974 which meets the
aforementioned requirements. The parcel is not considered as non-conforming in
non-urban areas but rather than be required to meet all the requirements of the
district in which it is located. No more than one variance will be granted for
the purposes set forth in this section.

§ 152.204 NON-CONFORMITIES.
   (A)   Authority. This section is pursuant to M.S. § 462.357.
      (1)   Non-conforming uses. Except as otherwise provided by law, any non-
conformity, including the lawful use or occupation of land or premises existing
at the time of the adoption of an additional control under this chapter, may be
continued, including through repair, replacement, restoration, maintenance, or
improvement, but not including expansion, unless:
         (a)   The non-conformity or occupancy is discontinued for a period of
more than one year; or
         (b)   Any non-conforming use is destroyed by fire or other peril to
the extent of greater than 50% of its estimated market value, as indicated in
the records of the County Assessor at the time of damage, and no building
permit has been applied for within 180 days of when the property is damaged. In
this case, reasonable condition may be imposed upon a zoning or building permit
to mitigate any newly created impact on adjacent property or water body.
         (c)   Any established use legally existing prior to adoption of this
chapter and which is herein classified by this chapter as requiring a
conditional use permit may be continued in like fashion and activity. Any
change to such a use shall require a new conditional use permit be processed
according to §
152.305.
         (d)   Any established use legally existing prior to adoption of this
chapter and which is herein classified by this chapter as requiring an interim
use permit may be continued in like fashion and activity. Any change to such a
use or building shall require a new IUP be processed according to §
152.306.
   (B)   Non-conforming structures. Expansion of an existing non-conforming
structure, reconstruction of a partially destroyed non-conforming structure, or
other intensification of a site may be subject to M.S. § 394.36.
      (1)   Non-conforming principal structures may not be enlarged or altered
in a way that increases their non-conformity unless in compliance with the
following:
         (a)   Expansion or alteration of buildings found to be non-conforming
only by reason of height, setback or lot area may be permitted, provided the
structural non-conformity is not increased and the expansion complies with the
performance standards of this chapter.
         (b)   Legal non-conforming single-family and two-family dwellings may
be expanded or altered to improve the livability provided the non-conformity of
the structure is not increased.
         (c)   The expansion or alteration must follow the requirements of §§
152.300 -
152.312.
      (2)   A non-conforming structure which has deteriorated or is damaged to
the extent of 50% or more of its market value (excluding land value) as
determined by the City Manager may be replaced or reconstructed only in
compliance with this chapter.
      (3)   Any non-conforming structure which is damaged to an extent of less
than 50% of its value, excluding land, as determined by the City Manager may be
restored to its former foundation footprint, structure height, and gross floor
area if building permit is issued within six months of the date of documented
damage.
   (C)   Non-conforming lot of record.
      (1)   Any lot which was legally created but became non-conforming due to
changes in area or dimensional requirements because of the adoption of this
chapter may be subject to the following:
         (a)   May be combined for tax purposes with a contiguous parcel or
parcels but may not be re-subdivided into a non-conforming lot even if the
division is consistent with the original lot configurations.
         (b)   If an owner has an interest in more than one lot of record
contiguous to other lots of record, all such lots must be combined to meet the
requirements of this section or the provisions of the zoning district in which
the property is located, whichever is more restrictive. If sufficient
contiguous property is held in one ownership to comply with the provision of
the zoning district where the property is located, the zoning district
provisions will apply. In no circumstances will there be approval of any
proposal for multiple lot developments based upon lots of record, and not
conforming with the provisions of the existing zoning district.
         (c)   A vacant lot may be used for a single-family detached dwelling
(if permitted by the district regulations), if the lot area or width
measurements meet at least 75% of the requirements for both the lot area and
width requirements.
         (d)   Additions to principal or accessory buildings or structures
located on non-conforming lots may be permitted provided that any such addition
will meet all minimum setback requirements of the zoning district in which it
is located.
         (e)   If the lot is non-conforming due to public action after the lot
was created or has no buildable area outside the flood plain or critical area
overlay setbacks, then no variance may be required for the reconstruction of a
single-family dwelling on a non-conforming lot that is damaged to the extent of
50% or more of its market value (excluding land value), so long as the
replacement dwelling has a footprint, building height and gross floor area size
equal to that of the destroyed dwelling.
   (D)   Non-conforming site improvements.
      (1)   If non-conforming uses, structures, or buildings suffer damage to
at least 50% of the value of the structure excluding land, as determined by the
City Assessor, or the property owner applies for a building addition or an
accessory structure amounting to 25% of the value of the principal structure,
the site must be brought into conformance with the requirements of this
chapter. At no time will a building or grading permit be issued if the proposed
construction will increase any non- conformity on the site.
      (2)   Upon any change in occupancy, non-conforming paved parking areas
may continue to be used without improvement if the number of parking spaces
supplied remains adequate according to the regulations in this chapter, and the
paved surface has not, in the city's judgment, deteriorated so as to be beyond
repair. If the parking lot cannot be repaired for the new occupancy, then the
parking lot surface must be replaced or otherwise brought into compliance with
this chapter.
      (3)   A building permit may be issued for a portion of a multiple
occupancy building without bringing the existing site improvements for the
entire property into compliance with this chapter so long as no non-conformity
is increased. If a multiple occupancy building becomes completely vacant, its
site improvements must be brought into compliance with this chapter prior to
any future occupancy.
      (4)   When expansion of existing sites occurs, the newly constructed
portion of the site improvements must fully comply with all of the requirements
of this chapter, unless the expansion portion of the property contains physical
limitations that make full compliance unfeasible, then site plan review shall
be required to determine the level of compliance required as approved by the
Planning Commission and City Council.
   (E)   Non-conformities in the Flood Hazard Overlay.
      (1)   Structures in the designated floodway may be considered non-
conforming uses.
      (2)   All reconstruction in the Flood Hazard Overlay must comply with
Minn. Rules parts 6120.5000 - 6120.6200. The only acceptable method of
elevating the lowest floor, including the basement (as defined for the Flood
Hazard Overlay), is with the placement of earthen materials (fill). Other
methods require a variance.
      (3)   Reconstruction commences within one year of the date of the
destruction of the original building and reasonable progress must be made in
completing the project for this division to be applicable. A building permit
must be obtained prior to construction of the new dwelling and the new
structure must be constructed in compliance with all other city codes
regulations.
(Ord. 2024-1304, passed 7-29-24)
§ 152.205 NUISANCES.
   (A)   No use may use or create noise, dust, vibration, odor, glare,
electrical interference, fire hazards, garbage, hazardous chemicals that exceed
standards published in the city code, or by the PCA or Department of Health
standards.
   (B)   No use may create traffic or parking congestion to a degree that
cannot be proportionally accommodated by adjacent street or private driveways
and garages.
   (C)   No use may create any other public health, safety or general welfare
hazard or nuisance to any greater or more frequent extent than that usually
experienced in an average dwelling unit or private garage, sewer, or water
services under normal circumstances wherein no vocation or avocation exists in
the zoning district where the vocation or avocation exists, except as
superseded by state or county ordinance, statute, or law.

(Ord. 2024-1304, passed 7-29-24)
§ 152.305 CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT.
   (A)   Purpose. Pursuant to M.S. § 462.3595, the purpose of this section is
to provide regulations which govern the procedure and requirements for the
review and approval, or denial, of proposed conditional uses.
   (B)   Applicability. Only the specific uses classified as "conditional" in
the zoning district where the property is located may qualify for a conditional
use permit.
   (C)   Review authority. The Planning Commission shall review and make
recommendation to City Council. The City Council shall have the review and
approval authority to grant conditional use permits.
   (D)   Review standards. The Planning Commission and City Council shall
consider the following factors when making its determination on a conditional
use permit application:
      (1)   Consistency with the Comprehensive Plan;
      (2)   Traffic generation, volume, and safety associated with the use and
driveway location on adjacent roads, sidewalks, and trail connections;
      (3)   The characteristics of the parking area of the use, including the
number and design of parking spaces, landscaping, traffic circulation,
drainage, and lighting;
      (4)   The provision of adequate public infrastructure to the site where
the use is proposed;
      (5)   The ability to screen and buffer incompatible off-site impacts of
the proposed use on adjacent property and the surrounding neighborhood;
      (6)   The degree that the site or building associated with the proposed
use meets or exceed the architectural design standards for the district in
which it is located; and
      (7)   Compliance with any other applicable section of this chapter or the
city code.
   (E)   Conditions. The Planning Commission may recommend, and the City
Council may impose, reasonable conditions relating to this chapter. Such
conditions must be related to the purpose of the chapter and be based on
factual evidence. The city may, however, impose conditions that are additional
to or above those standards contained in this chapter.
   (F)   Permit issuance. Conditional use permits shall be issued by resolution
of the City Council and shall include the legal description of the property
included.
   (G)   Recordation. A certified copy of all conditional use permits shall be
recorded with the Hennepin County Recorder prior to issuance of a building
permit.
   (H)   Construction. No building or grading permit can be issued except in

   (I)   Duration. The conditional use permit remains with the property as long
as the property and use comply with the conditions attached to the permit by
the City Council.
   (J)   Certification. Upon request by the City Manager, the holder of a
conditional use permit certifies that the use, building, and site are in
conformance with the conditional use permit and city codes, in conjunction with
§
152.204. The City Manager may maintain copies of the city policy concerning
certification.
   (K)   Revocation.
      (1)   The city may revoke a conditional use permit if there is not
substantial compliance with conditions. The revocation must be based upon
factual evidence, after appropriate notice and public hearing per §
152.302.
      (2)   If the city finds that exigent circumstances exist requiring
immediate permit revocation, the city may revoke the permit and provides a post
revocation hearing before the City Council not more than 15 days after holder's
receipt of written notice of the hearing. Following such hearing, the City
Council may sustain or rescind the revocation, or may impose such other and
further discipline as it deems appropriate.
      (3)   Any decision to impose a penalty or other discipline must be in
writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record.
   (L)   Amendment. Holders of a conditional use permit may propose amendments
to the approved permit at any time, subject to the procedures of §
152.302, except where administrative site plan review may be granted as
outlined in §
152.303(G).
   (M)   Changes in zoning classification. In the event a property is rezoned
to a district where the use becomes permitted, or a text amendment makes the
use permitted in the zoning district, the conditional use permit is voided.
(Ord. 2024-1304, passed 7-29-24)
§ 152.306 INTERIM USE PERMIT.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of interim use permits is:
      (1)   To allow a use for a brief period of time until a permanent
location is obtained or while the permanent location is under construction.
      (2)   To allow a use that is presently judged acceptable by the City
Council, but that with anticipated development or redevelopment will not be
acceptable in the future or will be replaced in the future by a permitted or
conditional use allowed within the respective district.
      (3)   To allow a use that complies with the Comprehensive Plan, provided
that said use maintains harmony and compatibility with surrounding uses and is
in keeping with the architectural character and design standards of existing
uses and development.
   (B)   Applicability. An interim use permit applies to those uses that fit
the criteria of division (A), above.
   (C)   Review standards. The Planning Commission and City Council shall
consider the following factors when making its determination on an interim use
permit application:
      (1)   The use conforms to the zoning regulations;
      (2)   The date or event that will terminate the use can be identified
with certainty;
      (3)   Permission of the use will not impose additional costs on the
public if it is necessary for the public to take the property in the future;
and
      (4)   The user agrees to any conditions that the governing body deems
appropriate for permission of the use.
   (D)   Conditions. The Planning Commission may recommend, and the City
Council may impose, reasonable conditions relating to this chapter. Such
conditions must be related to the purpose of the chapter and be based on
factual evidence. The city may, however, impose conditions that are additional
to or above those standards contained in this chapter.
   (E)   Duration. An interim use permit shall terminate on the happening of
any of the following events, whichever occurs first:
      (1)   The date stated in the interim use permit;
      (2)   Upon violation of conditions under which the permit was issued;
      (3)   Upon change in the city's zoning regulations, which render the use
non-conforming; or
      (4)   The redevelopment of the use and property.
   (F)   Changes in zoning classification. In the event a property is rezoned
to a district where the use becomes permitted, or a text amendment makes the
use permitted in the zoning district, the interim use permit is voided.
(Ord. 2024-1304, passed 7-29-24)
§ 152.307 VARIANCE.
   (A)   Purpose. Pursuant to M.S. § 462.357, Subd. 6, as it may be amended
from time to time, the City Council, acting as a Board of Appeals and
Adjustments, may issue variances from the provisions of this zoning code. A
variance is a modification or variation of the provisions of this zoning code
as applied to a specific piece of property.
   (B)   Review standards.
      (1)   Variances shall only be permitted:
         (a)   When they are in harmony with the general purposes and intent of
the chapter; and
         (b)   When the variances are consistent with the Comprehensive Plan.
      (2)   Variances may be granted when the applicant for the variance
establishes that there are practical difficulties in complying with the zoning
code. Practical difficulties, as used in connection with the granting of a
variance, means that:
         (a)   The property owner proposes to use the property in a reasonable
manner not permitted by this chapter;
         (b)   The plight of the landowner is due to circumstances unique to
the property not created by the landowner;
         (c)   The variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character
of the locality;
         (d)   Economic considerations alone do not constitute practical
difficulties; and
         (e)   Practical difficulties include, but are not limited to,
inadequate access to direct sunlight for solar energy systems.
   (C)   Conditions. The City Council may impose conditions in the granting of
variances. A condition must be directly related to and must bear a rough
proportionality to the impact created by the variance. No building permit may
be issued except in compliance with the conditions of the variance.
   (D)   Variances for communication towers.
      (1)   Initial criteria. The City Council may grant a variance to the
setback, separation or buffer requirements, and/or maximum height provision of
this subdivision based on the criteria set forth elsewhere in this chapter.
      (2)   Additional criteria. In addition to taking the criteria set forth
in §
152.1026 into consideration, the City Council may also grant a variance if the
applicant demonstrates with written or other satisfactory evidence that:
         (a)   The location, shape, appearance or nature of the use of the
proposed tower will not substantially detract from the aesthetics of the area
nor change the character of the neighborhood in which the tower is proposed to
be located;
         (b)   The variance will not create a threat to the public health,
safety, or welfare;
         (c)   If the request is for a modification to the setbacks, the size
of the parcel upon which the tower is proposed to be located makes compliance
impossible, and the only alternative for the applicant is to locate the tower
at another site that poses a greater threat to the public health, safety or
welfare or is closer in proximity to residentially zoned land;
         (d)   If the request is for a modification of separation requirements,
the applicant must provide technical evidence from an engineer that the
proposed tower and antennas must be located at the proposed site in order to
meet the coverage needs of the applicant's wireless communications system. The
applicant must also submit a landscape plan showing buffers to screen the tower
base from being visible from a residential area; and
         (e)   If the request is for modification of the maximum height limit,
the applicant must provide evidence documented by a qualified professional
engineer licensed by the State of Minnesota, showing the modification is
necessary to facilitate collocation of telecommunication antennas and ground
equipment to avoid the construction of a new tower, or to meet the coverage
requirements of the applicant's wireless communications system.

services, expenses, and materials provided in reviewing and processing an
application. This includes, but is not limited to staff time, legal expenses
incurred in the application approval, office and field checking, and similar
expenses.
      (2)   For projects that include public off-site improvements, the
engineering/ administrative escrow must be 6.5% of the estimated costs of the
project, but not less than $1,000. For projects with only on-site private
improvements, the cash escrow account shall be 3% of the estimated project cost
but not less than $1,000.
      (3)   If at any time the balance of the engineering/administrative escrow
account is depleted to less than 5% of the originally required cash escrow
amount, the applicant must deposit additional funds in the account sufficient
to cover all costs to be incurred by the city.
   (D)   Financial guarantee.
      (1)   Any financial guarantee required by the development contract
guarantees conformance and compliance with the conditions of the application
approval and the ordinances of the city. If the conditions are not met, the
financial guarantees may be forfeited to the city to cure the default or
reimburse the city the cost of enforcement measures.
      (2)   The amount of the financial guarantee must be established by the
city, based upon an itemized estimate of the cost of all required work as
documented by the applicant.
         (a)   An irrevocable letter of credit or similar financial security as
approved by the City Attorney must be posted with the city in the amount of 95%
of the approved estimated cost. This financial security must be automatically
renewed and shall not expire until released by the city.
         (b)   The remaining 5% of the approved estimated costs must be posted
with the city in cash to be held in a non-interest-bearing city account.
      (3)   Upon completion and city acceptance of the project, any remaining
financial securities must be returned to the depositor by the Finance
Department after all claims and charges have been paid and following approval
by City Council.
         (a)   If part of a project has been completed, inspected, and accepted
by the city, the financial securities posted may be reduced by the city and
partial payment be returned to the applicant.
         (b)   Landscaping improvements may not be deemed complete until the
city has verified survivability of all required plantings through two winter
seasons, which is defined for the purpose of this chapter as October 31 through
May 31.
      (4)   The city may hold the financial guarantee until the project is
completed and approved by the city.
         (a)   The financial guarantee can only be released by the City
Council.
         (b)   Periodically, the amount of the financial guarantee may be
reduced by the City Council based on the projects progress, as determined by
the city.
         (c)   Reduction and release actions will only be initiated after
proper request from the applicant.
      (5)   Failure to comply with the conditions of the application approval,
the development contract, or a city ordinance may result in forfeiture of the
financial guarantee to the extent necessary to achieve the project's total
compliance with the approved site plan.

§ 152.706 MIXED USE DISTRICT LOT AREA AND DIMENSIONAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   The purpose of this subchapter is to establish minimum area and
dimensional requirements for mixed use zoning districts to allow conformance
with the policies of the Comprehensive Plan.
   (B)   Minimum frontage buildout indicates that lots must contain buildings
along the prescribed length of property line.
      (1)   At front streets the minimum frontage buildout is a percentage of
the length of the abutting property line.
      (2)   At side streets the minimum frontage buildout is a specified
distance along the property line from the corner.
      (3)   Facades must be within the minimum and maximum setback.
      (4)   At corner lots the width of the property, for frontage buildout
calculation, may be reduced by the setback of the perpendicular lot line as
indicated by (a) in Figure 152.706.1 below.
   (C)   For buildings subject to a maximum front setback, the area between the
building and the right-of-way will be maintained as city easement for right-of-
way maintenance.
   (D)    Building width is measured at the front setback. The maximum building
width does not apply to buildings with a forecourt frontage type where the
forecourt is wider than 40 feet.

§ 152.800 CAZ CRYSTAL AIRPORT ZONING.
   (A)   Purpose and authority. The Crystal Airport Joint Airport Zoning Board,
created and established by joint action of the Metropolitan Airports Commission
and the Cities of Crystal, Brooklyn Park, Brooklyn Center, Minneapolis, New
Hope, and Robbinsdale, pursuant to the provisions and authority of M.S. §
360.063, hereby finds and declares that:
      (1)   An airport hazard endangers the lives and property of users of the
airport and property or occupants of land in its vicinity, and also may reduce
the size of the area available for the landing, takeoff, and maneuvering of
aircraft, thus tending to destroy or impair the utility of the airport and the
public investment therein.
         (a)   The creation or establishment of an airport hazard is a public
nuisance and an injury to the region served by the airport.
         (b)   For the protection of the public health, safety, order,
convenience, prosperity, and general welfare, and for the promotion of the most
appropriate use of land, it is necessary to prevent the creation or
establishment of airport hazards.
         (c)   The prevention of these airport hazards should be accomplished,
to the extent legally possible, by the exercise of police power without
compensation.
         (d)   The elimination or removal of existing land uses or their
designation as non- conforming uses is not in the public interest and should be
avoided whenever possible, consistent with reasonable standards of safety.
         (e)   In addition, the social and economic costs of disrupting land
uses around the airport often outweigh the benefits of a reduction in airport
hazards, requiring a balance between the social and economic costs to
surrounding communities and the benefits of regulation.
         (f)   Preventing the creation or establishment of airport hazards and
eliminating, removing, altering, mitigating, or marking and lighting of
existing airport hazards are public purposes for which political subdivisions
may raise and expend public funds, levy assessments against land, and acquire
land and property interests therein.
   (B)   Title and short title. This section shall be known as the "Crystal
Airport Zoning Ordinance."

airspace zones are hereby established, subject to the airspace zoning limits in
division (F)(1).
         (a)   Primary surface. An imaginary surface longitudinally centered on
each Runway extending 200 feet beyond each end of Runways 14-32, 6L-24R, and
6R-24L. Runway 14-32 has uniform width of 500 feet, while Runways 6L-24R and
6R-24L have a uniform width of 250 feet. The elevation of any point on the
primary surface is the same as the elevation of the nearest point on the runway
centerline.
         (b)   Primary zone. All that land which lies directly under a primary
surface.
         (c)   Horizontal surface. An imaginary surface that is 1,019.3 feet
above mean sea level, the perimeter of which is constructed by swinging arcs of
specified radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of each
runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those arcs. The
radius of each arc is 5,000 feet for runways 14-32, 6L-24R, and 6R-24L.
         (d)   Horizontal zone. All that land which lies directly under the
horizontal surface.
         (e)   Conical surface. An imaginary surface extending upward and

conical surface.
         (g)   Approach surface. An imaginary surface longitudinally centered
on the extended centerline at each end of Runways 14-32, 6L-24R, and 6R-24L.
The inner edge of this surface is at the same width and elevation as, and
coincides with, the end of the primary surface. For Runways 14-32, 6L-24R, and
6R-24L, this surface inclines upward and outward at a slope of 20:1 for a
horizontal distance of 5,000. For Runway 14-32, the outer width of this surface
is 2,000 feet. For both Runways 6L-24R and 6R-24L, the outer width of this
surface is 1,250 feet.
         (h)   Approach zone. All that land which lies directly under an
approach surface.

surface and from both sides of each approach surface of Runway 14-32, 6L-24R,
and 6R-24L until it intersects the horizontal surface or the conical surface.
         (j)   Transitional zone. All that land which lies directly under a
transitional surface.
      (2)   Height restrictions. Except as otherwise provided in this section,
and except as necessary and incidental to airport operations, the following
height restrictions shall apply. Where a lot is beneath more than one airspace
surface, the height of the more restrictive (lower) airspace surface shall
control.
         (a)   Structures. No new structure shall be constructed or
established; and no existing structure shall be altered, changed, rebuilt,
repaired, or replaced in any airspace zone so as to project above any airspace
surface. Nor shall any equipment used to accomplish any of the foregoing
activities be allowed to project above any airspace surface.
         (b)   Trees. No tree shall be allowed to grow or be altered, repaired,
replaced, or replanted in any airspace zone so as to project above any airspace
surface. Nor shall any equipment used to accomplish any of the foregoing
activities be allowed to project above any airspace surface.
            1.   Public nuisance; order. If the whole or any part of any tree
shall be determined to be an airport hazard by the FAA, or any successor
entity, after proper investigation, the Zoning Administrator may issue an order
in writing for the owner or owners, agent or occupant of the property upon
which such hazardous tree is located, to forthwith cause such hazardous tree,
or portion thereof if the removal of a portion will remove the hazard, to be
taken down and removed.
            2.   Notice. Said order is to be mailed to the last known address
of the owner, agent or occupant and shall be accompanied by a notice setting
forth the authority to remove such hazardous tree at such owner's, agent's or
occupant's expense in the event such owner, agent or occupant fails to comply
with or file a notice of appeal from said order within ten days of mailing. The
notice shall include instructions for filing a notice of appeal from said
order.
            3.   Removal. If within ten days after said order has been mailed,
as above provided for, the owner or owners, agent or occupant of the property
upon which such hazardous tree is located neglects or refuses to comply with
said order, or has failed to file a notice of appeal from said order with the
Zoning Administrator, then the Administrator or its designee(s) may enter upon
said premises and take down or remove said tree or portion thereof declared to
be hazardous, and to do any and all things which in his opinion may be
necessary for the protection of life, limb or property.
            4.   Assessment of expense. If, after the notice hereinbefore
provided for has been given, the owner, agent or occupant has failed to remove
such hazardous tree or portion thereof, and it becomes necessary for the Zoning
Administrator to remove same, the Zoning Administrator or its designee shall
mail a statement of the expense of such removal to the owner, agent or occupant
of the property from which such tree or portion thereof has been removed, and
if within 30 days therefrom the owner, agent or occupant has not remitted to
the Zoning Administrator for the expense incurred by the Zoning Administrator
in said removal, the Zoning Administrator or its designee may forthwith recover
the amount of such expense from the owner or owners of said property in any
civil court of competent jurisdiction, in the manner provided by law.
      (3)   FAA 7460 obstruction evaluation. All construction of new structures
or alteration of existing structures in an airspace zone shall comply with the
requirements for filing notice to the FAA under the FAA 7460 obstruction
evaluation process.

Horizontal Zone, as shown in
Figure 152.800.3, except that land within Land Use Zone 1.
      (2)   Land use restrictions.
         (a)   General restrictions. Subject at all times to the height
restrictions set forth in division (D)(2) and the FAA 7460 obstruction
evaluation process, no use shall be made of any land in any of the land use
zones that creates or causes interference with the operations of radio or
electronic facilities at the airport or with radio or electronic communications
between airport and aircraft, makes it difficult for pilots to distinguish
between airport lights and other lights, results in glare in the eyes of pilots
using the airport, impairs visibility in the vicinity of the airport, is deemed
a "hazard" to air navigation by FAA or MNDOT as part of an FAA 7460 obstruction
evaluation, or otherwise endangers the landing, taking off, or maneuvering of
aircraft.
         (b)   Land Use Zone 1 restrictions. Subject at all times to the height
restrictions set forth in division (D)(2) and to the general restrictions
contained in division E(2)(a), areas designated as Land Use Zone 1 for each end
of Runways 14-32, 6L-24R, and 6R-24L shall contain no buildings, exposed high-
voltage transmission lines, or other similar land use structural hazards, and
shall be restricted to those uses which will not create, attract, or bring
together a dense, confined assembly of persons thereon. Permitted uses may
include, but are not limited to, such uses as agriculture (seasonal crops),
horticulture, animal husbandry, wildlife habitat, light outdoor recreation,
cemeteries, roadways and vehicle parking, railroads, and other approved
aeronautical uses. Where Land Use Zone 1 overlies the Runway Protection Zone,
land uses and structures within the Runway Protection Zone will be governed by
federal laws and regulations or by FAA advisory circulars, orders, or guidance.
         (c)   Land Use Zone 2 restrictions. No land use in Land Use Zone 2
shall violate the height restrictions set forth in division (D)(2) or the

Figure 152.800.6 Airport Boundary and Land Use Zoning Limits, attached hereto
and made a part hereof, shows these limits.
      (3)   Crystal Airport Zoning Map. The locations and boundaries of the
airspace surfaces, airspace zones, land use zones, and the maximum construction
heights without an airport zoning permit established by this section are set
forth on the Crystal Airport Zoning Map consisting of 102 Plates- Airspace
Zones, Plates A-A2 to A-F6; Maximum Construction Heights Without Permit, Plates
MCH-A2 to MCH-F6; and Land Use Zones, Plates SZ-A2 to SZ-F6 prepared by the
Metropolitan Airports Commission, attached hereto and made a part hereof. These
plates, together with such amendments thereto as may from time to time be made,
and all notations, references, elevations, heights, data, surface and zone
boundaries, and other information thereon, shall be and the same are hereby
adopted as part of this section.
   (G)   Non-conforming uses. The provisions of this section shall not be
construed to require the removal, lowering, other change, or alteration of any
non-conforming structure or tree, or otherwise interfere with the continuance
of any non-conforming use. Non-conforming structures and non-conforming uses
are permitted under this section, subject to the provisions in divisions (H)
and (I). Nothing herein contained shall require any change in the construction,
alteration, or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of
which was begun prior to the effective date, and was diligently prosecuted and
completed within two years of the effective date.
   (H)   Airport zoning permits.
      (1)   Permit required. The following activities shall not take place on a
lot in any airspace zone or land use zone unless an airport zoning permit shall
have been granted therefore by the Zoning Administrator for the jurisdiction in
which the lot is located.
         (a)   Existing structures. Except as specifically provided in division
(H)(2), no existing structure shall be altered, changed, rebuilt, repaired, or
replaced.
         (b)   New structures. Except as specifically provided in division (H)
(2), no structure shall be newly constructed or otherwise established.
         (c)   Non-conforming structures. No non-conforming structure shall be
replaced, substantially altered or repaired, or rebuilt.
      (2)   Exception to permit requirement.
         (a)   Maximum construction height without a permit. No airport zoning
permit shall be required for an existing structure to be altered, changed,
rebuilt, repaired, or replaced on a lot, or for a new structure to be
constructed or otherwise established on a lot, if the highest point on the
structure or on any equipment used to accomplish any of the foregoing
activities, whichever is higher (measured in feet from curb level or from
natural grade at a point ten feet away from the front center of the structure,
whichever is lower) does not exceed the maximum construction height above
ground without an airport zoning permit shown for the lot on the applicable
Maximum Construction Heights Without Permit Plate in the Crystal Airport Zoning
Map.
         (b)   No violation of height or land use restriction permitted.
Nothing in this shall be construed as permitting or intending to permit a
violation or a greater violation of any provision of this section.
      (3)   Permit application. An airport zoning permit application for
activities on a lot shall be made in the manner and on the form established by
the Zoning Administrator of the jurisdiction in which the lot is located as
designated in division (K)(2).
      (4)   Permit standard. An airport zoning permit shall be granted unless
the Zoning Administrator determines that granting the permit (1) would allow a
conforming structure or use to violate any provision of this section or (2)
would permit a non-conforming structure or a non-conforming use to become a
greater violation of any provision of this section. Any airport zoning permit
may be granted subject to any reasonable conditions that the Zoning
Administrator may deem necessary to effectuate the purpose of this section. In
making any determination, the Zoning Administrator need not give public notice
of, or hold a public hearing on, the airport zoning permit application or the
determination.
      (5)   Abandoned or deteriorated non-conforming uses. Whenever a Zoning
Administrator determines that a non-conforming structure, non-conforming use,
or tree has been abandoned or more than 80% torn down, deteriorated, or
decayed, no airport zoning permit shall be granted that would allow such non-
conforming structure, non-conforming use, or tree to exceed the height
restrictions of division (D)(2) or otherwise violate any provision of this
section. Whether application is made for an airport zoning permit or not, a
Zoning Administrator may order the owner of the abandoned, torn down,
deteriorated, or decayed non-conforming structure, non-conforming use, or tree
at the owner's expense, to lower, remove, reconstruct, or equip the same in the
manner necessary to conform to the provisions of this section. In the event the
owner shall neglect or refuse to comply with such order for ten days after
receipt of written notice of such order, the Zoning Administrator may, by
appropriate legal action, proceed to have the non- conforming structure, non-
conforming use, or tree lowered, removed, reconstructed, or equipped and assess
the cost and expense thereof against the land on which the non-conforming
structure, non-conforming use, or tree is, or was, located. Unless such an
assessment is paid within 90 days from the service of notice thereof on the
owner of the land, the sum shall bear interest at the rate of 8% per annum from
the date the cost and expense is incurred until paid, and shall be collected in
the same manner as are general taxes, all as authorized by M.S. § 360.067.
   (I)   Variances.
      (1)   Variance application. Any person desiring to use his or her
property in violation of any provision of this section, whether to construct or
establish a new structure; to alter, change, rebuild, repair, or replace an
existing structure; to allow a tree to grow higher; to alter, repair, replace,
or replant a tree; or to otherwise use his or her property in violation of any
provision of this section, may apply to the Board of Adjustment for a variance
from such provision. A variance application shall be made by sending the
application on the form provided by the Board of Adjustment by certified United
States Mail to (1) the members of the Board of Adjustment and (2) the Board of
Adjustment at the mailing address specified in division (L)(3). The applicant
shall also mail a copy of the application by regular United States Mail to the
Zoning Administrator of the jurisdiction in which the structure or property is
located, as designated in division (K)(2). The Board of Adjustment may charge a
fee for processing the application.
      (2)   Failure of Board to act. If the Board of Adjustment fails to grant
or deny the variance within four months after the last Board member receives
the variance application, the variance shall be deemed to be granted by the
Board of Adjustment, but not yet effective. When the variance is granted by
reason of the failure of the Board of Adjustment to act on the variance, the
person receiving the variance shall send notice that the variance has been
granted by certified United States Mail to (1) the Board of Adjustment at the
mailing address specified in division (L)(3) and (2) the Commissioner. The
applicant shall include a copy of the original application for the variance
with the notice to the Commissioner. The variance shall be effective 60 days
after this notice is received by the Commissioner, subject to any action taken
by the Commissioner pursuant to M.S. § 360.063, Subd. 6.a.
      (3)   Variance standard. A variance shall be granted where it is found
that a literal application or enforcement of the provisions of this section
would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and relief granted
would not be contrary to the public interest but do substantial justice and be
in accordance with the spirit of this section and M.S. Chapter 360. Any
variance granted may be granted subject to any reasonable conditions that the
Board of Adjustment, or the Commissioner acting under division (I)(2), may deem
necessary to effectuate the purpose of this section or M.S. Chapter 360.
   (J)   Hazard marking and lighting.
      (1)   Non-conforming structure. The Metropolitan Airports Commission may
require the owner of any non-conforming structure to permit the installation,
operation, and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be
deemed necessary by the Metropolitan Airports Commission to indicate the
presence of the structure to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the
airport. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated, and maintained
at the expense of the Metropolitan Airports Commission.
      (2)   Permits and variances. Any airport zoning permit or variance
granted by a Zoning Administrator or the Board of Adjustment may, if such
action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this section and be
reasonable in the circumstances, be granted subject to a condition that the
owner of the structure in question permit the Metropolitan Airports Commission,
at its expense, to install, operate, and maintain thereon such markers and
lights as may be necessary to indicate to pilots the presence of an airport
hazard.
   (K)   Zoning Administrator.
      (1)   Duties. It shall be the duty of each Zoning Administrator to
administer and enforce the provisions of this section. Applications for airport
zoning permits shall be made to a Zoning Administrator as provided herein. A
Zoning Administrator may charge a fee for processing the application. Airport
zoning permit applications shall be considered and acted upon by the Zoning
Administrator in accordance with the provisions of this section and within the
timelines established by M.S. § 15.99, as it may be amended. The Zoning
Administrator shall remind each applicant that it is the responsibility of the
applicant to record any conditions of an airport zoning permit, if required by
law.

   (M)   Appeals.
      (1)   Who may appeal. Any person aggrieved, or any taxpayer affected by
any order, requirement, decision, or determination of a Zoning Administrator
made in administration of this section may appeal to the Board of Adjustment.
Such appeals may also be made by any governing body of a municipality or
county, or any joint airport zoning board, which is of the opinion that an
order, requirement, decision, or determination of a Zoning Administrator is an
improper application of this section as it concerns such governing body or
board.
      (2)   Commencement of appeals. All appeals hereunder must be commenced
within 30 days of a Zoning Administrator's decision by filing with the Zoning
Administrator a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The Zoning
Administrator shall forthwith transmit to the Board of Adjustment the notice of
appeal and all papers constituting the record upon which the order,
requirement, decision, or determination appealed from was taken.
      (3)   Stay of proceedings. An appeal shall stay all proceedings in
furtherance of the order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed
from, unless the Zoning Administrator certifies to the Board of Adjustment,
after the notice of appeal has been filed with it, that by reason of the facts
stated in the certificate a stay would, in the Zoning Administrator's opinion,
cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not
be stayed except by order of the Board of Adjustment on notice to the Zoning
Administrator and on due cause shown.
      (4)   Appeal procedures. The Board of Adjustment shall fix a reasonable
time for hearing an appeal, give public notice and due notice to the parties in
interest, and decide the same within a reasonable time. At the hearing, any
party may appear in person, by agent, or by attorney.
      (5)   Decision. The Board of Adjustment may, in conformity with the
provisions of M.S. Chapter 360 and this section, affirm or reverse, in whole or
in part, or modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed
from and may make such order, requirement, decision, or determination, as may
be appropriate under the circumstances and, to that end, shall have all the
powers of a Zoning Administrator.
   (N)   Judicial review. Any person aggrieved, or any taxpayer affected, by
any decision of the Board of Adjustment or any action of the Commissioner taken
under M.S. § 360.063, Subd. 6 or 6.a., or any governing body of a municipality
or county, or any joint airport zoning board, which is of the opinion that an
order, requirement, decision, or determination of the Board of Adjustment or
action of the Commissioner is illegal, may seek judicial review as provided in
M.S. § 360.072. The petitioner must exhaust the remedies provided in this
section before availing himself or herself of the right to seek judicial review
as provided by this section.
   (O)   Penalties and other remedies. Every person who violates any provision
of this section, any zoning approval granted hereunder, any condition of any
zoning approval granted hereunder, or any order, requirement, decision, or
determination of a Zoning Administrator or the Board of Adjustment shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished by a fine, imprisonment, or both
of not more than the fine and imprisonment established for misdemeanors by
state law. Each day a violation continues to exist shall constitute a separate
offense for the purpose of the penalties and remedies specified in this
section. This section may also be enforced through such proceedings for
injunctive relief and other relief as may be proper under M.S. § 360.073, as it
may be amended, and other applicable law.

§ 152.801 FLOOD HAZARD OVERLAY.
   The legislature of the State of Minnesota has, in M.S. Ch. 103F and 462
delegated the responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations
designed to minimize flood losses. The intent of the designation on a property
is to protect and preserve areas and investments on properties that are subject
to periodic inundation by flood waters. This designation includes Floodway
(FW), Flood Fringe (FF) and General Flood Plain (FP). The Official Zoning Map
together with all materials attached thereto is hereby adopted by reference and
declared to be part of this chapter. The attached material includes the Flood
Insurance Study for Hennepin County, Minnesota, and Incorporated Areas, dated
November 4, 2016, and the Flood Insurance Rate Map panels enumerated as
follows: 27053C0069F, 27053C0088F, 27053C0089F, 27053C0093F, 27053C0182F,
27053C0184F, 27053C0201F, 27053C0202F, 27053C0203F, 27053C0204F, 27053C0206F,
27053C0207F, 27053C0208F, 27053C0209F, dated November 4, 2016, all prepared by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency. These materials are on file in the
office of the City Clerk.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of these overlays includes:
      (1)   To protect areas with environmental sensitivity;
      (2)   To promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of the
city;
      (3)   To minimize losses of life, property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, public expenditures for flood
protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base due to periodic
inundation;
      (4)   To comply with the rules and regulations of the National Flood
Insurance Program codified as 44 CFR Parts 59 - 78, as amended, to maintain the
community's eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program; and
      (5)   To preserve the natural characteristics and functions of
watercourses and flood plains in order to moderate flood and stormwater
impacts, improve water quality, reduce soil erosion, protect aquatic and
riparian habitat, provide recreational opportunities, provide aesthetic
benefits and enhance community and economic development.
   (B)   General provisions.
      (1)   This subchapter adopts the flood plain maps applicable to the city
and includes three flood plain districts: Floodway, Flood Fringe, and General
Flood Plain.
         (a)   Where Floodway and Flood Fringe Districts are delineated on the
flood plain maps, the standards in divisions (D)(3) or (D)(4) will apply,
depending on the location of a property.
         (b)   Locations where Floodway and Flood Fringe Districts are not
delineated on the flood plain maps are considered to fall within the General
Flood Plain District. Within the General Flood Plain District, the Floodway
District standards in division (D)(3) apply unless the floodway boundary is
determined, according to the process outlined in division (D)(5). Once the
floodway boundary is determined, the Flood Fringe District standards in
division (D)(4) may apply outside the floodway.
      (2)   Lands to which subchapter applies. This subchapter applies to all
lands within the jurisdiction of the city shown on the official zoning map or
the attachments to the map as being located within the boundaries of the
Floodway, Flood Fringe, or General Flood Plain Districts.
         (a)   The Floodway, Flood Fringe and General Flood Plain Districts are
overlay districts that are superimposed on all existing zoning districts. The
standards imposed in the overlay districts are in addition to any other
requirements in this subchapter. In case of a conflict, the more restrictive
standards will apply.
      (3)   Interpretation. The boundaries of the zoning districts are
determined by scaling distances on the flood insurance rate map.
         (a)   Where a conflict exists between the flood plain limits
illustrated on the official zoning map and actual field conditions, the flood
elevations shall be the governing factor. The Zoning Administrator must
interpret the boundary location based on the ground elevations that existed on
the site on the date of the first National Flood Insurance Program map showing
the area within the regulatory flood plain, and other available technical data.
         (b)   Persons contesting the location of the district boundaries will
be given a reasonable opportunity to present their case to the Planning
Commission and to submit technical evidence.
      (4)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. It is not intended by this
subchapter to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or
other private agreements. However, where this subchapter imposes greater
restrictions, the provisions of this subchapter prevail. All other ordinances
inconsistent with this subchapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the
inconsistency only.
      (5)   This subchapter does not imply that areas outside a flood hazard
area will be free from flooding or flood damages. This subchapter does not
create liability on the part of the city or any officer or employee for any
flood damages that result from reliance on this section, or any administrative
decision lawfully made based on regulations in this section.
      (6)   Severability. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this
subchapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of law, the
remainder of this subchapter shall not be affected and shall remain in full
force.
      (7)   Annexations. The flood insurance rate map panels adopted by
reference into this section above may include flood plain areas that lie
outside of the corporate boundaries of the city at the time of adoption of this
subchapter. If any of these flood plain land areas are annexed into the city
after the date of adoption of this subchapter, the newly annexed flood plain
lands will be subject to the provisions of this subchapter immediately upon the
date of annexation.
      (8)   Detachments. The flood insurance rate map panels adopted by
reference into this section will include flood plain areas that lie inside the
city at the time of adoption of this subchapter. If any of these flood plain
land areas are detached from the city and come under the jurisdiction of
another city after the date of adoption of this subchapter, the newly detached
flood plain lands will no longer be subject to the provisions of this
subchapter as of the date of detachment.
   (C)   Amendments and administration. All amendments to this subchapter must
follow the procedures as defined in §
152.302.
      (1)   Designations shown on the zoning overlay map may not be removed
unless an applicant provides evidence that the designation is in error or that
the area has been filled to or above the elevation of the regulatory flood
protection elevation and is contiguous to lands outside the flood hazard area.
Special exceptions to this rule may be permitted by the Commissioner of Natural
Resources determined that, through other measures, lands are adequately
protected for the intended use.
      (2)   All amendments, either to the text of this section or the zoning
overlay map must be submitted to and approved by the Commissioner of Natural
Resources prior to adoption. Changes in the boundaries for flood hazard area
must meet the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Technical Conditions
and Criteria and must receive prior FEMA approval before adoption. The
Commissioner of Natural Resources must be given ten days written notice of all
hearings to consider an amendment to this section and said notice must include
a draft of the amendment or technical study under consideration.
      (3)   Zoning Administrator. A Zoning Administrator or other official
designated by the city shall administer and enforce this chapter. If the Zoning
Administrator finds a violation of the provisions of this chapter the Zoning
Administrator shall notify the person responsible for such violation in
accordance with the procedures stated in division (H).
      (4)   Permit requirements.
         (a)   Permit required. For that portion of the property or structures
in the flood plain, a permit issued by the Zoning Administrator in conformity
with the provisions of this subchapter shall be secured prior to the erection,
addition, modification, rehabilitation (including normal maintenance and repair
over $500), or alteration of any building, structure, or portion thereof; prior
to the use or change of use of a building, structure, or land; prior to the
construction of a dam, fence, or on-site septic system; prior to the change or
extension of a non-conforming use; prior to the repair of a structure that has
been damaged by flood, fire, tornado, or any other source, and prior to the
placement of fill, excavation of materials, or the storage of materials or
equipment within the flood plain; relocation or alteration of a watercourse
(including new or replacement culverts and bridges), unless a public waters
work permit has been applied for; any other type of development as defined in
this subchapter. Exceptions to this requirement include dog houses, non-
habitable structures such as storage units less than 36 square fee in size,
normal household storage, such as lawn furniture or equipment storage, such as
a canoe, all of which may easily be moved if necessary and normal landscaping
and maintenance, provided no fill is placed within the Flood Hazard Overlay.
         (b)   Notifications for watercourse alterations. The Zoning
Administrator shall notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and
the Commissioner of the Department of Natural Resources prior to the community
authorizing any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. If the applicant has
applied for a permit to work in the beds of public waters pursuant to M.S.
Chapter 103G, this shall suffice as adequate notice to the Commissioner of
Natural Resources. A copy of said notification shall also be submitted to the
Chicago Regional Office of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
         (c)   Notification to FEMA when physical changes increase or decrease
the 100-year flood elevation. As soon as is practicable, but not later than six
months after the date such supporting information becomes available, the Zoning
Administrator shall notify the Chicago Regional Office of FEMA of the changes
by submitting a copy of said technical or scientific data.
      (5)   The Flood Plain District regulations adopted by this subchapter
will be amended to incorporate any revisions by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency to the flood plain maps adopted by this section.
   (D)   Floodway, Flood Fringe, and General Flood Plain performance standards
and uses.
      (1)   Districts.
         (a)   Floodway District. The Floodway District includes those areas
within Zones AE that have a floodway delineated as shown on the flood insurance
rate map adopted in this section. For lakes, wetlands and other basins within
Zones AE that do not have a floodway delineated, the Floodway District also
includes those areas that are at or below the ordinary high water level as
defined in M.S. § 103G.005, Subd. 14.
         (b)   Flood Fringe District. The Flood Fringe District includes areas
within Zones AE that have a floodway delineated on the flood insurance rate map
adopted in this section but are located outside of the floodway. For lakes,
wetlands and other basins within Zones AE that do not have a floodway
delineated, the Flood Fringe District also includes those areas below the 1%
annual chance (100-year) flood elevation but above the ordinary high water
level as defined in M.S. § 103G.005, Subd. 14.
         (c)   General Flood Plain District. The General Flood Plain District
includes those areas within Zones A, AE, or AH that do not have a delineated
floodway as shown on the flood insurance rate map adopted in this section.
      (2)   Applicability. Within the Flood Plain Districts established in this
subchapter, the use, size, type and location of development must comply with
the terms of this subchapter and other applicable regulations. In no cases
shall flood plain development adversely affect the efficiency or unduly
restrict the capacity of the channels or floodways of any tributaries to the
main stream, drainage ditches, or any other drainage facilities or systems. All
uses not listed as permitted uses or conditional uses in divisions (D)(3)
through (5) below are prohibited. In addition, critical facilities, as defined
in §
152.105, are prohibited in all Flood Plain Districts.
      (3)   Floodway District (FW).
         (a)   Permitted uses. The following uses, subject to the standards set
forth in division (C)(2) and (E), are permitted uses if otherwise allowed in
the underlying zoning district or any applicable overlay district:
            1.   General farming, pasture, grazing, outdoor plant nurseries,
horticulture, truck farming, forestry, sod farming, and wild crop harvesting.
            2.   Industrial-commercial loading areas, parking areas, and
airport landing strips.
            3.   Open space uses, including but not limited to private and
public golf courses, tennis courts, driving ranges, archery ranges, picnic
grounds, boat launching ramps, swimming areas, parks, wildlife and nature
preserves, game farms, fish hatcheries, shooting preserves, hunting and fishing
areas, and single or multiple purpose recreational trails.
            4.   Residential lawns, gardens, parking areas, and play areas.
            5.   Railroads, streets, bridges, utility transmission lines and
pipelines, provided that the Department of Natural Resources Area Hydrologist
is notified at least ten days prior to issuance of any permit.
         (b)   Standards for Floodway permitted uses.
            1.   The use must have a low flood damage potential.
            2.   The use must not obstruct flood flows or cause any increase in
flood elevations and must not involve structures, obstructions, or storage of
materials or equipment.
            3.   Any facility that will be used by employees or the general
public must be designed with a flood warning system that provides adequate time
for evacuation if the area is inundated to a depth and velocity such that the
depth (in feet) multiplied by the velocity (in feet per second) would exceed a
product of four upon occurrence of the regional (1% chance) flood.
            4.   No on-site sewage treatment, holding tanks or water supply
systems are permitted in the floodway.
         (c)   Conditional uses. The following uses may be allowed as
conditional uses following the standards and procedures set forth in division
(K) and further subject to the standards set forth in division (C)(4), if
otherwise allowed in the underlying zoning district or any applicable overlay
district.
            1.   Structures accessory to the uses listed in divisions (C)(1)(a)
through (c) and the uses listed in divisions (C)(3)(b) and (c).
            2.   Extraction and storage of sand, gravel, and other materials.
            3.   Marinas, boat rentals, docks, piers, wharves, and water
control structures.
            4.   Storage yards for equipment, machinery, or materials.
            5.   Placement of fill or construction of fences that obstruct
flood flows. Farm fencing, as defined in M.S. §
344.02, Subd. 1(a) - (d), is permitted as it relates to this section.
            6.   Travel-ready recreational vehicles meeting the exception
standards in §
152.801(E).
            7.   Levees or dikes intended to protect agricultural crops for a
frequency flood event equal to or less than the ten-year frequency flood event.
         (d)   Standards for Floodway conditional uses.
            1.   All uses. A conditional use must not cause any increase in the
stage of the 1% chance or regional flood or cause an increase in flood damages
in the reach or reaches affected.
            2.   Fill; storage of materials and equipment:
               a.   The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of
flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or
plant life is prohibited.
               b.   Fill, dredge spoil, and other similar materials deposited
or stored in the flood plain must be protected from erosion by vegetative
cover, mulching, riprap or other acceptable method. Permanent sand and gravel
operations and similar uses must be covered by a long-term site development
plan.
               c.   Temporary placement of fill, other materials, or equipment
which would cause an increase to the stage of the 1% chance or regional flood
may only be allowed if the City Council has approved a plan that ensures
removal of the materials from the floodway based upon the flood warning time
available.
            3.   Accessory structures. Accessory structures, as identified in
division (C)(3)(a) above, may be permitted, provided that:
               a.   Structures are not intended for human habitation;
               b.   Structures will have a low flood damage potential;
               c.   Structures will be constructed and placed so as to offer a
minimal obstruction to the flow of flood waters;
               d.   Service utilities, such as electrical and heating
equipment, within these structures must be elevated to or above the regulatory
flood protection elevation or properly floodproofed;
               e.   Structures must be elevated on fill or structurally dry
floodproofed in accordance with the FP1 or FP2 floodproofing classifications in
the State Building Code. All floodproofed structures must be adequately
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement and designed to
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
               f.   As an alternative, an accessory structure may be internally
wet floodproofed to the FP3 or FP4 floodproofing classifications in the State
Building Code, provided the accessory structure constitutes a minimal
investment and does not exceed 576 square feet in size. Designs for meeting
this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer
or meet or exceed the following criteria: to allow for the equalization of
hydrostatic pressure, there must be a minimum of two "automatic" openings in
the outside walls of the structure, with a total net area of not less than one
square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; and
there must be openings on at least two sides of the structure and the bottom of
all openings must be no higher than one foot above the lowest adjacent grade to
the structure. Using human intervention to open a garage door prior to flooding
will not satisfy this requirement for automatic openings.
            4.   Accessory structures in the Flood Hazard Area Overlay.
               a.   Accessory structures shall not be designed for human
habitation.
               b.   Accessory structures shall be constructed and placed on the
building site so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of flood
waters:
            5.   Whenever possible, structures shall be constructed with the
longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow: and
            6.   So far as practicable, structures shall be placed
approximately on the same flood flow lines as those of adjoining structures.
               a.   Accessory structures shall be elevated on fill or
structurally dry floodproofed to the regulatory flood protection elevation in
accordance with the State Building Code. As an alternative, an accessory
structure may be wet floodproofed to the floodproofing classification in the
State Building Code provided the accessory structure constitutes a minimal
investment and does not exceed 500 square feet in size. All floodproofed
accessory structures must meet the following additional standards:
                  i.   The structure must be adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure and shall be designed
to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls;
                  ii.   Any mechanical and utility equipment in a structure
must be elevated to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or
properly floodproofed; and
                  iii.   To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure,
there must be a minimum of two "automatic" openings in the outside walls of the
structure having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every
square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. There must be openings on at
least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings must be no
higher than one foot above the lowest adjacent grade to the structure. Using
human intervention to open a door prior to flooding will not satisfy this
requirement for automatic openings.
            7.   Structural works for flood control that will change the
course, current or cross section of protected wetlands or public waters are
subject to the provisions of M.S. § 103G.245.
            8.   A levee, dike or floodwall constructed in the floodway must
not cause an increase to the 1% chance or regional flood. The technical
analysis must assume equal conveyance or storage loss on both sides of a
stream.
            9.   Floodway developments must not adversely affect the hydraulic
capacity of the channel and adjoining flood plain of any tributary watercourse
or drainage system.
      (4)   Flood Fringe District (FF).
         (a)   Permitted uses. Permitted uses are those uses of land or
structures allowed in the underlying zoning district(s) that comply with the
standards in division (4)(b) below. If no pre-existing, underlying zoning
districts exist, then any residential or nonresidential structure or use of a
structure or land is a permitted use provided it does not constitute a public
nuisance.
         (b)   Standards for Flood Fringe permitted uses.
            1.   Except for the structures mentioned in division (E)(4) only
non-habitable accessory structures constructed with less than 120 square feet,
fences, or docks for the personal use of the resident(s) of the principal
structure that are constructed with flood resistant material to the regulatory
flood protection elevation in accordance with the floodproofing classification
of the State Building Code may be permitted in the flood fringe, if permitted
in the underlying district. No accessory structure may be constructed on the
property that will increase flood elevations. All structures, including
accessory structures, must be elevated on fill so that the lowest floor, as
defined, is at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation. The finished
fill elevation for structures must be no lower than one foot below the
regulatory flood protection elevation and the fill must extend at the same
elevation at least 15 feet beyond the outside limits of the structure.
            2.   Accessory structures. As an alternative to the fill
requirements of division (4)(b)(i) above, structures accessory to the uses
identified in division (4)(a) above may be permitted to be internally/wet
floodproofed to the FP3 or FP4 floodproofing classifications in the State
Building Code, provided that:
               a.   The accessory structure constitutes a minimal investment,
does not exceed 576 square feet in size, and is only used for parking and
storage.
               b.   All portions of floodproofed accessory structures below the
regulatory flood protection elevation must be:
                  i.   Adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or
lateral movement and designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior
walls;
                  ii.   Be constructed with materials resistant to flood
damage; and
                  iii.   Must have all service utilities be water-tight or
elevated to above the regulatory flood protection elevation.
               c.   Designs for meeting this requirement must either be
certified by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following
criteria: to allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there must be
a minimum of two "automatic" openings in the outside walls of the structure,
with a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of
enclosed area subject to flooding; and there must be openings on at least two
sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings must be no higher than
one foot above the lowest adjacent grade to the structure. Using human
intervention to open a garage door prior to flooding will not satisfy this
requirement for automatic openings.
               d.   The cumulative placement of fill or similar material on a
parcel must not exceed 1,000 cubic yards, unless the fill is specifically
intended to elevate a structure in accordance with division (D)(2)(a) above, or
if allowed as a conditional use under division (D)(3)(c) below.
               e.   The storage of any materials or equipment must be elevated
on fill to the regulatory flood protection elevation.
               f.   All service utilities, including ductwork, must be elevated
or water-tight to prevent infiltration of floodwaters.
               g.   The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of
flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or
plant life is prohibited.
               h.   All fill must be properly compacted and the slopes must be
properly protected by the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable
method.
               i.   All new principal structures must have vehicular access at
or above an elevation not more than two feet below the regulatory flood

               b.   Non-residential basements may be allowed below the
regulatory flood protection elevation provided the basement is structurally dry
floodproofed in accordance with division (D)(4)(c) below.
            3.   All areas of nonresidential structures, including basements,
to be placed below the regulatory flood protection elevation must be
floodproofed in accordance with the structurally dry floodproofing
classifications in the State Building Code. Structurally dry floodproofing must
meet the FP1 or FP2 floodproofing classification in the State Building Code,
which requires making the structure watertight with the walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components capable of
resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy.
            4.   The placement of more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill or other
similar material on a parcel (other than for the purpose of elevating a
structure to the regulatory flood protection elevation) must comply with an
approved erosion/sedimentation control plan.
               a.   The plan must clearly specify methods to be used to
stabilize the fill on site for a flood event at a minimum of the regional (1%
chance) flood event.
               b.   The plan must be prepared and certified by a registered
professional engineer or other qualified individual acceptable to the City
Council.

protection elevation must comply with an approved emergency plan providing for
removal of such materials within the time available after a flood warning.
      (5)   General Flood Plain District (GF).
         (a)   Permitted uses.
            1.   The uses listed in division (C)(1) above, Floodway District
permitted uses, are permitted uses.
            2.   All other uses are subject to the floodway/flood fringe
evaluation criteria specified in division (E)(2) below. Division (C) above
applies if the proposed use is determined to be in the Floodway District.
Division (D) above applies if the proposed use is determined to be in the Flood
Fringe District.
         (b)   Procedures for Floodway and Flood Fringe determinations.
            1.   Upon receipt of an application for a permit or other approval
within the General Flood Plain District, the Zoning Administrator must obtain,
review and reasonably utilize any regional flood elevation and floodway data
available from a federal, state, or other source.
            2.   If regional flood elevation and floodway data are not readily
available, the applicant must furnish additional information, as needed, to
determine the regulatory flood protection elevation and whether the proposed
use would fall within the Floodway or Flood Fringe District. Information must
be consistent with accepted hydrological and hydraulic engineering standards
and the standards in division (E)(2)(c).
            3.   The determination of floodway and flood fringe must include
the following components, as applicable:
               a.   Estimate the peak discharge of the regional (1% chance)
flood.
               b.   Calculate the water surface profile of the regional flood
based upon a hydraulic analysis of the stream channel and overbank areas.
               c.   Compute the floodway necessary to convey or store the
regional flood without increasing flood stages more than one-half foot. A
lesser stage increase than a half foot is required if, as a result of the stage
increase, increased flood damages would result. An equal degree of encroachment
on both sides of the stream within the reach must be assumed in computing
floodway boundaries.
            4.   The Zoning Administrator will review the submitted information
and assess the technical evaluation and the recommended Floodway and/or Flood
Fringe District boundary. The assessment must include the cumulative effects of
previous floodway encroachments. The Zoning Administrator may seek technical
assistance from a designated engineer or other expert person or agency,
including the Department of Natural Resources. Based on this assessment, the
Zoning Administrator may approve or deny the application.
            5.   After the Floodway and Flood Fringe District boundaries have
been determined, the Zoning Administrator must process the permit application
consistent with the applicable provisions of divisions (C) and (D) above.

            4.   The vehicle and associated use must be permissible in any pre-
existing, underlying zoning district;
            5.   Accessory structures are not permitted within the Floodway
District. Any accessory structure in the Flood Fringe District must be
constructed of flood-resistant materials and be securely anchored, meeting the
requirements applicable to manufactured homes in division (E)(2) above; and
            6.   An accessory structure must constitute only a minimal
investment.
         (c)   Recreational vehicles that are exempt in division (F)(2) lose
this exemption when development occurs on the site that exceeds a minimal
investment for an accessory structure such as a garage or storage building. The
recreational vehicle and all accessory structures will then be treated as new
structures subject to the elevation and floodproofing requirements of §
152.801(D). No development or improvement on the parcel or attachment to the
recreational vehicle is allowed that would hinder the removal of the vehicle
should flooding occur.

technical assistance in determining whether the proposed use is in the floodway
or flood fringe and to determine the regulatory flood protection elevation.
Procedures consistent with Minn. Rules parts 6120.5000 - 6120.6200 must be
followed in this expert evaluation. The designated engineer or expert is
strongly encouraged to discuss the proposed technical evaluation methodology
with the respective Department of Natural Resources' Area Hydrologist prior to
commencing the analysis. The designated engineer or expert must:
         (a)   Estimate the peak discharge of the regional flood;
         (b)   Calculate the water surface profile of the regional flood based
upon a hydraulic analysis of the stream channel and overbank areas; and
         (c)   Compute the floodway necessary to convey or store the regional
flood without increasing flood stages and providing compensation storage
volumes on a 1:1 basis below the 100-year flood elevation. An equal degree of
encroachment on both sides of a stream within the reach must be assumed in
computing floodway boundaries.
   (G)   The City Manager must present the technical evaluation and findings of
the designated engineer or expert to the Board of Adjustment and Appeals. The
Board may formally accept the technical evaluation and the recommended floodway
and flood fringe delineations for the Flood Hazard Overlay Area or deny the

all land within the city.
      (2)   No land shall be subdivided which is unsuitable for the reason of
flooding, inadequate drainage, water supply or sewage treatment facilities.
Manufactured home parks and recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds are
considered subdivisions for purposes of this subchapter. All lots within Flood
Plain Districts shall be able to contain a building site outside of the Flood
Plain Districts. All subdivisions must have water and sewage treatment
facilities that comply with the provisions of this chapter and have road access
both to the subdivision and to the individual building sites no lower than two
feet below the regulatory flood protection elevation. For all subdivisions in
the Flood Plain, the Floodway and Flood Fringe District boundaries, the
regulatory flood protection elevation and the required elevation of all access
roads must be clearly labeled on all required elevations of all access roads
and must be clearly labeled on all required subdivision drawings and platting
documents.
      (3)   In the General Flood Plain Overlay, applicants must provide the
information required in §

Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for removing the
special flood hazard area designation for certain structures properly elevated
on fill above the 100-year flood elevation. FEMA's requirements incorporate
specific fill compaction and side slope protection standards for multi-
structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should be investigated
prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of special flood hazard
area designation will be requested.
      (5)   If a subdivision proposal or other proposed new development is in a
flood prone area, any such proposal must be reviewed to assure that:
         (a)   All such proposals are consistent with the need to minimize
flood damage within the flood prone area;
         (b)   All public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas,
electrical, and water systems are located and constructed to minimize or
eliminate flood damage; and
         (c)   Adequate drainage is provided to reduce exposure of flood
hazard.

Emergency Management Agency must be satisfied:
         (a)   Variances shall not be issued by a community within any
designated regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base
flood discharge would result.
         (b)   Variances shall only be issued by a community upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
         (c)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (11)   All new principal structures must have vehicular access at or
above an elevation not more than two feet below the regulatory flood protection
elevation. If a variance to this requirement is granted, the Board of

      (3)   The cost of any structural alterations or additions to any non-
conforming structure over the life of the structure must not exceed 50% of the
market value of the structure unless the conditions of this section are
satisfied. The cost of all structural alternations and additions constructed
since the adoption of the city's initial flood plain controls shall be
calculated into today's current cost which will include all costs such as
construction material and a reasonable cost placed on all manpower or labor. If
the current cost of all previous and proposed alterations and additions exceeds
50% of the current market value of the structure, then the structure must be
located outside the floodway and meet the flood plain management standards for
the State of Minnesota as found in Minn. Rules parts 6120.5000 - 5120.6200 and
44 CFR 60.3(a) - (d).
      (4)   If any non-conforming use is discontinued for 12 consecutive

            1.   The permit terminates on either a specific date or upon
occurrence of a particular event related to the person requiring accommodation;
and
            2.   Upon expiration of the permit, the ramp or other facilities
must be removed.
   (D)   MRCCA Districts.
      (1)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish districts
under which building height and structure placement are regulated to protect
and enhance the Mississippi River's resources and features consistent with the
natural and built character of each district.
      (2)   District description and management purpose. The MRCCA within the
Brooklyn Park is divided into the following MRCCA Districts:
         (a)   Rural and Open Space (ROS).
            1.   Description. The ROS District is characterized by rural and
low-density development patterns and land uses, and includes land that is
riparian or visible from the river, as well as large, undeveloped tracts of
high ecological and scenic value, flood plain, and undeveloped islands. Many
primary conservation areas exist in the district.
            2.   Management purpose. The ROS District must be managed to
sustain and restore the rural and natural character of the corridor and to
protect and enhance habitat, parks and open space, public river corridor views,
and scenic, natural, and historic areas.
         (b)   River Neighborhood (RN).
            1.   Description. The RN District is characterized by primarily
residential neighborhoods that are riparian or readily visible from the river
or that abut riparian parkland. The district includes parks and open space,
limited commercial development, marinas, and related land uses.
            2.   Management purpose. The RN District must be managed to
maintain the character of the river corridor within the context of existing
residential and related neighborhood development, and to protect and enhance
habitat, parks and open space, public river corridor views, and scenic,
natural, and historic areas. Minimizing erosion and the flow of untreated storm
water into the river and enhancing habitat and shoreline vegetation are
priorities in the district.
         (c)   Separated from River (SR).
            1.   Description. The SR District is characterized by its physical
and visual distance from the Mississippi River. The district includes land
separated from the river by distance, topography, development, or a
transportation corridor. The land in this district is not readily visible from
the Mississippi River.
            2.   Management purpose. The SR District provides flexibility in
managing development without negatively affecting the key resources and
features of the river corridor. Minimizing negative impacts to primary
conservation areas and minimizing erosion and flow of untreated storm water
into the Mississippi River are priorities in the district. The RTC District
must be managed in a manner that allows continued growth and redevelopment in
historic downtowns and more intensive redevelopment in limited areas at river
crossings to accommodate compact walkable development patterns and connections
to the river. Minimizing erosion and the flow of untreated storm water into the
river, providing public access to and public views of the river, and restoring
natural vegetation in riparian areas and tree canopy are priorities in the
district.
      (3)   MRCCA district map. The locations and boundaries of the MRCCA
Districts established by this section are shown on MRCCA Overlay District map
which is incorporated herein by reference. The district boundary lines are
intended to follow the centerlines of rivers and streams, highways, streets,
lot lines, and municipal boundaries, unless a boundary line is otherwise
indicated on the map. Where district boundaries cross unsubdivided property,
the district boundary line is determined by use of dimensions or the scale
appearing on the map.
   (E)   Special land use provisions.
      (1)   Purpose. To identify development standards and considerations for
land uses that have potential to negatively impact primary conservation areas
and public river corridor views.
      (2)   Underlying zoning. Uses within the MRCCA are determined by
underlying zoning, with additional provisions for the following land uses:
         (a)   Agricultural use. Perennial ground cover is required within 50
feet of the ordinary high water level and within the bluff impact zone.
         (b)   Feedlots. New animal feedlots and manure storage areas are
prohibited. Existing animal feedlots and manure storage areas must conform with
Minn. Rules, Chapter 7020.
         (c)   Forestry. Tree harvesting and biomass harvesting within
woodlands, and associated reforestation, must be consistent with recommended
practices in Conserving Wooded Areas in Developing Communities: Best Management
Practices in Minnesota.
         (d)   Non-metallic mining. Non-metallic mining requires a conditional
use permit or interim use permit issued by the local government, subject to the
following:
            1.   New non-metallic mining is prohibited within the shore impact
zone and bluff impact zone and within the required structure setback from the
bluffline and OHWL;
            2.   Processing machinery must be located consistent with setback
standards for structures as provided in division (F)(3);

operations must not be readily visible and must be screened by establishing and
maintaining natural vegetation. The unscreened boundaries of non-metallic
mining areas are limited to only the barge loading area;
            5.   A site management plan must be developed by the operator and
approved by the local government before new non-metallic mining commences.
Operations must be consistent with the site plan throughout the duration of
operations at the site. The site management plan must:
               a.   Describe how the site will be developed over time with an
emphasis on minimizing environmental risk to public waters;
               b.   Explain where staged reclamation may occur at certain

§ 152.803 PLANNED DEVELOPMENT OVERLAY.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of the Planned Development Overlay is to promote
creative and efficient use of land by providing design flexibility in the
application of the provisions of a primary zoning district by providing an
overlay district on top of any of the primary zoning districts. It is the
applicant's responsibility to demonstrate that the proposed planned development
is not simply for enhanced gain and accomplishes one or more of the following:
      (1)   Introduce flexibility of site design and architecture for the
conservation of land, natural features and open space through clustering of
structures, facilities, amenities and activities for public benefit.
      (2)   Improve the efficiency of public streets and utilities through a
more efficient and effective use of land, open space and public facilities
through assembly and development of land in larger parcels.
      (3)   Internal organization and adequacy of various uses or densities,
circulation and parking facilities, urban services, recreation areas, open
spaces, screening and landscaping, and the ability to demonstrate that a viable
development will be created.
      (4)   Provide mixed land use and land use transitions in keeping with the
character of adjacent land uses and the underlying zoning districts; and,
      (5)   Provide for the clustering of land parcels for development as an
integrated, coordinated unit as opposed to a parcel by parcel, piecemeal
approach and to maintain these parcels by central management including
integrated and joint use of parking, maintenance of open space and similar
features, and harmonious selection and efficient distribution of uses.
   (B)   Intent. The intent of this designation is to encourage development
that is superior in quality and design than could be achieved through
traditional zoning. The boundaries of this overlay are amended for each
application as approved through on the development plan through the rezoning
process outlined elsewhere in this chapter.
   (C)   Flexibilities. The City Council may grant certain flexibility to
zoning requirements if the applicant demonstrates to the Council's satisfaction
that the purpose and intent have been satisfied. Such flexibilities may
include:
      (1)   Land use. Flexibility in land use may be provided by a PDO,
however, the uses in the underlying zoning district may be further restricted.
      (2)   Density. Flexibility in density may be granted if consistent with
the land use designation in the comprehensive plan.
      (3)   Site design. Specific lot area, lot width, setbacks, height, yard,
floor area ratio, landscaping, and open space requirements may be established
for the PDO.
      (4)   Parking and loading. Flexibility in the design and location of off-
street parking facilities and loading areas is permitted with the approval of
such facilities by the city engineer; however, in no case shall gravel parking
areas be permitted.
      (5)   Signage. Flexibility in the design and location of signage is
permitted; however, in no case shall pylon signs be permitted.
      (6)   Stormwater. Stormwater facilities may be shared between parcels if
part of an approved PDO.
   (D)   Procedures. Planned development projects shall adhere to the rezoning
procedure listed in §
152.309 and site plan review listed in §
152.303.
   (E)   Maintenance requirements. If common open space or service facilities
are provided within the PDO, the PDO shall contain provisions to assure the
continued operation and maintenance of such open space and service facilities
to a predetermined reasonable standard. Open space and facilities may be placed
under the ownership of one of the following, as approved by the City Council:
      (1)   Dedicated to the public, where a community-wide use is anticipated,
and the City Council agrees to accept the dedication;
      (2)   Landlord control, where only use by tenants is anticipated; or
      (3)   Property owners' association, provided all the following conditions
are met:
         (a)   Prior to the use, occupancy, sale, or the execution of contract
for sale of individual buildings, units, lots, parcels, tracts or common areas,
a recorded declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions, or an
equivalent document as specified by state statute, must be filed with the city.
         (b)   Such document shall be filed with and reviewed and approved by
the City Attorney prior to recordation with the county.
   (F)   Phasing of public and common open space. When a PDO provides for
common private or public open space, and is planned for a phased development
over a period of time, the total area of common or public open space or land
escrow security in any phase of development may, at a minimum, bear the same
relationship to the total open space to be provided in the entire PDO as the
phases or units completed or under development bear to the entire PDO.
   (G)   Modifications or amendments. Minor modifications, as determined by the
City Manager, are subject to the site plan review process established in §
152.303. Major modifications or amendments, including changes in land use,
density, maintenance of open space or common areas, or extensive changes to
road, utility, or open space must follow the same procedures for submittal,
notification, and public hearing as the original PDO.

in the PPOD shall provide commercial uses, subject to the requirements of this
section.
      (3)   Size of required commercial use space. In a multi-story building
the commercial use or uses shall occupy at least 60% of the building's ground-
floor street frontage and a minimum depth of 20 feet. In a single-story
building the commercial use or uses shall occupy 100% of the building's street
frontage and a minimum interior depth of 20 feet.
      (4)   Use of required commercial space. Required commercial use areas
shall be occupied by one or more of the following uses. Building amenities
intended for use solely by building occupants and not open to the general
public shall not qualify as a required commercial use.
         (a)   Retail and service.
         (b)   Restaurant and brewpubs.

regulating plan, approved with the rezoning to TOD-G, which includes a
combination of at least two of the three intensities described below and
regulated by Table 152.1004.2 below. TOD-G areas must be divided into
neighborhoods by the introduction of a primary thoroughfare network, and then
into blocks by the completion of the streets and open spaces. As the area is
subdivided to generate blocks, parcels and individual building sites, the
regulating plan assigns intensities that may be refined with approval by the
City Manager according to §
152.201. Regulating plans, consisting of one or more maps, must show the
following:
         (a)   District boundaries;
         (b)   Existing infrastructure including streets, parks and open space;
         (c)   Thoroughfare network according to division (G)(4) with
thoroughfare assignments according to Tables 152.1004.3 and 152.1004.2; and
         (d)   Civic area in compliance with §
152.1006.
      (3)   Intensities. TOD-G intensities are comprised of:

with a mix of uses, home occupations, and accessory buildings. It contains a
wide range of building types: houses, courtyard housing, townhouses, duplexes,
triplexes, small apartment buildings, and neighborhood commercial uses. This
area must be more than 1,500 feet from a high frequency transit service
station.
         (b)   Medium intensity. Consists of a mix of uses but is primarily
medium to high density residential and neighborhood commercial uses.
         (c)   High intensity. Consists of high density mixed-use buildings
that accommodate retail, offices, institutions, and multi-family housing.

   (H)   MU Mixed Use building, site and public realm standards.
      (1)   Purpose and applicability. The structure of the MU District
provides the city and future development groups with the regulations and
guidelines needed to develop a comprehensive, resilient and pedestrian-oriented
neighborhood. The subdivision regulations in division (H)(4) provide the
following:
         (a)   A network of connected streets and blocks that reflect an
approved station area plan;
         (b)   General block sizes and configurations that support zoning and
land use goals;
         (c)   Maximum block perimeters that foster attractive, safe and
walkable environments, while enhancing circulation through the site; and
         (d)   Guidance on meeting regional stormwater requirements as detailed
in the Brooklyn Park Subarea Stormwater Master Plan.
      (2)   Regulating plan. The MU District is implemented through a
regulating plan, to be submitted prior to or in conjunction with other required
applications. Areas zoned MU must be divided into neighborhoods by the
introduction of a primary thoroughfare network, and then into blocks by the
completion of the streets and open spaces. Regulating plans must be recorded
against all properties governed by the plan and must show the following:
         (a)   District boundaries;
         (b)   Existing infrastructure including streets, parks and open space;
         (c)   Thoroughfare network according to division (3) with thoroughfare
assignments according to Tables 152.1004.7 or 152.1004.8; and
      (3)   Civic area in compliance with §
152.1006.
      (4)   Subdivision regulations.
         (a)   The provisions of this section will be used upon subdivision
within the MU Zoning District.
         (b)   The thoroughfare network must be laid out according to Table
152.1004.6 and comply with the standards of division (4)(b)1. below.

Block Dimensions         Dimensions
Block length             400 ft. max.
Block perimeter          1,600 ft. max.
Alley width              16 ft. min.
Mid-block Pedestrian Passages
Pedestrian passage width 12 ft. min., 24 ft. max.
 
            1.   Thoroughfare standards.
               a.   All thoroughfares must connect to other thoroughfares,
forming a network.
               b.   New thoroughfares must connect wherever possible to
thoroughfares on adjacent sites. Cul-de-sacs may only be permitted by approval
of the City Manager to accommodate specific site conditions.
               c.   New thoroughfares must implement any approved small area
plan street network and use street section options from Table 152.1004.7.
               d.   A section may be chosen according to right-of-way width and
functional classification. New thoroughfare sections may be created using the
standards in Table 152.1004.8.
            2.   Block dimensions. Block length and perimeter may be adjusted
up to 20% with approval from the City Manager due to topography, existing
development conditions, or if the block is at the perimeter of the regulating
plan. Block lengths up to 800 feet may be approved if a mid-block pedestrian
passage is provided.
            3.   Mid-block pedestrian passages. In areas with adequate
vehicular capacity, pedestrian-only connections may be used mid-block and will
count as a new edge in block perimeter calculations.
            4.   Parking lot layout. In addition to the parking regulations of
§
152.1020(5)(a), parking lots in MU must be laid out as blocks per Table
152.1004.6, with utilities located in the drive aisles. Drive aisles must have
adequate width to redevelop with rights-of-way required by one or more of the
thoroughfare sections in Table 152.1004.7.

§ 152.1005 BUILDING AND SITE DESIGN STANDARDS, NONRESIDENTIAL.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of establishing criteria for architectural design
and exterior facing materials is to ensure a high standard of development that
is compatible with neighboring development and contributes to a community image
of permanence, stability, and visual aesthetics, while preventing impermanent
construction and use of materials that are unsightly, rapidly deteriorate, or
cause urban blight. The standards are further intended to ensure coordinated
design of building facades, additions, and accessory structures in to prevent
visual disharmony.
   (B)   Applicability. The standards apply in all business districts (B-1, B-
2, B-3, B-4, BP, I, PI, OP).
   (C)   General requirements.
      (1)   Building construction and design may be used to create a structure
with equally attractive sides, except for those instances specified in this
section.
      (2)   Primary building entrances must be clearly defined to promote
visual interest and architectural presence.
      (3)   Large, uninterrupted expanses of a single material are not
permitted, unless approved by the City Manager.
      (4)   No wall that faces a public right-of-way, park, the public view
from adjacent properties, or a residential use or district shall have an
uninterrupted length exceeding 100 feet without including at least two of the
following: change in plane, change in texture or masonry pattern, two class one
materials, windows in a manner that is impactful to the design, or an
equivalent element that subdivides the wall into human scale proportions.
      (5)   Any other building, such as the case with multiple buildings on a
single parcel, accessory buildings, or parking structures, should be of
compatible design and materials with emphasis on the position(s) of the
building(s) to give visual interest.
      (6)   Additions for principal buildings constructed before the effective
date of the chapter may be of similar materials and design as the principal
structure.
   (D)   Class of materials. Acceptable exterior materials are divided into
Class 1 and Class 2 categories as shown in
Table 152.1005.1 below.
TABLE 152.1005.1 CLASSES OF MATERIALS

      (1)   Required combination of materials. Buildings must incorporate
classes of materials for each facade in the following manner:
         (a)   Office, service, and retail buildings.
            1.   Front facades and side and rear facades visible from public
right(s)-of-way, the public view from adjacent properties, parks, or
residential uses or districts must be composed of at least two or more Class 1
materials totaling 65% of the facade.
            2.   Side and rear facades not visible from public right-of-way,
parks, public view from adjacent properties or residential uses or districts
must use a combination of Class 1 or 2 materials.
            3.   Facades visible from public right-of-way must include windows,
doors, canopies or other treatments that help mitigate the appearance of blank
walls.
         (b)   Industrial and warehouse buildings, multi-tenant office/
industrial /warehouse or showroom/warehouse or other combinations.
            1.   Front facades must be composed of at least two or more Class 1
materials totaling 65%.
            2.   Side and rear facades visible from public right(s)-of-way,
parks, public view from adjacent properties, or residential uses or districts
must be composed of at least two or more Class 1 materials totaling 50%.
            3.   Side and rear facades not visible from public right(s)-of-way,
parks, public view from adjacent properties or residential uses or districts
must use a combination of Class 1 or 2 materials.
         (c)   Buildings for uses that do not conform to any of the above list
of uses must conform to the materials and proportion of office and retail
buildings listed in division (D)(1)(a), above.
   (E)   Exterior surface finishes. All exterior surfaces must be finished with
the appropriate sealant, stain, paint, or other process (to manufacturer's
specifications) to withstand the elements and prevent fading, chipping,
chalking, cracking, peeling, warping, rot, rust, water damage, or other natural
degrading process, with the exception of those materials, like copper, where
the degrading process is architecturally desirable and must not be allowed to
become or remain in an unsafe condition as defined by the Uniform Building and
Fire Codes.

§ 152.1006 CIVIC SPACES.
   (A)   Civic spaces are required to be provided in all mixed use district
developments, as part of the regulating plan in compliance with §
152.304.
   (B)   All Mixed Use District developments must dedicate 5-10% of the total
area to civic space.
   (C)   Civic spaces should be placed in such a manner to enhance pedestrian
circulation through the development, and should contain a mixture of civic
space types. The civic spaces must be designed according to

   (D)   Landscape areas. The landscape requirements have been divided into
four categories: canopy cover (C), foundation landscape (FL), open areas
landscape (OL), landscape screen (LS) and street trees (ST).
      (1)   Canopy cover (CC). The purpose of this requirement is to mitigate
the effects of vehicular hardscape by establishing tree canopy cover to
intercept rainfall, protect pavement from sun deterioration, reduce the heat
island affect, and improve aesthetics. Vehicular hardscape area shall include
all loading drives, parking lots, driveways, drop-offs, and other areas covered

trees shall be located within parking areas and not within any required
perimeter landscaping area. Pervious pavements are considered 50% hardscape.
         (b)   Required canopy trees shall be located within the parking lot
area islands (minimum width of six feet and total area of 180 square feet if
designed as end island or nine feet in width if designed as continuous island
between bays.
      (2)   Foundation landscape (FL).
         (a)   The purpose of this requirement is to soften and enhance
building architecture, define access points, add color and seasonal interest,
and to blend buildings in with the natural environment.
         (b)   At least 40% of the total building perimeter shall be sodded or
landscaped with approved ground cover, low level plantings in an area of no
less than six feet in width.

§ 152.1019 PARKING.
   (A)   Purpose. Establish off-street parking standards to allow for the
orderly and adequate storage of vehicles on property, to alleviate and prevent
congestion on public rights-of-way, and control the appearance and maintenance
of parking areas and surfaces.
   (B)   Applicability. All property in the city must comply with the minimum
parking requirements of this subchapter unless an exception is granted per
division (D) below.
   (C)   Required parking. Tables
152.1019.1 and
152.1019.2 below establish the minimum number of off-street parking spaces
required based on land use. For uses not specifically listed, off-street
parking requirements may be established by the City Manager based upon the
characteristics of the use and the district in which the use is located.
   (D)   Exceptions to required parking. Parking requirements may be reduced
when approved by the City Manager in the following cases.
      (1)   Industry standards. Based on verifiable information pertaining to
industry parking standards.
      (2)   Proof of future parking. If it is clearly demonstrated by the owner
that the required parking is more than anticipated demand, all required parking
need not be constructed initially. A minimum number of spaces, as negotiated
between the developer and the City Manager, shall initially be constructed. The
remainder of the required spaces, as shown on the site plan, may be constructed
by the owner if the City Manager determines they are needed. The area of future
parking must be sodded with grass and kept free of shrubs or trees. To ensure
the construction of the future spaces, a financial guarantee may be required by
the city. Any changes to use and/or building size could invalidate the
approval.
      (3)   Shared parking.
         (a)   Parking areas may be shared by uses on adjoining lots within 500
feet of the entrances to the uses it will serve.
         (b)   Cross access easements shall be required to accommodate shared
parking arrangements and access drives, and evidence of the maintenance of all
shared facilities may be provided to the city for review and may be recorded.
      (4)   Public parking and transit. All uses, other than residential,
located in proximity to rapid transit and/or municipal parking facilities shall
be entitled to a reduced parking requirement based on the following criteria.
         (a)   Uses within 650 feet of municipal parking garages or lots shall
be entitled to a 10% reduction in required parking.
         (b)   Uses within 1,000 feet of a bus stop or transit station shall be
entitled to a 20% reduction in required parking.
      (5)   Parking study. A parking study prepared by a registered
professional engineer indicates a reduced number of parking stalls can
adequately serve the proposed use. Said study shall include, at a minimum, the
following:
         (a)   Size and type of uses or activities on site;
         (b)   Composition of tenancy on site;
         (c)   Rate of parking turnover;
         (d)   Peak traffic and parking loads to be encountered;
         (e)   Local parking habits; and
         (f)   Availability of public transportation.
      (6)   Credit for on-street parking. This subsection is intended to reduce
the amount of unnecessary parking spaces and to encourage pedestrian activity
as an alternative means of transportation. Requests for on street parking shall
meet the following requirements:
         (a)   All on street parking facilities shall be designed in
conformance with the standards established by the city.
         (b)   Prior to approving any requests for on street parking, the
development review team shall determine that the proposed on-street parking
will not materially adversely impact traffic movements and related public
street functions.
         (c)   Credit for on street parking shall be limited to the number of
spaces provided along the street frontage adjacent to the use.
         (d)   A public sidewalk must be present or installed along the street
used for on-street parking for the entire length of the property or the area
anticipated for parking, whichever is greater, with a walkway connection to the
entrance of the building.

adjacent to sidewalks.
      (3)   All parking spaces must be designated by clearly visible painted
lines.
      (4)   Nonresidential driveway width shall be approved at the time of site
plan review based on expected traffic demands and road classification.
   (D)   Curbing required. Paving areas must be separated with curb and gutter
from all designated landscaping areas, curb islands, and at ingress-egress
locations to the traveled roadway. Curbing must be constructed of poured-in-
place concrete equipped with a gutter and must be of a six-inch non-

stalls, aisles and driveways.
      (2)   The use of pervious paving/paver systems is encouraged for
pedestrian walkways, parking areas, overflow parking areas, snow storage areas,
within raised medians and islands, emergency vehicle lanes and other low
traffic areas. The owner shall provide soils information and the City Engineer
shall make the final determination if soils are conducive for use of pervious
paving/paver systems. Owners of property in Business, Industrial and Mixed-Use
Districts shall enter into a maintenance agreement to ensure ongoing
maintenance and operation of all pervious paving/paver systems. This
requirement also applies to open sales lots, open rental lots, and outdoor
storage or display areas. Other materials such as decorative rock, gravel,
sand, or bare soil are prohibited.
      (3)   Any parking spaces proposed in excess over minimum requirements, as
listed in §
152.1019, shall use a pervious paver system (provided appropriate soil
conditions exist, as determined by the City Engineer), within the total square
footage of excess parking proposed, as approved by the City Engineer.
   (F)   Drainage. Driveways shall not exceed a grade of 4% and all parking
lots except those for less than four vehicles shall include a minimum of a 1%
grade. Catch basins, sumps, and underground storm sewers must be installed if

   (G)   Traffic regulatory signs. Stop signs are required at all driveway
exits to city streets. Other signs may be required as part of the site plan
review process.
   (H)   Shared parking. Parking areas may be shared by uses on adjoining lots
within 500 feet of the entrances to the uses it will serve provided that the
following are met:
      (1)   The marking or signing of parking spaces in multitenant building
for the exclusive use of specific tenants is not permitted.
      (2)   Certain uses that have their highest peak demand for parking at
substantially different times of the day or week can consider a plan to provide
required parking by sharing parking with adjacent uses based on the following
criteria:
         (a)   Up to 50% of the off-street parking stalls required for a
theatre, bowling alley, dance hall, bar, or restaurant may be supplied by the
off-street parking facilities provided by types of uses specified as a
primarily daytime use in division (H)(2)(d) below.
         (b)   Up to 50% of the off-street parking stalls required for any use
specified under division (H)(2)(d) below as primary daytime uses may be
supplied by the parking facilities provided by the following nighttime or
Sunday uses: auditoriums incidental to a public or parochial school, churches,
bowling alleys, dance halls, theatres, bars, or restaurants.
         (c)   Up to 50% of the off-street parking stalls required by §
152.1019 for a religious institution or for an auditorium incidental to a
public or parochial school may be supplied by off-street parking facilities
provided by uses specified under division (H)(2)(d) below as primarily daytime
uses.
         (d)   For the purpose of this section, the following uses are
considered as primarily daytime uses, such as banks, business offices, retail
stores/shopping centers, personal service shops, household equipment or
furniture shops, clothing or shoe repair or service shops, manufacturing,
wholesale, and similar uses.
      (3)   The parking area must have a pedestrian connection, which includes
a trail or walkway, paved with a continuous impervious surface that connects to
all users of the shared parking.
      (4)   The parking plan for the area must demonstrate that all other
applicable ordinances can be met.
      (5)   Any adjacent properties with approved shared parking agreements
must have vehicle access between them.
      (6)   The agreement between all affected property owners may be approved
as to content by the City Attorney and may define responsibilities for
maintenance. Where shared use of parking exists within the same site or across
sites, a properly drawn legal instrument, drafted and executed by the parties
concerned, must be filed as a deed restriction on both properties with the
records for both properties in the Registrar of Titles' or Recorder's Office of
Hennepin County with proof thereof presented to the city. The intent in either
case is that the agreement will be in the public record in perpetuity, and not
altered unless approved by the city.
      (7)   Revocation. Failure to comply with the shared parking provisions of
this section constitutes a violation of this code. A shared parking agreement
may be revoked by the parties to the agreement only if off-street parking is
provided as otherwise set forth in §
152.1019, or if an alternative shared parking plan is approved by the city.
      (8)   Multi-tenant buildings. A parking lot for a building containing
more than one tenant or user is considered shared between all users. Exclusive
parking spaces are not permitted.
      (9)   Time-limited (i.e., ten-minute parking) parking spaces are
permitted.
   (I)   Parking areas for interim or temporary uses in the UR Urban Reserve
District are exempt from provisions in §
152.1019 only when approved through the interim use permit process as described
in §
152.306.
   (J)   Parking lot landscaping and screening. This section is intended to
break up large impervious areas and provide greater shading and reduction of
heat island effect. Review and approval of a landscape plan shall be required
for new parking lots and changes to existing parking areas that create or
affect more than four stalls prior to issuance of any permits, including snow
removal.
      (1)   All landscaped areas, including parking area islands must be
equipped with an underground, automatic irrigation system. The irrigation
system must include a flow meter, moisture sensing devices and must be
calibrated to meet all applicable city codes.
      (2)   10% of the impervious, interior parking area must be landscape
islands, rain gardens or other green space. The 10% is included as part of the
total open space requirement.
      (3)   Landscape islands.
         (a)   All parking lots of at least 25 parking stalls or more shall be
designed with landscaped parking lot islands distributed throughout the entire
parking area.
         (b)   To ensure adequate distribution of landscaped islands within
parking lots no more than the maximum number of stalls as displayed in
Table 152.1020.2 below may be installed without abutting some type of
landscaped islands.
         (c)   Landscaped islands may be designed at the ends of stalls, in a
continuous row between bays as shown in the diagram below, or in other
patterns, provided that an island is abutting parking stalls based on
Table 152.1020.2 below.
         (d)   Islands designed at the end of rows shall have a minimum size of
180 square feet. Continuous parking lot islands shall be at least nine feet in
width.
         (e)   Islands can be designed at the end of rows or in a continuous
row to meet the maximum number of stalls between island requirements.

§ 152.1026 TELECOMMUNICATION TOWERS.
   (A)   Purpose. The Council finds that regulations are necessary to
accommodate the communication service facilities to benefit the needs of
residents and businesses while protecting the public health, safety, and
general welfare of the community. These regulations are necessary to:
      (1)   Provide for the appropriate locations for the development of
communication facilities to serve the residents and businesses of the city;
      (2)   Minimize adverse visual effects of communication towers and other
facilities through careful design and siting standards;
      (3)   Avoid potential tower failure damage to adjacent properties through
structural standards and setback requirements; and
      (4)   Maximize the use of existing and approved towers, buildings, and
other structures to accommodate wireless telecommunication devices to reduce
the number of towers needed to serve the community.
   (B)   Existing antennas and towers.
      (1)   Previous licensees, owners, operators, or secured parties must
remove all abandoned or unused towers or associated facilities and equipment
within 12 months of the cessation of operations at the site. Cessation of
operations means the removal of the antennas from the tower or the cessation of
electricity and/or phone service to the site.
      (2)   All hazardous towers or associated facilities and equipment as
defined in the Uniform Building Codes definition of hazardous structures must
be removed from the property within a maximum of 60 days of the date of the
hazardous determination by the city. The city may require more expeditious
removal based on the nature of the hazard.
   (C)   General requirements.
      (1)   No towers may be constructed in the Mississippi River Critical Area
Overlay.
      (2)   Towers and antennas in parks must obtain a valid lease from the
appropriate city, county, or state agency.
      (3)   Towers and antennas may not be artificially lighted except if
required by the FAA unless they are incorporated into the approved design of
the tower, such as light fixtures illuminating ball fields, parking lots, or a
similar use.
      (4)   Roof or wall-mounted communication devices (excluding satellite
dishes) shall adhere to the following standards.
         (a)   Roof-mounted antennas must be no more than 15 feet in height.
         (b)   Roof-mounted antennas and their accessory equipment/buildings
must be setback from the edge of the principal building or structure a distance
equal to the height of the antenna, equipment, or building.
         (c)   Installation of the antennas requires a building permit. The
applicant must submit a report prepared by a qualified professional engineer
licensed by the State of Minnesota indicating the existing structure or tower's
suitability to accept the antenna, and the proposed method of affixing the
antenna to the structure. Complete details of all fixtures and couplings, and
the precise point of attachment must be indicated.
         (d)   All other antennas may be considered conditional unless
otherwise modified in this chapter.
         (e)   Proof of non-interference with public safety telecommunications.
Each application for construction of wireless communication equipment includes
a statement from a qualified professional engineer licensed by the State of
Minnesota that the construction of the tower, including reception and
transmission functions, will not interfere with public safety
telecommunications, provided however, that no application requires any
statement regarding the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to
the extent that the wireless telecommunication equipment complies with FCC
regulations concerning such emissions. Before the introduction of any new
service or changes in existing service, telecommunication providers must notify
the city and the Hennepin County Sheriff's Radio Systems Manager at least ten
calendar days in advance of such changes to allow interference levels to be
monitored during the testing process.
      (5)   Construction and design requirements. Proposed or modified towers
and antennas must meet the following design requirements:
         (a)   All towers and antennas erected, constructed or located within
the city, and all wiring must comply with the requirements set forth in the
Minnesota Building Code;
         (b)   Towers and antennas must be designed to blend into the
surrounding environment through the use of color and camouflaging architectural
treatment, except when otherwise dictated by federal or state authorities. The
telecommunications facilities must use as many stealth design techniques as
reasonably possible. Economic considerations alone are not justification for
failing to provide stealth design techniques; and
         (c)   Commercial wireless telecommunication service towers intended
primarily for the support of their related antennas must be self-supporting
monopoles unless the City Council determines that an alternative design would
better blend into the surrounding environment. The use of guyed towers is
prohibited.
      (6)   Permanent platforms or other structures exclusive of antennas that
serve to increase off-site visibility are prohibited.
      (7)   The use of any portion of a tower for signs other than warning or
equipment information signs is prohibited.
      (8)   Accessory buildings and equipment. All accessory equipment related
to towers and antennas must be housed within an existing structure whenever
possible. Any new accessory buildings, lockers, and/or ground mounted equipment
must meet the following:
         (a)   They must be architecturally designed to blend in with the
surrounding environment, subject to the landscaping and screening requirements
of §
152.1013 and §
152.1024.
         (b)   They must meet the minimum setback requirements of the
underlying zoning district, unless they are located on the roof of the
principal building, in which case they must be setback from the edge a distance
equal to their height.
         (c)   Unless the accessory equipment is mounted on an existing
structure or housed within an existing structure, the city may require a
security fence around the base of the tower and/or accessory equipment. If
required, the security fence must have a maximum opacity of 50% and meet the
fencing requirements elsewhere in the city code.
      (9)   Maintenance hours. Nonemergency maintenance of towers, antennas and
associated equipment must be completed between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 7:00
p.m. for all towers within 1,000 feet of a residential district.
      (10)   Collocation requirements. All towers erected, constructed, or
located within the city to support antennas for wireless communication service
providers as defined in §
152.105, must comply with the following requirements:
         (a)   The City Council will not approve a proposal for a new tower
unless it finds that the antennas cannot be accommodated on an existing or
approved tower or building within a one-mile search radius (one-half-mile
search radius for towers 120 feet or less in height) of the proposed tower due
to one or more of the following reasons:
            1.   The planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity of
the existing or approved tower or building, as documented by a qualified
professional engineer licensed by the State of Minnesota and the existing or
approved tower cannot be reinforced, modified, or replaced to accommodate
planned or equivalent equipment;
            2.   The planned equipment would cause interference materially
impacting the usability of other existing or planned equipment at the tower or
building as documented by a qualified professional engineer licensed by the
State of Minnesota and the interference cannot be prevented;
            3.   Existing or approved towers and buildings within the search
radius cannot accommodate the planned equipment at a height necessary to
function as documented by a qualified professional engineer licensed by the
State of Minnesota;
            4.   Written documentation that the applicant made a good faith,
diligent, but unsuccessful effort to install or collocate the antenna(e) within
the defined search radius. The documentation must include the names, addresses
and telephone numbers of all owners of other towers, buildings, or other
structures of appropriate height, including those on city-owned property; and
            5.   Other unforeseen circumstances as approved by Council.
         (b)   Any proposed tower intended to support antennas for wireless
communication service providers, as defined in §
152.105, and its proposed site must be designed structurally, electrically, and
in all respects, to accommodate both the applicant's antennas and accessory
equipment and comparable antennas and equipment for at least two additional
users if the tower is over 100 feet in height and for at least one additional
user if the tower is between 60 to 100 feet in height. Towers must be designed
to allow for future rearrangement of antennas upon the tower and to accept
antennas mounted at varying heights. Alternative designs for towers with more
than three users may be approved by the City Council if they prevent the
construction of multiple towers and are found to be compatible with the
neighborhood; and
         (c)   Any tower proposed at less than 75 feet must be constructed with
a foundation adequate to accommodate an additional 20 feet of height to
accommodate an additional user. The applicant must provide written evidence
that they will allow the extra height added to their tower with a reasonable
request for a collocation lease.
      (11)   Tower and/or antenna setbacks. Towers and antennas must meet the
setbacks of the underlying zoning district, unless modified by the following:
         (a)   A tower's setback may be reduced or its location in relation to
a public street varied, at the sole discretion of the City Council, to allow
the integration of a tower into an existing or proposed structure such as a
church steeple, light standard, power line support device, or similar
structure;
         (b)   In Business Park (BP) and Industrial (I) Zoning Districts,
towers and/or antennas may encroach into the rear setback area, provided that
the rear property line abuts another property in the Business Park (BP) or
Industrial (I) District and the tower does not encroach upon any easements;
         (c)   All towers and/or antennas must be set back from planned public
rights-of-way as documented in city corridor studies, the Comprehensive Plan,
or the appropriate county or state plans, by a minimum distance equal to one
half of the height of the tower including all antennas and attachments;
         (d)   If applicable, setbacks for towers and/or antennas must be
determined for the full height of the proposed tower, including extension/
expansion height as may be required elsewhere in this chapter;
         (e)   Towers in residential districts shall be setback a distance
equal to four times the height of the structure; and
         (f)   Towers in districts adjacent to residential parcels used
primarily or guided for residential purposes shall be setback a distance equal
to two times the height of the tower.
      (12)   Height. Height may be determined by measuring the vertical
distance from the tower's point of contact with the ground to the highest point
of the tower, including all antennas or other attachments. When towers are
mounted upon or attached to other structures, the combined height of the
structure and tower must meet the height restrictions of this section. In
addition, all towers must meet the following:
         (a)   In all residential zoning districts on parcels other than those
used primarily for residential purposes, the maximum height of any tower,
including all antennas and other attachments, may not exceed one foot for each
four feet the tower is setback from residential parcels used primarily or
guided for residential purposes, up to a maximum height of 125 feet; and
         (b)   In all nonresidential zoning districts, the maximum height of
any tower, including all antennas and other attachments, may not exceed one
foot for each two feet the tower is setback from residential parcels used
primarily or guided for residential purposes up to a maximum height of 125
feet.
      (13)   Preference for identification of tower sites. The following
preferences shall be followed in site selection for new towers when collocation
is not possible:
         (a)   Existing buildings or structures;
         (b)   Public institution sites;
         (c)   Sites zoned BP or I;
         (d)   Sites zoned B-3 or B-4;
         (e)   Sites zoned B-1 or B-2; and
         (f)   Other properties consistent with provisions of this subchapter.
   (D)   Towers and antennas in residential areas. All towers and antennas in
the following residential and mixed-use districts: R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-5, and
in those areas in the PDO guided for low and medium residential development
must comply to the following:
      (1)   Radio and television towers and antennas. Proposed towers for
personal radio and television antennas located on parcels zoned residential and
used primarily for residential purposes may be considered permitted if they
meet the following conditions:
         (a)   The tower and/or antennas, including all accessory antennas and
other attachments, is (are) at or below the maximum height as regulated
elsewhere in the city code;
         (b)   It meets the setbacks of the underlying district;
         (c)   It is located to the rear of the property; and
         (d)   Only one tower is allowed per parcel.
      (2)   Personal (non-commercial) radio and television towers and antennas
that exceed the maximum height defined elsewhere in the city code and
commercial towers shall be considered conditional uses in residential
districts. Commercial towers may only be allowed as a conditional use on the
following parcels:
         (a)   Religious institution sites, when constructed in or as part of a
steeple, spire, bell tower or similar architectural feature;
         (b)   Park sites, if conformance with this section are met to the
satisfaction of the city; and
         (c)   Government, school, utility, and institutional uses.

§ 153.02 PURPOSE.
   This chapter is established to promote, preserve and enhance natural
resources within the City of Brooklyn Park and protect them from adverse
effects occasioned by poorly sited development or incompatible activities by
regulating land disturbing or development activities that would have an adverse
and potentially irreversible impact on water quality and unique or fragile
environmentally sensitive land. This chapter minimizes conflicts and encourages
compatibility between land disturbing and development activities and
environmentally sensitive lands. By requiring detailed review standards and
procedures for land disturbing or development activities proposed for such
areas, this chapter achieves a balance between urban growth and development and
the protection of water and natural resources within the city.
(Ord. 2017-1217, passed 7-10-17)
§ 153.03 SCOPE.
   (A)   Applicability.
      (1)   Every applicant for subdivision approval, conditional use permit,
or a grading permit to allow land disturbing activities must submit a
stormwater management plan to the Engineering Department. The stormwater
management plan shall be submitted with the building permit, grading permit
application, or as directed by the Engineering Department. No subdivision
approval or grading permit will be issued until approval of the stormwater
management plan or a waiver has been obtained in conformance with the
provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   Every applicant for subdivision approval or a grading permit that
involves wetland disturbing activities or work near wetlands must submit a
wetland assessment and delineation report to the Engineering Department. The
wetland assessment and delineation report shall be submitted with the grading
permit application, or as directed by the Engineering Department. No
subdivision approval, or grading permit will be issued until approval of the
wetland replacement plan application or a Certificate of Exemption has been
obtained in conformance with the provisions of this chapter and the Minnesota
Wetland Conservation Act of 1991, M.S. §§ 103G.222 - .2373 ("WCA").
   (3)   Every applicant for a building permit, subdivision approval,
conditional use permit, or a grading permit must submit an application for an
erosion control plan to the Engineering Department. The erosion control plan
shall be submitted with the building permit application, land use application,
grading permit application, or as directed by the Engineering Department. No
grading permit or building permit will be issued until approval of the erosion
control plan has been obtained in conformance with the erosion control
measures, standards and specifications contained in the MPCA's Minnesota
Stormwater Manual, or as otherwise approved by the City Engineer.
   (B)   Exemptions. The provisions of this chapter do not apply to:
      (1)   Any part of a subdivision if a preliminary plat for the subdivision
that has been approved by the City Council on or before the effective date
hereof.
      (2)   Installation of fence, sign, telephone, and electric poles and
other kinds of posts or poles.
      (3)   Excavations or land moving activities involving less than 50 cubic
yards of soil.
      (4)   Emergency work to protect life, limb, or property.
   (C)   Waiver. The Engineering Department, may waive any of the requirements
of this chapter upon making a finding that compliance with the requirement will
involve an unnecessary hardship and the waiver of such requirement will not
adversely affect the water quality and natural resources of the city or
adversely impact environmentally sensitive land. The Engineering Department may
require as a condition of the waiver that the applicant dedicates easements or
construct certain facilities as it deems necessary.

City Council.
      (2)   All stormwater management plans must be submitted to the City
Engineer prior to the start of construction activity. At a minimum all
applicants shall meet the criteria set forth below and observe the standards
established in NPDES Construction Stormwater General Permit requirements.
      (3)   The city adopts the MPCA's Minnesota Stormwater Manual as its
stormwater runoff design standards.
      (4)   All stormwater management plans must address erosion and sediment
control requirements of this chapter.
      (5)   Stormwater management requirements for permanent facilities.
         (a)   An applicant shall install or construct, on or for the proposed
land disturbing or development activity, all stormwater management facilities
necessary to meet the criteria of the NPDES Construction Stormwater General
Permit. No private stormwater facilities will be approved by the city unless a
maintenance agreement and maintenance plan are provided that defines who will
conduct the maintenance, the type of maintenance and intervals of the
maintenance to be performed. In the alternative, or in partial fulfillment of
this requirement and upon approval of the Engineering Department, an applicant
may make an in-kind or monetary contribution to the development and maintenance
of regional stormwater management facilities designed to serve multiple land
disturbing and development activities undertaken by one or more persons,
including the applicant.
         (b)   Proposed stormwater management plans shall incorporate volume
control, water quality control, and rate control as the basis for stormwater
management in the proposed development plan on sites without restrictions. All
proposed projects shall be in conformance with the most current requirements of
the MPCA's Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (MS4) Permit and the Shingle
Creek and West Mississippi Watershed Management Commissions, as applicable.
            1.   Volume control.
               a.   New development projects less than one acre in size.
                  i.   The applicant shall provide a detailed plan and/or
narrative describing the BMPs that will be incorporated in the development to
reduce runoff volume and improve water quality.
                  ii.   There shall be no net increase from pre-project
conditions (on an annual average basis) of:
                     1)   Stormwater discharge volume, unless precluded by the
stormwater management limitations as defined by the MPCA's MS4 Permit.
                     2)   Stormwater discharges of total suspended solids
(TSS).
                     3)   Stormwater discharges of total phosphorus (TP).
               b.   New development. For new, nonlinear developments,
stormwater runoff volume abstraction via infiltration will be controlled and
the post-construction runoff volume shall be retained on site for 1.0 inches of
runoff from all impervious surfaces on the site that result in a net increase
of impervious of one acre or greater. If filtration of the water quality volume
is deemed necessary through alternative compliance sequencing, the required
stormwater runoff volume shall be multiplied by 1.82 (i.e. 55% filtration
credit) and the filtration BMP shall provide this storage volume below the
invert of the low overflow outlet of the BMP (perforated drain pipes for
filtration will not be considered the low overflow outlet).
               c.   Redevelopment. For redevelopment projects, stormwater
runoff volume abstraction via infiltration will be controlled and the post-
construction runoff volume shall be retained on site for 1.0 inches of runoff
from the new impervious surfaces created by the project. If filtration of the
water quality volume is deemed necessary through alternative compliance
sequencing, the required stormwater runoff volume shall be multiplied by 1.82
(i.e. 55% filtration credit) and the filtration BMP shall provide this storage
volume below the invert of the low overflow outlet of the BMP (perforated drain
pipes for filtration will not be considered the low overflow outlet). There
shall be a net reduction from pre-project conditions (on an annual average
basis) of:
                  i.   Stormwater discharge volume, unless precluded by the
stormwater management limitations as defined by the MPCA's MS4 permit.
                  ii.   Stormwater discharges of TSS.
                  iii.   Stormwater discharges of TP.
               d.   Linear projects. For linear projects, the water quality
volume must be calculated as the larger of one inch times the new impervious
surface or one-half inch times the sum of the new and the fully reconstructed
impervious surface. Where the entire water quality volume cannot be treated
within the existing right-of-way, a reasonable attempt to obtain additional
right-of-way, easement, or other permission to treat the stormwater during the
project planning process must be made. Volume reduction practices must be
considered first. Volume reduction practices are not required if the practices
cannot be provided cost effectively if additional right-of-way, easements, or
other permission cannot be obtained, owners of construction activity must
maximize the treatment of the water quality volume prior to discharge from the
MS4.
            2.   Water quality control. The water quality requirement is met if
the project meets the volume control requirement outlined in §
153.07(C)(5)(b)1.
               a.   Where infiltration is not advisable or infeasible due to
site conditions, biofiltration must be provided for that part of the
abstraction volume that is not abstracted by other BMPs. Where biofiltration is
infeasible, at a minimum filtration through a medium that incorporates organic
material, iron fillings, or other material to reduce soluble phosphorus must be
provided.
               b.   There shall be no net increase in total phosphorus (TP) or
total suspended solids (TSS) from pre-development land cover to post-
development land cover. Pre-development land cover is defined as the
predominant land cover over the previous ten years.
                  i.   Full abstraction of 1.1 inches of runoff from all
impervious surfaces will satisfy the water quality requirement.
                  ii.   If it is not feasible to achieve the full 1.1-inch
abstraction requirement, a combination of BMPs may be used to achieve the no-
net-increase requirement using a water quality calculation method as outlined
in the Minnesota Stormwater Manual.
                  iii.   If permanent sedimentation and water quality ponds are
used, they shall be designed to the standards set forth in the Minnesota
Stormwater Manual.
                  iv.   Runoff may be directed to a downstream facility within
the same hydrologic subwatershed that has sufficient capacity to provide the
required treatment. This means that no treatment may be required for an
individual development provided there is a regional facility designed and
constructed to accommodate the flow from this property
            3.   Rate control. Rate control measures are required on new
development and redevelopment projects to meet this chapter's design criteria,
the Minnesota Stormwater Manual and Shingle Creek and West Mississippi River
Watershed Management Commissions requirements.
         (c)   The applicant shall reduce the need for stormwater treatment
practices by incorporating the use of natural topography and land cover such as
wetlands, ponds, natural swales and depressions as they exist before
development to the degree that they can accommodate the additional flow of
water without compromising the integrity or quality of the wetland or pond.
         (d)   The following stormwater management practices shall be
investigated by the applicant in developing a stormwater management plan in the
following descending order of preference, and the results of that investigation
shall be provided to the city in written form as a part of the application:
            1.   Natural infiltration of precipitation on-site.
            2.   Flow attenuation by use of open vegetated swales and natural
depressions.
            3.   Green infrastructure by use of rain gardens, bioswales,
constructed wetlands, and other constructed infiltration practices.
            4.   Stormwater retention facilities.
            5.   Stormwater detention facilities.
         (e)   A combination of stormwater treatment practices may be used to
achieve the applicable minimum control requirements specified in the subsection
above. Justification shall be provided by the applicant for the method
selected.
         (f)   Pond design standards. Stormwater detention facilities
constructed in the city shall be designed according to standards established by
the Engineering Division of the Operations and Maintenance Department, and
shall contain, at a minimum, the following design factors:
            1.   A permanent pool ("dead storage") volume below the principal
spillway (normal outlet) which shall be greater than or equal to the runoff
from a 2.5-inch, 24-hour storm over the entire contributing drainage area
assuming full development.
            2.   A permanent pool average depth (basin volume/basin area) of
four to ten feet.
            3.   An emergency overflow (emergency outlet) adequate to control
the 100-year frequency critical duration rainfall event.
            4.   Basin side slopes below the 100-year high water level should
be no steeper than 4:1, and preferably flatter. A basin shelf with a minimum
width of ten feet and one foot deep below the normal water level is recommended
to enhance wildlife habitat, reduce potential safety hazards, and improve
access for long-term maintenance.
            5.   To prevent short-circuiting, the distance between major inlets
and the normal outlet shall be maximized.
            6.   A flood pool ("live storage") volume above the principal
outlet spillway shall be adequate so that the peak discharge rate from the 1-,
10- and 100-year frequency critical duration storm is not greater than the peak
discharge for a similar storm and predevelopment watershed conditions.
            7.   Effective energy dissipation devices which reduce outlet
velocities to four feet per second or less shall consist of riprap, stilling
pools or other such measures to prevent erosion at all storm water outfalls
into the basin and at the detention basin outlet.
            8.   Consideration for aesthetics and wildlife habitat should be
included in the design of the pond.
            9.   A skimming device must be provided to deter floatable
pollutants from discharging out of pond.
            10.   Pond NWL elevations shall be established above the OHW of
adjacent MnDNR water bodies, except where topography of the site, floodplain
mitigation activities, or other design considerations are determined to be
unfavorable for these conditions to occur. This determination shall be
performed by an engineer, provided by the applicant, and approved by the
Engineering Division of the Operations and Maintenance Department.
            11.   All constructed ponds shall have a maintenance access bench
sufficient to provide access to all inlets and outlets. The maintenance bench
shall be located within a designated outlot or within a permanent easement. The
maintenance bench shall extend from the outlet elevation to one foot above the
outlet elevation and its cross slope shall be no steeper than 10:1. The
maintenance bench shall connect to the maintenance access.
            12.   All constructed ponds shall be provided a maintenance access
from an adjacent roadway. The maintenance access shall be provided in the form
of an easement no narrower than 20 feet. The maintenance access shall have a
longitudinal slope no steeper than 6:1 and minimal cross slope. Maintenance
access routes, due to their extra width, also serve well as emergency overflow
(EOF) routes.
         (g)   Infiltration requirements. BMPs will be required to the maximum
extent practical as determined by the Engineering Division of the Operations
and Maintenance Department or its designee.
            1.   Maximum extent practical shall be the infiltration of runoff
from the 100-year, 24-hour rainfall event within 48 hours. The maximum extent
practical may be less than this if the Engineering Division of the Operations
and Maintenance Department determines that one or more of the following
conditions apply:
               (a)   Infiltration characteristics of soils on site are not
favorable for infiltration of stormwater.
               (b)   The site's drainage course is to regional infiltration or
detention facilities controlled by the city that reduce runoff volumes.
               (c)   When the site's impervious areas are not increased due to
development.
               (d)   Other site conditions that make infiltration of stormwater
impractical on the site as determined by the Engineering Division of the
Operations and Maintenance Department.
               (e)   If one or more of these conditions apply, the Engineering
Division of the Public Works Department shall quantify infiltration that will
be deemed as the maximum extent practical for the site.
            2.   Infiltration will be prohibited where the infiltration BMP
will be constructed in any of the following areas:
               a.   Where documented past, present, or anticipated future land
uses have resulted in or may result in contamination coming in contact with
stormwater runoff.
               b.   With less than three feet of separation distance from the
bottom of the infiltration system to the elevation of the seasonally saturated
soils or the top of bedrock.
               c.   Where vehicle fueling and maintenance occur.
               d.   Where industrial facilities are not authorized to
infiltrate industrial stormwater under and NPDES/SDS Industrial Stormwater
Permit issued by the MPCA.
            3.   Infiltration will be restricted and subject to additional city
review where the infiltration BMP will be constructed in any of the following
areas:
               a.   Within 1,000 feet up-gradient, or 100 feet down-gradient of
active karst features.
               b.   Where drinking water supply management areas are present,
as defined by Minn. Rules 4720.51000, subp.13, unless precluded by a local unit
of government with an MS4 permit.
               c.   Soils are predominately Hydrologic Soil Group D (clay)
soils.
               d.   Soil infiltration rates are more than 8.3 inches per hour
unless soils are amended to slow the infiltration rate below 8.3 inches per
hour.
            4.   Stormwater runoff shall be treated in a stormwater pond or by
other means prior to entering an infiltration facility.
            5.   The minimum infiltration requirements for any region of the
city will be the requirements of the Shingle Creek and West Mississippi River
Watershed Management Commissions' policies that govern that region. Shingle
Creek and West Mississippi River Watershed Management Commissions' standards
may be met through the use of regional or downstream systems prior to discharge
of runoff to waters of the state.
            6.   Infiltration systems must not be excavated to final grade
until the contributing drainage area has been constructed and fully stabilized.
When the infiltration feature is excavated to final grade, rigorous erosion
prevention and sediment control BMPs must be implemented to keep sediment and
runoff completely away from the infiltration area.
            7.   To prevent clogging of the infiltration system, a pretreatment
device must be used to settle particles before the stormwater discharges into
the infiltrations system.
            8.   Per the stormwater management requirements for permanent
facilities section of this chapter, the infiltration system must provide a
water quality volume (calculated as an instantaneous volume) of one inch of
runoff (or one inch minus the volume of stormwater treated by another system on
the site) from the new impervious surfaces created by the project.
            9.   The applicant must ensure filtration systems with less than
three feet of separation from seasonally saturated soils or from bedrock are
constructed with an impermeable liner.
            10.   A minimum maintenance access of 12 feet is required.
         (h)   Mitigation.
            1.   Where construction projects cannot meet the TSS and/or TP
reduction requirements for new or development projects on the site of original
construction, all methods must be exhausted prior to considering alternative
locations where TSS and TP treatment standards can be achieved. If the City has
determined that all methods have been exhausted, the permittee will be required
to identify alternative locations where TSS and TP treatment standards can be
achieved. Mitigation projects will be chosen in the following order of
preference:
               a.   Locations that yield benefits to the same receiving water
that receives runoff from the original construction activity.
               b.   Locations within the same MnDNR catchment area as the
original construction activity.
               c.   Locations in the next adjacent MnDNR catchment area up-
stream.
               d.   Locations anywhere within the City of Brooklyn Park.
            2.   In addition, mitigation projects must also meet the following
criteria:
               a.   Mitigation projects shall involve the establishment new
structural stormwater BMPs or the retrofit of existing structural stormwater
BMPs, or the use of a properly designed regional structural stormwater BMP.
               b.   Previously required routine maintenance of structural
stormwater BMPs cannot be considered mitigation.
               c.   Mitigation projects must be finished within 24 months after
the original construction activity begins.
               d.   A maintenance agreement specifying the responsible party
for long-term maintenance shall be identified.
         (i)   Stormwater and infiltration facilities must be located at least
50 feet away from the top of bluff.
         (j)   Watershed management plans/groundwater management plans.
Stormwater management plans shall be consistent with the Shingle Creek and West
Mississippi River Watershed Management Commissions requirements and groundwater
management plans prepared in accordance with Minnesota Board of Water and Soil
Resources in accordance with state law.
         (k)   Easement. If the stormwater management plan involves direction
of some or all runoff off of the site, it shall be the responsibility of the
applicant to obtain from adjacent property owners any necessary easements or
other property interests to permit the flow of water across the property.
         (l)   Low floor/building opening elevations.
            1.   Any new development or redevelopment shall maintain a minimum
building opening elevation of at least three feet above the anticipated 100-
year high water elevation as a standard practice. However, if the applicant
demonstrates that this requirement would be a hardship, the standard may be
reduced to two feet if all of the following can be demonstrated:
               a.   That, within the two-foot freeboard area, stormwater
storage is available which is equal to or exceeds 50% of the storm water
storage currently available in the basin below the 100-year elevation.
               b.   That a 25% obstruction of the basin outlet over a 24-hour
period would not result in more than one foot of additional bounce in the
basin.
               c.   That an adequate overflow route from the basin is available
that will provide one foot of freeboard for the proposed low building opening.
            2.   Basement floor elevations must be set to an elevation that
meets all of the following criteria:
               a.   The lowest floor elevation must be at least four feet above
the currently observed groundwater elevations in the area.
               b.   The lowest floor elevation must be at least two feet above
the elevation of any known historic high groundwater elevations for the area.
Information on historic high groundwater elevations can be derived from any
reasonable sources including piezometer data, soil boring data, percolation
testing logs, etc.
               c.   The lowest floor elevation must be at least two feet above
the 100-year high surface water elevation for the area unless it can be
demonstrated that this standard creates a hardship. If the two-foot standard is
determined by the City Council to constitute a hardship, the standard shall be
at least one foot above the highest anticipated groundwater elevation resulting
from a 100-year critical duration rainfall event. The impact of high surface
water elevations on groundwater elevations in the vicinity of the structure
should take into consideration the site's distance from the floodplain area,
the soils, the normal water elevation of surface depressions in the area, the
static groundwater table and historic water elevations in the area. This
information shall be provided by a registered engineer or soil scientist.
         (m)   Impervious surface coverage of each lot must not exceed the
impervious surface coverage allowed under the Zoning Ordinance.
         (n)   Storm sewers shall be designed to accommodate discharge rates
associated with a 10-year, 24-hour rainfall event.

specifications including, but not limited to:
            1.   Settling basins, sediment traps, or tanks.
            2.   Protection for adjacent properties by the use of a vegetated
buffer strip in combination with perimeter controls.
            3.   Perimeter control including machine sliced silt fence or other
city approved BMP, which shall be in place before, during and after grading of
the site. Fencing shall be removed only after final stabilization.
            4.   Designated as a temporary construction staging area.
         (f)   Temporary sediment basins. For sites that have more than ten
acres of disturbed soil that drains to a common location (or, five or more
acres for special or impaired waters), one or more temporary sediment basins
shall be constructed. Use of temporary basins is encouraged when construction
projects will impact steep slopes or when highly erodible soils are present.
The basin shall provide treatment to the runoff before it leaves the
construction site or enters surface waters. The temporary sediment basins must
be designed and constructed as follows:
            1.   Provide live storage for a calculated volume of runoff from a
two-year, 24-hour storm from each acre drained to the basin. All basins shall
provide at least 1,800 cubic feet of live storage from each acre drained or
more.
            2.   For basins where the calculation in §
153.08(B)(2)(f)1 has not been performed, a temporary sediment basin providing
3,600 cubic feet of live storage from each acre drained to the basin shall be
provided for the entire drainage area of the temporary basin.
            3.   The outlet structure must be designed to withdraw water from
the surface in order to minimize the discharge of pollutants.
            4.   The basin outlet shall be designed to prevent short-circuiting
and the discharge of floating debris.
            5.   Ensure the basin can be completely drawn down to conduct
maintenance activities.
            6.   Include energy dissipation on the outlet of the basin and a
stabilized emergency overflow to prevent failure of pond integrity.
            7.   Be located outside of surface waters or any buffer zone, and
be designed to avoid draining water from wetlands unless appropriate approval
from the USACE and the MnDNR is obtained.
            8.   If installation of a temporary sediment basin is infeasible
equivalent sediment controls such as smaller sediment basins, and/or sediment
traps, silt fences, vegetative buffer strips, or any appropriate combination of
measures are required for all down-slope boundaries of the construction area
and for side-slope boundaries where appropriate. Determination of infeasibility
shall be documented in the erosion and sediment control plan.
         (g)   Individual construction site sediment controls. Individual
construction site sediment controls shall include:
            1.   Rock construction entrance (driveway).
            2.   Perimeter controls including silt fence in-place before,
during and after grading of the site. Fencing shall be removed only after
proper turf establishment.
         (h)   Waterway and watercourse protection. Waterway and watercourse
protection requirements shall include stabilization of the watercourse channel
before, during and after any in-channel work consistent with the city's general
specifications.
            1.   A temporary stream crossing must be installed and approved by
the local government unit and regulating agency if a wet watercourse will be
crossed regularly during construction.
            2.   The watercourse channel shall be stabilized before, during,
and within 24 hours after any in-channel work.
            3.   No in-water work shall be allowed in public waters during the
MnDNR's work exclusion dates.

equipment must be free of aquatic invasive species.
            5.   All on-site stormwater conveyance channels designed according
to the criteria outlined in this document. Stabilization adequate to prevent
erosion located at the outlets of all pipes and paved channels is required.
         (i)   Site dewatering. Site dewatering shall be conducted pursuant to
the NPDES Construction Stormwater General Permit. Water pumped from the site
shall be treated by temporary sediment basins, grit chambers, sand filters, or
other controls as appropriate to ensure adequate treatment is obtained and that
nuisance conditions will not result from the discharge. Discharges from the
site shall not be released in a manner that causes erosion, scour,
sedimentation or flooding of the site to receiving channels or wetlands.
         (j)   Waste and material disposal. All waste and unused building
materials (including garbage, debris, cleaning wastes, wastewater, toxic
materials or hazardous materials) shall be properly disposed of off-site and
not allowed to be carried by runoff into a receiving channel or storm sewer
system.
            1.   Solid waste. All unused building materials and waste
(including, but not limited to: collected sediment, asphalt and concrete
millings, floating debris, paper, plastic, fabric, etc.) must be disposed of
accordingly and shall comply with disposal requirements set forth by the MPCA.
            2.   Hazardous/toxic waste. Paint, gasoline, oil and any hazardous
materials must be properly stored, including secondary containment, to prevent
spills, leaks or other discharges. Access to the storage areas must be
restricted to prevent vandalism. Storage and disposal of hazardous or toxic
substance must be in compliance with the requirements set forth by the MPCA.
            3.   Liquid waste. All other non-stormwater discharges (including,
but not limited to, concrete truck washout, vehicle washing or maintenance
spills) produced during the construction activity shall not be discharged to
any surface waters.
            4.   External washing of equipment and vehicles. All external
washing activities shall be limited to a designated area of the site. All
runoff must be contained and wastes from external washing activities must be
disposed of properly. No engine degreasing shall be allowed on the site.
            5.   Wastes generated by concrete and other washout operations. All
liquid and solid wastes generated by any concrete or other washout operations
must be contained in a leak proof facility or impermeable liner. Concrete waste
must not come into contact with the ground. Concrete waste must be disposed of
properly and in compliance with applicable MPCA regulations.
         (k)   Drain inlet protection. All storm drain inlets shall be
protected during construction until all sources with potential for discharging
to the inlet have been stabilized. Inlet protection measures must meet the
city's standards and specifications.
         (l)   Energy dissipation. Pipe outlets must have temporary or
permanent energy dissipation within 24 hours of connection to a surface water.
         (m)   Tracking. Vehicle tracking BMPs (including, but not limited to:
rock pads, mud mats, slash mulch, concrete or steel wash racks, or similar
systems) must be installed to minimize track out of sediment from the
construction site. If vehicle tracking BMPs are not actively preventing
sediment from being tracked into the street, the applicant must utilize street
sweeping to contain sediment.
         (n)   Final stabilization. Final stabilization is not complete until
the following criteria are met:
            1.   All land disturbing activities must be finished and all soils
shall be stabilized by a uniform perennial vegetative cover with a density of
70% or greater of its expected final growth density over the entire pervious
surface area, or other equivalent means necessary to prevent soil failure under
erosive conditions.
            2.   The permanent stormwater management system is constructed,
meets all of the required design parameters and is operating as designed.
            3.   All temporary synthetic and structural erosion prevention and
sediment control BMPs (such as silt fence) have been removed. BMPs designed to
decompose on site may be left in place.
            4.   For residential construction only, individual lots are
considered finally stabilized if the structure(s) are finished and temporary
erosion protection and down gradient perimeter control has been completed and
the residence has been sold to the homeowner.
            5.   For construction projects on agricultural land the disturbed
land has been returned to its preconstruction agricultural use.
      (3)   The permittee must maintain the erosion and sediment control
measures on the site to the satisfaction of the City Engineer throughout the
entire construction process. If erosion and sediment control is not being
maintained to the City Engineer's satisfaction, the city may perform remedial
work on the site as outlined in this section.
      (4)   All erosion control systems must be maintained by the permittee in
an acceptable condition until turf is established or structural surfaces are
constructed to protect the soil from erosion.
   (C)   Inspection of erosion control plan. The city will make periodic
inspections of the site to ensure compliance with the erosion control plan. The
permittee or his/her agent shall ensure that a trained person will regularly
inspect the construction site at least once every seven days until final
stabilization and within 24 hours of a rainfall event of one-half inch or
greater in a 24-hour period. All inspection and maintenance activities
conducted on the site during construction must be recorded in writing and
retained within the erosion control plan. Records of each inspection and
maintenance activity shall include the following:
      (1)   Date and time of inspection.
      (2)   Name of person(s) conducting the inspection.
      (3)   Findings of inspections, including recommendations for corrective
actions.
      (4)   Corrective actions taken, including the dates, times and the name
of the party completing the corrective action.
      (5)   Date and the amount of rainfall events that are greater than one-
half inch in a 24- hour period.
      (6)   Documentation of any changes made to the erosion and sediment
control plan.
   (D)   Site and BMP maintenance. Prior to any construction, the developer
shall provide the City Engineer with a schedule for erosion and sediment
control inspection and maintenance, including schedules for street cleaning,
and street sweeping. All site and BMP maintenance activities must comply with
the requirements of the NPDES Construction Stormwater General Permit. The
applicant shall investigate and comply with the following BMP maintenance
requirements:
      (1)   Perimeter control. All perimeter controls must be repaired,
replaced or supplemented when they become nonfunctional or the sediment reaches
one-half of the height of the fence. Repairs shall be made by the end of the
next business day after discovery or as soon as field conditions allow access.
      (2)   Temporary sediment basins. Temporary sedimentation basins must be
drained and the sediment must be removed when the depth of the sediment
collected in the basin reaches one half the storage volume. Drainage and
removal must be completed within 72 hours of discovery or as soon as field
conditions allow access.
      (3)   Surface waters and conveyance systems. Surface water, including
drainage ditches and conveyance systems, must be inspected for visible signs of
sediment being deposited by erosion. The applicant must remove all sediment
deposited in surface waters, including drainage ways, catch basins, and other
drainage systems and must restabilize the areas of exposed soil as a result of
sediment removal. The removal and stabilization must take place within seven
days of discovery unless legal, regulatory or physical access constraints
prevent remediation. In the event of an access constraint, the applicant shall
use all reasonable efforts to obtain access. If access is precluded, removal
and stabilization must take place within seven calendar days of obtaining
access. The applicant is responsible for contacting all local, regional, state
and federal authorities and obtaining any required permits prior to conducting
any work.
      (4)   Streets and impervious surfaces. Where vehicle traffic leaves any
part of the site, the exit locations must be inspected for visible signs of
off-site sediment tracking onto impervious surfaces. Tracked sediment must be
removed from all off-site impervious surfaces as soon as possible or within 24
hours of discovery.
      (5)   General maintenance. The applicant shall be responsible for the
operation and maintenance of temporary and permanent water quality management
BMPs, as well as erosion prevention and sediment control BMPs for the duration
of the construction work on the site. The applicant remains responsible until
another party has assumed control over all areas of the site that have not
established final stabilization and a notice of termination (NOT) has been
submitted to the MPCA.
      (6)   Infiltration areas. All infiltration areas must be inspected to
ensure that no sediment from ongoing construction activities is reaching the
infiltration area and these areas are protected from compaction caused by
construction equipment driving across the infiltration area.
   (E)   Notification of failure of erosion control plan. The city shall notify
the permittee of the failure of the erosion control measures that have been
constructed. The notification will be by phone or written correspondence to the
parties listed on the information sheet required by this section. The city, at
its discretion, may begin remedial work within 48 hours after notification has
been provided.
   (F)   Erosion off-site. If erosion breaches the perimeter of the site, the
permittee shall immediately develop a cleanup and restoration plan, obtain a
right-of-entry from the adjoining property owner, and implement the cleanup and
restoration plan within 48 hours of obtaining the adjoining property owner's
permission. In no case, unless written approval is received from the
Engineering Division of the Operations and Maintenance Department, may more
than seven calendar days pass without any corrective action being taken. If at
the discretion of the city, the permittee does not repair the damage caused by
the erosion, the city may perform the remedial work required, after notice is
provided to the permittee.
   (G)   Erosion into streets, wetlands, or other surface waters. If eroded
soils enter, or entrance appears imminent into streets, wetlands, or other
surface waters, cleanup and repair shall be immediate. The permittee shall
provide all traffic control and flagging required to protect the public during
the cleanup operations. If at the discretion of the city, the permittee does
not repair the erosion and sedimentation, the city may perform the remedial
work required, after notice is provided to the permittee.
   (H)   Failure to complete corrective work. When a permittee fails to conform
to any provision of this section within the time stipulated, the city may take
the following actions:
      (1)   Issue a notice of violation. When the city determines that an
activity is not being carried out in accordance with the requirements of this
chapter, it shall issue a written notice of violation to the owner of the
property. The notice of violation shall contain:
         (a)   The name and address of the owner or applicant.
         (b)   The address when available or a description of the land upon
which the violation is occurring.
         (c)   A statement specifying the nature of the violation.
         (d)   A description of the remedial measures necessary to bring the
development activity into compliance with this chapter and a time schedule for
the completion of such remedial action.
         (e)   A statement of the penalty or penalties that shall or may be
assessed against the person to whom the notice of violation is directed.
         (f)   A statement that the determination of violation may be appealed
to the city by filing a written notice of appeal within 15 days of services of
the notice of violation. Service may be accomplished by mail or by personal
delivery of the notice.
      (2)   Withhold the scheduling of inspections.
      (3)   Withhold the issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
      (4)   Issue a stop work order.
      (5)   Direct the correction of the deficiency by city forces or separate
contract. The issuance of an erosion control permit constitutes a right-of-
entry for the city or its contractor to enter upon the construction site for
the purpose of correcting deficiencies with respect to erosion and sediment
control. All costs incurred by the city in correcting erosion and sediment
control deficiencies, including administrative expenses, shall be reimbursed by
the permittee. If payment is not made within 30 days after an invoice is
issued, the city may draw from the financial security. If the financial
security is of an insufficient amount, the city may assess the remaining amount
against the property. As a condition of the permit, the owner shall waive
notice of any assessment hearing to be conducted by the city, concur that the
benefit to the property exceeds the amount of the proposed assessment, and
waive all rights by virtue of M.S. § 429.081 to challenge the amount or
validity of assessment.
(Ord. 2017-1217, passed 7-10-17; Am. Ord. 2024-1304, passed 7-29-24)

   •   or 50¢ for a two-sided copy
The charge for most other types of copies, when a charge is not set by statute or
rule, is the actual cost of searching for and retrieving the data, and making the
copies or electronically transmitting the data (ie., send the data by email).
•   In determining the actual costs of making copies, we factor in employee time,
the cost of the materials onto which we are copying the data (paper, CD, DVD, etc.)
and mailing costs (if any).
•   The cost of employee time to search the data, retrieve data, and make copies is
$22.39* per hour.
•   If, based on your request, we find it necessary for a higher-paid employee to
search for and retrieve the data, we will calculate search and retrieval charges at
the higher salary/wage.
* Note: Fees not to exceed labor costs (wages/salary plus benefits) of the lowest-
paid employee who could complete the task.
