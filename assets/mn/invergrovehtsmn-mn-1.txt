AN ORDINANCE ADOPTING THE RECODIFICATION OF THE INVER GROVE HEIGHTS CITY CODE
INCLUDING THE CITY ZONING ORDINANCE
The city council of Inver Grove Heights does hereby ordain:
Section 1.    Authority.
1.1    Minnesota statutes, sections 415.02, 415.021, and 599.13 authorize the
city to codify its ordinances and print them in various formats, including
book, loose leaf or pamphlet form, and provide that any ordinance included in a
new code but not previously published is sufficiently published if a
substantial quantity of the code is printed for distribution to the general
public.
1.2    The city has completed a recodification the ("recodification"), of the
1974 Code of city ordinances ("city code"), which was prepared by Sterling
Codifiers with assistance from city staff, and which incorporates ordinances
through ordinance no. 1176.
1.3    The city council has reviewed the proposed recodification in a
publication entitled "2008 Inver Grove Heights City Code." The recodification
is on file with the deputy city clerk.
1.4    Minnesota statutes sections 331A.01, subdivision 10, and 412.191,
subdivision 4 allow publication by title and summary in the event of lengthy
ordinances or those containing charts or maps. The city council finds that the
summary of the recodification would clearly inform the public of the intent and
effect of the recodification; that the recodification is lengthy, comprising
two volumes and exceeding 200 pages in length; and summary publication is
appropriate.

meetings. If the proposed ordinance is passed by a majority of the council at

additional amendments, as may be accepted by the council in either or both of
said meetings, then the ordinance shall become effective in the form as finally
passed as provided herein. Ordinances which do not receive final approval
within twelve-months of the date the first reading is approved will be deemed
to have been postponed indefinitely. Further consideration of any such
ordinance will require restarting the three-reading process.

action appropriate with reference to fire, civil disorder, riot, flood,
tornado, and other disasters or other acts of nature, then any ordinance
dealing with such declared emergency situation may be passed at that meeting
and shall be effective at a time and date set forth in said ordinance. An
ordinance passed under this emergency rule shall automatically be suspended and
be of no further effect following the tenth day after the ordinance has been
passed unless another termination date is specified within the ordinance. (1974

employees, except those mandated by federal or state law. (Ord. 888, 3-11-1997)
1-6A-11-4: HOURLY RATES:
Hourly wage rates shall be established for nonexempt positions. Such hourly
rate shall be determined by multiplying the monthly rate by twelve (12), and

1-6A-11-5: PAY RATES IN TRANSFER, PROMOTION OR DEMOTION:
If an employee is transferred, promoted or demoted, his rate of pay for the new
class shall be determined as follows:

former class is less than the minimum rate established for the class of the new
position, the rate shall be advanced to the next rate of the class to which
transferred or promoted.
   B.    In the case of a transfer or demotion, if the rate of pay in the
former class is more than the maximum rate established for the class of the new
position, the rate of pay shall be reduced to the maximum rate of the position
classification to which transferred or demoted.

      1.    It shall be the normal practice to pay for overtime. However, at
the request of an employee, the supervisor or department head may approve
compensatory time in lieu of overtime payment. Compensatory time is available
for all nonexempt employees. Compensatory time, however, will not be allowed to
accrue to such an extent that, in the judgment of the administrator, such
accrual could compromise the service responsibilities of the city. Compensatory
time shall be determined at the rate of one and one-half (11/2) hours off for
every hour of overtime worked in accordance with the fair labor standards act.
      2.    An employee may accrue up to forty (40) hours of compensatory time,
which represents not more than 26.67 hours of actual overtime worked. The
accrued compensatory time must be taken within ninety (90) days of
accumulation. This request must be made prior to the time requested and have
approval from the department supervisor and department head. Compensatory time
must be utilized in the same calendar year accrued and may not transfer from
one year to another. At year's end, the completion of the ninety (90) days, or
upon resignation, accrued compensatory time will be paid in a lump sum. Upon an
employee's death, the spouse, designated beneficiary or estate shall be paid
the benefit.
      3.    "Overtime" is defined as all work in excess of the regular
established workweek. Overtime worked on a designated holiday shall be
compensated at a rate of one and one-half (11/2) times the employee's hourly
wage rate for each hour worked on the holiday in addition to the holiday pay.
(Ord. 1128, 3-13-2006)
   C.    Compensatory Time Accrual Waiver: The maximum amount of compensatory
time (40 hours) that can be accrued by individual employees may be waived by
the city administrator. The waiver may be a result of, but not limited to,
department reorganization, position vacancies, excessive workloads and
procedural or system changes. Waivers must include a date of termination of the
waiver. Accrued compensatory time from such a waiver must be used by the
calendar year end or forfeited unless excepted by the city administrator.
   D.    Calculation: Overtime shall be calculated based on actual hours worked
to the nearest fifteen (15) minute interval. Personal, vacation or holiday
leave, failure of the employer to provide sufficient work, or other similar
cause is considered part of the employee's regular rate of pay and shall be
counted as "time worked" for the purpose of calculating overtime pay. (Ord.
888, 3-11-1997)
1-6A-11-7: PART TIME EMPLOYEE DETERMINATION OF BENEFITS:
Section
1-6A-2 of this article defines part time employees. Determination of benefits
shall be concluded on a pro rata basis, i.e., hours of work as related to
benefit schedules for full time employment. Pro rata holidays shall be
determined by calculating the hours worked for a period not to exceed three (3)
months before the holiday. Pro rata for all other benefits shall be determined

master insurance policy.
   B.    The employee benefits enumerated in this section are offered at the
city's sole discretion to eligible employees. The enumeration of these benefits
should not be construed as a claim of entitlement to the benefits described, as
the benefits set forth may be changed from time to time. The city reserves the
right to change, delete, modify, or otherwise revise employee benefits and
eligibility requirements regarding benefits at any time and, in its sole
discretion, with or without notice to employees unless otherwise prohibited by
law.
   C.    The insurance benefits provided are specified in materials provided by
the respective insurance carriers. The respective insurance carriers may have
different requirements concerning the eligibility of employees. The
requirements of the carrier will govern eligibility. The city reserves the
right to change insurance carriers and programs at any time. Any such change
may affect eligibility requirements and/or benefit limits under any given
policy. (Ord. 888, 3-11-1997)

written resignation stating the effective date of the resignation and the
reason for leaving. The employee may, at the discretion of the city
administrator, be required to participate in an exit interview regarding the
reason(s) for resigning. Failure to comply with the above stated procedures may
be considered cause for denying such employee future employment by the city and
denying terminal leave benefits. Unauthorized absence from work for a period of
three (3) working days may be considered as a resignation without benefits.

receive written concurrence of the aggrieved party and the department head; and
2) specify the length of extension.
   D.    Third Step:
      1.    If the employee is not satisfied with the results of the second
step, the employee shall, within five (5) days of receipt of the recommended
solution, put the grievance in writing and submit it to the city administrator.
The administrator shall fully investigate the problem and the facts involved
and discuss the matter with the parties concerned.
      2.    After a full investigation, the administrator shall advise the
parties concerned of the administrator's decision in writing. The decision of
the administrator shall be considered final and shall be rendered within five
(5) days of receipt of a written grievance. An extension must: a) receive
written concurrence of the aggrieved party and the city administrator; and b)
specify the length of extension.
      3.    The city administrator is the final authority within the city's
organization that a grievance may be appealed to. A grievance may not be
appealed to the city council.
   E.    Limitations: Any employee under the auspices of a collective
bargaining agreement who grieves disciplinary action through the provisions of
a bargaining agreement may not access the grievance policies of the personnel
policy. Pursuant to section 1-6A-7 of this article, employees in the
orientation period are precluded from the grievance process or procedure. (Ord.
888, 3-11-1997)
1-6A-20: LAYOFFS:
   A.    The city council, upon the recommendation of the city administrator,
may lay off any employee whenever such action is made necessary by reason of
shortage of work or funds, the abolition of a position or because of changes in
organization. Provided, however, that two (2) weeks' advance written notice
shall be given. No full time employee shall be laid off while there are
temporary or part time employees serving in the same class of positions for
which a full time employee is qualified, eligible and available. A full time
employee will be given absolute preference over an employee in the orientation
period. All other things being equal, consideration will be given to the
employee's length of service in determining the order of layoffs. (Ord. 888, 3-
11-1997; amd. 2008 Code)
   B.    The city council, upon the recommendation of the city administrator,
may make any changes necessary to the operating hours of the city hall and the
work schedule of city employees to increase the efficiency or accessibility of
city services to city residents. (Ord. 888, 3-11-1997)
1-6A-21: OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT:
   A.    Policy: It is the policy of the city to place certain limitations on
the types of outside employment in which an employee may engage.
   B.    Limitations:
      1.    Outside employment shall be regarded as secondary to regular city
employment.
      2.    Outside employment shall not interfere with the availability of
employees for emergency or call-in work.
      3.    Employees shall not engage in any outside occupation, employment or
business which could hinder the impartial, objective or efficient performance
of their duties, as determined by the city administrator.
      4.    Employees shall not engage in noncity employment which could create
a conflict of interest with their city employment, as determined by the city
administrator.
      5.    No employee shall be instructed or allowed to perform work for pay
for private individuals or other governmental agencies which would be required
or expected to be performed in the regular course of the employee's city
employment, as determined by the city administrator.
      6.    No city equipment shall be utilized for outside employment, unless
authorized by the department head. (Ord. 888, 3-11-1997)
1-6A-22: DISCIPLINE:
   A.   Administration: City employees shall be subject to disciplinary action
for cause. The City reserves the right to administer disciplinary action in any
manner it deems appropriate. The City may take a progressive approach to the
discipline of an employee. This discipline will be based upon a determination
of the severity of the act(s) or action(s) involved.
   B.   Authority: A department head or the City Administrator may exercise the
option to rescind the following employee personnel actions initiated by a
supervisor: transfer, suspension, reward, grievance adjustment, and any
disciplinary action including discharge, promotion, or appointment.
   C.   Verbal Reprimand: A "verbal reprimand" is a discussion with an employee
about a relatively minor offense. Verbal reprimands shall be documented
including the date and content of the discussion and the parties present. A
written report documenting the discussion shall be maintained in the employee's
personnel file.
   D.   Written Reprimand: A "written reprimand" is a formal written statement
to an employee which describes the offense, and may refer to previous verbal
reprimands, states the deficiency or misconduct, describes the past actions
taken by the supervisor to correct the problem, states the desired goals or
outcomes of this action and outlines subsequent disciplinary action should the
problem continue. In the case of a written reprimand, the employee shall be
required to acknowledge notice of said reprimand by signing the reprimand. By
signing, the employee is not necessarily agreeing with the charge(s), but is
acknowledging that notice of such reprimand was issued to and received by the
employee. The signed reprimand shall be placed in the employee's personnel
file. A reprimand may be administered by the employee's immediate supervisor or
any supervisor above the immediate supervisor.
   E.   Suspension Without Pay: The action of "suspension without pay" is an
involuntary, temporary absence from duty. Prior to the suspension, or as soon
after the action as is possible, the employee shall receive a written notice of
suspension, indicating the reasons for the suspension, length of suspension and
an outline of further disciplinary actions should the problem(s) continue. A
department head or supervisor, who has been the employees supervisor for at
least the thirty (30) days prior to the action with approval from the
department head, may suspend an employee without pay whenever the cause for
discipline is not sufficiently grave enough for discharge. Such suspension
shall not exceed thirty (30) working days within one calendar year. In the
event a supervisor suspends an employee, the department head shall be notified
in writing and approve of this action and the reasons therefor. Such suspension
shall not exceed thirty (30) working days without the approval of the City
Administrator. All material relating to a suspension action shall remain in the
employee's personnel file permanently. The employee shall acknowledge receipt
of the notice and reasons for a suspension by their signature. This does not
mean that the employee agrees with the reasons for the suspension or the action
taken.
If suspended, the following applies if the suspension exceeds thirty (30) days:
      1.   The employee will not accrue salary, vacation or personal leave, nor
is the employee entitled to use such time while on suspension.
      2.   If the duration of suspension exceeds thirty (30) days and the
employee is not being provided with benefits during that time period, the
employee must make direct payments to the City to maintain their health
insurance.
   F.   Forced Transfer: A forced transfer occurs when an employee is
transferred from a position in a department to a position of equal level in a
different department to eliminate a specific conflict within a department. This
action requires the recommendation of the department head and approval of the
City Administrator. A written notice of a forced transfer shall be permanently
included in the employee's personnel file.
   G.   Demotion: A demotion may occur when an employee fails to meet the
standards for performance expected at a higher classification. When the
employee's performance is such that dismissal is unwarranted, yet other forms
of disciplinary action, i.e., reprimand, forced transfer, or suspension without
pay will not solve the problem, a demotion must be recommended by the City
Administrator and be confirmed by the City Council. A written notice of
demotion shall be permanently included in the employee's personnel file.
   H.   Dismissal: This is the act of the complete separation of the employee
from employment with the City.
      1.   General Provisions: Any officer or employee subject to the
provisions of the Personnel Policy may be dismissed from the municipal service.
Dismissed employees need not be kept in employment or be paid for any time
after the completion of the normal working day they are dismissed, unless the
employee claims veterans' rights.
      2.   Dismissal Of Veteran: Veterans shall be treated as defined in
Minnesota Statutes Section 197.46, Veterans Preference Act; Removal Forbidden;
Right Of Mandamus.
      3.   Dismissal Of Employee While In The Orientation Period: An employee
in the orientation period may be dismissed without cause. The City
Administrator, upon the recommendation of the department head, may concur with
or overturn the recommendation of the department head to dismiss an employee.
In the event the City Administrator recommends dismissal, the City Council then
may reverse or ratify the dismissal recommendation. An employee in their
orientation period shall not receive a hearing before the City Council.
Employees in the orientation period do not have any grievance rights.
      4.   Procedure:
         a.   When a department determines such action is necessary,
appropriate, and in the best interest of the City, the department head shall
recommend to the City Administrator that an employee be dismissed. The
recommendation shall contain the reasons why it is necessary to take the
recommended action rather than alternative personnel action(s).
         b.   The City Administrator will review the recommendation from the
department head. If the City Administrator concurs with the dismissal
recommendation, the employee shall be notified of the recommended dismissal.
The notification shall be in writing and contain the reasons and the effective
date.
         c.   The City Administrator shall prepare a summary of the recommended
dismissal for the City Council's consideration. The employee shall be informed
of the right to be present for a hearing before the City Council. This does not
apply to any employee while still in the orientation period. The City Council
may reverse or ratify the dismissal recommendation or may impose another form
of discipline.
   I.   Cause: Adequate cause for disciplinary action that may result in
dismissal may include, but is not limited to, the following kinds of conduct or
anything of a similar type:
      1.   Conduct or performance on the job which fails to adequately satisfy
the duties and responsibilities of the position or classification held by the
employee.
      2.   Conduct or performance on the job which fails to produce the quality
or quantity of work the position or classification requires.
      3.   Conduct or performance on the job which is insubordinate, such as a

orientation.
      11.   The use of offensive conduct or language towards the public,
municipal officers or employees.
      12.   Carelessness, negligence or inappropriate use in the handling or

to commit an unlawful act or to act in violation of any lawful and reasonable

gift or thing is given in the hope of expectation of receiving a favor or
better treatment than accorded other persons.
      16.   Proven dishonesty in the performance of the employee's duties.
      17.   Conviction of a felony. In the event an employee is charged with a
felony, the employee shall be suspended pending a valid disposition of the
charge. If an employee is charged with the commission of a misdemeanor or gross
misdemeanor offense, the employee may be suspended pending a valid disposition
of the charge. The determination of the salary and benefit status of an
employee during the suspension shall be based upon the circumstances resulting
in the charge and shall be in accordance with applicable veterans' preference
statutes, labor agreements and the City's personnel policy. If final resolution
of the charge does not result in a conviction, the department head shall
determine whether the conduct of the employee involved moral turpitude or
otherwise causes doubt on the ability of the employee to perform the job.
      18.   Violation of the provisions of this Code, local, state or federal
laws as they relate to the position of public employment held, or other
performance or behavior/conduct the City deems inappropriate for employees of
the City.
   J.   Limitations: Any employee under the auspices of a collective bargaining
agreement who grieves a disciplinary action through the provisions of a
bargaining agreement may not access the grievance policies of the personnel
policy.
   K.   Documentation Of Disciplinary Actions; Employee Signature Required:
Written reprimands, notice of suspension, demotion, forced transfers and
notices of dismissal that are to become part of the employee's personnel file
shall be read and acknowledged by the signature of the employee. Employees will
receive a copy of such reprimands and/or notices.
   L.   Notification: The Human Resources Manager, their designee or any future
replacement position in charge of human resources for the City will be notified
by the Supervisor, Department Head or the City Administrator whenever any
discipline will be given to an employee so that they are aware of such action
and can be prepared for any subsequent action from the employee or their
respective union, if a union position (i.e. appeal, grievance, legal challenge,
etc.). (Ord. 888, 3-11-1997; Ord. 1125, 12-12-2005; amd. Ord. 1383, 7-27-2020)

appointed or elected officials of the city. The city will not tolerate
retaliation or intimidation directed toward anyone who makes a complaint under

transactions involving pawnbrokers and precious metal dealers. The City Council
further finds that the pawnbroker and precious metal industries have outgrown
the City's current ability to effectively or efficiently identify potential
criminal activity related to pawnshops and precious metal dealers. The purpose
of this chapter is to prevent pawnbroker and precious metal businesses from
being used as facilities for the disposition of illegally obtained property, to
aid in the identification of individuals involved in criminal activities
through the timely collection and sharing of transaction information, and to
ensure that such businesses comply with basic consumer protection standards,
thereby protecting the public health, safety, and general welfare of the
citizens of the City.
To help the City better regulate current and future pawnbroker and precious
metal businesses, and stabilize costs associated with the regulation of the
pawnbroker and precious metal industries, and increase identification of
criminal activities in the pawnbroker and precious metal industries through the
timely collection and sharing of pawnbroker and precious metal transaction
information, this chapter also implements and establishes the required use of
the automated pawn system. (Ord. 1355, 7-9-2018)

RECORDS SYSTEM:

all required records, including printed copies of all reportable transactions
along with the required photographs or videotape for that day, must be
maintained at the licensed premises and be made immediately available for
inspection upon request by a police officer. If the electronic transmission
failure is determined to be in the licensee's system, the licensee must take
all reasonable steps including the replacement of its computer system and
related components in order to return the electronic reporting system to
working condition as soon as possible. If the nonfunctioning system or repair
will require more than ten (10) days to return the system to a working
condition, the licensee must notify the Inver Grove Heights Police Department.
Failure by the licensee to correct a problem with its computer or other systems
causing the licensee's inability to electronically transmit required
transaction data to the authorized electronic pawn records system or failing to
notify the Inver Grove Heights Police Department of the malfunction within ten
(10) days is a violation of this section. Regardless of the origin of the

4-7-9: PRIORITY IN APPROVAL PROCESS:
It is anticipated that there may be multiple organizations applying for an
available premises permit at a single on-sale liquor establishment. Therefore,
if the on-sale liquor establishment refuses to pick one of the applicants but
indicates that the multiple applicants are equally acceptable, the following
criteria, in the order listed, prioritize and determine the approval for the
available premises permit:
   A.    If there are two (2) or more applications and if the on-sale liquor
establishment refuses to pick one of the applicants but indicates that the
multiple applicants are equally acceptable, then a local organization will be
preferred over an organization that does not meet the definition of local
organization. Because of the nuisance prone nature of gambling, compared to
other licensing or permitting activities within the City, the City prefers that
the organization have a local connection so as to facilitate investigation of
applicants and the investigation and arrest of violators. Where two (2) or more
organizations seek to obtain an available premises permit at the same on-sale
liquor establishment and where the on-sale liquor establishment refuses to pick
one of the applicants but indicates that the multiple applicants are equally
acceptable, the organization that meets the definition of local organization
will be preferred over an organization that does not meet the definition.
   B.    If two (2) or more nonlocal organizations seek approval, the Council
will approve the organization which applied first. (Ord. 1360, 12-10-2018)
4-7-10: INSPECTIONS:
   A.    All licensed organizations are deemed to have consented to inspection

reasonable time without notice or search warrant, all records, including

information submitted on the application. (Ord. 1360, 12-10-2018)
4-7-13: DESIGNATED TRADE AREA:
   A.    During the calendar year, each licensed organization within the City

CHAPTER 8
MASSAGE THERAPY
SECTION:
4-8-1 Massage Therapy Regulations
4-8-1: MASSAGE THERAPY REGULATIONS:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this chapter is to prohibit the operation of
massage businesses and the offering of massage services to the public except by
those licensed as therapeutic massage businesses and massage therapists
pursuant to this section. The licensing regulations prescribed herein are
necessary in order to protect businesses that are operating legitimate
businesses, to prevent criminal activity and to protect the health and welfare
of the community. The purpose of this section is not to impose restrictions or
limitations on the freedom of protected speech or expression.
   B.   Findings Of The City Council: The city council makes the following
findings regarding the need to license therapeutic massage businesses and
massage therapists and to prohibit all other types of massage businesses and
services to the public:
      1.   Persons who have bona fide and standardized training in therapeutic
massage, health, and hygiene can provide a legitimate and necessary service to
the general public.
      2.   Health and sanitation regulations governing therapeutic massage
businesses and therapists can minimize the risk of the spread of communicable
diseases and can promote overall health and sanitation.
      3.   Establishing license qualifications for therapeutic massage
businesses and therapists can minimize the risk that such businesses and
persons will facilitate prostitution and other criminal activity in the
community.
      4.   Massage businesses which employ persons with no specialized and
standardized training can tax law enforcement services because such businesses
are more likely to be operated as fronts for prostitution and other criminal
activity than operations established by persons with standardized training.
      5.   The training of professional massage therapists at accredited
institutions is an important means of ensuring the fullest measure of
protecting the public health, safety, and welfare.

employees and others in regard to the sale of licensed products on the licensed
premises and the sale of such an item by an employee or other person on the
licensed premises shall be considered a sale by the license holder. Nothing in
this chapter shall be construed as prohibiting the city from also subjecting

   A.   License Violations: Any violation of the terms of a license or the
provisions of this Chapter shall be cause for an administrative financial
penalty and/or suspension or revocation of the license. The following minimum
penalties are deemed appropriate for a licensee’s failure to comply with an
applicable statute, rule, ordinance, or term of the license. However, the level
and order of the penalties shall be at the sole discretion of the City Council,
based on the nature of the infraction and the City Council may suspend or
revoke a license for any violation of this Chapter or any applicable law. When

or impose other conditions deemed appropriate including amending an existing
license to add reasonable conditions to the license. The following minimum
penalties are established for violations of the terms of a license or the
provisions of this chapter:
      1.   The first violation shall result in an administrative penalty of
$300 to the license holder payable to the City. Failure to pay the
administrative penalty within 30 days from the date of the invoice shall result
in the licensee’s license being suspended until payment is received.
      2.   A second violation within thirty-six (36) months of a previous
violation shall result in a minimum administrative penalty of $600 to the
license holder payable to the City and a license suspension of at least one (1)

licensed products at the licensed retail establishment. Within thirty (30) days
of the date the Council imposes a penalty for a license violation, the license
holder shall require that anyone who sells licensed products at the licensed
retail establishment must comply with the licensed product seller training
requirements of this section. For a period of thirty-six (36) months following
a license violation, no person shall sell any licensed product at the licensed
retail establishment unless the person has first completed licensed product
seller training within the twenty-four (24) month period prior to the date of
selling the licensed product. The licensed product seller training program must
meet the standards hereafter set forth and must be provided by a business
entity or association whose regular business includes providing such trainings
and who is not owned by a license holder; provided, however, the training may
be provided by a license holder if the training meets the standards hereafter
set forth and the training program is approved by the city’s chief of police or
their designee. The standards for training must include the following:
      1.   Information regarding the laws pertaining to the sale of licensed
products;
      2.   The rules for identification checks;
      3.   Responsibilities of establishments serving or selling licensed
products; and
      4.   Verification of age, forms of identification, and forms of false or
misleading age identification and identifying minors.
      License holders shall keep on file proof that all persons selling
licensed products at the licensed retail establishment have completed the
licensed product seller training required by this section. Such proof shall be
kept for at least three (3) years. Proof of a person’s completion of licensed
product seller training shall be presented to a police officer upon request no
later than three (3) days after the request, excluding holidays and weekends.
No license holder shall allow the sale of any licensed product by a person who
has not complied with the licensed product seller training requirements of this
section. Any such sale or service shall constitute a violation of the
licensee’s license.
      Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, Section
461.12, subd 1a, a licensee’s authority to sell licensed products must be
suspended for not less than seven (7) days and may be revoked if the licensee:
      1.   Holds a license or registration issued pursuant to Minnesota
Statutes, Chapter 342 or Minnesota Statutes, Section 151.72, subdivision 5b,
and the license or registration is revoked;
      2.   Is convicted of an offense under Minnesota Statutes, Section 151.72,
subdivision 7; or
      3.   Has been convicted under any other state statute for the illegal
sale of marijuana, cannabis flower, cannabis products, lower-potency hemp
edibles, hemp-derived consumer products, or edible cannabinoid products and the
sale took place on the premises of a business that sells tobacco, tobacco-
related devices, electronic delivery devices, or nicotine or lobelia delivery
products.
   B.   Notice Required. No suspension or revocation may take effect until the
licensee has received notice, served personally or by mail, of the alleged
violation and an opportunity for a hearing before the City Council. A decision
that a violation has occurred must be in writing.
   C.   License Revocation and License Ineligibility. Licensees whose licenses
have been revoked shall not be eligible for another license for one (1) year
from the date of revocation. The City Council may attach reasonable conditions

amd. Ord. 1483, 9-9-2024)

   A.   Revocation, suspension, or denial of a license shall be preceded by a
hearing before the City Council. Notice of the hearing shall be provided to the
license holder or applicant via certified mail or personal service at least 10
days prior to the hearing. The notice shall include the time and place of the
hearing and shall state the nature of the charge against the licensee. A
hearing for consideration of the issuance, suspension, or revocation of a
license will be conducted before the City Council. At the hearing, the
applicant or licensee has the right to be represented by counsel, the right to
respond to the charges or information provided to the Council, and the right to
present evidence through witnesses under oath. It is not necessary that
criminal charges be brought in order to support a determination of a license
violation, nor does the dismissal or acquittal of such a criminal charge
operate as a bar to adverse license actions under this section.
   B.   Following the hearing, the Council may deny, revoke, suspend, or not
renew the license for the retail establishment or may grant or continue the
license upon such terms and conditions as it deems reasonable and necessary to
accomplish the purposes of this chapter. The decision by the City Council
following a hearing is final.
   C.   Enforcement actions provided in this section are not exclusive and the

4-15-5 Subsequent Nuisance Or Nuisance-Related Activity; Liability
4-15-6 Cost Of Enforcement Services; Collection
4-15-7 Excessive Inspection Services, Fee And Collection
4-15-8 Excessive Police And Nuisance Enforcement Costs And Collection
4-15-9 Penalty Not Exclusive; Additional Remedies
4-15-1: POLICY, PURPOSE, OBJECTIVE, INTENT:
The City Council finds some property owners take little or no responsibility
for the maintenance of their property until the City, through its various
inspections programs, has repeatedly ordered them to remedy violations of the
City Code. Such property owners create excessive costs for the City that are
over and above the normal cost of providing inspection services in the City.
Property owners who the City must repeatedly order to remedy Code violations on
their property consume a disproportionate share of limited City resources.
It is the intent of the City Council, by the adoption of this chapter, to
impose and collect the costs associated with re- inspections and the excessive
consumption of City inspection services. The collection of such costs for
certain properties shall be by assessment against the real property requiring
such excessive inspection or reinspection services, pursuant to Minnesota
Statutes section 429.101, which authorizes the Council to provide for
reinspection fees to be collected by special assessment and allows cities to
collect the costs associated with the removal or elimination of public health
or safety hazards.
The City Council also intends, by the adoption of this chapter, to impose on
and collect from the owner of a property the City cost for police and law
enforcement services which are over and above the cost of providing normal law
enforcement services and police protection City-wide, if the said excess costs
are spent to abate a nuisance which has occurred, or is maintained and
permitted, on the property. The collection of the costs for such excess police
services shall be by assessment against the property on which the nuisance, or
activity constituting the nuisance, occurs, pursuant to the authority in the
City Code empowering the Council to abate nuisances and collect the costs of
such abatement by special assessment. Nothing herein shall prevent the City
from using the authority and procedures in any other provision of the City
ordinance or statute, including but not limited to Minnesota Statutes, section
429.101. (Ord. 1366, 2-25-2019)

authorized to resolve the definition. For purposes of this chapter the
following terms below have the meanings given them:

compliance official, chief building official, building inspector, Fire Marshal/

inspection orders, or both. The fee being imposed is an administrative fee,

otherwise imposed, levied, or ordered by the City or a court pursuant to any

5-3-1: TITLE:
This chapter shall be known, cited, and referred to as the ALARM ORDINANCE.
(1974 Code § 907.01)
5-3-2: POLICY AND PURPOSE:
To protect the public health, safety and welfare, the city council deems it
necessary to provide for the special and express regulations of alarm systems
which are designed to signal the presence of a hazard requiring urgent
attention and to which public safety personnel are expected to respond. The
city council finds that the regulation of alarm systems is necessary in order
to reduce the increasing frequency of false alarms in the city. The great
number of and increasing frequency of these false alarms require intensive and
time consuming efforts by the police and fire departments and thereby distract
from and reduce the level of services available to the rest of the community.
This diminishes the ability of the city to promote the general health, welfare
and safety of the community. In consideration for the necessity on the part of
the city to provide numerous public safety services to all segments of the
community, without an undue concentration of public services in one area to the
detriment of members of the general public, it is hereby decided that the alarm
systems shall be regulated through the permit process described in this
chapter. (1974 Code § 907.03)
5-3-3: DEFINITIONS:

have the meanings as follows:
ALARM SIGNAL: An audible or visual signal, or both, indicating the existence of
an emergency condition. Audible devices may be bells, horns, chimes, speakers

a local alarm or an alarm transmitted to a monitoring agency which then
notifies the police and/or fire department.
ALARM SYSTEM: A single device or a combination of approved compatible devices
with the necessary electrical interconnection and energy to produce an alarm
signal in the event of an emergency. The alarm signal, when initiated, must be
connected to a monitoring agency which notifies the police and/or fire
department of an emergency to which public safety personnel initiate a
response, or emits an audible local signal which is reported to the police and/
or fire department to which public safety personnel initiate a response.
ALARM USER: The person, firm, partnership, association, corporation, company,
or organization of any kind on whose premises an alarm system is located.

1. The deliberate activation of an alarm system when no such emergency actually
exists; or
2. The activation of an alarm system through mechanical failure, malfunction,
or improper installation; or
3. The negligent use or maintenance of the alarm system by its owner or lessee
or by the owner's or lessee's employees or agents.
   B.    "False alarm" does not include activation of the alarm system by a
utility company or by power outages or by climatic conditions such as
tornadoes, lightning, earthquakes, other violent conditions of nature, or any
other conditions which are clearly beyond the control of the alarm
manufacturer, installer or owner.
   C.    "False alarm" does not include activation of an alarm system as the
result of an effort or order to upgrade, install, test or maintain the system,
if the police chief and, where applicable, the central monitoring agency for
the alarm system are each notified in advance of said upgrade, installation,
test or maintenance.

   E.   False Alarms; Automatic Revocation; Reissuance:
      1.   A third false police alarm or a third false fire alarm and any false
alarm thereafter in any calendar year will result in automatic revocation of
the applicable alarm user permit, unless the permit is reissued in accordance
with this section. When the police chief determines that such a false police or
fire alarm has occurred, the police chief shall notify the alarm user of that
determination. The alarm user's permit will be revoked unless, within ten (10)
working days of the date of the notice, the alarm user complies with subsection
F3 of this section and also submits the required permit fee or establishes to
the satisfaction of the police chief that the alarm activation was not a "false
alarm" within the meaning of this chapter.
      2.   A false alarm that occurs during the ten (10) day period for
reissuance of an alarm user permit shall be treated as requiring an additional
reissued permit. For each such false alarm, the alarm user shall pay the permit
fee for a reissued permit as provided by this section.

subsection, the alarm user shall provide the police chief with evidence that

corrected.

permit by paying the permit fee for reissuance and by satisfying the provisions
of this chapter. A new application is not required, provided that the

by an alarm user or his agents.

alarms.

regarding the application for an alarm user's permit.

this chapter within the time period specified by the police chief in an oral or
written notice to the alarm user.

this section shall be investigated by the police department. The alarm user
shall be given notice of the proposed revocation or suspension and be provided
an opportunity to informally present evidence to the police chief prior to the
final decision on revocation or suspension.
      3.   Conditions For Permit Reactivation Or Reissuance: The police chief
may impose reasonable conditions for the reactivation of a suspended alarm user
permit or the reissuance of a revoked alarm user permit.
      4.   Reactivation Or Reissuance Of Permit: A suspended permit will be
reactivated at the end of the period of suspension or upon satisfaction of all
conditions imposed under this chapter, whichever is later, and without payment
of a reissued permit fee. An alarm user whose permit has been revoked must
apply for a reissued permit in accordance with this section.
   G.   Notice And Appeal: Where notice of suspension, automatic revocation, or
other revocation is required to be given to an alarm user under this chapter,
the notice shall be sent by certified mail to the alarm user's last known
address. The notice shall inform the alarm user of: the action to be taken on
the permit; the conditions, if any, for reissuance or reactivation of the alarm
user's permit; the alarm user's right to an informal hearing before the police
chief; and the alarm user's right to appeal the police chief's decision to the
city council. The police chief's decision may be appealed to the city council,
provided such appeal is filed in writing with the city clerk within fifteen
(15) days after mailing of the police chief's decision to the alarm user. If an
appeal is taken, the alarm user shall be given at least ten (10) days'
advanced, written notice as to when the city council will consider the appeal.
The alarm user may present any oral or written evidence to the council on the
issues of whether revocation or suspension is justified and on the conditions
for reissuance. (1974 Code §§ 907.07, 907.09, 907.11, 907.15, 907.17, and

premises.
         e.   Any electric or electrified fence in association with prescribed
grazing must have a warning sign posted on every boundary of the enclosure at
least every fifty feet (50') along each side of the fence. The warning sign
shall clearly identify the electric fence. No single sign shall exceed four (4)
square feet in area. Each sign shall be clearly visible on the approach to the
fence and be posted on or within one foot (1') of the electric or electrified
fence.
      8.   Shelter: Temporary shelters may be allowed during the duration of
the permit subject to staff review.

sanitary condition so as to be free from offensive odors, fly breeding, dust,
and general nuisance conditions. Goat manure shall be removed and disposed of
as frequently as necessary to avoid the creation of nuisance conditions.
      11.   Noise: Goats that engage in habitual bleating may not be used for
prescribed grazing. Habitual bleating is defined as bleating for repeated
intervals of at least five (5) minutes with less than one (1) minute of
interruption that is audible off of the property owner's premises.
      12.   Natural Resources Protection: Prescribed grazing shall not
adversely affect significant natural resources. Prescribed grazing activities

regulations set forth elsewhere in the City Code.
      13.   Conservation Easements: If the proposed prescribed grazing area is
within a conservation easement, all requirements of the conservation easement
must be met. If the terms of the conservation easements do not allow prescribed
grazing, then the permit will be denied.
   H.   Feeding And Care Of Goats: All supplemental feed for the goats shall be
securely stored in water-tight and vermin-proof containers. All goats on the
premises shall have daily access to fresh drinking water (not from nearby
lakes, ponds, etc.). All goats used under the permit shall receive proper
veterinary treatment and regular deworming. In the event that a goat becomes
ill, hurt, or perishes, the owner of the goat is responsible for immediate on-
site care or removal of the goat from the property.
   I.   Revocation Of Permit: If a violation of the terms of this section or
the prescribed grazing permit is found, the City Clerk shall give written
notice thereof to the owner of the goat(s) and property owner. If the violation
is not remedied within twenty four (24) hours of the date of the notice, the
prescribed goat grazing permit may be administratively revoked. The City Clerk
may summarily revoke a permit if goat(s) have been found running at large on
two (2) or more occurrences during the term of the permit. (Ord. 1416, 6-28-

5-5-9: GRAFFITI:
   A.    Findings: The City Council of the City of Inver Grove Heights makes
the following findings regarding the need to promptly remove graffiti from
private and public property:
      1.    Graffiti constitutes a form of vandalism defacing public and
private property without the permission of the owner, and causing citizens,
businesses and the City to incur the cost of repair and removal.
      2.    Graffiti is a visual symbol of disorder eroding public safety,
contributing to a downward spiral of blight and decay, lessening property
values, business viability and ultimately tax revenues and, as such, is
inconsistent with the City's property maintenance goals and aesthetic
standards.
      3.    The failure to maintain one's property by removing graffiti after
being ordered by the City to do so within a reasonable period of time is
injurious to the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the
residents of the City.
   B.    Definition:
   GRAFFITI: Any unauthorized inscription, word, figure, painting, or other
defacement that is written, marked, etched, scratched, sprayed, drawn, painted,
or engraved on or otherwise affixed to any surface of a permanent structure,
fixture or object, including, but not limited to: buildings, walls, fences,
bridges, benches, shelters, sidewalks, hydrants, fountains, pavement, curbs,
trees, rocks, signs, utility poles or boxes situated on public or private
property to the extent that the inscription, word, figure, painting or other
defacement was not authorized in advance by the responsible party for the
property.
   C.    Graffiti Vandalism: It shall be unlawful for any person to
intentionally place or apply, or attempt to place or apply, graffiti on any
surface of a permanent structure, fixture or object located on public or
private real property within the city without the advance authorization of the
property owner.
   D.    Removal Of Graffiti:
      1.    By Perpetrator: Any person applying graffiti on public or private
property has the duty to remove the graffiti within twenty four (24) hours
after being given notice by the city or property owner. This removal must be
done in a manner prescribed by the city administrator, chief of police, code
compliance specialist or their designees. Any person applying graffiti is
responsible for the removal or for the payment of the removal. Failure of any
person to remove graffiti or pay for the removal will constitute an additional
violation of this section. If graffiti is applied by a person under eighteen
(18) years old, the parents or legal guardian will also be responsible for such
removal or for the payment for the removal. Notice shall be served as provided
in this section.
      2.    By Property Owner: If graffiti is not removed by the perpetrator
according to the previous subsection, the city may order that the graffiti be
removed by the property owner or any person who may be in possession or who has
the right to possess such property. The graffiti must be removed within seven
(7) days unless a different time frame is specified in the notice. Notice shall
be served as provided in this section.
   E.    Notice: The city shall cause written notice to be served on the
perpetrator or owner of the property by personal service or by certified mail,
ordering the perpetrator or owner to remove the graffiti within the time frame
specified in the notice. The notice shall contain a description of the
property, the location of the graffiti, and inform the perpetrator or owner
that failure to comply with the notice may result in the imposition of a
criminal citation. (Ord. 1195, 7-27-2009)
5-5-10: COAL TAR BASED SEALER:
   A.    Purpose: The city understands that the lakes, rivers, streams and
other bodies of water within the city are natural assets that enhance the
environmental, recreational, cultural and economic resource of the city and
that they contribute to the general health and welfare of the community.
The use of sealers on asphalt driveways is a common practice. However,
scientific studies on the use of driveway sealers have demonstrated a
relationship between stormwater runoff and certain health and environmental
concerns.
The purpose of this section is to prohibit the use of coal tar based sealer
within the city to protect water quality within the city.
   B.    Definitions: For purposes of this section, the following shall mean:
   ASPHALT BASED SEALER: A petroleum based sealer material that is commonly
used on driveways, parking lots, and other surfaces and which does not contain
coal tar.
   COAL TAR: A byproduct of the process used to refine coal.

5-5-11: PREDATORY OFFENDER RESIDENCY:
   A.    Findings And Intent:
      1.    Repeat sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical
violence, and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual predators who
present an extreme threat to public safety. Current information indicates that
such predatory offenders are likely to use physical violence and to repeat
their offenses, and most predatory offenders commit many offenses, have many
more victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of
their crimes. The cost of predatory offender victimization to society at large,
while not precisely calculable, is steep.
      2.    It is the intent of this section to serve the City's compelling
interest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety and welfare of the
citizens of the City by creating areas around locations where children
regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain predatory
offenders are prohibited from establishing temporary or permanent residences.

necessary and in the public interest to impose a permanent ordinance limiting
the residency locations of designated predatory offenders within the City.

level of III (referred to as a level III predatory offender) pursuant to

The city council has determined that the health of the elm trees within city
limits is threatened by a fatal disease known as Dutch elm disease, that oak
trees are threatened by a disease known as oak wilt, and that ash trees are
threatened by the emerald ash borer. The council has further determined that
the loss of such trees growing upon public and private property would
substantially depreciate the value of property within the city, cause
significant costs to the public for tree removal, and impair the safety, good
order, general welfare and convenience of the public. It is declared to be the
intention of the council to control and prevent the spread of these diseases as
well as infestation by these insects, and this chapter is enacted for that
purpose. (Ord. 1217, 8-9-2010)

   A.    Abatement Process:
      1.    Notice: Whenever, following an inspection, the enforcement officer
determines that a public nuisance on property exists or is being maintained on
property, the enforcement officer must give written notification to the
property owner and occupant or other responsible party of that fact and order
that the public nuisance on property be terminated and abated. Notice must be
served in person or by certified mail. Failure of the party to receive the
certified mail does not invalidate the service of the notice. Notice to the
owner will be satisfied by notice to the person listed as the taxpayer on the
county's tax records. If the property is not occupied, the owner is unknown, or
no other responsible party can reasonably be identified, notice may be served
by posting it on the property for a period of at least seventy two (72) hours.
The notice must state:
         a.    The property location of the public nuisance on property;
         b.    The nature of the public nuisance on property, with reference to
the appropriate code provision;
         c.    The steps to be taken to abate the public nuisance on property
and a reasonable amount of time within which the public nuisance on property is
to be abated, which shall not be less than seven (7) business days after the
date of the notice;
         d.    That if the owner, occupant, or other responsible party does not
comply with the notice within the time specified, the city may provide for
abating the public nuisance on property;
         e.    That the owner, occupant, or other responsible party has the
right to appeal the designation as a public nuisance on property by submitting
a request in writing to the city clerk before the date by which abatement must
be completed or within seven (7) calendar days after service of the notice,
whichever comes first; and
         f.    That the city may assess its costs for abatement of the public
nuisance on property against the property in accordance with this section.
      2.    Authority To Abate: If no timely appeal is submitted and the public
nuisance on property is not abated within the deadline given, the enforcement
officer may proceed to abate the public nuisance on property. If the owners or
responsible parties deny access to the property for abatement of the public
nuisance on property, the enforcement officer shall then obtain an
administrative search warrant or other judicial order to proceed with
enforcement of this chapter. If any material derived from the abatement is
salvageable, the city may sell the salvaged material at private or public sale
with the proceeds from the sale being used to offset the cost of abatement. Any

section, the city will maintain a record showing the cost of the work
attributable to abatement of the public nuisance on property, including

abated by the City, or any person who has caused a public nuisance on property
not owned by that person, shall be personally liable for all costs incurred by

forth in the City Fee Schedule. As soon as the abatement work has been
completed and the cost determined, the city clerk shall prepare and send by
first class mail an invoice to the owner and/or responsible party setting forth
the amount of expenses and charges for such work, which amount is due and
payable to the city within thirty (30) days after the date of invoice. Unpaid

specially assess all the costs of abatement identified in subsection A4 of this
section against the property.

Minnesota statutes section 429.061 to levy the special assessment for the
abatement.
      7.    Emergency Procedure; Summary Enforcement: In cases of emergency,
where delay in abatement required to complete the procedure and notice
requirements as set forth in this subsection A will permit a continuing public
nuisance on property to unreasonably endanger public health, safety, or
welfare, the city council may order summary enforcement and abate the public
nuisance on property. To proceed with summary enforcement, the enforcement
officer or other designated official shall first determine that a public
nuisance on property exists or is being maintained and that delay in abatement
will unreasonably endanger public health, safety, or welfare. The officer or
designated official shall then notify in writing the occupant or owner of the
property of the nature of the public nuisance on property, whether public
health, safety, or welfare will be unreasonably endangered by delay in
abatement required to complete the procedure set forth in this subsection A and
may order that the public nuisance on property be immediately terminated or
abated. If the public nuisance on property is not immediately terminated or
abated, the city council may then order summary enforcement and abate the
public nuisance on property.

5-10-1 Findings And Purpose
5-10-2 Prohibition Of Feeding Deer
5-10-3 Exceptions
5-10-4 Penalty
5-10-1: FINDINGS AND PURPOSE:
The city council finds that feeding of deer contributes to a high deer density
in the city which in turn causes a threat to the public health, safety and
welfare. The high deer density has resulted in damage to landscapes and damage
to the understory of wooded areas. Further, the high deer density causes an
increased potential for accidents between vehicles and deer and increased
potential for contact with deer ticks that could result in Lyme disease.
Prohibiting the feeding of deer in the urban developed areas will lessen the
deer population in those areas by reducing the number of deer concentration
sites. (Ord. 1267, 5-13-2013)
5-10-2: PROHIBITION OF FEEDING DEER:
Within that portion of the city designated as the prohibited deer feeding area
on the map attached to the ordinance codified herein, no person shall engage in
the feeding of deer or allow the feeding of deer on that person's property. The
map is on file with the city clerk and is hereby incorporated by reference and
made a part of this section.
For purposes of this section, feeding of deer shall mean that the following
circumstances have occurred:
   A.    Providing salt blocks, birdseed mixtures, grain, fruits, vegetables,
nuts, hay or other edible material;
   B.    In a manner that attracts or is designed to attract deer on a regular
basis;
provided, however, feeding of deer does not include any of the following:
      1.    Providing living food sources, such as fruit trees, growing crops
or other live vegetation; or
      2.    Providing birdseed mixtures, grain, fruits, vegetables, nuts, or
other edible material in a birdfeeder that is designed to preclude deer access
to the storage space within the birdfeeder; or
      3.    Providing birdseed mixtures, grain, fruits, vegetables, nuts, or
other edible material located at a height more than five feet (5') above the
ground; or
      4.    Leaving in or on top of the ground, crops or other vegetation that
have been spoiled or killed by frost conditions; or
      5.    Placing or allowing to be kept on the ground, any combination of
birdseed mixtures, grains, fruits, vegetables or nuts in a total aggregate
amount of less than four (4) pounds at any one time; there shall not be more
than one such feeding location per tax parcel. (Ord. 1267, 5-13-2013)
5-10-3: EXCEPTIONS:
The prohibition contained in section
5-10-2 of this chapter shall not apply to veterinarians or governmental game
officials, who in the course of their duties have deer in their custody or
under their management. Further, the prohibition contained in section
5-10-2 of this chapter shall not apply to a Minnesota department of natural
resources deer management program approved by the city council. (Ord. 1267, 5-
13-2013)
5-10-4: PENALTY:
A violation of section
5-10-2 of this chapter shall be a petty misdemeanor. (Ord. 1267, 5-13-2013)

to snow and ice removal by the City shall be the responsibility of the adjacent
property owner. All snow, ice, dirt, and rubbish remaining on a public sidewalk
more than twenty four (24) hours after its deposit thereon is hereby determined
to be a public nuisance. The owner of any property adjacent to a public
sidewalk shall use due diligence to keep such sidewalk safe for pedestrians. No
such owner shall allow snow, ice, dirt or rubbish to remain on the sidewalk
more than twenty-four (24) hours after has been deposited thereon; with respect

a record showing the cost of such removal from public sidewalk and shall
deliver such information to the City Clerk.
   C.   Emergency Abatement. Upon inspection of the property on which it is
alleged that a public nuisance exists related to snow, ice, dirt or rubbish, if
the street maintenance superintendent or their designee determine that a public
nuisance exists and that the public health, safety or welfare may be in
immediate danger, then emergency abatement procedures may be implemented, and
the City may cause the nuisance to be removed or abated. When emergency
abatement of snow, ice, dirt or rubbish is authorized, pre-abatement notice to

city are kept in repair and safe for pedestrians. If he finds that any sidewalk
abutting on private property is unsafe and in need of repairs, he shall cause a
notice to be served, by registered mail or by personal service, upon the record
owner of the property and the occupant, if the owner does not reside within the
city or cannot be found therein, ordering such owner to have the sidewalk
repaired and made safe within thirty (30) days and stating if the owner fails
to do so, the city will have such work done, and that the expense thereof must
be paid by the owner, and that if unpaid, the entire cost thereof will be made
a special assessment against the property concerned.
   C.    Repair By City: If the sidewalk is not repaired within thirty (30)
days after receipt of the notice, the council shall, by resolution, order the

receive the new permit or an extension of the old permit before working after
the end date of the previous permit. This supplementary application must be
submitted before the permit end date.
      2.    If the obstruction or excavation of the right of way begins later
or ends sooner than the date given on the permit, the permittee shall notify
the city by supplementary application of the accurate information as soon as
this information is known. (Ord. 1174, 4-28-2008)
7-3-9: OTHER OBLIGATIONS:
   A.    Compliance With Other Laws: Obtaining a right of way permit does not
relieve permittee of its duty to obtain all other necessary permits, licenses,
and authority and to pay all fees required by the city or other applicable
rule, law or regulation. A permittee shall comply with all requirements of
local, state and federal laws, including, but not limited to, Minnesota
statutes sections 216D.01 to 216D.09 (gopher one call excavation notice system)
and Minnesota rules chapter 7560. A permittee shall perform all work in
conformance with all applicable codes and established rules and regulations,
and is responsible for all work done in the right of way pursuant to its
permit, regardless of who does the work.
   B.    Prohibited Work: Except in an emergency, or with the approval of the
city, no right of way obstruction or excavation may be done when seasonally
prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable for such work.
   C.    Interference With Right Of Way: A permittee shall not so obstruct a
right of way that the natural free and clear passage of water through the
gutters or other waterways shall be interfered with, unless otherwise approved
by the director. Private vehicles of those doing work in the right of way may
not be parked within or next to a permit area, unless parked in conformance
with city parking regulations. The loading or unloading of trucks must be done
solely within the defined permit area unless specifically authorized by the
permit.
   D.    Traffic Control: A permittee shall implement traffic control measures
in the area of the work and shall use traffic control procedures in accordance
with the most recent manuals on uniform traffic control, traffic control
devices and traffic zone layouts published by the state of Minnesota.
   E.    Trenchless Excavation: As a condition of all applicable permits,
permittees employing trenchless excavation methods, including, but not limited
to, horizontal directional drilling, shall follow all requirements set forth in
Minnesota statutes chapter 216D and Minnesota rules chapter 7560, and shall
require potholing or open cutting over existing underground utilities before
excavating, as determined by the director. (Ord. 1174, 4-28-2008)
7-3-10: ROUTINE OBSTRUCTION AND EXCAVATION:
Routine excavations and obstructions are permitted without separate notice and
separate compensation for such projects. Projects that do not involve
excavation of paved surface and that last less than a continuous eight (8) hour
period in duration between seven o'clock (7:00) A.M. and seven o'clock (7:00)
P.M., Monday through Friday, excluding holidays, may, in the director's
discretion, be considered routine obstruction and excavation and include, by
way of example, switching, replacing fuses, replacing transformers, placing
line guards, animal protection, leak surveys, anode installations and
inspections, or to repair facilities due to public damage or accident. (Ord.
1174, 4-28-2008)
7-3-11: DILIGENCE IN PERFORMING WORK; DELAY PENALTY:
Work shall progress in an expeditious manner as permitted by weather conditions
until completion in order to avoid unnecessary inconvenience. In the event that
the work is not performed in accordance with applicable regulations,
excavations and utility connections, or the work is not done in an expeditious
manner, or is abandoned without due cause, the city may, after seventy two (72)
hours' notice to the permit holder, correct and fill the excavation or repair
the street. The entire cost of such work shall be paid by the permit holder
upon demand made by the city. In accordance with Minnesota rule 7819.1000,
subpart 3, the city shall establish and impose a delay penalty for unreasonable
delays in right of way excavation, obstruction, patching, or restoration. The
delay penalty shall be established from time to time by city council
resolution. A delay penalty will not be imposed for delays due to force
majeure, including inclement weather, civil strife, acts of God, or other
circumstances beyond the control of the applicant. (Ord. 1174, 4-28-2008)
7-3-12: WORK STANDARDS:
The permit holder shall comply with the following standards when engaging in
the work:
   A.    Observe and comply with all laws, rules and regulations of the state.
   B.    Conduct the operation and perform the work in a manner as to ensure
the least obstruction and interference to traffic.
   C.    Take adequate precautions to ensure the safety of the general public
and those who require access to abutting property.
   D.    If required by the director, notify adjoining property owners prior to
the commencement of work which may disrupt the use of and access to such
adjoining properties.
   E.    In all cases where construction work interferes with the normal use of
the construction area, provide for closing the construction area to traffic or
to afford restricted use of the area and comply with MUTCD traffic safety
signing requirements.
   F.    Exercise precaution at all times for the protection of persons,
including employees and property.
   G.    Protect and identify excavations and work operations with barricade
flags and, if required, by flagmen in the daytime and by warning lights at
night.
   H.    Provide proper trench protection as required by OSHA when necessary
and, depending upon the type of soil, in order to prevent cave ins endangering
life or tending to enlarge the excavation.
   I.    Protect the root growth of trees and shrubbery.
   J.    Installation of pipe (utility conductors) under concrete or bituminous
pavements shall be done by jacking, auguring or tunneling as directed by the
director unless otherwise authorized.
   K.    All backfilling must be placed in six inch (6") layers at optimum
moisture and compacted with the objective of attaining one hundred percent
(100%) of standard proctor density. Compaction shall be accomplished with hand,
pneumatic or vibrating compacters, as appropriate.
   L.    No metal tracked or other lugged equipment is allowed to be driven on
the public right of way. (Ord. 1174, 4-28-2008)
7-3-13: INSPECTIONS:
   A.    Site Inspection: Permittee shall make the work site available to the
city and to all others as authorized by law for inspection at all reasonable
times during the execution of and upon completion of the work.
   B.    Authority Of Director:
      1.    At the time of inspection, the director may order the immediate
cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the life, health, safety
or well being of the public.
      2.    The director may issue an order to the permittee to correct any
work that does not conform to the terms of the permit or other applicable
standards, conditions, or code. If the work failure is a "substantial breach",
within the meaning of Minnesota statutes section 237.163, subdivision 4(c), the
order shall state that failure to correct the violation will be cause for
revocation of the permit after a specified period determined by the director.
The permittee shall present proof to the director that the violation has been
corrected within the time period set forth by the director in the order. Such
proof shall be provided no later than the next business day following the day
of completion. If such proof has not been presented within the required time,
the director may revoke the permit pursuant to section
7-3-7-10 of this chapter. (Ord. 1174, 4-28-2008)
7-3-14: WORK WITHOUT PERMIT:
   A.    Emergency Situations:
      1.    Each registrant shall immediately notify the director of any event
regarding its facilities that it considers to be an emergency. The registrant
may proceed to take whatever actions are necessary to respond to the emergency.
Excavators' notification to state gopher one call regarding an emergency
situation does not fulfill this requirement. Within two (2) business days after
the occurrence of the emergency, the registrant shall apply for the necessary
permits, pay the fees associated therewith, and fulfill the rest of the
requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with this chapter for
the actions it took in response to the emergency.
      2.    If the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding a registrant's
facilities, the city will attempt to contact the local representative of each
registrant affected, or potentially affected, by the emergency. In any event,
the city may take whatever action it deems necessary to respond to the
emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the registrant whose facilities
occasioned the emergency.
   B.    Nonemergency Situations: Except in an emergency, any person who,
without first having obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or excavates a
right of way must subsequently obtain a permit and, as a penalty, pay double
the normal fee for said permit, pay double all the other fees required by this
code, deposit with the city the fees necessary to correct any damage to the
right of way, and comply with all of the requirements of this chapter. (Ord.
1174, 4-28-2008)
7-3-15: INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS:
The excavation, backfilling, patching and restoration, and all other work
performed in the right of way shall be done in conformance with Minnesota rules
7819.1100 and 7819.5000 and other applicable local requirements, insofar as
they are not inconsistent with the Minnesota statutes sections 237.162 and
237.163. Installation of service laterals shall be performed in accordance with
Minnesota rules chapter 7560 and this chapter. Service lateral installation is
further subject to those requirements and conditions set forth by the city in
the applicable permits and/or agreements referenced in subsection
7-3-17B of this chapter. (Ord. 1174, 4-28-2008)
7-3-16: PATCHING AND RESTORATION OF RIGHT OF WAY:
   A.    Timing: The work to be done under the utility permit, and the patching
and restoration of the right of way as required herein, must be completed
within the dates specified in the permit, increased by as many days as work
could not be done because of circumstances beyond the control of the permittee
or when work was prohibited as unseasonal or unreasonable under subsection
7-3-9B of this chapter or if the permittee is granted a new permit.
   B.    Performing Work: Permittee must patch its own work. The city may
choose either to have the permittee restore the surface and subgrading portions
of right of way or to restore the surface portion of right of way itself.
      1.    Permittee Restoration: If the permittee restores the right of way
itself, it shall, at the time of application for a utility permit, post a
construction performance bond in accordance with the provisions of section
7-3-7-4 of this chapter, and Minnesota rules 7819.3000.
      2.    City Restoration: If the city restores the surface portion of right
of way, permittee shall pay the costs thereof within thirty (30) days of
billing. If, following such restoration, the pavement settles or otherwise
fails for reasons not caused by the city's failure to properly restore, the
permittee shall pay to the city, within thirty (30) days of billing, all costs
associated with correcting the defective work.
      3.    Degradation Fee In Lieu Of Restoration: In lieu of right of way
restoration, a right of way user may elect to pay a degradation fee. However,
the right of way user shall remain responsible for replacing and compacting the
subgrade and aggregate based material in the excavation, and the degradation
fee shall not include the cost to accomplish these responsibilities.
   C.    Standards: The permittee shall perform patching and restoration
according to the standards and with the materials specified by the city and
shall comply with Minnesota rules 7819.1100. In exercising authority over
restoration, the director shall be guided by the following standards and
considerations:
      1.    The number, size, depth and duration of the excavations,
disruptions or damage to the right of way;
      2.    The traffic volume carried by the right of way and the character of
the neighborhood surrounding the right of way;
      3.    The preexcavation condition of the right of way and the remaining
life expectancy of the right of way affected by the excavation;
      4.    Whether the relative cost of the method of restoration to the
permit holder is in reasonable balance with the prevention of an accelerated
depreciation of the right of way that would otherwise result from the
excavation, disturbance or damage to the right of way; and
      5.    The likelihood that the particular method of restoration would be
effective in slowing the depreciation of the right of way that would otherwise
take place.
   D.    Duty To Correct Defects: The permittee shall correct defects in
patching or restoration performed by permittee or its agents. Upon notification
from the city, permittee shall correct all restoration work to the extent
necessary, using the method required by the city. Unless otherwise agreed to by
the director, said work shall be commenced within two (2) days of receipt of
the notice from the city and shall be completed within fourteen (14) days of
commencement of work, not including days during which work cannot be done
because of circumstances constituting force majeure or days when work is
prohibited as unseasonal or unreasonable under subsection
7-3-9B of this chapter.
   E.    Failure To Restore: If the permittee fails to restore the right of way
in the manner and to the condition required by the city, or fails to
satisfactorily and timely complete all restoration required by the city, the
city shall notify the permittee in writing of the specific alleged failure or
failures and shall allow the permittee five (5) days from receipt of said
written notice to cure said failure or failures, unless otherwise extended by
the director. In the event the permittee fails to cure, the city may, at its
option, perform the necessary work, and the permittee shall pay to the city,
within thirty (30) days of billing, the cost of restoring the right of way. If
the permittee fails to pay as required, the city, in addition to other remedies
provided by law, may exercise its rights under the construction performance
bond. (Ord. 1174, 4-28-2008)
7-3-17: MAPPING DATA:
   A.    Information Required: Each registrant and permittee shall provide
mapping information required by the city in accordance with Minnesota rules
7819.4000 and 7819.4100. Within ninety (90) days following completion of any
work pursuant to a permit, the permittee shall provide the director accurate
maps and drawings certifying the as built location of all equipment installed,
owed, and maintained by the permittee. Such maps and drawings shall include the
horizontal and vertical location of all facilities and equipment and shall be
provided consistent with the city's electronic mapping system, when practical
or as a condition imposed by the director. Failure to provide maps and drawings
pursuant to this subsection shall be grounds for revoking the permit holder's
registration.
   B.    Service Laterals: All permits issued for the installation or repair of
service laterals, other than minor repairs as defined in Minnesota rules
7560.0150, subpart 2, shall require the permittee's use of appropriate means of
establishing the horizontal locations of installed service laterals and the
service lateral vertical locations in those cases where the director reasonably
requires it. Permittees or their subcontractors shall submit to the director
evidence satisfactory to the director of the installed service lateral
locations. Compliance with this subsection and with applicable state gopher one
call law and Minnesota rules governing service laterals installed after
December 31, 2007, shall be a condition of any city approval necessary for: 1)
payments to contractors working on a public improvement project including those
under Minnesota statutes chapter 429; and 2) city approval of performance under
development agreements or other subdivision or site plan approval under
Minnesota statutes chapter 462. The director shall reasonably determine the
appropriate method of providing such information to the city. Failure to
provide prompt and accurate information on the service laterals installed may
result in the revocation of the permit issued for the work or for future
permits to the offending permittee or its subcontractors. (Ord. 1174, 4-28-
2008)
7-3-18: UNDERGROUNDING:
   A.    Purpose: The purpose of this section is to promote the health, safety
and general welfare of the public and is intended to foster: 1) safe travel
over the right of way; 2) nontravel related safety around homes and buildings
where overhead feeds are connected; and 3) orderly development in the city.
Location and relocation, installation and reinstallation of facilities in the
right of way or in or on other public ground must be made in accordance with
this section and is intended to be enforced consistently with state and federal
law regulating right of way users, specifically including, but not limited to,
Minnesota statutes sections 161.45, 237.162, 237.163, 301B.01, 222.37, 238.084
and 216B.36 and the telecommunications act of 1996, title 47, USC section 253.
   B.    New Facilities: Facilities newly installed, constructed or otherwise
placed in the public right of way or in other public property held in common
for public use must be located and maintained underground pursuant to the terms
and conditions of this chapter and in accordance with applicable construction
standards, subject to the exceptions below. Aboveground installation,
construction, modification, or replacement of meters, gauges, transformers,
street lighting, pad mount switches, capacitor banks, reclosers and service
connection pedestals shall be allowed. These requirements shall apply equally
outside of the corporate limits of the city coincident with city jurisdiction
of platting, subdivision regulation or comprehensive planning as may now or in
the future be allowed by law.
   C.    Permanent Replacement, Relocated Or Reconstructed Facilities: If the
city finds that one or more of the purposes set forth in subsection A of this
section would be promoted, the city may require a permanent replacement,
relocation or reconstruction of a facility to be located and maintained
underground, with due regard for seasonal working conditions. For purposes of
this subsection, "reconstruction" means any substantial repair of or any
improvement to existing facilities. Undergrounding may be required whether a
replacement, relocation or reconstruction is initiated by the right of way user
owning or operating the facilities, or by the city in connection with: 1) the
present or future use by the city or other local governmental unit of the right
of way or other public ground for a public project; 2) the public health or
safety; or 3) the safety and convenience of travel over the right of way.
Subject to subsection D of this section, all relocations from previously placed
underground facilities shall be to another underground location.
   D.    Exceptions: The following exceptions to the strict application of this
section shall be allowed upon the conditions stated:
      1.    Technical/Economic Feasibility; Promotion Of Policy: Aboveground
installation, construction, or placement of facilities shall be allowed in
residential, commercial and industrial areas where the council, following
consideration and recommendation by the planning commission, finds that:
         a.    Underground placement would place an undue financial burden upon
the landowner, rate payer, or right of way user, or would deprive the landowner
of the preservation and enjoyment of substantial property rights; or
         b.    Underground placement is impractical or not technically feasible
due to topographical, subsoil or other existing conditions which adversely
affect underground facilities placement; or
         c.    Failure to promote the purposes of undergrounding. The right of
way user clearly and convincingly demonstrates that none of the purposes under
subsection A of this section would be advanced by underground placement of
facilities on the project in question, or the city determines on its own review
that undergrounding is not warranted based on the circumstances of the proposed
undergrounding.
      2.    Temporary Service: Aboveground installation, construction, or
placement of temporary service lines shall only be allowed:
         a.    During new construction of any project for a period not to
exceed three (3) months.
         b.    During an emergency in order to safeguard lives or property
within the city.
         c.    For a period of not more than seven (7) months when soil
conditions make excavation impractical.
   E.    Developer Responsibility: All owners, platters, or developers are
responsible for complying with the requirements of this section and, prior to
final approval of any plat or development plan, shall submit to the director
written instruments from the appropriate right of way users showing that all
necessary arrangements with said users for installation of such facilities have
been made. (Ord. 1174, 4-28-2008)
7-3-19: LOCATION AND RELOCATION OF FACILITIES:
   A.    Compliance With State Regulations: Placement, location and relocation
of facilities must comply with the act, with other applicable rights of the
city under its police power, and with Minnesota rules 7819.3100, 7819.5000 and
7819.5100, to the extent the rules do not limit authority otherwise available
to cities.
   B.    Relocation Notification Procedure: The director shall notify the
utility owner at least three (3) months in advance of the need to relocate
existing facilities so the owner can determine if relocation or replacement is
required and plan any required work. The city should provide one notification,
provide the date work will start on the city's project and, if different,
provide the date by which the relocation must be completed. To the extent
technically feasible and limited by seasonal constraints, all utilities shall
be relocated within one month or in a time frame determined by the director.
The director may allow a different schedule if it does not interfere with the
city's project. The utility owner shall diligently work to relocate the
facilities within the above schedule.
   C.    Delay To City Project: If the owner fails to meet the relocation
schedule due to circumstances within the utility's control, the city may charge
the utility owner for all costs incurred by the city because the relocation is
not completed in the scheduled time frame.
   D.    Joint Trenching: All facilities shall be placed in appropriate
portions of right of way so as to cause minimum conflict with other underground
facilities. When technically appropriate and no safety hazards are created, all
utilities shall be installed, constructed or placed within the same trench.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, gas and electric lines shall be placed in
conformance with Minnesota rules part 7819.5100, subpart 2, governing safety
standards.
   E.    Corridors:
      1.    The city may assign a specific area within the right of way, or any
particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of facility that
is or, pursuant to current technology, the city expects will be located within
the right of way. All utility, obstruction, or other permits issued by the city
involving the installation or replacement of facilities shall designate the
proper corridor for the facilities at issue. A typical cross section of the
location for utilities may be on file at the director's office. This section is
not intended to establish "high density corridors".
      2.    Any registrant who has facilities in the right of way in a position
at variance with the corridors established by the city may remain at that
location until the city requires facilities relocation to the corridor pursuant
to relocation authority granted under Minnesota rules 7819.3100 or other
applicable law.
   F.    Limitation Of Space: To protect the public health, safety, and
welfare, or when necessary to protect the right of way and its current use, the
city shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or
additional facilities within the right of way. In making such decisions, the
city shall strive, to the extent possible, to accommodate all existing and
potential users of the right of way, but shall be guided primarily by
considerations of the public interest, the public needs for the particular
utility service, the condition of the right of way, the time of year with
respect to essential utilities, the protection of existing facilities in the
right of way, and future city plans for public improvements and development
projects which have been determined to be in the public interest. (Ord. 1174,
4-28-2008)
7-3-20: PREEXCAVATION FACILITIES LOCATION:
In addition to complying with the requirements of Minnesota statutes sections
216D.01 to 216D.09 (one call excavation notice system) before the start date of
any right of way excavation, each registrant who has facilities or equipment in
the area to be excavated shall be responsible to mark the horizontal placement
of all said facilities, to the extent technically feasible. To the extent its
records contain such information, each registrant shall provide information
regarding the approximate vertical location of its facilities, at the time of
installation, to excavators upon request. Nothing in this section is meant to
limit the rights, duties and obligations of the facility owners or excavators
as set forth in Minnesota statutes sections 216D.01 to 216D.09. (Ord. 1174, 4-
28-2008)
7-3-21: INTERFERENCE BY OTHER FACILITIES:
When the city does work in the right of way, in its governmental right of way
management function, and finds it necessary to maintain, support, or move a
registrant's facilities to carry out the work without damaging the registrant's
facilities, the city shall notify the local representative as early as is
reasonably possible. The city costs associated therewith will be billed to that
registrant and must be paid within thirty (30) days from the date of billing.
Each registrant shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any facilities
in the right of way which it or its facilities damage. (Ord. 1174, 4-28-2008)
7-3-22: VACATION OF RIGHT OF WAY:
   A.    Reservation Of Right: If the city vacates a right of way which
contains the equipment of a registrant, and if the vacation does not require
the relocation of registrant facilities and equipment, the city shall reserve,
to and for itself and all registrants having facilities and equipment in the
vacated right of way, the right to install, maintain and operate any facilities
and equipment in the vacated right of way and to enter upon such right of way
at any time for the purpose of reconstruction, inspecting, maintaining or
repairing the same.
   B.    Relocation Of Equipment: If the vacation requires the relocation of
registrant facilities and equipment, and: 1) if the vacation proceedings are
initiated by the registrant, the registrant must pay the relocation costs; or
2) if the vacation proceedings are initiated by the city, the registrant must
pay the relocation costs unless otherwise agreed to by the city and the
registrant; or 3) if the vacation proceedings are initiated by a person or
persons other than the registrant or permit holder, such other person or
persons must pay the relocation costs. (Ord. 1174, 4-28-2008)
7-3-23: INDEMNIFICATION AND LIABILITY:
By registering with the city, or by accepting a permit under this chapter, a
registrant or permittee agrees to defend and indemnify the city in accordance
with the provisions of Minnesota rules 7819.1250. (Ord. 1174, 4-28-2008)
7-3-24: ABANDONED FACILITIES:
   A.    Discontinued Operations: A registrant who has decided to discontinue
all or a portion of its operations in the city must provide information
satisfactory to the city that the registrant's obligations for its facilities
in the right of way under this chapter have been lawfully assumed by another
registrant.
   B.    Removal: Any registrant who has abandoned facilities in any right of
way shall remove them from that right of way pursuant to Minnesota rules
7819.3300, unless the requirement is waived by the director. A facility is not
abandoned unless declared so by the operator. (Ord. 1174, 4-28-2008)
7-3-25: APPEALS:
A right of way user that: a) has been denied registration; b) has been denied a
permit; c) has had a permit revoked; d) believes that the fees imposed are not
in conformity with Minnesota statutes section 237.163, subdivision 6; or e)
disputes a determination of the director regarding subsection
7-3-17B of this chapter may have the denial, revocation, fee imposition, or
decision reviewed, upon written request, by the city council. The city council
shall act on a timely written request at its next regularly scheduled meeting.
A decision by the city council affirming the denial, revocation, or fee
imposition will be in writing and supported by written findings establishing
the reasonableness of the decision. (Ord. 1174, 4-28-2008)
7-3-26: RESERVATION OF REGULATORY AND POLICE POWERS:
A permittee's or registrant's rights are subject to the regulatory and police
powers of the city to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to protect
the health, safety and welfare of the public. (Ord. 1174, 4-28-2008)
7-3-27: SEVERABILITY:
If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this
chapter is, for any reason, held invalid or unconstitutional by any court or
administrative agency of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a
separate, distinct, and independent provision, and such holding shall not
affect the validity of the remaining portions hereof. If a regulatory body or a
court of competent jurisdiction should determine, by a final, nonappealable
order, that any permit, right or registration issued under this chapter or any
portions of this chapter is illegal or unenforceable, then any such permit,
right or registration granted or deemed to exist hereunder shall be considered
as a revocable permit with a mutual right in either party to terminate without
cause upon giving sixty (60) days' written notice to the other. The
requirements and conditions of such a revocable permit shall be the same
requirements and conditions as set forth in the permit, right or registration,
respectively, except for conditions relating to the term of the permit and the
right of termination. Nothing in this chapter precludes the city from requiring
a franchise agreement with the applicant, as allowed by law, in addition to
requirements set forth herein. (Ord. 1174, 4-28-2008)

   B.    Approval: The size of water service connections and meters shall be
subject to approval of the inspection department. (1974 Code § 705.27)
   C.    Permit Required: No connection to the water system may be made without
a permit issued by the inspection department or the council. (1974 Code §
705.29)
   D.    Fees:
      1.    Basis Of Fees:
         a.    The water system, as constructed to date, heretofore has been
financed and paid for primarily through a combination of special assessments
levied against benefited property and connection charges. Such financing
methods were appropriate to the circumstances at the time they were used, may
be appropriate in certain circumstance in the future. However, the city has
determined that it is now necessary and desirable to amend and refine the
method of recovering some or all of the future costs of constructing,
operating, maintaining and improving the water system through the imposition of
charges as provided in this chapter.
         b.    In imposing fees and charges, it is necessary to establish a
methodology that undertakes to make them just and equitable. Taking into
account the status of completion of the water system in portions of the city,
past methods of recovering water system costs, and the factors set forth in the
utilities act, it is determined that it would be just and equitable to assign
responsibility for the future costs of constructing, operating, maintaining and
improving the water system primarily based on the methodology described in this
chapter.
         c.    The city has further determined that the water system has yet to
be constructed in the northwest area, and it is just and equitable to impose
charges for construction, maintenance and operation of the water system on a
different basis in the northwest area compared to the balance of the city where
portions of the water system have been financed through special assessments.
         d.    Assigning costs and making charges for the water system in both
the northwest area and the balance of the city cannot be done with mathematical
precision but can only be accomplished within reasonable and practical limits
based upon analysis of the factors described in this chapter.
         e.    To ensure that charges for the water system are just and
equitable, the city has further determined to impose fees for connection to the
city water utility system to pay for the construction, reconstruction, repair,
enlargement, improvement, or other obtainment, the maintenance, operation and
use of the facilities, and of obtaining and complying with permits required by
law. The fee to be charged for a connection to the water system shall be used
for defraying the cost to the city of the following:
            (1)    The cost to the city for making any and all necessary
inspections of such connection.
            (2)    The cost to the city for repair of any street or roadway
caused by or resulting from such connection.
            (3)    The cost to the city for the installation of the service
line running from the main to the stop box and the cost of installing the stop
box.
            (4)    The charge on a proportionate basis of the cost to the city
of acquiring the core facilities of the city water system determined on a
uniform and nondiscriminatory basis allocated on the basis of water consumed
(including by reference to the size of water system facilities serving the
subject property), by reference to a reasonable classification of the types of
premises to which water service is furnished (including classifications based
on the expected density of such premises), on an SAC unit basis (including by
reference to density of such units), or any other equitable basis including a
combination of the foregoing equitable basis. "Core facilities" as that term is
used herein shall be deemed to include the wells, water towers, water mains and
water trunk lines of or for the water system, and costs of core facilities
include debt service and related financing costs in connection with obligations
issued by the city to finance such improvements, depreciation, a reasonable
reserve for capital replacement, and the costs of obtaining and complying with
permits required by law.
            (5)    The city has further determined that it is fair and
equitable, in light of the city's long term and ongoing costs of acquisition,
maintenance and repair of the water system, to impose connection fees payable
in part at the time property is platted or building permits are issued,
whichever occurs first, and in part payable at the time when building permits
are issued or when connection is made to the water system, whichever occurs
first, and further that fees payable in the northwest area compared to the
balance of the city may take into consideration the additional costs of
installing the water system in the northwest area.
      2.    Fees, Amounts: Water system connection fees, including the timing
and manner of payment, shall be specified in section
3-4-2-2 of this code. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this chapter,
such connection fees are in addition to and separate from rates for the use of
water imposed under subsection
8-2-10A of this chapter.
      3.    Relationship To Special Assessments: Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this chapter, the city may determine that it is just and
equitable to finance the capital costs of water system improvements in the
northwest area or elsewhere in the city through special assessments under
Minnesota statutes, chapter 429, provided that the city reasonably determines
that the capital costs so financed are not otherwise financed from connection
fees collected under this chapter. (Ord. 1154, 6-11-2007)
   E.    Notice And Time For Connections:
      1.    The plumber installing the connection or the owner or occupant of
the property requesting the connection shall notify the inspection department
within twenty four (24) hours after piping is completed and ready for meter
installation, giving street address and permit number. (1974 Code § 705.27)
      2.    If, for any cause, the plumber or contractor laying the service
pipe should fail to have the connection made at the time specified in his
application, notice must be given the inspection department fixing another day
on which he wishes to make connection. The notice must be given at least two
(2) days previous to the excavation for laying of the service pipe, and the

occupancy and located on property adjacent to a public sanitary sewer main, or
in a block through or to which the public sanitary sewer system extends, shall
be connected to the city sanitary sewer system as follows:
         a.   Properties without compliant subsurface sewage treatment systems
(SSTS) shall be connected to the public sanitary sewer system as follows:
            (1)   Systems posing an imminent threat to public health and safety
shall connect to the public sanitary sewer system within thirty (30) days of
issuance of a Notice of Noncompliance to the owner of the property where the
noncompliant SSTS is located.
            (2)   Systems that have been identified as failing to protect
groundwater shall connect to the public sanitary sewer system within ten (10)
months of issuance of a Notice of Noncompliance to the owner of the property
where the noncompliant SSTS is located.
         b.   Properties with compliant SSTS systems at the time the public
sanitary sewer system becomes available are not required to connect to the
public sanitary sewer system until such time as the existing SSTS becomes
noncompliant. The City will not issue a permit or otherwise authorize the
repair or replacement of an SSTS that becomes noncompliant if the property
where the SSTS is located has access to the public sanitary sewer system.
Property owners will have until the end of the calendar year after the SSTS
becomes noncompliant to connect to the public sanitary sewer system, unless the
SSTS is subsequently issued a Notice of Noncompliance for failing to protect
groundwater or as an imminent threat to public health and safety, in which case
the property shall connect to the public sanitary sewer system as outlined in
Section
8-4-4 A.1.a.
      2.   The Building Official may require a compliance inspection on an
existing SSTS where extension of the public sanitary sewer system enables
connection of the property or any building on the property to the system to
determine compliance of the SSTS with all applicable SSTS standards.
      3.   For purposes of this Section, a compliant SSTS shall mean an SSTS
that is in compliance with all state, county, and City statutes, rules and
regulations for SSTS. A noncompliant SSTS means an SSTS that is not in
compliance with all applicable state, county, and City statutes, rules, and
regulations for SSTS.
      4.   New Buildings: All buildings hereafter constructed within the city
on property adjacent to a public sewer main, or in a block through or to which
the public sanitary sewer system extends, shall be connected to the city
sanitary sewer system for the disposal of all human wastes.
   B.   Connections From Outside City Limits: No buildings located on property
lying outside the limits of the city shall be connected to the sanitary sewer
system unless express authorization therefor is obtained from the council.
   C.   Use Of Cesspools And Septic Tanks Discontinued: When connection is made
to the sewer system, all cesspools and septic tanks situated upon the property
served by said sewer connection must be pumped and filled. If the sewer
connection passes over such cesspools or septic tanks, cast iron, ductile iron,
or gasketed PVC pipe must be used to bridge such span.
   D.   Permit To Construct: No person shall proceed with the construction,
enlargement, alteration, or repair, or make any type of connection to the city
sanitary sewer system except upon making an application therefor on a form
provided by the city and receiving a permit issued by the city for such
purposes.
   E.   Specifications:
      1.   Materials: The building sewer shall be constructed of either
vitrified clay sewer pipe and fittings meeting the current ASTM specifications
for standard or extra strength clay sewer pipe, or cast iron soil pipe and
fittings, or plastic pipe and fittings meeting the requirements of the building
code. If installed in filled or unstable ground, the building sewer shall be of
cast iron soil pipe, except that vitrified clay pipe may be accepted if laid on
a suitable improved bed or cradle as approved by the inspector.
      2.   Joints And Connections: All joints and connections shall be made
gastight and watertight. Vitrified clay sewer pipe shall be fitted with factory
made resilient compression joints meeting ASTM "Specifications For Vitrified
Clay Pipe Joints Having Resilient Properties" (designation C425). Before
joining the pipe in the trench, the bell and spigot surfaces shall be wiped
free of dirt or other foreign matter. A lubricant or sealer, as recommended by
the pipe manufacturer, shall be applied to the bell and spigot mating surfaces
just before they are joined together. The spigot end shall be positioned into
the bell end of the pipe previously laid and shall then be shoved home to
compress the joint and to assure a tight fit between the interfaces. Joints for
cast iron soil pipe shall be made by inserting a roll of hemp or jute and
thoroughly caulking into place and then following with pure molten lead, well
caulked, not less than one inch (1") deep. No paint, varnish or putty will be
allowed in the joints until they have been tested and approved.
      3.   Size And Slope: The size and slope of the building sewers shall be
subject to the approval of the plumbing inspector, but in no event shall the
diameter be less than four inches (4"). The slope of such four inch (4") pipe
shall not be less than one-eighth inch (1/8") per foot. A slope of one-fourth
inch (1/4") per foot shall be used wherever practical.
      4.   Elevation; Excavations: Whenever possible, the building sewer shall
be brought to the building at an elevation below the basement floor. The depth
shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost. All excavations required
for the installation of a building sewer shall be open trench work unless
otherwise approved by the inspector. Pipe laying and backfill shall be
performed in accordance with the ASTM specification (designation C12), except
that no backfill shall be placed until the work has been inspected by the
plumbing inspector or his representative.
      5.   Lifts: In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to
permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such drains
shall be lifted by approved artificial means and discharged to the building
sewer. No water operated sewage ejector shall be used.
      6.   Location Of Connection, Excavation And Pipe
         a.   The connection of the building sewer into the sanitary sewer
system shall be made at the wye branch designated for that property. The sewer
stub at the street right of way, or wye, shall be located prior to any
extension of the building sewer. The trench for the house connection shall be
dug in a straight line from the wye connection in the street to the structure.
         b.   Any connection made to the sanitary sewer at other than an
existing wye branch shall be as directed by the director of public works or his
authorized representative.
   F.   Excavation Work: All connections or installation work or repair of
connections to the sewer systems including grades, bends and backfilling shall
be performed under the direction and supervision of the plumbing inspector and
only by persons duly licensed by the city to perform such work. No such work
shall be covered or backfilled until directed by the inspector. All such work
and excavations shall be protected by barricades and warning markers and lights
reasonable and suitable to the purpose. All street excavations shall be filled
and compacted as directed by the plumbing inspector.
   G.   Inspections: The plumbing inspector shall examine all applications
before construction is begun, and after the construction, enlargement,
alteration, repair or connection is complete, the plumbing inspector shall be
notified. It shall be unlawful to cover any connecting line until an inspection
has been made and such connection and the work incident thereto has been
approved by the city as a proper and suitable connection. (1974 Code §§ 710.03,
710.05, 710.07, 710.11, 710.17, 710.19, and 710.23; amd. Ord. 1476, 4-8-2024)
8-4-5: FEES:
   A.    Basis Of Fees:
      1.    The sanitary sewer system, as constructed to date, heretofore has
been financed and paid for primarily through a combination of special
assessments levied against benefited property and connection charges. Such
financing methods were appropriate to the circumstances at the time they were
used, may be appropriate in certain circumstance in the future. However, the
city has determined that it is now necessary and desirable to amend and refine
the method of recovering some or all of the future costs of constructing,
operating, maintaining and improving the sanitary sewer system through the
imposition of charges as provided in this chapter.
      2.    In imposing fees and charges, it is necessary to establish a
methodology that undertakes to make them just and equitable. Taking into
account the status of completion of the sanitary sewer system in portions of
the city, past methods of recovering sanitary sewer system costs, and the
factors set forth in the utilities act, it is determined that it would be just
and equitable to assign responsibility for the future costs of constructing,
operating, maintaining and improving the sanitary sewer system primarily based
on the methodology described in this chapter.
      3.    The city has further determined that the sanitary sewer system has
yet to be constructed in the northwest area, and it is just and equitable to
impose charges for construction, maintenance and operation of the sanitary
sewer system on a different basis in the northwest area compared to the balance
of the city where portions of the sanitary sewer system have been financed
through special assessments.
      4.    Assigning costs and making charges for the sanitary sewer system in
both the northwest area and the balance of the city cannot be done with
mathematical precision but can only be accomplished within reasonable and
practical limits based upon analysis of the factors described in this chapter.
      5.    To ensure that charges for the sanitary sewer system are just and
equitable, the city has further determined to impose fees for connection to the
city sanitary sewer utility system to pay for the construction, reconstruction,
repair, enlargement, improvement, or other obtainment, the maintenance,
operation and use of the facilities, and of obtaining and complying with
permits required by law. The fee to be charged for a connection to the sanitary
sewer system shall be used for defraying the cost to the city of the following:
         a.    The cost to the city for making any and all necessary
inspections of such connection.
         b.    The cost to the city for repair of any street or roadway caused
by or resulting from such connection.
         c.    The cost to the city for the installation of the service line
running from the main to the "wye" branch in accordance with subsection
8-4-4E of this chapter.
         d.    The charge on a proportionate basis of the cost to the city of
acquiring the core facilities of the city sanitary sewer system determined on a
uniform and nondiscriminatory basis allocated on the basis of water consumed,
by reference to a reasonable classification of the types of premises to which
sanitary sewer service is furnished (including classifications based on the
expected density of such premises), on an SAC unit basis (including by
reference to the density of such units), by reference to the quantity,
pollution qualities and difficulty of disposal of sewage produced (including by
reference to the size of sanitary sewer service facilities serving the subject
property), or any other equitable basis including a combination of the
foregoing equitable basis, but excluding an allocation by reference to the
square footage of the property charged (except to the extent square footage is
relevant to calculation of the density of premises and/or SAC units to be
served). "Core facilities" as that term is used herein shall be deemed to
include all mains, trunk lines and lift stations of or for the sanitary sewer
system, and costs of core facilities include debt service and related financing
costs in connection with obligations issued by the city to finance such
improvements, depreciation, a reasonable reserve for capital replacement, and
the costs of obtaining and complying with permits required by law.
      6.    The city has further determined that it is fair and equitable, in
light of the city's long term and ongoing costs of acquisition, maintenance and
repair of the sanitary sewer system, to impose connection fees payable in part
at the time property is platted or building permits are issued, whichever
occurs first, and in part payable at the time when building permits are issued
or when connection is made to the sanitary sewer system, whichever occurs
first, and further that fees payable in the northwest area compared to the
balance of the city may take into consideration the additional costs of
installing the sanitary sewer system in the northwest area.
   B.    Fees, Amounts: Sanitary sewer connection fees, including the timing
and manner of payment, shall be specified in section
3-4-2-2 of this code. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this chapter,
such connection fees are in addition to and separate from rates for the use of
the sanitary sewer system imposed under section
8-4-6 of this chapter.
   C.    Relationship To Special Assessments: Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this chapter, the city may determine that it is just and equitable
to finance the capital costs of sanitary sewer system improvements in the
northwest area or elsewhere in the city through special assessments under
Minnesota statutes, chapter 429, provided that the city reasonably determines
that the capital costs so financed are not otherwise financed from connection
fees collected under this chapter. (Ord. 1154, 6-11-2007)
8-4-6: SEWER RATES:
The rates to be charged for sewer rental shall be determined from time to time
by resolution of the city council. (1974 Code § 710.27)
8-4-7: PROHIBITED DISCHARGES INTO SYSTEM:
   A.    It shall be unlawful to discharge or cause to be discharged into the
sewer system, either directly or indirectly, any roof, storm, surface or ground
water of any type or kind, or water discharged from any air conditioning unit
or system. (1974 Code § 710.13)
   B.    No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged to any city sewer
any harmful waters or wastes, whether liquid, solid or gas, capable of causing
obstruction to the flow in sewers, damage or hazard to structures, equipment
and personnel of the sewage works, or other interference with the proper
operation of the sewage works. (1974 Code § 710.25)
8-4-8: HARMFUL WASTES; PRELIMINARY TREATMENT:
The admission into the sewer system of any waters or wastes having harmful or
objectionable characteristics shall be subject to the review and approval of
the director of public works, who may prescribe limits on the strength and
character of these waters and wastes. Where necessary, in the opinion of the
director, the owner shall provide, at his expense, such preliminary treatment
as may be necessary to treat these wastes prior to discharge to the city sewer
system. Plans, specifications, and any other pertinent information relating to
proposed preliminary treatment facilities shall be submitted for the approval
of the director and of the state commissioner of health, and no construction of
such facilities shall be commenced until approval is obtained in writing. Where
preliminary treatment facilities are provided for any waters or wastes, they
shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the
owner at his expense. (1974 Code § 710.25; amd. 2008 Code)
8-4-9: INDUSTRIAL WASTES:
When required by the superintendent, the owner of any property served by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install and maintain at his
expense a suitable control manhole in the building sewer to facilitate
observation, sampling and measurement of the wastes. All measurements, tests,
and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes shall be determined in
accordance with "Standard Methods For The Examination Of Water And Sewage", and
shall be determined at the control manhole or upon suitable samples taken at
said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been required,
the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in
the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. (1974
Code § 710.25)
8-4-10: INTERCEPTORS:
Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of
the plumbing inspector, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid
wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand,
and other harmful ingredients, except that such interceptors shall not be
required for private living quarters or dwelling units. Where installed, they
shall be maintained by the owner at his expense, in continuously efficient
operation at all times. (1974 Code § 710.25)
8-4-11: RIGHT OF INSPECTION:
The city, by any authorized employee or agent, shall have the right at all
reasonable times to enter and be admitted to any lands and property in the city
for the purpose of making inspection of materials, making meter readings, and
making inspections of plumbing work and fixtures of all kinds used by or in
connection with the sewer systems. (1974 Code § 710.11)
8-4-12: DAMAGE TO, TAMPERING WITH SYSTEM:
No person shall maliciously, wilfully, or negligently break, damage, destroy,
uncover, deface or tamper with any structure, appurtenance or equipment which
is a part of the sewer system. (1974 Code § 710.15)
8-4-13: IMPLIED CONSENT TO REGULATIONS:
Every person applying for sewer service, every owner of property for which any
such application is made, every person accepting sewer service and every owner
of property where such service is accepted subsequent to the effective date
hereof shall be deemed, upon making such application or accepting such service,
to consent to all rules, regulations, and rates as established by this chapter
and as may hereafter be set forth and adopted by the council by resolution or
ordinance, and further shall be deemed to agree to indemnify and hold the city
harmless from any claim, damage (including, but not limited to, any damages or
repairs incurred or occasioned with respect to any streets, alleys, sidewalks,
curbs or gutters), injury or loss caused by or in any way arising by reason of
or related to their connection to or repair of their connection to the city
sewer system, including, but not limited to, excavation work in connection
therewith. (1974 Code § 710.09)
8-4-14: MARINA SANITARY PUMP OUT FACILITY REGULATIONS 1 :
All marinas, either public or private, shall provide a sanitary pump out
facility for the disposal of waste accumulating in boats either docked at the
marina or for the general boating public subject to the following conditions:
   A.    Pump out facilities and holding tanks connected to city sewer shall
conform to the following:

by washing the screen waste into the septic tank or, if rinse water is not
available, exchanged with a clean effluent screen. (Ord. 1219, 10-25-2010)
8-5-6-3: COMPLIANCE CRITERIA FOR EXISTING SSTS:
   A.    SSTS built before April 1, 1996, outside of areas designated as
shoreland areas, wellhead protection areas, or SSTS providing sewage treatment
for food, beverage, or lodging establishments must have at least two feet (2')
of vertical separation between the bottom of the dispersal system and seasonal
saturation or bedrock. The vertical separation measurement shall be made
outside the area of system influence in an area of similar soil. (Minnesota
rules 7082.0100, subpart 1(D))
   B.    SSTS built after March 31, 1996, or SSTS located in a shoreland area,
wellhead protection area, or serving a food, beverage, or lodging establishment
as defined under Minnesota rules 7080.1100, subpart 84 must have a three foot
(3') vertical separation between the bottom soil infiltrative surface and the
periodically saturated soil and/or bedrock. Unless otherwise determined by the
department, existing systems that have no more than a fifteen percent (15%)
reduction to the minimum required thirty six inch (36") separation distance are
considered compliant (i.e., a separation distance no less than 30.6 inches).
This reduction is to account for settling of sand or soil, normal variation of
separation distance measurements and interpretation of limiting layer
characteristics. The vertical separation measurement shall be made outside the
area of system influence in an area of similar soil. (Ord. 1219, 10-25-2010)

a valid operational permit for such a system that was issued prior to the
adoption of this chapter, then the expiration date of the operational permit
shall be the deadline for obtaining an initial operating permit.
   L.    Suspension Or Revocation: The department may suspend or revoke any
operating permit issued under this section for any false statements,
misrepresentations of facts on which the operating permit was issued, or
violation of this chapter, or noncompliance with permit conditions, or system
that is found to be an imminent threat to the environment or to the public
health, safety or welfare. A notice of suspension or revocation and the reasons
for the suspension or revocation shall be conveyed in writing to the owner
pursuant to section
8-5-11-7 of this chapter. If suspended or revoked, the department may require
that the treatment system be removed from service, operated as a holding tank,
or abandoned in accordance with section

8-5-9: COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT:
8-5-9-1: RESERVED:
(Ord. 1219, 10-25-2010)
8-5-9-2: COMPLIANCE INSPECTION PROGRAM:
(Minnesota rules 7082.0700)
   A.    Department Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the department,
or its agent, to perform various SSTS compliance inspections periodically to
assure that the requirements of this chapter are met.
      1.    SSTS compliance inspections must be performed:
         a.    To ensure compliance with applicable requirements;
         b.    For all new SSTS construction or replacement; and
         c.    For an evaluation, investigation, inspection, recommendation, or
other process used to prepare a disclosure statement if conducted by a party
who is not the SSTS owner. Such an inspection constitutes a compliance
inspection and shall be conducted in accordance with Minnesota rules 7082.0700
using the SSTS inspection report forms provided by the MPCA.
      2.    All compliance inspections must be performed and signed by licensed
inspection businesses or qualified employees certified as inspectors.
      3.    The department shall be given access to enter a property at any
reasonable time to inspect and/or monitor the SSTS system. As used in this
paragraph, "property" does not include a residence or private building.
      4.    No person shall hinder or otherwise interfere with the department's
employees or agents in the performance of their duties and responsibilities
pursuant to this chapter. Refusal to allow reasonable access to the property by
the department or its agent shall be deemed a violation of this chapter.
   B.    New Construction Or Replacement:
      1.    Compliance inspections must be performed on new or replacement SSTS
to determine compliance with Minnesota rules chapters 7080 or 7081. SSTS found
to be noncompliant with other applicable requirements must be repaired or
replaced according to the department's requirements.
      2.    It is the duty of the permit holder or agent of the permit holder
to notify the department at least one working day prior to any required
inspection of work authorized by the construction permit. The work shall remain
accessible and exposed until inspected and approved by the department.
Inspections are required:
         a.    After ground surface preparation for a mound system, but prior
to placing sand fill;
         b.    After all tanks, distribution media, piping, equipment and
devices are in place, but prior to backfill;
         c.    For building sewer inspection and testing in accordance with
Minnesota rules, parts 4715.2800 and 4715.2820;
         d.    Final inspection after all work is complete including final
grading and erosion protection; and
         e.    As may otherwise be required by the department to ascertain
compliance with the provisions of this chapter and other laws enforced by the
department.
      3.    A certificate of compliance for new SSTS construction or
replacement shall be issued by the department if the department has reasonable
assurance that the SSTS was built in accordance with the applicable
requirements as specified in the construction permit.
      4.    The department, upon notification, shall make the requested
inspections and shall either indicate the portion of the work that is
satisfactory as completed, or notify the permit holder or the agent of the
permit holder wherein the same fails to comply with this chapter.
      5.    No SSTS may be placed into operation until a valid certificate of
compliance has been issued.
      6.    Certificates of compliance for new construction or replacement
shall remain valid for five (5) years from the date of issue unless the
department finds evidence of an imminent threat to public health or safety
requiring removal and abatement under Minnesota statutes section 145A.04,
subdivision 8.
   C.    Existing Systems:
      1.    Compliance inspections shall be required when any of the following
conditions occur:
         a.    When a construction permit is required to repair, modify, or
upgrade an existing system;
         b.    Anytime there is an expansion of use of the building being
served by an existing SSTS which may impact the performance of the system;
         c.    Anytime there is a change in the use of the property being
served by an existing SSTS which may impact the performance of the system;
         d.    When an operating permit is to be renewed;
         e.    Prior to the sale or transfer of real property served by an
existing SSTS if required by subsection D1a of this section;
         f.    During systematic shoreland or area wide SSTS surveys by the
department;
         g.    At any time as required by this chapter or the department deems
appropriate such as upon receipt of a complaint or other notice of system
malfunction; and
         h.    Prior to the issuance of a building permit or variance for a
bedroom addition on property served by an existing system; unless temporarily
waived by the department for a bedroom addition permit for which the
application is filed during the period from November 1 to April 30, provided a
compliance inspection is performed by the following June 1 and the applicant
submits a certificate of compliance by the following September 30. (Ord. 1219,
10-25-2010)
      2.    Compliance inspections of existing SSTS shall be reported on the
inspection report forms provided by the MPCA. An inspection for existing SSTS
must verify the conditions in subsections C2a through C2c of this section.
(Ord. 1262, 4-8-2013)
         a.    Sewage tanks must be assessed for leakage below the operating
depth. A leakage report must be completed that includes the method(s) used to
make the assessment. The assessment must be made by a licensed SSTS business
(except a design business) hired by the system owner. A passing report is valid
for three (3) years unless the certified individual has reason to believe that
a new inspection is to be conducted and the tank is found not to be watertight.
         b.    The vertical separation distance from the bottom of the soil
treatment and dispersal system and the periodically saturated soil or bedrock.
This verification must be achieved by either conducting soil borings or by
prior verifications by two (2) independent parties. The soil borings used for
system design or previous inspections qualifies as a verification. A vertical
separation distance report must be completed that includes the method(s) used
to make the assessment and includes any previous soil borings. The assessment
must be made by a licensed SSTS business hired by the system owner. If the
verification separation report consists of verifications by two (2) independent
parties, a subsequent verification is not required unless the inspector has
reason to believe a noncompliant condition exists.
If a documented discrepancy arises on the depth of the periodically saturated
soil between licensed businesses or between a licensed business and the
department for SSTS compliance purposes, all disputing parties must follow the
dispute resolution procedure described in Minnesota rules 7082.0700, subpart 5.
(Minnesota rules 7082.0100, subpart 3(N))
         c.    Sewage backup, surface seeping or surface discharge from the
system must be determined. A hydraulic function report must be completed that
includes the method(s) used to make the assessment. The assessment must be made
by a licensed inspection business hired by the system owner. A passing report
is valid until a new inspection is requested or if the hydraulic performance is
believed to have changed.
      3.    A certificate of compliance shall be based on the results of the
verifications in subsection C2 of this section. The certificate of compliance
must include a certified statement by a licensed inspection business whether
the SSTS is in compliance with the chapter requirements. If the SSTS is
determined not to be in compliance with the applicable requirements, a notice
of noncompliance must include a statement specifying those chapter provisions
with which the SSTS does not comply. A construction permit application must be
submitted to the department if the required corrective action is not a minor
repair.
      4.    The certificate of compliance or notice of noncompliance must be
submitted to the department and the property owner or owner's agent no later
than fifteen (15) calendar days after the date the inspection was performed.
The department shall deliver the certificate of compliance or notice of
noncompliance to the owner or the owner's agent within fifteen (15) calendar
days of receipt from the licensed inspection business.
      5.    Certificates of compliance for existing SSTS shall remain valid for
three (3) years from the date of issue unless the department finds evidence of
an imminent threat to public safety requiring removal and abatement under
Minnesota statutes section 145A.04, subdivision 8.
      6.    The department may waive a compliance inspection required by
subsection C1 of this section if:
         a.    The owner of the real property served by an existing SSTS
acknowledges in writing to the department that the existing SSTS is failing and
shall be upgraded, repaired, replaced or abandoned in accordance with this
chapter within ten (10) months; or
         b.    The owner of the real property served by an existing SSTS
acknowledges in writing to the department that the existing SSTS is an imminent
threat to public health or safety and shall be upgraded, repaired, replaced or
abandoned in accordance with this chapter within thirty (30) days.
   D.    Property Transfer/Sale Requirements:
      1.    No owner or other person acting with legal authority on behalf of
an owner of real property served by an existing SSTS may sell or transfer to
another party said real property unless the following requirements are met:
         a.    A compliance inspection has been performed and a certificate of
compliance has been issued for the SSTS within three (3) years if the SSTS is
older than five (5) years or within five (5) years if the SSTS is less than
five (5) years old prior to the intended date of sale or transfer of the real
property, unless evidence is found identifying an imminent threat to public
health and safety. If this requirement cannot be met, a compliance inspection
must be conducted in accordance with subsection C of this section.
         b.    The compliance inspection must have been performed following the
procedures described in subsection C of this section by the licensed inspection
business hired by the system owner.
         c.    The seller/transferor of the real property must provide the
disclosure required by Minnesota statutes section 115.55, subdivision 6.
         d.    If the seller/transferor fails to provide a certificate of
compliance, the seller/transferor shall provide the buyer/transferee sufficient
security in the form of an escrow agreement to assure the installation of a
complying SSTS. The security shall be placed in an escrow with a licensed real
estate closer, licensed attorney, or federal or state chartered financial
institution. The amount escrowed shall be equal to one hundred twenty five
percent (125%) of a written estimate to install a complying SSTS provided by a
licensed and certified installer, or the amount escrowed shall be equal to one
hundred ten percent (110%) of the written contract price for the installation
of a complying SSTS provided by a licensed and certified installer. After a
complying SSTS has been installed and a certificate of compliance issued, the
seller/transferor or the buyer/transferee shall provide the escrow agent a copy
of the certificate of compliance.
      2.    The compliance portion of the certificate of compliance need not be
completed if the sale or transfer involves the following circumstances:
         a.    The affected real property is without buildings or contains no
dwellings or other buildings with plumbing fixtures.
         b.    The transfer is a tax forfeiture.
         c.    The sale or transfer completes a contract for deed or purchase
agreement entered into prior to the effective date of this chapter. This
subsection applies only to the original vendor and vendee on such contract.
      3.    All real property sales or transfers subject to this chapter
occurring during the period between November 15 and April 15 when SSTS
compliance cannot be determined due to frozen soil conditions shall require a
winter agreement, which includes an application for an SSTS permit and an
agreement to complete a compliance inspection by the following June 1 by a
licensed inspection business. If upon inspection the SSTS is found to be in
compliance, the permit fee will be refunded. If upon inspection the system is
found to be noncompliant, an escrow agreement must be established in accordance
with subsection D1d of this section and the system upgraded.
      4.    The responsibility for filing the completed compliance portion of
the certificate of compliance under subsection D1 of this section or for
upgrading a system found to be noncompliant shall be determined by the seller/
transferor and the buyer/transferee. The seller/transferor and the buyer/
transferee shall provide the department with a signed statement indicating
responsibility for completing the compliance portion of the certificate of
compliance and for upgrading a system found to be noncompliant.
      5.    The issuance of permits, certificates of compliance or notices of
noncompliance as requested or issued shall not be construed to represent a
guarantee or warranty of the system's operation or effectiveness. Such
certificates signify that the system in question is or has been designed and
installed in compliance or noncompliance with the provisions of this chapter.
   E.    Conflict Of Interest: A licensed inspection business that inspects an
existing SSTS is allowed to subsequently design and install a new SSTS for that
property provided the inspection business is also licensed to design and
install. A licensed inspection business working on behalf of a municipality
must not design or install a system if there is likelihood that the inspector
or business will be responsible for permitting or inspecting the system or
system site. A person working for or on behalf of a municipality shall not use
the person's position to solicit for private business gain. (Minnesota rules
7082.0700, subpart 2(B)) (Ord. 1219, 10-25-2010)

         c.    Notice that if the property owner fails to abate the public
health nuisance within the specified time frame, the department or its agent
intends to enter the property and commence abatement of the public health
nuisance and assess the costs of inspection and abatement against the real
property on which the nuisance is located.
      2.    Service: The abatement notice must be served on a property owner by
certified mail or personal service. Service by certified mail shall be deemed
complete upon mailing. If the property owner is unknown or absent and has no
known representative upon whom notice can be served, the department shall post
a written or printed notice in a conspicuous place on the property stating
that, unless the public health nuisance is abated within a period not longer
than ten (10) days, the department will have the nuisance abated at the expense

failure to abate the nuisance within the time limit stated in subsection A of
this section shall authorize the department to the nuisance abated. The city
may then charge all costs of abatement to the property owner and bill the
property owner directly for such costs. If the owner does not pay the bill the
costs due may be assessed. Failure by the property owner to abate the nuisance
within the time period specified in subsection A of this section is a violation
of this chapter and shall be punishable as a misdemeanor.
      3.    Record Of Costs: The department shall keep a record of the costs of
abatements done under this chapter and shall report monthly to the finance
department and clerk all work done for which billings and assessments are to be
made stating and certifying the description of the land, lots, and parcels
involved and the amount chargeable to each.
      4.    Assessment Of Costs: On or before September 1 of each year, the

The purpose and intent of this article is to implement fully the promulgated
authority granted to the city by virtue of laws of Minnesota for 1984, chapter
644, section 47, whereby the city is authorized to impose a fee on operators of
mixed municipal solid waste facilities for solid waste accepted and disposed of
on land within the city. (1974 Code § 1130.01)
8-6A-2: DEFINITIONS:
The terms and phrases used throughout this article are defined in Minnesota
statutes chapters 115A, 116, 290, and 473, or the rules of the Minnesota
pollution control agency, and shall have the meanings described therein, except
where the context clearly indicates a different meaning. As used in this
article, the terms defined in this section have the meanings given them:
MIXED MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE: Garbage, refuse, and other solid waste from
residential, commercial, industrial, and community activities, which is
generated and collected in aggregate, but does not include auto hulks, street
sweepings, ash, construction debris, mining waste, sludges, tree and
agricultural waste, tires and other materials collected, processed and disposed
of as separate waste streams.
MIXED MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL FACILITY: A waste facility used for the
disposal of mixed municipal solid waste.
OPERATOR: A. The permittee of a mixed municipal solid waste disposal facility
that has a pollution control agency permit; or
   B.    The person in control of a mixed municipal solid waste disposal
facility that does not have a pollution control agency permit.
SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL FACILITY: A waste facility which is used for the disposal
of solid waste. (1974 Code § 1130.03)
8-6A-3: FEE ESTABLISHED; EXEMPTIONS:
The operator of a mixed municipal solid waste disposal facility located within
the city shall pay to the city a fee on solid waste accepted and disposed of on
land at the facility as follows:
   A.    A facility that weighs the waste that it accepts must pay a fee of one
dollar ($1.00) per cubic yard based on the equivalent cubic yards of waste
accepted at the entrance of the facility.
   B.    A facility that does not weigh the waste but that measures the volume
of the waste that it accepts must pay a fee of one dollar ($1.00) per cubic
yard of waste accepted at the entrance of the facility.
   C.    Waste residue from recycling facilities at which recyclable materials
are separated or processed for the purpose of recycling, or from energy and
resource recovery facilities at which solid waste is processed for purpose of
extracting, reducing, converting to energy, or otherwise separating and
preparing solid waste for reuse is exempt from the fee imposed by this section
if there is at least an eighty five percent (85%) volume reduction in the solid
waste processed. To qualify for exemption under this subsection, waste residue
must be brought to a disposal facility separately. Before any fee is reduced
under this subsection, the operator must meet the prescribed procedures for
determining the amount of waste residue qualifying for exemption in accord with
the procedures set by the Minnesota commissioner of revenue, and the operator
must have submitted to the city the qualifying exemption issued by the
Minnesota department of revenue. For purposes of measuring the volume of solid
waste and for purposes of determining the conversion of weighed waste to the
equivalent cubic yards of waste, the measurements and the conversion factors
shall be the same as are approved and adopted by the Minnesota commissioner of
revenue in rules promulgated pursuant to the metropolitan landfill abatement
act, Minnesota statutes sections 473.842 to 473.847. All vehicles transporting
solid waste shall be registered at the entrance of the waste facility. The fee
shall be the liability of the operator, and failure to collect from the
customer shall not relieve the operator of liability. (1974 Code § 1130.05)
8-6A-4: PAYMENT OF FEE; RETURN FILED:

due under this article for the previous month, using a form either provided by
the city or approved by the city. The form provided or approved by the city
shall be similar in content and format to that form provided by the Minnesota
commissioner of revenue for collection of fees under the metropolitan landfill
abatement act. In addition to filing the city form with the city, the operator
shall also file with the city a copy of the fee reporting for the same time
period that the operator filed with the commissioner of revenue and the county
with respect to the state and county fees imposed by the metropolitan landfill
abatement act and laws of Minnesota for 1984, chapter 644, section 46. (1974
Code § 1130.09)
8-6A-5: FAILURE TO FILE RETURN; FALSE, FRAUDULENT RETURNS:

prescribed by this article or shall make, wilfully or otherwise, an incorrect,
false or fraudulent return, such operator, upon written notice and demand,
shall immediately file such return or corrected return and at the time pay any
fee due on the basis thereof. If such operator shall fail to file such return
or corrected return, the city may make for the operator a return or corrected
return from its knowledge and from such information as the city can obtain
through testimony or otherwise and assess a fee on the basis thereof, which fee
(less any partial payments for the fee covered by such return) shall be
immediately paid upon written notice and demand. Any such return or assessment
made by the city shall be prima facie correct and valid, and such operator
shall have the burden of establishing its incorrectness or invalidity in any
action or proceeding in respect thereto. Nothing in this section shall preclude
the city from enforcing this article by pursuing any other remedy authorized by
law or ordinance. (1974 Code § 1130.11)
8-6A-6: DISPOSITION OF PROCEEDS:
The revenue from the fees shall be deposited in the city general fund. Revenue
produced by twenty five cents ($0.25) of the fee must be used only for purposes
of landfill abatement or for purposes of mitigating and compensating for the
local risks, costs, and other adverse effects of facilities for the disposal of
mixed municipal solid waste located in the city. Revenue produced by seventy
five cents ($0.75) of the fee may be used for any general fund purpose. On an
annual basis, the city council shall, by resolution, designate the specific
purposes and particular uses of the fees consistent with the federal statutory
purposes as set forth in laws of Minnesota for 1984, chapter 644, section 47.

STORMWATER SYSTEMS
SECTION:
8-7-1 Definitions
8-7-2 Findings And Purpose
8-7-3 Stormwater System Established
8-7-4 Rates And Charges
8-7-5 Use Of Revenues
8-7-6 Relationship To Watershed Management Tax Districts And Special
Assessments
8-7-1: DEFINITIONS:
For the purposes of this chapter, the following terms have the meanings given:
NORTHWEST AREA STORMWATER SYSTEM: The stormwater management, control and
treatment practices described in the stormwater management manual for the
northwest area.
STORMWATER SYSTEM: The city's storm sewer utility established under this
chapter and under the utilities act, which utility is also known as the
stormwater sewer utility system. (Ord. 1155, 6-11-2007)
8-7-2: FINDINGS AND PURPOSE:
In providing for charges, the following findings and determinations are made:
   A.    In the exercise of its governmental authority and in order to promote
the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare, the city has
constructed, operated and maintained a stormwater runoff system in portions of
the city, and intends to continue to improve, operate and maintain that system
as a stormwater utility under the utility act. This chapter is adopted in the
further exercise of such authority.
   B.    The stormwater system, as constructed to date, heretofore has been
financed and paid for primarily through a combination of special assessments
levied against benefited property and the imposition of ad valorem taxes within
certain watershed management tax districts established under Minnesota
statutes, section 103B.245. Such financing methods were appropriate to the
circumstances at the time they were used, may be appropriate in certain
circumstance in the future. However, the city has determined that it is now
necessary and desirable to provide an alternative method of recovering some or
all of the future costs of constructing, operating, maintaining and improving
the stormwater system through the imposition of charges as provided in this
chapter.
   C.    In imposing fees and charges, it is necessary to establish a
methodology that undertakes to make them just and equitable. Taking into
account the status of completion of the stormwater system in portions of the
city, past methods of recovering stormwater system costs, and the factors set
forth in subdivision 3b of the utility act, it is determined that it would be
just and equitable to assign responsibility for the future costs of
constructing, operating, maintaining and improving the stormwater system
primarily based on the methodology described in this chapter.
   D.    The city has further determined that the stormwater system has yet to
be constructed in the northwest area, and that the stormwater improvements in
that area will be based on the northwest area stormwater system, which includes
(without limitation) rain gardens, infiltration basins, biofiltration trenches
and other stormwater management techniques. In light of the northwest area
stormwater system compared to stormwater runoff systems existing in the balance
of the city, it is just and equitable to impose charges for construction,
maintenance and operation of the stormwater system on a different basis in the
northwest area compared to the balance of the city.
   E.    Assigning costs and making charges for the stormwater system in both
the northwest area and the balance of the city cannot be done with mathematical
precision but can only be accomplished within reasonable and practical limits
based upon analysis of the factors described in this chapter.
   F.    To ensure that charges for the stormwater system are just and
equitable, the city has further determined that: 1) the capital cost of future
improvements to the system in the northwest area are most fairly financed
through connection fees payable at the time property is platted or building
permits are issued, whichever occurs first; 2) the capital cost of future
improvements to the system in the balance of the city outside the northwest
area are most fairly financed through special assessments or watershed
management taxes; and 3) the costs for operation and maintenance of the
stormwater system are most fairly financed by operation charges, payable in
accordance with other city utility procedures and at rates reflecting the
different levels of operation and maintenance cost of the stormwater system in
the northwest area and the balance of the city. (Ord. 1155, 6-11-2007)
8-7-3: STORMWATER SYSTEM ESTABLISHED:
A city stormwater system is hereby established. The stormwater system consists
of all stormwater conduits, manholes and catch basins, ditches, ponds within
the public right of way and easements and any additional facilities acquired by
the city in the future, including, without limitation, the improvements to be
constructed as part of the northwest area stormwater system. (Ord. 1155, 6-11-
2007)
8-7-4: RATES AND CHARGES:
   A.   Connection Fees: The city may impose a connection fee, based on: 1) the
square footage of the property to be charged, adjusted for a reasonable
calculation of stormwater runoff, 2) a reasonable classification of the types
of premises to which service is furnished, 3) by reference to the quantity,
pollution qualities, and difficulty of disposal of stormwater runoff produced,
or 4) any other equitable basis, including any combination of the basis
described in items 1) through 3) of this subsection, but excluding any
reference to the amount of water consumed. The connection fee must be a fair
and equitable share of the amount reasonably calculated to pay total projected
capital costs of the stormwater system, including the cost of debt service and
related financing costs in connection with obligations issued by the city to
finance such improvements, depreciation, a reasonable reserve for capital
replacement, and the costs of obtaining and complying with permits required by
law. In determining the connection fee, the city may give consideration to all
costs of establishing the system, and of improvements, enlargements and
extensions necessary to serve adequately the area. The connection fee,
including timing and manner of payment, shall be specified in subsection
3-4-2-2(E) of this code, as amended from time to time.
   B.   Operation Charges: The city may impose an operation charge on all
owners and users of the stormwater system in the city, based on: 1) the square
footage of the property to be charged, adjusted for a reasonable calculation of
stormwater runoff, 2) a reasonable classification of the types of premises to
which service is furnished, 3) by reference to the quantity, pollution
qualities, and difficulty of disposal of stormwater runoff produced, or 4) any
other equitable basis, including any combination of the basis described in
items 1) through 3) of this subsection, but excluding any reference to the
amount of water consumed. The operation charge must be a fair and equitable
share of the amount reasonably calculated to pay total operation and
maintenance costs of the stormwater system. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the operation charge will consist of a minimum charge imposed
on all property and users in the city, an additional charge for property within
the northwest area, and an additional charge for property in the balance of the
city, recognizing the differential in operation and maintenance costs in those
two (2) portions of the city. The connection fees for the northwest area and
the balance of the city, including timing and manner of payment, shall be
specified in section
3-4-2-2 of this code, as amended from time to time.
   C.   Supplying Information: The owner, occupant or person in charge of any
premises must supply the city with such information as the city may reasonably
request related to the use, development and area of the premises and the
imposition of any connection fee or operation charge. Wilful failure to provide
such information or to falsify it is a violation of this subsection.
   D.   Estimated Fees: If the owner, occupant or person in charge of any
premises fails or refuses to provide the information requested, as provided in
subsection C of this section, the fee for such premises must be estimated and
billed in accordance with such estimate, based upon information then available
to the city.
   E.   Payment And Collection: All connection fees and operation charges
imposed under this section are charges against the respective owner, lessees
and occupants, and are due on the due date specified by the city for the
respective account, and shall be delinquent thirty (30) days thereafter. In the
event a bill becomes delinquent, the city council may cause the delinquent
charges to become a lien against the property served by certifying to the
county auditor the amount of such delinquent bill in accordance with the
utility act. (Ord. 1155, 6-11-2007; amd. Ord. 1440, 12-12-2022)
8-7-5: USE OF REVENUES:
Revenues received from connection fees and operation charges are to be placed
in a separate stormwater system account and used to pay the normal, reasonable
and current costs of constructing, operating, maintaining, and improving the
stormwater system. The city finance director may establish such funds and
subaccounts within the stormwater system account as deemed reasonable and
necessary to manage the stormwater system in accordance with the utility act.
Revenues from time to time received in excess of amounts needed to pay costs of
operation and maintenance of the stormwater system, including any operating
reserve established within the stormwater system account, may be used to
finance improvements to and betterments of the stormwater system in accordance
with the utility act. (Ord. 1155, 6-11-2007)
8-7-6: RELATIONSHIP TO WATERSHED MANAGEMENT TAX DISTRICTS AND SPECIAL
ASSESSMENTS:
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this chapter, the city may
determine that it is just and equitable to finance the capital costs of
stormwater system improvements in the northwest stormwater area or elsewhere in
the city through the establishment of watershed management tax districts under
Minnesota statutes, section 103B.245, or special assessments under Minnesota
statutes, chapter 429, provided that the city reasonably determines that the
capital costs so financed are not otherwise financed from connection fees
collected under this chapter. (Ord. 1155, 6-11-2007)

appeal must be in writing and shall be filed with the city clerk. The council
shall consider the appeal within thirty (30) days after the date of the appeal.

will consider the appeal, the city clerk shall mail notice of the date, time
and place of the meeting and a general description of the subject matter of the

This chapter is adopted pursuant to Minnesota statutes section 462.351 for
cities and towns (1990).
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to limit the existing authority of
the city to enforce rules and regulations in place. This chapter shall be
cumulative to and in furtherance of any statutory, common law, or other legal
right, duty, power, or authority possessed by the city. Compliance with this
chapter or any permit or plan approval rendered hereunder, shall not excuse any
person from compliance with any other federal, state or local law, ordinance,
regulation, rule or order.
Any powers granted to, or duties imposed upon the director of public works, may
be delegated by the director of public works to other city personnel. (Ord.
1326, 11-28-2016)
9-5-2: FINDINGS:
The city of Inver Grove Heights, hereby finds that uncontrolled and unmanaged
stormwater and snowmelt runoff can have significant adverse impacts upon water
resources; and can adversely affect the health, safety, property and general
welfare of the community, and diminish the public enjoyment and use of natural
resources. Specifically, runoff can:
   A.    Cause erosion to exposed soil resulting in loss of topsoil and
deposition of sediments.
   B.    Carry nutrients, pathogens, organic matter, heavy metals, toxins, and
other pollutants to lakes, streams, and wetlands.
   C.    Diminish the capacity of water resources to support recreational and
water supply uses and reduce the natural diversity of plant and animal life.
   D.    Clog existing drainage systems, increasing maintenance problems and
costs.
   E.    Cause bank and channel erosion.
   F.    Increase downstream flooding.
   G.    Reduce groundwater recharge, which may diminish stream base flows and
lower water levels in lakes, ponds, and wetlands.
   H.    Contaminate drinking water supplies.
   I.    Increase risk of property damage and personal injury.
Further, effective stormwater pollution prevention, addressing the following
issues, depends on proper planning and design, the timely installation and
maintenance of site and situation of appropriate best management practices
(BMPs), and prompt and appropriate response upon discovery of previously
unknown pollutant sources. (Ord. 1326, 11-28-2016)
9-5-3: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to set forth minimum requirements for managing
the quantity and quality of runoff from all types of land uses throughout the
city to achieve the following objectives:
   A.    Protect, preserve, and use natural surface and ground water storage
and retention systems;
   B.    Improve the quality of stormwater runoff reaching surface water
resources within the city and the Mississippi River by reducing nonpoint source
pollution (including sediment) carried as stormwater runoff;
   C.    Minimize flood damage to residential, business, commercial and public
structures and property, and protect against increased flooding caused by land
disturbing activities and other projects;
   D.    Reduce volumes of stormwater runoff and the amount of impervious
surfaces in the developed parts of the city;
   E.    Limit the rates and volumes, and increase the treatment of stormwater
runoff, by managing stormwater runoff as close to its source as possible and
mimicking the system's natural hydrology;
   F.    Minimize flood damage to residential, business, commercial, and public
structures and property, and protect against increased flooding caused by land
disturbing activities and other projects;
   G.    Minimize erosion and sedimentation;
   H.    Minimize damage from sediments resulting from eroded soil;
   I.    Regulate land disturbing activities to protect against erosion and
sedimentation;
   J.    Implement soil protection and sedimentation controls to maintain
health, safety, and welfare;
   K.    Protect and enhance fish and wildlife habitat and water recreational
facilities; and
   L.    Secure the other benefits associated with proper management of surface
and ground water. (Ord. 1326, 11-28-2016)
9-5-4: DEFINITIONS:
Unless specifically defined below, the words or phrases used in this chapter
shall have the same meaning as they have in the "Minnesota Stormwater Manual"
and if not defined there, as they are defined in common usage. When not
inconsistent with the context, words used in the present tense include the
future tense, words in the plural number include the singular number, and words
in the singular number include the plural number. The words "shall" and "must"
are always mandatory and not merely directive.
               Any person or entity that applies for any permit for a project that includes a
APPLICANT:     land disturbing activity. Applicant also means that person's agents, employees,
               and others acting under that person's direction.
               Erosion and sediment control and stormwater management practices that are the
               most effective and practicable means of controlling, preventing, and minimizing
               the degradation of surface water, including construction phasing, minimizing the
BEST           length of time soil areas are exposed, and other management practices published
MANAGEMENT     by state or designated area wide planning agencies. BMPs include integrated
PRACTICES      management practices (IMP), which are small scale, distributed, on site
(BMPs):        stormwater management devices.
               Examples of BMPs can be found in the current versions of the "Inver Grove Heights
               Stormwater Manual - Northwest Area" (2006), the Minnesota pollution control
               agency's "Minnesota Stormwater Manual".
               A protective vegetated zone located adjacent to a natural resource, such as a
               lake, stream or wetland, which is subject to direct or indirect human alteration.
               Such a buffer strip is an integral part of protecting an aquatic ecosystem
               through filtering pollutants and providing adjacent habitat. For a stream, the
BUFFER:        width of a buffer strip is the width along each bank of the stream. Therefore, a
               thirty foot (30') wide stream with one hundred foot (100') wide buffer strips has
               a total width of two hundred thirty feet (230'). Buffer vegetation may include
               preserving existing predevelopment vegetation and/or planting locally distributed
               native Minnesota trees, shrubs and herbaceous vegetation.
               Any city adopted or approved planning document such as the comprehensive plan,
CITY PLAN:     water resources management plan, "Inver Grove Heights Stormwater Manual -
               Northwest Area" (2006), land use plan, or other.
               A disturbance to the land that results in a change in the topography, existing
CONSTRUCTION   soil cover (both vegetative and nonvegetative), or the existing soil topography
ACTIVITY:      that may result in accelerated stormwater runoff, leading to soil erosion and
               movement of sediment into surface waters or drainage systems. Examples of
               construction activity may include clearing, grading, filling and excavating.
CONVEYANCE:    A structure or feature used for transferring water from one location to another.
               A rainfall event of specified size and return frequency that is used to calculate
DESIGN STORM:  the runoff volume and peak discharge rate and is used to measure the performance
               of stormwater management practices.
DISCHARGE:     The release, conveyance, channeling, runoff, or drainage of stormwater, including
               snowmelt, into a receiving water resource.
DRAINAGEWAYS:  Any natural or constructed channel which provides a course for water flowing
               either continuously or intermittently.
EMERGENCY      The part of the wellhead protection area that is defined by a one-year time of
RESPONSE AREA  travel within the aquifer that is used by the public water supply well (as
(ERA):         defined by Minnesota Rules, Part 4720.5250, Subpart 3).
               Any process that wears away the surface of the land by the action of water, wind,

28-2016; amd. Ord. 1435, - -2022)
9-5-7: EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL PLAN STANDARDS AND APPROVAL:
   A.   Approval: The applicant must develop an erosion and sediment control
plan. The erosion and sediment control plan may be a combination of narrative,
plan sheets, and if appropriate, standard detail sheets that address the
foreseeable conditions, at any state in the construction or post construction
activities. The plan must include a description of the nature of the
construction activity and the anticipated schedule of activities. The plan must
address and account for reducing the potential for discharge of sediment and/or
other potential pollutants. Site plans must be updated and maintained
throughout construction. Plans must contain the following information, as
applicable: erosion prevention practices; sediment control practices;
dewatering and basin draining; inspection and maintenance; pollution prevention
measures; temporary sediment basins and permit termination conditions.
   B.   Compliance With Other Plans: For any project disturbing one or more
acres of land, all erosion and sediment control plans must be prepared by a
qualified individual, conform to the MPCA's NPDES general permit to discharge
stormwater from construction sites, and incorporate the appropriate ESC BMPs
described in the "Minnesota Stormwater Manual".
   C.   Site Erosion Control Design Standards: The erosion and sediment control
plan requirements must be incorporated into the project's final plans and
specifications and/or project documentation, as appropriate. The site erosion
control plan shall include measures to ensure the following standards are
fulfilled:
      1.   Sediment control practices must minimize sediment from entering
surface waters, including curb and gutter systems and storm sewer inlets.
      2.   Temporary or permanent drainage ditches and sediment basins that are
designed as part of a treatment system (e.g., ditches with rock check dams)
require sediment control practices as appropriate for site conditions.
      3.   In order to maintain sheet flow and minimize rills and/or gullies,
there shall be no unbroken slope length of greater than seventy five feet (75')
for slopes with a grade of three to one (3:1) or steeper.
      4.   To limit soil erosion, all exposed soil areas must be stabilized as
soon as possible but in no case later than fourteen (14) days after the
construction activity in that portion of the site has temporarily or
permanently ceased.
      5.   Sediment control practices must be established on all down gradient
perimeters before any up gradient land disturbing activities begin. These
practices shall remain in place until final stabilization has been established.
      6.   The timing of the installation of sediment control practices may be
adjusted to accommodate short term activities such as clearing or grubbing, or
passage of vehicles. Any short term activity must be completed as quickly as
possible and the sediment control practices must be installed immediately after
the activity is completed. However, sediment control practices must be
installed before the next precipitation event even if the activity is not
complete.
      7.   All storm drain inlets must be protected by appropriate BMPs during
construction until all sources with potential for discharging to the inlet have
been stabilized.
      8.   Temporary soil stockpiles must have silt fence or other effective
sediment controls, and shall not be placed in surface waters, including
stormwater conveyances such as curb and gutter systems, conduits, or ditches.
      9.   Vehicle tracking of sediment from the construction site (or onto
streets within the site) must be minimized by BMPs such as stone pads, concrete
or steel wash racks, or equivalent systems. Street sweeping must be used if
such BMPs are not adequate to prevent sediment from being tracked onto the
street.
   D.   Inspection And Maintenance:
      1.   The contractor shall designate an ESC technician that shall:
         a.   Be familiar with all aspects of a given site's ESC activities.
         b.   Be responsible for all inspections, recordkeeping, communication,
and/or coordination with the city, and implementation of required corrective
actions.
         c.   Be available to visit the site during working hours within four
(4) hours of notification by the director of public works.
         d.   Provide written documentation, with submittal of the NPDES
permit, of successful completion of ESC training as defined below, or other
training/certification program approved by the director of public works.
      2.   The ESC technician must routinely inspect the entire construction
site once every seven (7) days during active construction and within twenty
four (24) hours after a rainfall event greater than 0.5 inches in twenty four
(24) hours.
      3.   All inspections and maintenance conducted during construction must
be recorded in writing and these records must be retained with the erosion and
sediment control plan.
      4.   All erosion prevention and sediment control BMPs must be inspected
to ensure integrity and effectiveness. All nonfunctional BMPs must be repaired,
replaced, or supplemented with functional BMPs within twenty four (24) hours
after discovery, or as soon as field conditions allow access.
      5.   The owner and operator are responsible for the operation and
maintenance of temporary and permanent water quality management BMP/IMPs, as
well as all erosion prevention and sediment control BMPs, for the duration of
the construction work at the site.
      6.   If sediment escapes the construction site, off site accumulations of
sediment must be removed in a manner and at a frequency sufficient to minimize
off site impacts. (Ord. 1326, 11-28-2016; amd. Ord. 1435, - -2022)
9-5-8: STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN STANDARDS AND APPROVAL:
   A.   Approval: No stormwater management plan which fails to meet the
standards contained in this section shall be approved. All proposed projects
required to submit a stormwater management plan, as per subsection
9-5-5A of this chapter, shall incorporate the erosion and sediment control plan
requirements set forth in sections
9-5-6 and
9-5-7 of this chapter into the stormwater management plan.
The city may prohibit or restrict the use of stormwater infiltration practices
when soil conditions, groundwater supply issues, safety issues, snow removal,
and other concerns would show such practices to be impractical or unsafe. All
such exceptions must be approved by the director of public works. Specific
prohibitions on infiltration practices are:
      1.   Infiltration systems are prohibited:
         a.   Where industrial facilities are not authorized to infiltrate
industrial stormwater under an NPDES/SDS industrial stormwater permit issued by
MPCA.
         b.   Where vehicle fueling and maintenance occur.
         c.   Where the bottom of the infiltration basin is less than three
feet (3') to bedrock or seasonally saturated soils.
         d.   Within areas designated as very high vulnerability and high
vulnerability within a drinking water supply management area (DWSMA).
         e.   In an ERA within a DWSMA classified as moderate vulnerability
unless the permittee performs or approves a higher level of engineering review
sufficient to provide a functioning treatment system and to prevent adverse
impacts to groundwater.
         f.   Outside an ERA within a DWSMA classified as high or very high
vulnerability unless the permittee performs a higher level of engineering
review sufficient to provide a functioning treatment system and to prevent
adverse impacts to groundwater.
         g.   Where soil infiltration rates are more than 8.3 inches per hour,
unless soils are amended to slow the rate to below 8.3 inches per hour
         h.   Low permeability soils (i.e., hydrologic soil group D soils) or
where a confining layer exists below the proposed basin.
         i.   Within one thousand feet (1,000') up gradient or one hundred feet
(100') down gradient of active karst features.
      3.   For linear projects where the lack of right of way precludes the
installation of volume control practices that require volume control in
accordance with subsection D1 of this section, the city may allow a lesser
volume control on the construction site provided a reasonable attempt has been
made to obtain right of way during the project planning process and:
         a.   One or more of the prohibited site conditions listed above
exists; and
         b.   The owner implements other practices (e.g., evapotranspiration,
reuse, conservation design, green roofs, etc.) on the site that may not fully
meet the volume control requirements.
   B.   Compliance With Other Plans: All stormwater management plans must be
prepared in accordance with the city plans, city permits, TMDL allocation
plans, and other special district plans as adopted and amended from time to
time.
   C.   Stormwater Management Criteria for Permanent Facilities: The applicant
shall install or construct, on or for the proposed land disturbing or
development activity, all stormwater management facilities necessary to manage
runoff in compliance with the following design standards:
      1.   Water quality volume: site stormwater practices shall be designed to
infiltrate the required water quality volume calculated as follows:
         a.   For projects located within the Northwest Area, volume control
practices shall meet the standards set forth in Chapter 7 of the "Inver Grove
Heights Stormwater Manual - Northwest Area" (2006) and all subsequent revisions
and as directed by the director of public works.
         b.   For projects located outside the Northwest Area that are not
defined as linear projects, the water quality volume shall be calculated as one
(1.0) inch times the sum of the new impervious surfaces and the fully
reconstructed impervious surfaces.
         c.   For linear projects, the water quality volume must be calculated
as the larger of one (1.0) inch multiplied by the new impervious surfaces or
one-half (0.5) inch multiplied by the new plus fully reconstructed impervious
surfaces. Where treatment of water quality volume is found to be cost-
prohibitive, the director of public works may allow a water quality volume
between the two above-calculated volumes, provided volume reduction practices
have been considered and implemented into the project where feasible.
      2.   Pollutant Removal Requirements:
         a.   For projects that have met the infiltration/volume control
requirements above, the pollutant removal requirements are considered to be
met.
         b.   For projects where infiltration is prohibited, the following
pollutant removal standards apply prior to site discharge reaching a downstream
receiving water: achieve a minimum eighty five percent (85%) removal of total
suspended solids and minimum fifty five percent (55%) removal of total
phosphorus.
         c.   For redevelopment projects, BMPs shall be such that there is a
net reduction in phosphorus and total suspended solids loading from the
redevelopment site when compared to the existing (currently developed) site.
         d.   Where projects propose multiple BMPs in a treatment train
approach to meet the pollutant removal requirements, at least fifty percent
(50%) of the project area shall be treated in BMPs located in the upstream
areas of the site.
      3.   LID Or Green Infrastructure Design Concepts: Low impact development
(LID), or green infrastructure, design concepts shall be incorporated into
development projects located in the northwest area and in other landlocked
basins in the city. In all other parts of the city, LID design concepts must be
implemented wherever possible. Specific LID related requirements for the
northwest area and other landlocked basin areas include:
         a.   Postdevelopment runoff volume must match predevelopment runoff
volume for the 5-year, 24-hour event.
         b.   Proposed developments must use infiltration rain gardens,
vegetated swales, parking lot bioretention, infiltration basins/trenches,
disconnection of impervious surfaces, green roofs, and other LID techniques.
         c.   Mass grading should be avoided to reduce compaction of natural/
open space areas.
         d.   Joint parking and shared driveway arrangements are encouraged.
         e.   Pervious materials may be used for parking lot surfaces and are
encouraged for single-family residential driveways.
         f.   Parking lot curbing generally must be flat (ribbon curb) or have
breaks at regular intervals (curb cuts) to convey runoff into the stormwater
system.
         g.   Residential downspouts and sump pumps must discharge to cisterns
and/or permeable surfaces. Nonresidential downspouts and sump pumps must meet
this requirement if reasonably possible.
         h.   Narrower street widths are allowed, with restrictions.
      4.   Impervious Surface Reduction: Applicants shall include methods for
reducing the amount of impervious surface on their sites. Methods to use
include:
         a.   Reducing road widths, such as allowing parking on only one side
of a residential street.
         b.   Reducing sidewalk widths.
         c.   Allowing and providing for shared parking.
         d.   Creating a smaller building footprint (e.g., building two- story
houses instead of one-story houses).
         e.   Installing semipermeable/permeable paving, where feasible.
      5.   Storm Sewer Conveyance Systems: Storm sewer conveyance systems will
be designed to provide discharge capacity for the 10-year frequency runoff
event. The city may allow variances to this standard in areas where a new storm
sewer system would connect to an existing storm sewer system that does not have
and is not expected in the future to have a ten (10) year capacity. The
portions of the system that convey outflows from ponding areas will be sized to
convey the critical 10-year storm flow or the required 100-year outflow from
upstream ponding areas, whichever is greater. The storm sewer systems shall be
designed for 10-year storm events and their performance shall be analyzed for
storms exceeding the design storm.
      6.   Postdevelopment Peak Discharge Rates: Postdevelopment peak discharge
rates shall not exceed existing discharge rates for the 2-year, 5-year, 10-
year, and 100-year (50 percent, 20 percent, 10 percent, and 1 percent
probability), 24-hour duration storm events. Hydrologic modeling to calculate
the flood levels resulting from the 2-year, 5-year, 10-year, and 100-year, 24-
hour duration storm events shall be submitted for review.
      7.   Precipitation And Storm Distribution Data: Atlas 14 precipitation
and storm distribution data shall be used for all hydrologic/hydraulic
analyses.
      8.   Emergency Overflow: The city will require the incorporation of
emergency overflows (e.g., swales, spillways), where feasible, into non-
landlocked basin outlet structure designs to prevent undesired flooding
resulting from storms larger than the 100-year (1 percent) event or plugged
outlet conditions.
      9.   Pond Flow: All ponds shall use multistage outlets where needed to
control flows from smaller, less frequent storms and help maintain base flows
in downstream open channels. Pipes entering wet ponds shall have the invert
elevation set 0.5 feet below the pond normal water level.
      10.   Culvert Outlet Velocities: For culvert outlet velocities less than
or equal to four (4) fps, check shear stress to determine if vegetation or
riprap will be adequate. If vegetation is used, temporary erosion control
during and immediately following construction shall be used until vegetation
becomes established. For velocities greater than four (4) fps, energy
dissipaters shall be designed in accordance with MnDOT design criteria.
      11.   Skimming Devices: The placement of skimming devices at the outlet
of all on site detention basins to capture trash and floatable debris is
required.
      12.   Landlocked Basins: For landlocked basin areas only the existing
tributary area will be allowed to discharge to a landlocked basin, unless
provisions have been made for an outlet from the basin. The water quality and
flooding impacts of proposed outlets from landlocked basins on downstream water
resources will be evaluated. Easements obtained for landlocked basin outlets
should include continuous lands along the flow path between the natural
overflow (NOF) location and the downstream water body or storm sewer inlet.
      13.   LFE Of Structure Adjacent To Inundation Area With Outlet: The
lowest floor elevation (LFE) of any structure adjacent to an inundation area
with an outlet shall be at least two feet (2') above the 100-year flood level.
For the purposes of this section, "structure" means a walled and roofed
building, including gas or liquid storage tanks, which are principally above
ground. The term includes recreational vehicles and travel trailers on site for
more than one hundred eighty (180) days.
      14.   LFE Of Structure Adjacent To Landlocked Basin: The lowest floor
elevation (LFE) of any structure (as described in subsection C13 of this
section) adjacent to a landlocked basin or inundation area shall meet the
following standards and as illustrated in figure 1 of this section:
         a.   Scenario 1: Where the 100-year flood level is zero to six feet
(6') below the natural overflow elevation (NOF) the LFE shall be the greater of
the 100-year elevation plus two feet (2') or the NOF plus one foot (1'). The
NOF must be maintained and an easement obtained over the NOF. Easements
obtained for landlocked basin outlets should include continuous lands along the
flow path between the NOF location and the downstream water body or storm sewer
inlet.
         b.   Scenario 2: Where the 100-year flood level is six (6) to eighteen
feet (18') below the NOF, the LFE shall be the 100-year elevation plus six feet
(6'). The overflow shall consist of a drop inlet having a minimum pipe diameter
of eighteen inches (18") and an invert set four feet (4') above the 100-year
flood level. The overflow and overflow pipe routing shall include an easement
corridor between the NOF and the downstream water body or storm sewer inlet.
         c.   Scenario 3: Where the 100-year flood level is more than eighteen
feet (18') below the NOF, the LFE shall be the 100-year elevation plus ten feet
(10'). The overflow shall include an easement corridor and contingency for a
future gravity outlet or lift station outlet along a path for future downstream
force main, gravity sewer, or overland routing.
         d.   For all landlocked basins, the LFE shall be set at least one foot
(1') above the greater of the back to back 100-year storm event and a 100-year,
10-day snowmelt.

      15.   Structures Or Fill In Inundation Area: The city may allow
nonbuilding structures or fill within an inundation area, provided the
structure or fill is placed in an area where the 100-year flood level is not
more than eighteen inches (18") in depth in the location of the activity, and
the activity does not result in any loss of flood storage volume or result in
an increase in the regulatory flood elevation.
   D.   Mitigation For Permanent Facilities On Non-Linear Projects: If the
applicant, in consultation with the director of public works, believes that the
requirements for volume control, TP and/or TSS cannot be cost-effectively met
on the site of the original construction activity, the applicant may request to
pursue mitigation off site for all or a portion of the volume requirement that
cannot be created on site, and provide appropriate documentation to the city as
support for a request to pursue mitigation. The proposed mitigation must meet
the following criteria:
      1.   Mitigation project areas should be selected in the following order
of preference and in consultation and with approval by the city:
         a.   Locations that yield benefits to the same receiving water that
receives runoff from the original construction activity.
         b.   Locations within the same department of natural resource (DNR)
catchment area (or city subwatershed area shown in the WRMP) as the original
construction activity.
         c.   Locations in the next adjacent DNR catchment area (or city
subwatershed area shown in the WRMP) upstream.
         d.   Priority locations within the city.
      2.   Mitigation projects must involve the creation of new structural
stormwater BMPs, the retrofit of existing structural stormwater BMPs, or the
use of a properly designed regional structural stormwater BMP.
      3.   Routine maintenance of structural stormwater BMPs required by this
section cannot be used to meet mitigation requirements.
      4.   Mitigation projects must be completed within twenty four (24) months
after the start of the original construction activity.
      5.   If the mitigation project is a private structural stormwater BMP and
the city is not responsible for long term maintenance of the project, the city
will require written and recorded documentation of maintenance
responsibilities.
   E.   Models/Methodologies/Computations: Hydrologic models and design
methodologies used for determining runoff characteristics and analyzing
stormwater management structures shall be as set forth in the "Inver Grove
Heights Stormwater Manual - Northwest Area" (2006) and all subsequent revisions
and as directed by the director of public works.
   F.   Legal Documents: Legal documents for securing permanent easements as
necessary shall be submitted for review. Easements extending up to at least the
100-year flood elevation over floodplains, detention areas, wetlands, ditches,
and all other parts of the stormwater system shall be conveyed to the city.
(Ord. 1326, 11-28-2016; amd. Ord. 1435, - -2022)

the city shall comply with the following good housekeeping requirements:
      1.    Chemical Or Septic Waste: No person shall leave, deposit,
discharge, dump, or otherwise expose any chemical or septic waste in an area
where discharge to streets or storm drain systems may occur. This section shall
apply to both actual and potential discharges.
      2.    Runoff: Runoff of water from residential property shall be
minimized to the maximum extent practicable. Runoff of water from the washing
down of paved areas in commercial or industrial property is prohibited unless
necessary for health or safety purposes and not in violation of any other
provision of this code.
      3.    Storage Of Materials, Machinery, And Equipment:
         a.    Objects, such as motor vehicle parts, containing grease, oil or
other hazardous substances, and unsealed receptacles containing hazardous
materials, shall not be stored in areas susceptible to runoff.
         b.    Any machinery or equipment which is to be repaired or maintained
in areas susceptible to runoff shall be placed in a confined area to contain
leaks, spills, or discharges.
   B.    Removal Of Debris And Residue: All motor vehicle parking lots located
in areas susceptible to runoff shall be kept clean of debris and residues. Such
debris shall be collected and disposed of properly. Fuel and chemical residue
or other types of potentially harmful material, such as animal waste, garbage
or batteries, which are located in an area susceptible to runoff, shall be
removed as soon as possible and disposed of properly. Household hazardous waste
may be disposed of through the county collection program or at any other
appropriate disposal site and shall not be placed in a trash container. (Ord.
1326, 11-28-2016)
9-5-10: MAINTENANCE OF PERMANENT STORMWATER FACILITIES:
   A.    Maintenance of stormwater pollution prevention BMPs shall meet the
following minimum standards:
      1.    All stormwater pollution prevention BMPs shall be designed to
minimize the need for maintenance, to provide access for maintenance purposes,
and to be structurally sound.
      2.    All stormwater pollution prevention BMPs shall have a plan of
operation and maintenance that assures continued effective functionality as
designed.
      3.    Upon completion of all construction on a given site, stormwater
pollution prevention BMPs shall be maintained as necessary to return the BMP to
its original design function and capacity.
   B.    Assignment of responsibility for maintenance of facilities, associated
costs, and necessary easements are detailed in the stormwater facilities
maintenance agreement or improvement agreement for the project.
   C.    If site features/BMPs that are implemented to comply with the
permanent stormwater requirements change such that a reduction in the intended
design function and capacity is determined by the city, the owner will be
required to maintain the BMP to restore the intended design function and
capacity of the BMP, modify the BMP or create a new BMP(s) to ensure that the
features/BMPs on site meet the intended design function and capacity. (Ord.
1326, 11-28-2016)
9-5-11: PENALTY, ENFORCEMENT, RIGHT OF ENTRY:
   A.   Penalty: Any person, firm or corporation violating any provision of
this chapter shall be fined as provided in section
1-4-1 of this code, and a separate offense shall be deemed committed on each
day during or on which a violation occurs or continues.
   B.   Inspection: The director of public works may inspect construction sites
for compliance with provisions of this chapter.
   C.   Notification Of Failure Of The Erosion And Sediment Control Plan Or
Stormwater Management Plan:
      1.   Notification By City: If upon notification by the city of an
observed failure of the erosion and sediment control plan or stormwater
management plan measures, the contractor fails to correct the failure within
forty eight (48) hours after notification by the city or the time specified by
the city, the city, at its discretion, may begin corrective work.
      2.   Erosion Off Site: If erosion breaches the perimeter of the site, the
applicant shall immediately develop a cleanup and restoration plan, obtain the
right of entry from the adjoining property owner, and implement the cleanup and
restoration plan within forty eight (48) hours of obtaining the adjoining
property owner's permission. In no case, unless written approval is received
from the city, may more than seven (7) calendar days go by without corrective
action being taken. If in the opinion of the city, the applicant does not
repair the damage caused by the erosion, the city may do the remedial work
required.
      3.   Erosion/Sediment Deposition Into Streets, Wetlands, Or Water Bodies:
The applicant shall immediately clean up and repair any eroded soils (including
tracked soils from construction activities) or sediment that has entered, or
appears likely to enter, streets, wetlands, or other water bodies. The
applicant shall provide all traffic control and flagging required to protect
the traveling public during the cleanup and repair operations.
      4.   Failure To Do Corrective Work: When an applicant fails to conform to
any provision of this chapter within the time stipulated, the city may take the
following actions:
         a.   Withhold the scheduling of inspections and/or the issuance of a
certificate of occupancy.
         b.   Revoke any permit issued by the city to the applicant for the
site in question or any other of the applicant's sites within the city's
jurisdiction.
         c.   Direct the correction of the deficiency by city staff or by a
separate contract. The issuance of a permit constitutes a right of entry for
the city or its contractor to enter upon the construction site for the purpose
of correcting deficiencies in the erosion and sediment controls and stormwater
management facilities.
         d.   All costs incurred by the city in correcting erosion and sediment
controls and stormwater management deficiencies shall be reimbursed by the
applicant. If payment is not made within thirty (30) days after costs are
incurred by the city, payment will be made from the applicant's financial
securities, as set by other city permits/approvals.
         e.   If there is an insufficient financial amount in the applicant's
financial securities to cover the costs incurred by the city, then the city may
assess the remaining amount against the property.
   D.   Notification Of Need For Maintenance, Repair, Or Replacement Of
Existing Private Stormwater Facilities Of A Noncritical Nature: If, upon
inspection, the city finds that any private stormwater management facilities
require maintenance, repair, or replacement, but such deficiencies do not
create a critical or imminent threat to adjacent properties, the environment,
or other stormwater facilities, the party or parties responsible for the
continued operation of the facilities shall be given written notice of the
findings, the actions required to correct the situation, and a timetable by
which such activities must be completed. Such parties shall have fifteen (15)
days to reply to the city indicating their response to the notice.
If the responsible party or parties do not complete the necessary activities
stipulated by the city public works department, the city, after notice, may
order that such activities be completed by the city or its designated
contractor and that all costs associated with such activities be certified by
the director of public works to the council. The amount so charged shall be a
lien upon the properties benefiting from and utilizing the stormwater
facilities maintained, repaired or replaced and shall be added to, become, and
form part of the taxes next to be assessed and levied upon such properties. The
council shall, by appropriate resolution, assess the above mentioned costs
against said properties, and certify the same to the county. The same shall be
collected and enforced in the same manner as the collection of real estate
taxes.
   E.   Operator Responsibility: The contractor is jointly responsible with the
owner for compliance with all portions of any permit and stormwater management
plan prior to final completion of construction activities. (Ord. 1326, 11-28-

pollutants. (Ord. 1244, 10-24-2011)
9-5-13-6: DISCHARGE PROHIBITIONS:
   A.    Prohibition Of Illegal Discharges: No person shall discharge or cause
to be discharged into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses any
materials, including, but not limited to, pollutants or waters containing any
pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality
standards, other than stormwater.
Any property owner within the city shall comply with the following requirements
to prevent discharges:
      1.    Recreational vehicle sewage shall be disposed of at a proper
sanitary waste facility. Waste must not be discharged in an area where drainage
to streets or the storm sewer system may occur.
      2.    Water in swimming pools must sit for seven (7) days without the
addition of any chlorine to allow for evaporation of the chlorine before it is
discharged.
      3.    Mobile washing companies, such as carpet cleaning and mobile
vehicle washing services, shall dispose of any wastewater to the sanitary sewer
system. Wastewater shall not be discharged to the streets or the storm sewer
system.
      4.    Objects such as motor vehicle parts that contain grease, oil or
other hazardous substances and unsealed receptacles containing hazardous
materials shall not be stored in areas susceptible to runoff. Any machinery or
equipment that is to be repaired or maintained in areas susceptible to runoff
shall be placed in a confined area to contain any leaks, spills, or discharges.
The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal discharge to the storm
drain system is prohibited except as described as follows:
      1.    The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions
established by this section: water line flushing or other potable water
sources, landscape irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream flows, rising
groundwater, groundwater infiltration to storm drains, uncontaminated pumped
groundwater, foundation or footing drains (not including active groundwater
dewatering systems), crawl space pumps, air conditioning condensation, springs,
noncommercial washing of vehicles, natural riparian habitat or wetland flows,
swimming pools (if dechlorinated by water in swimming pools sitting for 7 days
without the addition of any chlorine to allow for evaporation of the chlorine
before it is discharged), firefighting activities, any other water source not
containing pollutants, and the use of fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides
for agricultural or landscaping purposes when applied for their intended
purpose in accordance with label directions and with all applicable local,
state and federal ordinances, laws and regulations.
      2.    Discharges specified in writing by the authorized enforcement
agency as being necessary to protect public health and safety.
      3.    Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a verbal
notification to the authorized enforcement agency prior to the time of the
test.
      4.    The prohibition shall not apply to any nonstormwater discharge
permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the
discharger and administered under the authority of the federal environmental
protection agency, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all
requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and
regulations, and provided that written approval has been granted for any
discharge to the storm drain system.
   B.    Prohibition Of Illicit Connections:
      1.    The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of
illicit connections to the storm drain system is prohibited.
      2.    This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of the
connection.
      3.    A person is considered to be in violation of this section
9-5-13 if the person connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows
such a connection to continue. (Ord. 1244, 10-24-2011)
9-5-13-7: SUSPENSION OF MS4 ACCESS:
   A.    Suspension Due To Illicit Discharges In Emergency Situations: The city
council may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person
when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge
that presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the
environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of
the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order
issued in an emergency, the authorized enforcement agency may take such steps
as it deems necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the
United States, or to minimize danger to persons.
   B.    Suspension Due To The Detection Of Illicit Discharge: Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this section
9-5-13 may have its MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or
reduce an illicit discharge. The authorized enforcement agency will notify a
violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may
petition the authorized enforcement agency for reconsideration and a hearing. A
person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises
terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the
authorized enforcement agency. (Ord. 1244, 10-24-2011)
9-5-13-8: INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES:
Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES stormwater
discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of
compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the city
council prior to the allowing of discharge to the MS4. (Ord. 1244, 10-24-2011)
9-5-13-9: MONITORING OF DISCHARGES:
   A.    Applicability: This section applies to all facilities that have
stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity, including
construction activity.
   B.    Access To Facilities:
      1.    The authorized enforcement agency shall be permitted to enter and
inspect facilities subject to regulation under this section as often as may be
necessary to determine compliance with this section. If a discharger has
security measures in force that require proper identification and clearance
before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary
arrangements to allow access to representatives of the authorized enforcement
agency.
      2.    Facility operators shall allow the authorized enforcement agency
ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection,
sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept under the
conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the performance of
any additional duties as defined by state and federal law.
      3.    The authorized enforcement agency shall have the right to set up on
any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the
authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the
facility's stormwater discharge.
      4.    The authorized enforcement agency has the right to require the
discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's
sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All
devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to
ensure their accuracy.
      5.    Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the authorized enforcement agency
and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by
the operator.
      6.    Unreasonable delays in allowing the authorized enforcement agency
access to a permitted facility are a violation of a stormwater discharge permit
and of this section. A person who is the operator of the facility with an NPDES
permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an
offense if the person denies the authorized enforcement agency reasonable
access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity
authorized or required by this section.
      7.    If the authorized enforcement agency has been refused access to any
part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and the city is able
to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of any
part of this section
9-5-13, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with any part of
this section
9-5-13 or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health,
safety and welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement agency may
seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.
(Ord. 1244, 10-24-2011)
9-5-13-10: POLLUTANTS:
The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial land use shall provide, at
its own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited
materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses
through the use of structural and nonstructural BMPs of the MPCA. Further, any
person responsible for a property or premises that is, or may be, the source of
an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's expense,
additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the further discharge
of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all
terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of
stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable,
shall be deemed compliant with the provisions of this section
9-5-13. The BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan
(SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with the requirements of the NPDES permit.
(Ord. 1244, 10-24-2011)
9-5-13-11: WATERCOURSE PROTECTION:
Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles
that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so
that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical
integrity of the watercourse. (Ord. 1244, 10-24-2011)
9-5-13-12: NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS:
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of
materials that are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants
discharging into stormwater, the storm drain system, or waters of the United
States, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery,
containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of
hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response
agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a
release of nonhazardous materials, said person shall notify the authorized
enforcement agency in person or by telephone or facsimile no later than the
next business day. Notifications in person or by telephone shall be confirmed
by written notice addressed and mailed to the city within three (3) business
days of the telephone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates
from a commercial or industrial land use, the owner or operator of such a land
use shall also retain an on site written record of the discharge and the
actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at
least three (3) years. The city shall keep records of any known illicit
discharge on the city's inspection form. (Ord. 1244, 10-24-2011)
9-5-13-13: ENFORCEMENT:

contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property;
      5.    The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs of the MPCA.
If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is
required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such remediation
or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall further advise that, should
the violator fail to remediate or restore within the established deadline, the
work will be done by a designated governmental agency or a contractor and the
expense thereof shall be charged to the violator;
      6.    The notice shall state that the determination of violation may be
appealed to the city administrator by filing with city clerk a written notice
of appeal within seven (7) calendar days of service of the notice of violation.
(Ord. 1244, 10-24-2011)
9-5-13-14: APPEAL OF NOTICE OF VIOLATION:
Any person receiving a notice of violation may appeal the determination of the
authorized enforcement agency. The notice of appeal must be received by the

Notes

10-3-3: NONCONFORMING USE CERTIFICATE:
   A.    Purpose: From time to time, amendments to this title cause uses and
structures to become lawfully nonconforming. This may create uncertainties for
owners and operators of lawfully nonconforming uses and structures as to their
rights and obligations and complexities for the city in monitoring and
enforcing this code with respect to such uses. To address these uncertainties
and complexities, the city council, sitting as a board of adjustments and
appeals, by majority vote, may grant nonconforming use certificates for
lawfully nonconforming uses and structures, impose reasonable conditions in the
nonconforming use certificates, and authorize accessory uses not currently on
the property to be placed thereon in the future.
   B.    Application For Certificate: Either an owner may apply, or the city
may initiate or require an application for a nonconforming use certificate for
a use and/or a structure. The application shall include at least the following:
      1.    The address and legal description of the use or structure;
      2.    The nature of the nonconformity with specific reference to the
provision of this code or other circumstance which caused the nonconformity;
      3.    Evidence that the use or structure existed as a legal use prior to
the effective date hereof or other circumstance which caused the nonconformity;
      4.    Evidence that the use or structure has been continuously used and
maintained in its nonconforming state from the time the nonconformity was
caused to the date the application was filed;
      5.    If the use is a prohibited use listed in section 10-13E-7 of this
title, the information required under subsection 10-13E-8B of this title; and
      6.    Other information as requested by the city.
   C.    Application And Procedure: The application for a nonconforming use
certificate shall be filed with the planning division for scheduling before the
planning commission and city council. The city council and the planning
commission may hold a public hearing on the nonconforming use certificate if
they deem it necessary or advisable. Where the planning commission or city
council shall determine that a public hearing is necessary or advisable, the
application, public hearing, and notice requirements for nonconforming use
certificates shall be the same as for amendments set forth in section
10-3-5 of this chapter.
   D.    Referral To Planning Commission: Before granting any nonconforming use
certificate, the request therefor shall be referred to the planning commission
for review concerning whether the use is a legally nonconforming use and for
its recommendation to the city council in connection with the request. If no
recommendation is timely made, the council may act without the recommendation
of the planning commission. The planning commission may recommend such
conditions related to the nonconforming use certificate as it may deem
advisable to make clear the rights and obligations of the city and the owner.
The council shall approve or deny the application within the time established
by Minnesota statutes section 15.99.
   E.    Approval Or Denial Of Certificate:
      1.    The planning commission may recommend to approve, approve with
conditions, or deny a request for a nonconforming use certificate. The city
council, sitting as the board of adjustments and appeals, by majority vote, may
deny or approve a nonconforming use certificate, impose conditions therein, and
authorize therein accessory uses not currently on the property to be placed
thereon in the future. The planning commission, in making a recommendation, and
the city council, in acting upon a request for a nonconforming use certificate,
shall consider the following factors:
         a.    Whether under this title the use or structure is nonconforming
and how it is nonconforming; and
         b.    Whether the use or structure was lawful prior to the change in
this title, which caused it to become nonconforming.
      2.    If the city council finds that a use or structure is not a lawful
nonconforming use, the city council shall deny the application, and the use
shall be terminated immediately or altered to make it conforming, or the
structure shall be altered to make it conforming. Failure to terminate or alter
the use to make it conforming shall be a violation of this title.
   F.    Record Of Certificate: If the city council grants a nonconforming use
certificate, the owner shall record the certificate with the county recorder
and provide evidence of recording to the city. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-3-4: VARIANCES:
   A.    Authority: The council may grant variances from the strict application
of the provisions of this title and impose conditions and safeguards in the
variances so granted where practical difficulties or undue hardships result
from carrying out the strict letter of the regulations of this title.
   B.    Application And Procedure: Application for a variance shall be filed
with the planning division for scheduling before the planning commission and
city council. The council and planning commission may hold a public hearing on
the variance request if they deem it necessary or advisable. Where the planning
commission or city council shall determine that a public hearing is necessary
or advisable, the application, public hearing, notice and procedure
requirements for variances shall be the same as for amendments set forth in
section
10-3-5 of this chapter. The city council shall act upon the application within
the time limits established by Minnesota statutes section 15.99.
   C.    Referral To Planning Commission: Before authorization of any
variances, the request therefor shall be referred to the planning commission
for study concerning the effect of the proposed variance upon the comprehensive
guide plan and on the character and development of the neighborhood and for its
recommendation to the council in connection with such request. The planning
commission shall make its recommendation after the request is referred to it,
and if no recommendation is made within that time, the council may act without
the recommendation. The planning commission may recommend such conditions
related to the variance regarding the location, character, and other features
of the proposed building, structure, or use as it may deem advisable. (Ord.
1098, 11-8-2004)
   D.    Approval Or Denial Of Variance:
      1.    a. The planning commission may recommend to approve, approve with
conditions, or deny a request for a variance. The city council may deny or
approve such variances and impose conditions and safeguards therein. In making
its recommendation, the planning commission shall consider the following
factors and the city council, in acting upon a request for a variance, shall
only grant a variance if the applicant demonstrates to the city council that
the following factors have been met:
            (1)    That circumstances exist that are special and unique to the
structure or land under consideration and such circumstances do not apply
generally to other land or structures in the district in which the subject
structure or land is located.
            (2)    That the granting of the application will not be contrary to
the spirit and intent of this title and the comprehensive plan.
            (3)    That the granting of such variance is necessary as a result
of a demonstrated undue hardship and will not merely serve as a convenience to
the applicant. Undue hardship means that all of the following circumstances
exist:
               (A) The subject property cannot be put to a reasonable,
beneficial use unless the variance is granted.
               (B) The plight of the landowner is due to circumstances unique
to the subject property not created by the landowner.
               (C) The variance, if granted, will not alter the essential
character of the locality.
            (4)    That economic considerations alone do not constitute an
undue hardship if reasonable beneficial use for the subject property exists
under the terms of this title.
         b.    Undue hardship also includes, but is not limited to, inadequate
access to direct sunlight for solar energy systems.
         c.    A variance shall be granted for earth shelter construction as
defined in Minnesota statutes section 216C.06, subdivision 14 when such
construction and variance are in harmony with this title.
         d.    A variance may not permit any use that is not permitted under
this title for property in the zone where the affected person's land is
located.
         e.    A variance may permit the temporary use of a one-family dwelling
as a two-family dwelling.
         f.    The council may impose conditions in the granting of a variance
to ensure compliance and to protect adjacent properties.
         g.    Approval of a variance shall require a majority of the city
council present. (Ord. 1221, 11-8-2010)
      2.    The council may deny variances, and such denial shall constitute a
finding and determination that the conditions required for approval do not
exist.
   E.    Violation; Termination Of Variance: A violation of any condition set
forth in granting a variance shall be a violation of this title and also
automatically terminates the variance.
   F.    Lapse Of Variance: A variance shall become void two (2) years after it
was granted unless made use of within two (2) years or such longer period as
the council, within two (2) years, may provide. The city council may grant a
single one year extension, the request for which must be submitted to the city
planning division at least sixty (60) days prior to the date upon which the
variance would become void. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-3-5: AMENDMENTS:
   A.    Authority; Vote Required: The provisions of this title may be amended
by majority vote of the entire council, and amendments changing the boundaries
of any zoning district or changing the regulations of any existing district may

   B.    Initiation: Proceedings for amendment of this title shall be initiated
by:
      1.    A petition of seventy five percent (75%) or more of the owners in
the area subject to the proposed amendment;
      2.    A recommendation of the planning commission; or
      3.    By action of the council.
   C.    Application For Amendment: All applications for amendment which are
initiated by the petition of seventy five percent (75%) or more of the owners
in the area subject to the proposed amendment shall be filed with the clerk,
and if the application involves the changing of zoning districts and boundaries
thereof, the application shall be accompanied by an abstractor's certified
property certificate showing the property owners within three hundred fifty
feet (350') of the outer boundaries of the property in question. When the
application is initiated by the owners of one hundred percent (100%) of the
property, the council may waive the requirement of the abstractor's certified
property certificate. The application shall be forwarded to the planning
commission by the clerk. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004; amd. 2008 Code)
   D.    Public Hearing; Notice And Procedure:
      1.    The planning commission shall hold at least one public hearing
affording an opportunity for all parties interested to be heard and shall give
not less than ten (10) days' notice nor more than thirty (30) days' notice of
the time and place of such hearing published in the designated official
newspaper for the city. Such notice shall also contain the description of the
land and the proposed change in zoning. At least ten (10) days before the
hearing, the clerk shall mail an identical notice to the owners and to each of
the property owners within three hundred fifty feet (350') of the outside
boundaries of the land proposed to be rezoned. If the property is to be rezoned
from A agricultural, E-1 estate or E-2 estate, the individual notice shall be
mailed to each of the property owners within one thousand feet (1,000').
Failure of the clerk to mail the notice or failure of the property owners to
receive the notice shall not invalidate the proceedings. The council may waive
the above notice requirements in connection with a citywide zoning initiated by
the planning commission or council.
      2.    The planning commission shall hold said public hearing after the
rezoning request has been received and there has been sufficient time to mail
and publish the required notices.
      3.    The planning commission shall make a written report to the council
stating its findings and recommendations. A copy of the planning commission's
report to the council shall be mailed to the applicant.
   E.    Referral To Planning Commission: The council shall not amend this
title or rezone any land or area in any zoning district or make any other
proposed amendments to this title without having first referred it to the
planning commission for their consideration and recommendation.
   F.    Action By Council: The council shall approve or deny the application
within the time limits set forth in Minnesota statutes section 15.99.
   G.    Effect Of Denial: The denial of a rezoning or ordinance text amendment
application by the council shall constitute a finding and determination that
the proposed rezoning is not in the best interest of the physical development
of the city. No application for rezoning which has been denied wholly or in
part shall be resubmitted for a period of six (6) months from the date of said
denial. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-3-6: DETERMINATION OF SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR USE STATUS:
   A.    Authority: When a use is not specifically listed as permitted,
conditional or accessory in the nonresidential use chart found in section
10-6-2 of this title, the zoning administrator shall make a determination of
substantially similar use. If the zoning administrator concludes that the use
has a substantial similarity to other uses listed in the nonresidential use
chart of said section
10-6-2, the use determined to be substantially similar shall have the same
zoning classification as the use to which it was determined to be similar.
   B.    Application For Determination: Any person may initiate an application
for determination of substantially similar use. The application shall include
at least the following:
      1.    The address and legal description of the property upon which the
use in question is proposed to be located.
      2.    Written consent of the landowner to conduct the proposed use on the
landowner's property.
      3.    A written detailed description of the nature and activities
associated with the use in question.
      4.    A cover letter specifically requesting the city to determine the
proposed use to be substantially similar to one or more allowed uses listed
within the same zoning district as the proposed use.
      5.    An escrow deposit for the city attorney's time to review the
application. The amount of the escrow shall be as established in subsection
10-3-8B of this chapter.
      6.    Other information as requested by the zoning administrator.
   C.    Consideration: When determining whether the proposed use is
substantially similar to other uses found in section
10-6-2 of this title, the zoning administrator shall consider the following
factors:
      1.    Traffic generation.
      2.    Access.
      3.    Deliveries.
      4.    Parking.
      5.    Impervious surface coverage.
      6.    Number and type of employees.
      7.    Intensity of use.
      8.    Outside storage.
      9.    Hours of operation.
      10.    Noise, vibrations, etc.
      11.    Function.
      12.    Exterior use.
      13.    Size of property.
      14.    Size and scale of building(s) and improvements.
      15.    Comments from surrounding property owners. Prior to making a
decision on the substantially similar use determination, the zoning
administrator shall solicit comments on the request from property owners
surrounding the site upon which the determination of a substantially similar
use has been requested. This shall be done in the form of a letter that
explains the request and asks for comments to be submitted within ten (10)
days.
   D.    Further Review By Board Of Adjustments And Appeals: At the zoning
administrator's discretion, the application may be referred to the board of
adjustments and appeals to make a determination. If referred to the board of
adjustments and appeals, notification and hearing procedures shall be the same
as set forth in section
10-3-5 of this chapter.
   E.    Appeal: If the zoning administrator makes a determination of
substantially similar use without referring it to the board of adjustments and
appeals, the applicant may appeal the decision to the board of adjustments and
appeals. Prior to a decision by the board of adjustments and appeals, the
planning commission shall consider the matter and make a recommendation on the
substantially similar use request.
   F.    Decision: If the zoning administrator makes the decision on whether a
proposed use is substantially similar to one listed in section
10-6-2 of this title, a letter clarifying the findings of the zoning
administrator shall be kept on file for future reference. A copy of the letter
shall be forwarded to the planning commission and city council for
informational purposes within ten (10) working days of the determination. A
letter of notification shall also be mailed to the surrounding property owners
who were asked for comments under subsection C of this section. If the board of
adjustments and appeals makes the decision on the application, a copy of the
meeting minutes shall be kept on file for future reference.
   G.    Limitations: The procedures and regulations found in this section
shall only apply to those uses found in the nonresidential use table found in
section
10-6-2 of this title. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-3-7: BOARD OF ADJUSTMENTS AND APPEALS; APPEALS PROCEDURE:
   A.    Board Of Adjustments And Appeals:
      1.    Established; Composition; Records: A board of adjustments and
appeals is hereby established for the city. The board of adjustments and
appeals shall consist of the city council. The board shall provide for a record
of its proceedings, which shall include the minutes of its meetings, its
findings, and the action taken on each matter heard by it, including the final
order.
      2.    Duties: The board shall act upon all questions as they may arise in

appeal and forward a recommendation to the Board.
      3.    Decision: The Board may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may
modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination as in its opinion
ought to be made in the premises and to that end shall have all the powers of
the officer from whom the appeal was taken and may issue or direct the issuance
of a permit. The reasons for the Board's decision shall be stated. The decision
of the Board shall be final. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-3-8: FEES AND DEPOSIT:

this section. In addition, the applicant shall reimburse the City for all
attorney, planning and engineering costs and other professional consultant
costs incurred by the City in reviewing and processing the application.
   B.   Fee Amounts and Escrow Deposit: The city may require that applicants

10-3-8-1: NORTHWEST AREA ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES FEE:
   A.    Definitions: For purposes of this section, the following terms have
the meanings given:
    GROSS ACRES: The total acres within a plat, subdivision, or parcel. Gross
acres do not include outlots within a plat that are intended to be replatted at
a later date into developable lots.
   NORTHWEST AREA: That certain geographic area within the City of Inver Grove
Heights, defined, established, and referred to as the Northwest Area Overlay
District pursuant to chapter 13, article J of this title.
   B.    Purpose And Intent:
      1.    Minnesota Statutes section 462.353, subd. 4 allows municipalities
to prescribe fees sufficient to defray the costs incurred in the review,
investigation, and administration of subdivision applications. The City has
incurred costs while preparing studies and analyses in the Northwest Area, an
area of approximately three thousand one hundred forty (3,140) acres. These
studies include:
         a.    "Natural Resource Inventory and Management Plan for the
Northwest Area", prepared by Bonestroo, Rosene, Anderlik & Associates, dated
January 2004.
         b.    "Northwest Quadrant Hydrologic & Hydraulic Analysis", prepared
by Emmons & Olivier Resources, dated February 2004.
         c.    "Northwest Expansion Area Alternative Urban Area-Wide Review
(AUAR)", prepared by Bonestroo, Rosene, Anderlik & Associates, dated January
2006.
         d.    "2005 Basin Monitoring", prepared by Emmons & Olivier, dated
April 2006. "Inver Grove Heights Northwest Area Low Impact Development -
Overflow Contingencies and Cost Analysis", prepared by Emmons & Olivier
Resources, dated July 2006.
         e.    "Northwest Area Surface Water Modeling Report", prepared by
Emmons & Olivier Resources, dated August 2006.
      2.    These studies and analyses provide direct benefit to subdividers in
the Northwest Area. These studies and analyses were necessary and advisable in
order to review, investigate, and administer applications for subdivision
within the Northwest Area. But for the City having prepared these studies and
analyses, the subdividers in the Northwest Area would, in all likelihood, have
had to prepare the studies themselves. The costs incurred by the City in
performing the above studies was at least three hundred seventeen thousand
three hundred eighty two dollars ($317,382.00).
      3.    The purpose and intent of this section is to establish fees to
reimburse the City for its costs in performing these studies and analyses.
   C.    Fee Established; Payment: A fee of eighty dollars ($80.00) per gross
acre, to be known as the Northwest Area Environmental Studies fee, is hereby
established, imposed and required to be paid by all applicants for subdivision
in the northwest area. The northwest area environmental studies fee shall be
paid by the applicant when an application is submitted to the city for approval
of a final plat in the northwest area. (Ord. 1171, 12-10-2007)
10-3-9: VIOLATION; PENALTIES:
The violation of any provision of this title or the violation of the conditions
or provisions of any permit issued pursuant to this title shall be a
misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof, the violator shall be subject to a
fine, imprisonment or both. Unless otherwise provided, each act of violation
and every day on which such violation occurs or continues constitutes a
separate offense. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)

At the time a conditional use permit application is submitted to the city, a
site plan review application shall also be submitted pursuant to the terms of
chapter 15, article J of this title. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-3A-5: REVIEW BY PLANNING COMMISSION; ACTION BY COUNCIL:
   A.    The planning commission may recommend to approve, approve with
conditions or deny a request for a conditional use permit. In making a
recommendation, the planning commission shall consider the following
provisions. If the planning commission does not make a recommendation in a
timely fashion, the council may act without the recommendation. The city
council may grant a conditional use permit as the use permit was applied for,
or in modified form, and impose conditions and safeguards therein, if it
determines the following:
      1.    The use is consistent with the goals, policies and plans of the
city comprehensive plan, including future land uses, utilities, streets and
parks.
      2.    The use is consistent with this code, especially this title and the
intent of the specific zoning district in which the use is located.
      3.    The use would not be materially injurious to existing or planned
properties or improvements in the vicinity.
      4.    The use does not have an undue adverse impact on existing or
planned city facilities and services, including streets, utilities, parks,
police and fire, and the reasonable ability of the city to provide such
services in an orderly, timely manner.
      5.    The use is generally compatible with existing and future uses of
surrounding properties, including:
         a.    Aesthetics/exterior appearance.
         b.    Noise.
         c.    Traffic.
         d.    Drainage.
         e.    Fencing, landscaping and buffering.

         a.    Size and shape.
         b.    Topography.
         c.    Vegetation.
         d.    Other natural and physical features.
         e.    Access.
         f.    Traffic volumes and flows.
         g.    Utilities.
         h.    Parking, setback, lot coverage and other zoning requirements.

(4/5) vote of the entire council. The council shall either approve or deny the
conditional use permit application within the time limit established by
Minnesota statutes section 15.99. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
   C.    Within the I-2 district only, modifications to the previously approved
site plan of an approved conditional use permit shall be allowed by
administrative review subject to the following procedural requirements:
      1.    Plan review will be in accordance with established procedures on
file with the planning department including the coordinated review by other
city departments and divisions as determined by the zoning administrator.
      2.    Administrative approval including all applicable conditions and
requirements shall be made in writing by the zoning administrator. The
applicant, in addition to all other applicable requirements, shall submit a
written acknowledgment of that approval prior to the commencement of any
development and prior to the issuance of any permits.
      3.    Any unresolved dispute as to administrative interpretation of this
code, this title, or policy requirements may be formally appealed pursuant to
this title.
      4.    Any variance proposal will automatically require the entire
application to be processed in accordance with the planning commission review
and city council approval provisions of section
10-3-4 of this chapter.
      5.    Any new use not approved under the existing conditional use permit
and is classified as a conditional use in the corresponding zoning district,
shall require the entire application to be processed in accordance with the
requirements for conditional uses in this article.
      6.    The zoning administrator may waive or modify data submission
application requirements if the zoning administrator determines previously made
submissions for the property substantially address the information needed to
evaluate the requested modifications. (Ord. 1322, 10-10-2016)
10-3A-6: ENVIRONMENTAL AND SPECIAL STUDIES:
   A.    In making its findings for the issuance or denial of a conditional use
permit, the city council may require the preparation of an environmental
assessment worksheet (EAW), environmental impact statement (EIS) or any special
studies it deems necessary or advisable in order to provide more factual or
detailed information on which to base approval, denial or mitigating condition
of a conditional use permit. Said special studies may include, but not be
limited to: traffic, utilities, engineering, economics, potential health
hazard, groundwater, air quality, wetlands or similar matters. With respect to
studies for potential health hazard, a human health risk assessment in
conformance with chapter LIV of the city administrative code may be required.
   B.    The reasonable cost of the preparation of an EAW, EIS or other special
study, as required by the city council, shall be borne by the conditional use
permit applicant. Where an EAW, EIS or other special study has been ordered by
the council, no final action on the conditional use permit request shall occur
until completion of the study as required. Failure by the applicant to finance
or provide for special studies and corresponding information required by the
city council may be sufficient reason to deny a request for a conditional use
permit. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-3A-7: LAPSE OF PERMIT; EXTENSIONS:
   A.    A conditional use permit shall become void two (2) years after being
granted by the city council unless it is used prior to the expiration of said
two (2) year period. An extension of the two (2) year period may be requested
subject to the following procedure:
      1.    At least ninety (90) days prior to the expiration date of the
conditional use permit, the applicant shall submit to the city council a
written request for a time limit extension, stating the reasons for the
extension request.
      2.    Upon receipt of the extension request, the city council may either:
         a.    Act upon the request; or
         b.    Refer the matter to the planning commission for further study.
      3.    If the extension request is referred to the planning commission,
that body shall conduct an informal review to determine if changes have
occurred in the area which would warrant a new public hearing or denial of the
time extension request. The planning commission shall subsequently make a
recommendation to the city council suggesting approval of the time extension,
denial of the time extension, or recommending that the property owner reapply
for a new conditional use permit, thus initiating a new public hearing. In the
event that the planning commission recommends denial of the time extension, or
submittal of a new application for a conditional use permit, the reasons for
such a determination shall be stated.
      4.    A maximum of one time limit extension may be requested for any
previously approved conditional use permit. Said time limit extension shall be
valid for only one year from the day of the month that the original conditional
use permit was approved.
   B.    Upon expiration of the time limit extension, the property owner may
resubmit a new request for a conditional use permit, subject to all procedures
and fees in effect at the time of submittal. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-3A-8: VIOLATIONS; TERMINATION OF PERMIT:
A violation of any condition set forth in a conditional use permit shall be a
violation of this title and also automatically terminate the conditional use
permit. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)

10-9E-3 Bulk Standards
10-9E-4 Allowable Uses
10-9E-1: PURPOSE:
The LaFayette neighborhood is a unique area to the city, and is the subject of
a component of the city comprehensive plan. The LaFayette neighborhood
comprehensive plan component encourages growth in the area by means of the
planned unit development approach. As multiple-family developments are proposed
in the neighborhood and are found compatible by the city, the ordinance that is
specific to the LaFayette neighborhood will be amended by adding the new
development for the subject property. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-9E-2: TRAFFIC ALLOCATION:
A principal reason for planning the development of the LaFayette neighborhood
by means of a specific comprehensive plan component and a separate ordinance
unique to the neighborhood is that the traffic capacity of the main arterial
streets in the neighborhood is limited. Consequently, to better assure that the
key intersections in the neighborhood function at an acceptable level, and to
allow for an equitable distribution of traffic to all properties in the
neighborhood, regardless of whether they are the first or last to develop,
traffic generation is carefully planned and monitored. Each proposed
development is analyzed against the needs and resources of the whole
neighborhood, and at the same time, the ordinance for the LaFayette
neighborhood is amended by adding a new use/development. A peak P.M. rush hour
traffic amount will also be allocated for the new use/development. (Ord. 1098,
11-8-2004)
10-9E-3: BULK STANDARDS:
The bulk standards for the LaFayette neighborhood are established in the
ordinance specific to that neighborhood. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)

The MU-PUD mixed use planned unit development district is intended to provide a
range of retail and service commercial, office, institutional, public, open
space, and high density residential uses that are organized and planned in a
manner that is pedestrian friendly. The mixed use concept embodies traditional
town planning concepts to create an urban environment allowing arrangements of
residential and commercial uses not found in other areas of the city. High
density residential uses comprise the majority of the district with a lesser
degree provided for retail and service commercial, office, and public and
institutional uses. A high degree of aesthetic detail is to be provided in
building and site design to promote a village community atmosphere. (Ord. 1098,
11-8-2004)
10-10E-2: BULK STANDARDS:

10-10F-4 Allowable Uses
10-10F-1: PURPOSE:
The LaFayette neighborhood is a unique area to the city and is the subject of a
component of the city comprehensive plan. The LaFayette neighborhood
comprehensive plan component encourages growth in the area by means of the
planned unit development approach. As commercial uses or developments are
proposed in the neighborhood and are found compatible by the city, the
ordinance specific to the LaFayette neighborhood will be amended by adding the
new use/development for the subject property. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-10F-2: TRAFFIC ALLOCATION:
A principal reason for planning the development of the LaFayette neighborhood
by means of a specific comprehensive plan component and a separate ordinance
unique to the neighborhood is that the traffic capacity of the main arterial
streets in the neighborhood is limited. Consequently, to better assure that the
key intersections in the neighborhood function at an acceptable level, and to
allow for an equitable distribution of traffic to all properties in the
neighborhood, regardless of whether they are the first or last to develop,
traffic generation is carefully planned and monitored. Each proposed
development is analyzed against the needs and resources of the whole
neighborhood, and at the same time, the ordinance for the LaFayette
neighborhood is amended by adding a new use/development. A peak P.M. rush hour
traffic amount will also be allocated for the new use/development. (Ord. 1098,
11-8-2004)
10-10F-3: BULK STANDARDS:
The bulk standards for the LaFayette neighborhood are established in the
ordinance specific to that neighborhood. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-10F-4: ALLOWABLE USES:
   A.    See table in section

existed as of May 1, 2003, shall be considered a permitted use within the
district and shall be regulated by standards for the R-1C district as found in
chapter 9, article A of this title. Any single-family residential structure
that existed in the COMM-PUD district as of May 1, 2003, may be completely
rebuilt or modified on the same premises, subject to the performance standards
found in chapter 9, article A of this title. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)

This article is adopted for the purposes of:
   A.    Providing the means for greater creativity and flexibility in
environmental design than is proposed under the strict application of this
title while at the same time preserving the health, safety, order, convenience,
prosperity and general welfare of the city and its inhabitants.
   B.    Recognizing the economic and cultural advantages that will accrue to
the residents of a planned community.
   C.    Encouraging a more creative and efficient approach to the use of the
land.
   D.    Encouraging the preservation and enhancement of desirable site
characteristics and open space.
   E.    Encouraging a development pattern in harmony with land use density,
transportation facilities and community facilities, and objectives of the
comprehensive plan. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13A-2: INTERPRETATION:
The provisions of this article shall be interpreted in accordance with the
following:
   A.    Planned unit developments may be excluded from certain requirements of
this title when specifically approved as a part of the planned unit
development. Such exclusions shall only be granted for the purpose of creating
better overall design and an improved living environment and not solely for the
economic advantage of the developer. All provisions of this title not
specifically excluded in the preliminary and/or final plan shall apply to the
planned unit development.
   B.    In most cases, the granting of a planned unit development permit does
not alter in any manner the underlying zoning district classification, except
that building permits shall not be issued which are not in conformity with the
approved planned unit development. In those cases where a specific planned unit
development ordinance is adopted for a development (in contrast to those cases
in which adoption of an ordinance simply effects a rezoning of the development
site to a planned unit development district), the granting of a planned unit
development permit to that development shall confer upon its planned unit
development ordinance precedence over this title.
   C.    Whenever a dispute arises concerning the interpretation and/or
application of any section of this title, the matter may be referred to the
board of adjustments and appeals for hearing pursuant to section
10-3-7 of this title. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13A-3: RELATION OF PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT SITE TO ADJACENT AREAS:
The design of a planned unit development shall take into account the
relationship of the site to the surrounding areas. The perimeter of the planned
unit development shall be so designed to minimize undesirable impact of the
development on adjacent properties and, conversely, to minimize undesirable
impact of adjacent land use and development characteristics on the planned unit
development. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13A-4: MINIMUM AREA:
The minimum total area required for a planned unit development shall be ten
(10) acres of contiguous land. Tracts of less than ten (10) acres may qualify
only if the applicant can show that the minimum lot area requirement should be
waived because a planned unit development is in the public interest and that
one or both of the following conditions exist:
   A.    Unusual physical features of the property itself or of the surrounding
neighborhood are such that development under the standard provisions of the
normal district would not be appropriate in order to conserve a physical or
terrain feature of importance to the neighborhood or community.
   B.    The property is adjacent to or across the street from property which
has been developed under the provisions of this article and will contribute to
the amenities of the neighborhood. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13A-5: SITE COVERAGE:
   A.    Residential Districts: In residential districts, the total ground area
occupied by buildings in a planned unit development shall not exceed twenty
percent (20%) of the net land area, excluding public streets and permanent
water areas.
   B.    Nonresidential Districts: In nonresidential districts, the total
ground area occupied by buildings in a planned unit development shall not
exceed thirty percent (30%) of the net land area, excluding public streets and
permanent water areas. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13A-6: RESIDENTIAL UNIT DENSITIES:
A planned unit development may provide for a variety of housing types in any
one of the basic residential zoning districts. The total number of dwelling
units allowed in a development shall be determined by either:
   A.    The area standards of the underlying zoning district in which the
proposed development is to be located; or
   B.    The density specified by the city council consistent with the intent
of the city comprehensive plan. A plan may provide for a greater number of
dwelling units per acre than would otherwise be permitted by the regulations
otherwise applicable to the site; however, the applicant has the burden to show
that such excess will not have an undue and adverse impact on existing public
facilities and on the reasonable enjoyment of neighboring property. The
council, in determining the reasonableness of the increase in the authorized
dwelling units per acre, shall recognize that increased density may be
compensated for by additional private amenities and by increased efficiency in
public facilities and services to be achieved by:
      1.    The location, amount and proposed use of common open space;
      2.    The location, design and type of dwelling units; and
      3.    The physical characteristics of the site. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13A-7: SETBACK AND SIDE YARD REQUIREMENTS:
Notwithstanding other provisions of this article, every lot in a planned unit
development abutting the perimeter of the development shall conform to the yard
requirements for the underlying district. Side yards between buildings in a
planned unit development shall be not less than twenty feet (20') or the height
of the building in nonresidential developments, whichever is greater, but such
buildings may be constructed without reference to the property lines of the
individual lots on which they are built. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13A-8: OPEN SPACE:
   A.    A primary function of this article is to encourage development which
will preserve and enhance the worthwhile, natural terrain characteristics and
not force intense development to utilize all portions of a given site in order
to arrive at the maximum intensity or density allowed. In evaluating each
individual proposal, the recognition of this objective will be a basic
consideration in granting approval or denial including, but not limited to, the
following:
      1.    The amount and location of private common open space area shall be
consistent with the stated purpose of this article and in no case shall be less
than fifteen percent (15%) of the total project area. The residential portion
of the project area shall further conform to the mandatory public park,
playground and open space area dedication requirements of section
11-4-5 of this code.
      2.    All open space shall be labeled as such and as to its intent or
designed functions.
   B.    In the event certain land areas or structures are provided within the
planned unit development for recreational use or as service facilities, the
owner of such land and buildings shall file a suitable agreement with the city
that assures the continued operation and maintenance to a predetermined
reasonable standard. These common areas may be placed under the ownership of
one of the following, depending which is more appropriate:
      1.    Landlord control.
      2.    Homeowners' association, provided all of the following conditions
are met:
         a.    The homeowners' association must be established prior to any
sale.
         b.    Membership must be mandatory for each owner and any successive
buyer.
         c.    The open space restrictions must be permanent, not for a given
period of years.
         d.    The association must be responsible for liability insurance,
local taxes and the maintenance of residential and other facilities.
         e.    Landowners must pay their pro rata share of the cost and the
assessment levied by the association that can become a lien on the property in
accordance with Minnesota statutes.
         f.    The association must be able to adjust the assessment to meet
changing needs. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13A-9: PERMITTED USES:
Uses approved and permitted under a planned unit development shall only include
permitted, conditional and accessory uses allowed in residential districts in
the city and those business, industry and institutional uses specifically
approved as a part of the planned unit development and in accordance with
standards herein provided. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13A-10: PROCEDURE:
   A.    Generally: Planned unit developments shall be proposed and approved in
accordance with this section.
   B.    Preliminary Discussion: Prior to filing a petition, any person may
request a meeting with the planning commission to discuss the feasibility of a
planned unit development. Such request shall be made by addressing a letter to
the city planning commission where, upon said request, shall be heard at a
subsequent planning commission meeting.
   C.    Petition: The petition for a planned unit development shall be on a
form provided by the city and shall include all of the following information:
      1.    Signature(s) of owner(s) and developer(s).

plan", as defined in subsection 10-13A-11A of this article.
   D.    Preliminary Development Plan Approval: The petition for a preliminary
development plan of a planned unit development shall be processed by the city
in the same manner in which rezoning petitions are processed as described in
section
10-3-5 of this title.
   E.    Development Agreements: As a condition to approval of a preliminary
development plan, the city may require the owner and developer of a proposed
planned unit development to execute an agreement which may include, but not be
limited to, all information required in the preliminary development plan as
provided in subsection
10-13A-11A of this article.
   F.    Fees: The fee for a planned unit development shall be the same as the
fee charged for a rezoning and preliminary plat when the latter is also
included.
   G.    Performance Bond:
      1.    The owner and/or developer of a proposed planned unit development
shall furnish a letter of credit in a sum equal to one hundred twenty five
percent (125%) of the city director of public works cost estimate for the
required improvements to be furnished or installed by the owner and/or
developer, including, but not limited to, street surfacing, curbs, gutters,
sanitary sewer and water service and storm sewers. The letter of credit shall
be approved by the city attorney prior to its acceptance.
      2.    A certified check shall be submitted by the owner and/or developer
for the estimated inspection costs of the required improvements to be furnished
or installed by said owner and/or developer. Said check shall be submitted at
the time of the submission of the letter of credit.
   H.    Variances: Variances granted as a part of a planned unit development
shall not be subject to this title. Said variances shall be permitted as a part
of the overall approval of the planned unit development, provided said variance
from provisions of this title are so stated in the planned unit development
agreement.
   I.    Effect Of Approval Of Preliminary Development Plan: Upon approval of a
preliminary development plan, a planned unit development may not be altered,
revised or withdrawn without the approval of the city council.
   J.    Final Development Plan Approval:
      1.    The "final development plan", as defined in subsection 10-13A-11B
of this article, shall be submitted for final development plan approval within
one year after city council approval of the preliminary development plan unless
a written request for an extension is submitted by the applicant. If
application for final approval or a request for extension is not received
within one year, the preliminary development plan will be considered abandoned,
and a new petition for a preliminary development plan must be submitted
following the preliminary development plan procedure. In addition to a request
for extension, the applicant may request in writing that final development plan
approval take place in phases coinciding with the progression of staged
development.
      2.    The final development plan shall be reviewed and recommendations
made by the planning commission within ninety (90) days after filing of the
application for final development plan approval. The city council shall make
the final determination on approval of the final development plan. Public
hearing shall not be required, provided the final development plan is in
substantial conformance with the preliminary development plan. Any major change
as determined by the city council shall require a public hearing.
   K.    Zoning Map: All approved final development plans shall be so
designated on the city zoning map, as it is revised from time to time. The map
shall refer by number or other means to an approved final development plan of a
planned unit development on file with the city. Said plans shall be available
for the general public to review.
   L.    Council Action: The approval of a preliminary development plan and a
final development plan of a planned unit development shall require a vote of a
majority of the entire city council, except that any preliminary development
plan or final development plan of a planned unit development incorporating any
of the following rezonings shall require a four-fifths (4/5) vote of the entire
council:

10-13A-12: STANDARDS AND CRITERIA FOR PLANNING COMMISSION AND COUNCIL ACTION:
The planning commission may recommend and the council may act to approve,
approve with conditions, or deny a preliminary or final plan for a planned unit
development. The planning commission, in making a recommendation, and the
council, in acting upon a plan, shall consider the following factors:
   A.    The consistency of the proposed planned unit development with the
adopted or proposed comprehensive plan of the city.
   B.    The extent to which the proposed planned unit development is designed
to form a desirable and unified environment within its own boundaries in terms
of relationship of structures, patterns of circulation, visual character and
sufficiency of drainage and utilities.
   C.    The extent to which the proposed uses will be compatible with present
and planned uses in the surrounding area.
   D.    That any exceptions to this article are justified by the design or the
development.
   E.    The sufficiency of each planned unit development phase's size,
composition, and arrangement in order that its construction, and operation is
feasible without dependence upon any subsequent phase.
   F.    The burden or impact created by the planned unit development on parks,
schools, streets, and other public facilities and utilities.
   G.    The impact of the planned unit development on environmental quality
and on the reasonable enjoyment of the surrounding property. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-
2004)
10-13A-13: EFFECT OF FINAL PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT APPROVAL:
   A.    Except as provided in section
10-13A-14 of this article, no building permit shall be issued for any building
on land for which a plan for a planned unit development has been approved which
does not conform to the approved final plan. No grading, development or
construction on the site may occur unless it conforms with the approved final
development plan.
   B.    Except as provided in section
10-13A-14 of this article, development of land for which a planned unit
development has been approved which does not conform to the approved final plan
shall only be allowed after one of the following:
      1.    Amendment to the approved final plan of the planned unit
development by the city council in the same manner as required for approval of
a planned unit development.
      2.    Vacation of the approved planned unit development by the city
council after notice and public hearing in the same manner as required for
approval of the planned unit development. The council may further condition the
vacation of a planned unit development in order to better protect the public
health, safety and welfare. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13A-14: AUTOMATIC TERMINATION:
Upon expiration of the specific time period, if any, approved by the city for
total development of a planned unit development, the subject area shall become
a permanent planned unit development district, and the conditions, provisions
and restrictions of the final development plan shall continue to govern the use
of the land. Provided, nevertheless, that if a planned unit development is not
completed within the required time period, the planned unit development
district classification shall automatically terminate as to that portion of the
district which has not been developed. The requirements and provisions of the
underlying zoning classification in its entirety shall thereafter apply to the
undeveloped area. Any factual disputes arising under this section shall be
presented to and determined by a majority vote of the city council. (Ord. 1098,

This article is adopted pursuant to the authorization contained in Minnesota
statutes chapter 103F, Minnesota regulations parts 6120.2500 to 6120.3900, and
the planning and zoning enabling legislation in Minnesota statutes chapter 462.
(Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13B-2: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
The uncontrolled use of shorelands of the city affects public health, safety
and general welfare not only by contributing to pollution of public waters, but
also by impairing the local tax base. Therefore, it is in the best interests of
public health, safety and welfare to provide for the wise use and development
of shorelands of public waters. The legislature of Minnesota has delegated
responsibility to local governments of the state to regulate the subdivision,
use and development of shorelands of public waters to preserve and enhance the
quality of surface waters, conserve the economic and natural environmental
values of shorelands, and provide for wise use of waters and related land
resources. This responsibility is hereby recognized by the city. (Ord. 1098,
11-8-2004)
10-13B-3: JURISDICTION:
The provisions of this article shall apply to the shorelands of the public
water bodies as classified in section 10-13B-7 of this article. (Ord. 1098, 11-
8-2004)
10-13B-4: COMPLIANCE REQUIRED:
The use of any shoreland of public waters; the size and shape of lots; the use,
size, type and location of structures on lots; the installation and maintenance
of water supply and waste treatment systems; the grading and filling of any
shoreland area; the cutting of shoreland vegetation; and the subdivision of
land shall be in full compliance with the terms of this article and other
applicable regulations. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13B-5: INTERPRETATION:
   A.    Minimum Requirements: In their interpretation and application, the
provisions of this article shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall
be liberally construed in favor of the city council and shall not be deemed a
limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes.
   B.    Abrogation And Greater Restrictions: It is not intended by this
article to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or
deed restrictions. However, where this article imposes greater restrictions,
the provisions of this article shall prevail.
   C.    Measuring Distance: For the purpose of this article, all distances,
unless otherwise specified, shall be measured horizontally. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-
2004)
10-13B-6: ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT:
   A.    Administration And Enforcement Official: The zoning administrator
shall be responsible for the administration and enforcement of this article.
   B.    Permit Requirements:
      1.    Permit Required: A permit is required for the construction of
buildings or building additions (and including such related activities as
construction of fences, decks and signs), the installation and/or alteration of
sewage treatment systems, and those grading and filling activities not exempted
by subsection
10-13B-9I of this article.
      2.    Application For Permit: Application for a permit shall be made to
the city on the forms provided. The application shall include the necessary
information so that the city can determine the site's suitability for the
intended use and that a conforming sewage treatment system will be provided
should any building permits or conditional use permits be issued.
      3.    Conditions: Any permit that is issued as described in this
subsection shall stipulate that an identified nonconforming sewage treatment
system, as defined by section 10-13B-16 of this article, shall be reconstructed
or replaced in accordance with the provisions of this article.
   C.    Zoning Compliance: Zoning compliance by the city shall be required for
each activity requiring a permit as specified in subsection B of this section.
This will specify that the use of land conforms to the requirements of this
article. Any use, arrangement, or construction that varies from what has been
authorized by permit shall be deemed a violation of this article and shall be
punishable as provided by subsection F of this section. This subsection shall
be satisfied by planning approval of permits as they are processed by the city.
   D.    Variances:
      1.    Variances may be granted only in accordance with Minnesota statutes
chapter 462. A variance shall not circumvent the general purposes and intent of
this article. No variance may be granted that would allow any use that is
prohibited in the zoning district in which the subject property is located.
Conditions may be imposed in the granting of a variance to ensure compliance
and to protect adjacent properties and the public interest. In considering a
variance request, the city council will also consider whether the property
owner has reasonable use of the land without the variance, whether the property
is used seasonally or year round, whether the variance is being requested
solely on the basis of economic considerations, and the characteristics of
development on adjacent properties.
      2.    The city shall hear and decide requests for variances, including
variances for sewage treatment systems in shoreland districts, in accordance
with the rules that the city has adopted for consideration of variances in
section
10-3-4 of this title. When a variance is approved after the department of
natural resources has formally recommended denial in the hearing record, the
notification of the approved variance required in subsection E of this section
shall also include the summary of the public record/testimony and the findings
of fact and conclusions, which supported the issuance of the variance.
      3.    For existing developments, the application for variance shall
clearly demonstrate whether a conforming sewage treatment system is present for
the intended use of the property. All variances granted shall require
reconstruction of a nonconforming sewage treatment system.
   E.    Notice To Department Of Natural Resources:
      1.    Copies of all notices of any public hearings to consider variances,
amendments, planned developments, or conditional uses under shoreland
management controls shall be sent to the DNR or the DNR's designated
representative and postmarked at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing.
Notices of hearings to consider proposed preliminary plats shall include copies
thereof.
      2.    A copy of approved amendments and subdivisions/plats and final
decisions granting variances, planned developments, or conditional uses under
shoreland management controls must be sent to the DNR or the DNR's designated
representative and postmarked within ten (10) days of final action.
   F.    Violations: Any violation of the provisions of this article or failure
to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and
safeguards established in connection with building permits, shoreland
alteration permits, grants of variances or conditional uses) shall constitute a
misdemeanor and shall be punishable as defined by law. Violations of this
article can occur regardless of whether or not a permit is required for a
regulated activity pursuant to subsection B of this section. Each day that a
violation of the provisions of this article exists shall constitute a separate
misdemeanor. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13B-7: SHORELAND CLASSIFICATION AND LAND USE DISTRICTS:
   A.    Shoreland Classification System: The public waters of the city have
been classified in this section consistent with criteria found in Minnesota
rules part 6120.3300, and the protected waters inventory map for the county.
The shoreland area for the water bodies and the Mississippi River listed below
shall be as defined and as shown on the official zoning maps of the city.

   B.    Land Use Zoning Districts:
      1.    Purpose: The development of shorelands of public waters shall be
controlled by means of land use zoning districts which are designated to be
compatible with the classes of public waters to which they apply. Land use
zoning districts are established to provide for:
         a.    The management of areas unsuitable for development due to wet
soils, steep slopes, flooding, inadequate drainage, severe erosion potential,
presence of significant historic sites, or any other feature likely to be
harmful to the health, safety, or welfare of the residents of the city.
         b.    The preservation of areas suitable for residential development
from encroachment by commercial and industrial uses.
         c.    The centralization of service facilities for residential areas
and enhancement of economic growth for those areas suitable for limited
commercial development.
         d.    The management of areas for commercial or industrial uses which,
by their nature, require location in shoreland areas.
         e.    The preservation and enhancement of the quality of water based
recreational use of public waters including provisions for public accesses.

(Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13B-9: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
The following general provisions shall be required in the shoreland overlay
districts:
   A.   Lots For Controlled Access: Lots used for controlled access to public
waters or as recreation areas by owners of nonriparian lots within subdivisions
shall meet or exceed the following standards:
      1.    Lots shall meet the minimum width and area requirements for
residential lots, and be suitable for the intended uses of controlled access
lots;
      2.   If docking, mooring, or over water storage of more than six (6)
watercraft is to be allowed at a controlled access lot, then the width of the
lot (keeping the same lot depth) must be increased by twenty five percent (25%)
in lot frontage for each watercraft beyond six (6);
      3.   Lots must be jointly or commonly owned by all purchasers of lots in
the subdivision or by all purchasers of nonriparian lots in the subdivision who
are provided riparian access rights on the access lot in a manner acceptable to
the city and the DNR; and
      4.   Covenants or other equally effective legal instruments shall be
developed that specifically state which lot owners have authority to use the
access lot and what activities are allowed. The activities may include
watercraft launching, loading, storage, beaching, mooring, or docking. They
shall also include other outdoor recreational activities that do not
significantly conflict with general public use of the public water or the
enjoyment of normal property rights of adjacent property owners. Examples of
the nonsignificant conflict activities include swimming, sunbathing, or
picnicking. The covenants shall limit the total number of vehicles allowed to
be parked and the total number of watercraft allowed to be continuously moored,
docked, or stored over water, and shall require centralization of all common
facilities and activities in the most suitable locations on the lot to minimize
topographic and vegetation alterations. They shall also require all parking
areas, storage buildings, and other facilities to be screened by vegetation or
topography as much as practical from view from the public water, assuming
summer, leaf-on conditions.
   B.   Placement Of Structure On Lots: When more than one setback applies to a
site, structures and facilities must be located to meet all setbacks. Where
structures exist on the adjoining lots on both sides of a proposed building
site, structure setbacks required for a new proposed building or an addition to
an existing building may be altered without a variance to conform to the
average setbacks on the adjoining lots from the ordinary high water level,
provided the proposed building site is not located in a shore impact zone or
bluff impact zone.
   C.   Floodplain Regulations:
      1.   Structures shall be located in accordance with the city floodplain
regulations, article D of this chapter, that are applicable to the site.
      2.   Water oriented accessory structures, where allowed, may have the
lowest floor placed lower than the elevation determined by the procedures in
this article if the structure is constructed of flood resistant materials to
the flood elevation, electrical and mechanical equipment is placed above the
flood elevation and, if long duration flooding is anticipated, the structure is
built to withstand ice action, wind driven waves and debris.
   D.   Water Oriented Accessory Structures: On general development and
recreation development lakes and urban and transitional rivers, each residence
may have one water oriented accessory structure not meeting the normal
structure setback in section
10-13B-8 of this article if this water oriented accessory structure complies
with the following provisions:
      1.   The accessory use shall not be a boathouse, fish house, or pump
house which are prohibited uses in all shoreland zoning districts; and
      2.   The structure or facility shall not exceed ten feet (10') in height,
exclusive of safety rails, and cannot occupy an area greater than one hundred
fifty (150) square feet. Detached decks shall not exceed eight feet (8') above
grade at any point; and
`      3.   The setback of the structure or facility from the ordinary high
water level shall be at least ten feet (10') except for a boat lift; and4. The
structure or facility shall be treated to reduce visibility, as viewed from
public waters and adjacent shorelands, by vegetation, topography, increased
setbacks or color, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions; and5. The structure or
facility shall not be designed or used for human habitation and shall not
contain water supply or sewage treatment facilities.
   E.   Stairways, Lifts, Landings And Docks: Stairways and lifts are the
preferred alternative to major topographic alterations for achieving access up
and down bluffs and steep slopes to shore areas. Stairways and lifts shall meet
the following design requirements:
      1.   Stairways and lifts shall not exceed four feet (4') in width. Wider
stairways may be used for public open space recreational properties;
      2.   Landings for stairways, landings at the bottom of stairways and
lifts on residential lots shall not exceed thirty two (32) square feet in area.
Landings larger than thirty two (32) square feet may be used for public open
space recreational properties;
      3.   Canopies or roofs shall not be permitted on stairways, lifts or
landings;
      4.   Stairways, lifts, and landings may be either constructed above the
ground on posts or pilings, or placed into the ground, provided they are
designed and built in a manner that ensures control of soil erosion;
      5.   Stairways, lifts, and landings shall be located in the most visually
inconspicuous portions of lots, as viewed from the surface of the public water,
assuming summer, leaf-on conditions, whenever practical;6. Facilities such as
ramps, lifts, or mobility paths for physically handicapped persons are also
allowed for achieving access to shore areas, provided that the dimensional and
performance standards of subsections E1 to E5 of this section are complied with
in addition to the requirements of Minnesota regulations chapter 1340; and7.
Docks that exceed five feet (5') in width require a shoreland building permit.
   F.   Significant Historic Sites: No structure shall be placed on a
significant historic site in a manner that affects the historical value of the
site unless adequate information about the site, as determined by the Minnesota
Historical Society, has been reviewed and documented in a public repository.
   G.   Steep Slopes: The city shall evaluate possible soil erosion impacts and
development visibility from public waters before issuing a permit for
construction of sewage treatment systems, roads, driveways, structures, or
other improvements on steep slopes. When determined necessary, conditions shall
be attached to issued permits to prevent soil erosion and to preserve existing
vegetation screening of structures, vehicles, and other facilities as viewed
from the surface of public waters, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions.
   H.   Height Of Structures: All structures in all shoreland districts shall
not exceed thirty five feet (35') in height, except that a conditional use
permit may be granted for additional height up to four (4) stories maximum.
Said conditional use permit for additional height shall be subject to notice
and comment by the DNR before issuance by the city.
      I.   Shoreland Alterations: Alterations of vegetation and topography will
be regulated to prevent soil erosion into public waters, fix nutrients,
preserve shoreland aesthetics, preserve historic values, prevent bank slumping,
and protect fish and wildlife habitat.J. Vegetation Alterations:1. Vegetation
alteration necessary for the construction of structures and sewage treatment
systems and the construction of roads and parking areas regulated by section
10-13B-10 of this article are exempt from the vegetation alteration standards
that follow.
      2.   Removal or alteration of vegetation, except for agricultural and
forest management uses as regulated in section
10-13B-14 of this article, is allowed subject to the following standards:
         a.   Clear cutting and intensive vegetation clearing within the shore
impact zones and on steep slopes are not permitted. Intensive vegetation
clearing for forest land conversion to another use outside of these areas is
allowable as a conditional use if a soil erosion control and sedimentation plan
is developed and approved by the soil and water conservation district in which
the property is located.
         b.   In shore impact zones and on steep slopes, limited clearing of
trees and shrubs and cutting, pruning, and trimming of trees is allowed to
provide a view to the water from the principal dwelling site and to accommodate
the placement of stairways and landings, picnic areas, access paths, beach and
watercraft areas, and permitted water oriented accessory structures of
facilities, provided that:
            (1)   The screening of structures, vehicles, or other facilities as
viewed from the water, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions, is not
substantially reduced;
            (2)   Along rivers, existing shading of water surfaces is
preserved; and
            (3)   In the shore impact zone, live trees larger than six inches
(6") in diameter shall not be cut, except to provide for water oriented
accessory structures or to provide a water viewing corridor not to exceed
twenty percent (20%) of the shoreline width of the lot.3. The provisions of
this subsection are not applicable to the removal of trees, limbs, or branches
that are dead, diseased, or pose safety hazards. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13B-10: TOPOGRAPHIC ALTERATIONS/GRADING AND FILLING:
   A.   Construction Of Structures, Sewage Systems, Driveways: Grading, filling
and excavations necessary for the construction of structures, sewage treatment
systems, and driveways under validly issued building permits for these
facilities do not require the issuance of a separate grading and filling
permit. However, the grading and filling standards in this section shall be
incorporated into the issuance of permits for construction of structures,
sewage treatment systems, and driveways.
   B.   Roads; Utilities; Parking: Public roads, public utilities and parking
areas are regulated by this section.
   C.   Permit Required: Not withstanding subsections A and B of this section,
a grading and filling permit shall be required for:
      1.   The movement of more than ten (10) cubic yards of material on steep
slopes and within shore impact zones.
      2.   The movement of more than fifty (50) cubic yards of material outside
of steep slopes and shore impact zones.
   D.   Considerations And Conditions: The following considerations and
conditions shall be adhered to during the issuance of construction permits,
grading and filling permits, conditional use permits, variances and subdivision
approvals:
      1.   Any filling that occurs in any type 3, 4, or 5 wetland over two and
one-half (2.5) acres in area shall require a permit from the DNR;
      2.   Alterations shall be designed and conducted in a manner that ensures
that only the smallest amount of bare ground is exposed for the shortest time
possible;
      3.   Mulches or similar materials shall be used, where necessary, for
temporary bare soil coverage, and a permanent vegetation cover shall be
established as soon as weather conditions allow;
      4.   Methods to minimize soil erosion and to trap sediments before they
reach any surface water feature shall be used;
      5.   Altered areas shall be stabilized to acceptable erosion control
standards consistent with the field office technical guides of the local soil
and water conservation districts and the United States soil conservation
service;
      6.   Fill or excavated material shall not be placed in a manner that
creates an unstable slope;
      7.   Plans to place fill or excavated material on steep slopes shall be
reviewed by the city engineer for continued slope stability and shall not
create finished slopes of thirty percent (30%) or greater;
      8.   Fill or excavated material shall not be placed in bluff impact
zones;
      9.   Any alterations below the ordinary high water level of public waters
shall first be authorized by the DNR under Minnesota statutes section 103G.245;
      10.   Alterations of topography shall be allowed only if they are
accessory to construction of public utilities, permitted or conditional uses
and do not adversely affect adjacent or nearby properties;
      11.   Placement of natural rock riprap and placement of a filter blanket
are permitted if the finished slope does not exceed three feet (3') horizontal
to one foot (1') vertical (may be increased by DNR permit), the landward extent
of the riprap is within ten feet (10') of the ordinary high water level, and
the height of the riprap above the ordinary high water level does not exceed
three feet (3'); and
      12.   Excavations and fills shall also be subject to all other provisions
of this code related thereto.E. Connection To Public Waters: Excavations, where
the intended purpose is a new connection to a public water, such as boat slips,
canals, lagoons, and harbors, require a conditional use permit. Permission for
excavations may be given only after the DNR has approved the proposed
connection to public waters. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13B-11: WETLAND PROTECTION:
   A. Grading or filling in any type 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 wetland shall be
evaluated by the city to determine how extensively the proposed activity would
affect the following functional qualities of the wetland:
      1.   Sediment and pollutant trapping and retention;
      2.   Storage of surface runoff to prevent or reduce flood damage;
      3.   Fish and wildlife habitat;
      4.   Recreational use;
      5.   Shoreline or bank stabilization; and
      6.   Noteworthiness, including special qualities such as historic
significance, critical habitat for endangered plants and animals, or other.
   B.   An evaluation shall also be made to determine whether the wetland
alteration being proposed requires permits, reviews, or approvals by other
local, state, or federal agencies such as a watershed district, the Minnesota
department of natural resources, or the United States army corps of engineers.
The person(s) proposing the wetland alteration shall be responsible for this
evaluation and compliance with these agency regulations and requirements. (Ord.
1098, 11-8-2004)

   A.   Public and private roads and parking areas shall be designed to take
advantage of natural vegetation and topography to achieve maximum screening
from view from public waters. Documentation shall be provided to the city
engineer that all roads and parking areas are designed and constructed to
minimize and control erosion to public waters consistent with the field office
technical guides of the local soil and water conservation district, or other
applicable technical materials.
   B.   Roads, driveways and parking areas shall meet structure setbacks and
shall not be placed within bluff and shore impact zones, when other reasonable
and feasible placement alternatives exist. If no alternatives exist, they shall
be placed within these areas, and shall be designed to minimize adverse
impacts.
   C.   Public and private watercraft access ramps, approach roads, and access
related parking areas may be placed within shore impact zones, provided the

10-13B-13: STORM WATER MANAGEMENT:
The following general and specific storm water management standards shall
apply:
   A.   General Standards:
      1.   When possible, existing natural drainageways, wetlands, and
vegetated soil surfaces must be used to convey, store, filter, and retain storm
water runoff before discharge to public waters.
      2.   Development must be planned and conducted in a manner that will
minimize the extent of disturbed areas, runoff velocities and erosion potential
that will reduce and delay runoff volumes. Disturbed areas must be stabilized
and protected as soon as possible, and facilities or methods must be used to
retain sediment on the site.
      3.   When development density, topographic features and soil and
vegetation conditions are not sufficient to adequately handle storm water
runoff using natural features and vegetation, various types of constructed
facilities such as diversions, settling basins, skimming devices, dikes,
waterways, and ponds shall be required. Preference must be given to designs
using surface drainage, vegetation, and infiltration rather than buried pipes
and manmade materials and facilities. Settling basins to intercept urban runoff
shall be sized to a minimum of a 10-year storm design.
   B.   Specific Standards:
      1.   Impervious surface coverage of lots must not exceed twenty five
percent (25%) of the lot. This may be increased, provided the city has approved
and implemented a storm water management plan affecting the subject site and a
conditional use permit permitting an increase has been granted.
      2.   When constructed facilities are used for storm water management,
documentation must be provided by a qualified individual that they are designed
and installed consistent with the field office technical guide of the local
soil and water conservation districts.3. New constructed storm water outfalls
to public waters must provide for filtering or settling of suspended solids and
skimming of surface debris before discharge. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)

   A.   Water Oriented Uses And Public Or Semipublic Uses: Surface water
oriented uses and public or semipublic uses, where permitted by this article,
that have need for access to and use of public waters may be located on parcels
or lots with frontage on public waters. Those uses with water oriented needs
must meet the following standards:
      1.   In addition to meeting impervious coverage limits, setbacks, and
other zoning standards in this article, the uses must be designed to
incorporate topographic and vegetative screening of parking areas and
structures;
      2.   No advertising signs or supporting facilities for signs may be
placed in or upon public waters. Signs conveying information or safety messages
may be placed in or on public waters by the city;
      3.   Outside lighting may be located within the shore impact zone or over
public waters if it is used primarily to illuminate potential safety hazards
and is shielded or otherwise directed to prevent direct illumination out across
public waters. This does not preclude use of navigational lights;
      4.   Commercial uses such as boat rides, on board vendors or similar uses
are strictly prohibited; and5. Uses that require short term watercraft mooring
for patrons must centralize these facilities and design them to avoid
obstructions to navigation and to be the minimum size necessary to meet the
need.B. Uses Without Water Oriented Needs: Uses without water oriented needs
shall be located on lots or parcels without public waters frontage or, if
located on lots or parcels with public waters frontage, shall either be set
back double the normal ordinary high water level setback or be substantially
screened from view from the water by vegetation or topography, assuming summer,
leaf-on conditions.
   C.   Agricultural Use Standards:
      1.   In all lake and river shoreland areas, general cultivation farming,
grazing, nurseries, horticulture, truck farming, sod farming, and wild crop
harvesting are permitted uses if steep slopes and shore and bluff impact zones
are maintained in permanent vegetation or managed under an approved
conservation plan (resource management systems) consistent with the field
office technical guides of the local soil and water conservation districts of
the United States soil conservation service, as provided by a qualified
individual or agency. The shore impact zone for parcels with permitted
agricultural land uses is equal to a line parallel to and fifty feet (50') from
the ordinary high water level.
      2.   Animal feedlot operations shall be prohibited.
   D.   Forest Management Standards: The harvesting of timber and associated
reforestation shall be conducted consistent with the provisions of the
Minnesota nonpoint source pollution assessment forestry and the provisions of
water quality in forest management "Best Management Practices In Minnesota".
   E.   Extractive Use Standards:
      1.   Site Development And Restoration Plan: An extractive use site
development and restoration plan shall be developed, approved, and followed
over the course of operation of the site. The plan shall address dust, noise,
possible pollutant discharges, hours and duration of operation, and anticipated
vegetation and topographic alterations. It shall also identify actions to be
taken during operation to mitigate adverse environmental impact, particularly
erosion, and shall clearly explain how and when the site will be rehabilitated
after extractive activities end.
      2.   Setbacks For Processing Machinery: Processing machinery shall be
located consistent with setback standards for structures from ordinary high
water levels of public waters and from bluffs.F. Mining Of Metallic Minerals

10-13B-16: WATER SUPPLY AND SEWAGE TREATMENT:
   A.   Water Supply: Any public or private supply of water for domestic
purposes shall meet or exceed standards for water quality of the Minnesota
department of health, Dakota County and the Minnesota pollution control agency.
   B.   Sewage Treatment:
      1.   All private sewage treatment systems shall meet or exceed the
Minnesota pollution control agency standards for individual sewage treatment
systems contained in the document titled, "Individual Sewage Treatment Systems
Standards, Chapter 7080", a copy of which is hereby adopted by the city by
reference and declared to be a part of this article.
      2.   Connections shall be made to public systems where available.
      3.   On site sewage treatment systems shall be set back from the ordinary
high water level in accordance with the setbacks contained in section
10-13B-8 of this article.
      4.   All proposed sites for individual sewage treatment systems shall be
evaluated in accordance with the following criteria. If the determination of a
site's suitability cannot be made with publicly available, existing
information, it shall then be the responsibility of the applicant to provide
sufficient soil borings and percolation tests from on site field
investigations. Evaluation criteria is as follows:

(Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004; amd. 2008 Code)
      6.   Additional regulations governing on site sewage treatment systems
are contained in the city on site sewage treatment system ordinance1. (Ord.
1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13B-17: SUBDIVISIONS:
   A.   Land Suitability: Each lot created through subdivision, including
planned unit developments, must be suitable in its natural state for the
proposed use, with minimal alteration. Suitability analysis by the city shall
consider susceptibility to flooding, existence of wetlands, soil and rock
formations and severe limitations for development, severe erosion potential,
steep topography, inadequate water supply or sewage treatment capabilities,
near shore aquatic conditions unsuitable for water based recreation, important
fish and wildlife habitat, presence of significant historic sites, or any other
feature of the natural land likely to be harmful to the health, safety, or
welfare of future residents of the proposed subdivision or of the community.
   B.   Consistency With Other Controls: Subdivisions must conform to all
official controls of the city. A subdivision will not be approved where a later
variance from one or more standards in official controls would be needed to use
the lots for their intended purpose. In areas not served by publicly owned
sewer and water systems, a subdivision will not be approved unless domestic
water supply is available and a sewage treatment system consistent with this
code can be provided for every lot. Each lot shall meet the minimum lot size
and dimensional requirements of section

that is free of limiting factors, sufficient for the construction of two (2)
standard soil treatment systems where private sewage systems are permitted.
Lots that would require use of holding tanks must not be approved. (Ord. 1098,
11-8-2004)
10-13B-18: PLANNED DEVELOPMENT (CLUSTER DEVELOPMENTS):
   A.   Types Of Planned Developments Permitted: Planned developments (PDs) are
permitted for new projects on undeveloped land, redevelopment of previously
built sites, or conversions of existing buildings and land. The land use
districts in which they are permitted are identified in the land use district
descriptions in sections
10-6-1 and
10-6-2 of this title and on the official zoning map of the city.
   B.   Planned Development Zoning: Planned developments shall require a
planned development (PD) zoning of the property and shall be processed in
accordance with the provisions of article A of this chapter.
   C.   Application For Planned Development:
      1.   Planned developments shall only be permitted when they meet the
provisions of article A of this chapter for a planned development district.
      2.   Planned developments shall be processed in accordance with the
administrative provisions of section 10-13B-6 of this article, and the planned
development provisions of article A of this chapter.
      3.   The city must require additional information and documentation to
aid in the processing of planned developments in a shoreland zone. This may
include, but is not limited to: surface water features, existing and proposed
vegetative detail, deed restrictions, covenants, owners' association bylaws,
details of water oriented uses, long term plans for preservation and
maintenance of open space at two foot (2') interval contours, and similar
information.
   D.   Public Utilities: Public utilities including municipal sanitary sewer
and water shall be available and be required for any planned development (PD)
in the city.
   E.   Site Suitable Area Evaluation: Proposed new or expansions to existing
planned unit developments shall be evaluated using the following procedures and
standards to determine the suitable area for the dwelling unit/dwelling site
density evaluation in planned development areas:
      1.   Shoreland Tier Dimensions: The project parcel shall be divided into
tiers by locating one or more lines approximately parallel to a line that
identifies the ordinary high water level at the following intervals, proceeding
landward:
   SHORELAND TIER DIMENSIONS
 
Type Of Lake                                            Sewered (Feet)
General development lakes - first tier (riparian)       200
General development lakes - second and additional tiers 200
Recreational development lakes                          267
Natural environment lakes                               320
Urban river                                             200
      2.   Suitable Area Calculation: The suitable area within each tier is
calculated by excluding from the tier area all wetlands, bluffs, or land below
the ordinary high water level of public waters. This suitable area and the
proposed project are then subjected to either the residential or commercial
planned unit development density evaluation steps to arrive at an allowable
number of dwelling units or sites.
   F.   Residential And Commercial PD Density Evaluation: The procedures for
determining the base density of a PD and density increase multipliers are as
follows. Allowable densities may be transferred from any tier to any other tier
further from the water body, but shall not be transferred to any other tier
closer.
      1.   For residential PD base density evaluation, the suitable area within
each tier is divided by the minimum single residential lot size standard for
lakes to determine the maximum permitted density. Proposed locations and number
of dwelling units or sites for residential planned developments are then
compared with the tier, density, and suitability analyses herein and the design
criteria in subsection G of this section.
      2.   For commercial PD base density evaluation, determine the average
inside living area size of dwelling units or sites within each tier, including
both existing and proposed units and sites. Computation of inside living area
sizes shall not include decks, patios, stoops, steps, garages, or porches and
basements, unless they are habitable space.
      3.   Select the appropriate floor area ratio from the following table:
   COMMERCIAL PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT FLOOR AREA RATIOS PUBLIC WATER CLASSES
Average Unit Floor Urban River And     Recreational      Natural Environmental
Area (Square Feet) General Development Development Lakes Lakes
                   Lakes
Average Unit Floor Urban River And     Recreational      Natural Environmental
Area (Square Feet) General Development Development Lakes Lakes

500                .065                .032              .016
600                .072                .038              .019
700                .082                .042              .021
800                .091                .046              .023
900                .099                .050              .025
1,000              .108                .054              .027
1,100              .116                .058              .029
1,200              .125                .064              .032
1,300              .133                .068              .034
1,400              .142                .072              .036
1,500 and above    .150                .075              .038
      4.   Multiply the suitable area within each tier by the floor area ratio
to yield total floor area for each tier allowed to be used for dwelling units
or sites.
      5.   Divide the total floor area by tier, computed in subsection F4 of
this section, by the average inside living area size determined in subsection
F1 of this section. This yields a base number of dwelling units and sites for
each tier.
      6.   Proposed locations and number of dwelling units or sites for the
commercial planned development are then compared with the tier, density and
suitability analyses herein and the design criteria in subsection G of this
section.
      7.   a.   Increases to the dwelling unit or dwelling site base densities
previously determined are allowable if the dimensional standards in section
10-13B-8 of this article are met or exceeded and the design criteria in
subsection G of this section are satisfied. The allowable density increases in
subsection F7b of this section will only be allowed if structure setbacks from
the ordinary high water level are increased to at least fifty percent (50%)
greater than the minimum setback, or an impact on the water body is reduced an
equivalent amount through vegetative management, topography, or additional
means acceptable to the city, and the setback is at least twenty five percent
(25%) greater than the minimum setback.
         b.   Dwelling unit or dwelling site density increases for residential
or commercial planned unit developments are allowed as follows:
 
Density Evaluation Tiers Maximum Density Increase Within Each Tier (Percent)
First                    50
Second                   100
Third                    200

preserved as open space;
      2.   Dwelling units or sites, road rights of way, or land covered by road
surfaces, parking areas, or structures, except water oriented accessory
structures or facilities, are developed areas and shall not be included in the
computation of minimum open space;
      3.   Open space shall include areas with physical characteristics
unsuitable for development in their natural state, and areas containing
significant historic sites or unplatted cemeteries;
      4.   Open space may include outdoor recreational facilities for use by

purpose of this article, as follows.
         a.   The extent, location and intensity of the variance will be in
substantial compliance with the MRCCA Plan;
         b.   The variance is consistent with the character and management
purpose of the MRCCA district in which it is located;
         c.   The variance will not be detrimental to Primary Conservation
Areas (PCAs) and Public River Corridor Views (PRCVs) nor will it contribute to
negative incremental impacts to PCAs and PRCVs when considered in the context
of past, present and reasonable future actions; and
   F.   Conditional and interim use permits. All conditional and interim uses,
required under this article must comply with Minnesota Statutes, section
462.3595 and must consider the potential impacts on primary conservation areas,

10-13C-4: MRCCA DISTRICTS:
   A.   Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to establish districts under
which building height and structure placement are regulated to protect and
enhance the Mississippi River's resources and features consistent with the
natural and built character of each district.
   B.   District description and management purpose. The MRCCA within the City
is divided into the following MRCCA Districts:
      1.   Rural and Open Space (ROS).
         a.   Description. The ROS District is characterized by rural and low-
density development patterns and land uses, and includes land that is riparian
or visible from the river, as well as large, undeveloped tracts of high
ecological and scenic value, floodplain, and undeveloped islands. Many primary
conservation areas exist in the district.
         b.   Management purpose. The ROS District must be managed to sustain
and restore the rural and natural character of the corridor and to protect and
enhance habitat, parks and open space, public river corridor views, and scenic,
natural, and historic areas.
      2.   River Neighborhood (RN).
         a.   Description. The RN District is characterized by primarily
residential neighborhoods that are riparian or readily visible from the river
or that abut riparian parkland. The district includes parks and open space,
limited commercial development, marinas, and related land uses.
         b.   Management purpose. The RN District must be managed to maintain
the character of the river corridor within the context of existing residential
and related neighborhood development, and to protect and enhance habitat, parks
and open space, public river corridor views, and scenic, natural, and historic
areas. Minimizing erosion and the flow of untreated storm water into the river
and enhancing habitat and shoreline vegetation are priorities in the district.
      3.   Separated from River (SR).
         a.   Description. The SR District is characterized by its physical and
visual distance from the Mississippi River. The district includes land
separated from the river by distance, topography, development, or a
transportation corridor. The land in this district is not readily visible from
the Mississippi River.
         b.   Management purpose. The SR district provides flexibility in
managing development without negatively affecting the key resources and
features of the river corridor. Minimizing negative impacts to primary
conservation areas and minimizing erosion and flow of untreated storm water
into the Mississippi River are priorities in the district. The RTC district
must be managed in a manner that allows continued growth and redevelopment in
historic downtowns and more intensive redevelopment in limited areas at river
crossings to accommodate compact walkable development patterns and connections
to the river. Minimizing erosion and the flow of untreated storm water into the
river, providing public access to and public views of the river, and restoring
natural vegetation in riparian areas and tree canopy are priorities in the
district.
      4.   Urban Mixed (UM).
         a.   Description. The UM District includes large areas of highly
urbanized mixed use that are a part of the urban fabric of the river corridor,
including institutional, commercial, industrial, and residential areas and
parks and open space.
         b.   Management purpose. The UM District must be managed in a manner
that allows for future growth and potential transition of intensely developed
areas that does not negatively affect public river corridor views and that
protects bluffs and floodplains. Restoring and enhancing bluff and shoreline
habitat, minimizing erosion and flow of untreated storm water into the river,
and providing public access to and public views of the river are priorities in
the district.
   C.   MRCCA district map. The locations and boundaries of the MRCCA districts
established by this article are shown on the Shoreland and Critical Area
Overlay Map which is incorporated herein by reference. The district boundary
lines are intended to follow the centerlines of rivers and streams, highways,
streets, lot lines, and municipal boundaries, unless a boundary line is
otherwise indicated on the map. Where district boundaries cross unsubdivided
property, the district boundary line is determined by use of dimensions or the
scale appearing on the map. (Ord. 1429, 6-13-2022)
10-13C-5: SPECIAL LAND USE PROVISIONS:
   A.   Purpose. To identify development standards and considerations for land
uses that have potential to negatively impact primary conservation areas and
public river corridor views.

DNR General Public Waters Work Permit GP 2004-0001, where applicable;
      4.   Avoid primary conservation areas, unless no alternative exists. If
no alternative exists, then disturbance to primary conservation areas must be
avoided to the greatest extent practicable, and design and construction must
minimize impacts; and
      5.   Minimize disturbance of spawning and nesting times by scheduling
construction at times when local fish and wildlife are not spawning or nesting.
      6.   Minimize disturbance during bird migration and nesting times by
scheduling construction at times when birds are not migrating or nesting.

must be planted and maintained on the right-of-way; and
      3.   Chemical control of vegetation must be avoided when practicable, but
when chemical control is necessary, chemicals used must be in accordance with
the regulations and other requirements of all state and federal agencies with
authority over the chemical's use.
      4.   All propagules must be appropriate for site conditions and that all
species native ranges must originate from within one hundred and seventy-five
(175) miles of the project site.

land controlled by the commissioner are subject to approval by the commissioner
according to Minnesota Statutes, sections 84.415 and 103G.245.
   E.   Public utilities. Public utilities must comply with the following
standards:
      1.   High-voltage transmission lines, wind energy conversion systems
greater than five megawatts, and pipelines are regulated according to Minnesota
Statutes, chapter 216E, 216F, and 216G respectively; and
      2.   If overhead placement is necessary, utility facility crossings must
minimize visibility of the facility from the river and follow other existing
right of ways as much as practicable.
      3.   The appearance of structures must be as compatible as practicable
with the surrounding area in a natural state with regard to height and width,
materials used, and color.
      4.   Wireless communication facilities, according to section
10-13C-5B6.
   F.   Public transportation facilities. Public transportation facilities
shall comply with structure placement and height standards in section 10-13C-
6:. Where such facilities intersect or about two or more MRCCA districts, the
least restrictive standards apply. Public transportation facilities must be
designed and constructed to give priority to:
      1.   Providing scenic overlooks for motorists, bicyclists, and
pedestrians;
      2.   Providing safe pedestrian crossings and facilities along the river
corridor;
      3.   Providing access to the riverfront in public ownership; and
      4.   Allowing for use of the land between the river and the
transportation facility.
   G.   Public recreational facilities. Public recreational facilities must
comply with the following standards:
      1.   Buildings and parking associated with pubic recreational facilities

10-13C-12:;
      2.   Roads and driveways associated with public recreational facilities
must not be placed in the bluff or shore impact zones unless no other placement
alternative exists. If no alternative exists, then design and construction must
minimize impacts to shoreline vegetation, erodible soils and slopes, and other
sensitive resources.
      3.   Trails, access paths, and viewing areas associated with public
recreational facilities and providing access to or views of the Mississippi
River are allowed within the bluff and shore impact zones if design,
construction, and maintenance methods are consistent with the best management
practice guidelines in Trail Planning, Design, and Development Guidelines.

soil stability, runoff retention, and infiltration capability. Vegetation
species, composition, density, and diversity must be guided by nearby patches
of native plant communities and by Native Vegetation Establishment and
Enhancement Guidelines;
         c.   Any highly erodible soils disturbed during removal and/or
restoration must be stabilized with deep-rooted vegetation with a high stem
density;
         d.   Vegetation removed must be restored with native vegetation to the
greatest extent practicable. The area (square feet) of the restored vegetation
should be similar to that removed to the greatest extent practicable.
         e.   For restoration of removed native plant communities, restored
vegetation must also provide biological and ecological function equivalent to
the removed native plant communities. The area (square feet) of the restored
vegetation should be equivalent to that removed. Restoration plans should be
prepared by a qualified individual and include a maintenance plan with
management provisions for controlling invasive species and replacement of plant
loss for three years.

10-13C-11: SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
   A.   Purpose.
      1.   To protect and enhance the natural and scenic values of the MRCCA
during development or redevelopment of the remaining large sites
      2.   To establish standards for protecting and restoring biological and
ecological functions of primary conservation areas on large sites; and
      3.   To encourage restoration of natural vegetation during development or
redevelopment of large sites where restoration opportunities have been
identified in MRCCA Plans.
   B.   Applicability.
      1.   The design standards in this section apply to subdivisions, planned
unit developments and master- planned development and redevelopment of land
involving ten or more acres for contiguous parcels that abut the Mississippi
River and twenty (20) or more acres for all other parcels, including smaller
individual sites within the following developments that are part of a common
plan of development that may be constructed at different times:
         a.   Subdivisions;
         b.   Planned unit developments; and
         c.   Master-planned development and redevelopment of land.
      2.   The following activities are exempt from the requirements of this
section:
         a.   Minor subdivisions consisting of three or fewer lots;
         b.   Minor boundary line corrections;
         c.   Resolutions of encroachments;
         d.   Additions to existing lots of record;
         e.   Placement of essential services; and
         f.   Activities involving river-dependent commercial and industrial
uses.
      3.   Where provisions of section 10-13C-11 are conflicting with Title 11
Subdivision Regulations, the more restrictive provision shall apply.
   C.   Application materials. Project information listed in Section
10-13C-3H must be submitted for all proposed developments.
   D.   Design standards.
      1.   Primary conservation areas, where they exist, must be set aside and
designated as protected open space in quantities meeting the following as a
percentage of total parcel area:
         a.   CA-ROS District: fifty percent (50%);
         b.   CA-RN District: twenty percent (20%);
         c.   CA-UM District: ten percent (10%); and
         d.   CA-SR District: ten percent (10%) if the parcel includes native
plant communities or provides feasible connections to a regional park or trail
system, otherwise no requirement.
      2.   If the primary conservation areas exceed the amounts specified in
Section 10-13C-11 D1, then protection of native plant communities and natural
vegetation in riparian areas shall be prioritized.
      3.   If primary conservation areas exist but do not have natural
vegetation (identified as restoration priorities in the MRCCA Plan), then a
vegetation assessment must be completed to evaluate the unvegetated primary
conservation areas and determine whether vegetation restoration is needed. If
restoration is needed, vegetation must be restored according to section
10-13C-9F.
      4.   If primary conservation areas do not exist on the parcel and
portions of the parcel have been identified in the MRCCA plan as a restoration
area, vegetation must be restored in the identified areas according to section
10-13C-9F and the area must be set aside and designated as protected open
space.
      5.   Storm water treatment areas or other green infrastructure may be
used to meet the protected open space requirements if the vegetation provides
biological and ecological functions.
      6.   Land dedicated for public river access, parks, or other open space
or public facilities may be counted toward the protected open space
requirement.
      7.   Protected open space areas must connect open space, natural areas,
and recreational areas, where present on adjacent parcels, as much as possible
to form an interconnected network.
   E.   Permanent protection of designated open space.
      1.   Designated open space areas must be protected through one or more of
the following methods:
         a.   Public acquisition by a government entity for conservation
purposes;
         b.   A permanent conservation easement, as provided in Minnesota
Statutes, chapter 84C;
         c.   A deed restriction; and
         d.   Other arrangements that achieve an equivalent degree of
protection.
      2.   Permanent protection methods must ensure the long-term management of
vegetation to meet its biological and ecological functions, prohibit
structures, and prohibit land alteration, except as needed to provide public
recreational facilities and access to the river.
   F.   Alternative design standards. The City will consider alternative design
standards through a Planned Unit Development (PUD) processed consistent with
Chapter 13 Article A of the zoning code. With using a PUD the city will
consider deviation from minimum lot sizes and lot dimension standards. Use of a
PUD within the MRCCA boundary shall include the following:
      1.   A demonstrated protection and restoration of continuous vegetation -
preventing the fragmentation of vegetation and habitat by individual lots,
especially along the river and natural drainage areas and protecting it as
common open space.
      2.   Protection of open space, particularly PCAs, beyond the minimum
identified in 10-13C-11 D 1. (Ord. 1429, 6-13-2022)

10-13D-1: STATUTE AUTHORITY:
The legislature of the state has, in Minnesota statutes chapter 103F and
section 462.357, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to
adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the city
council has adopted the provisions of this article. (Ord. 1243, 10-24-2011)
10-13D-2: FINDINGS OF FACT:
The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which
results in potential loss of life, loss of property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and government services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
(Ord. 1243, 10-24-2011)
10-13D-3: PURPOSE:
It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize those losses described in section 10-13D-2 of
this article by provisions contained in this article. (Ord. 1243, 10-24-2011)
10-13D-4: METHOD OF ANALYZING FLOOD HAZARDS:
This article is based upon a reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards,
which is consistent with the standards established by the Minnesota department
of natural resources. (Ord. 1243, 10-24-2011)
10-13D-5: NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM COMPLIANCE:
This article is adopted to comply with the rules and regulations of the
national flood insurance program codified as 44 code of federal regulations
parts 59-78, as amended, so as to maintain the community's eligibility in the
national flood insurance program. (Ord. 1243, 10-24-2011)
10-13D-6: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   A.    Application And Interpretation:
      1.    Application Of Provisions: This article shall apply to all lands
within the jurisdiction of the city as shown on the official zoning map as
being within the boundaries of the floodway or flood fringe district.
      2.    Minimum Requirements: In their interpretation and application, the
provisions of this article shall be held to be minimum requirements, and this
article shall be liberally construed in favor of the city council and shall not
be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes.
      3.    District Boundaries: The boundaries of the zoning districts shall
be determined by scaling distances on the official zoning map. Where
interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the
districts as shown on the official zoning map, as for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions
and there is a formal appeal of the decision of the zoning administrator, the
board of adjustments and appeals shall make the necessary interpretation. All
decisions will be based on elevations on the regional (100-year) flood profile,
the ground elevations that existed on the site at the time the community
adopted its initial floodplain ordinance or on the date of the first national
flood insurance program map showing the area within the 100-year floodplain if
earlier, and other available technical data. Persons contesting the location of
the district boundaries shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present
their case to the board and to submit technical evidence.
      4.    Abrogation And Greater Restrictions: It is not intended by this
article to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or
deed restrictions. However, where this article imposes greater restrictions,
the provisions of this article shall prevail.
   B.    Compliance Required: No new structure or land shall hereafter be used
and no new or existing structure shall be constructed, located, extended,
converted, or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of
this article and other applicable regulations which apply to uses within the
jurisdiction of this article. Within the floodway and flood fringe districts,
all uses not listed as permitted uses or conditional uses within sections
10-13D-7-1 and
10-13D-7-2 of this article, respectively, shall be prohibited. In addition, a
caution is provided herein that:
      1.    New manufactured homes, replacement manufactured homes and certain
recreational vehicles are subject to the general provisions of this article
and, specifically, section 10-13D-12 of this article;
      2.    Modifications, additions, structural alterations, normal
maintenance and repair, or repair after damage to existing nonconforming
structures and nonconforming uses of structures or land are regulated by the
general provisions of this article and, specifically, subsection D of this
section; and
      3.    As built elevations for elevated or floodproofed structures must be
certified by ground surveys, and floodproofing techniques must be designed and
certified by a registered professional engineer or architect as specified in
the general provisions of this article and, specifically, as stated in
subsection 10-13D-13B5 of this article.
   C.    Zoning Map Adopted: The official zoning map, together with all
materials attached thereto, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a
part of this article. The attached material shall include the flood insurance
study for Dakota County, Minnesota, and incorporated areas, flood insurance
rate map panels therein numbered 27037C0043E, 27037C0107E, 27037C0109E,
27037C0117E and 27037C0119E and the flood insurance rate map index (map number
27037CIND4A), all dated December 2, 2011, and prepared by the federal emergency
management agency. The official zoning map shall be on file in the office of
the city clerk and the zoning administrator.
   D.    Nonconforming Uses: A structure or the use of a structure or premises
which was lawful before the effective date hereof but which is not in
conformity with the provisions of this article may be continued subject to the
following conditions. Historic structures as defined in 44 code of federal
regulations, part 59.1, shall be subject to the provisions of subsections D1
through D6 of this section:
      1.    No such use shall be expanded, changed, enlarged, or altered in a
way which increases its nonconformity.
      2.    Any structural alteration or addition to a nonconforming structure
or nonconforming use which would result in increasing the flood damage
potential of that structure or use shall be protected to the regulatory flood
protection elevation in accordance with any of the elevation on fill or
floodproofing techniques (i.e., FP-1 through FP-4 floodproofing
classifications) allowable in the state building code, except as further
restricted in subsection D3 of this section.
      3.    If a substantial improvement occurs only from a building addition,
then the building addition must meet the elevation on fill or FP-1 or FP-2 dry
floodproofing requirements of section 10-13D-7-1 or 10-13D-7-2 of this article
for new structures and the existing structure must also meet the elevation on
fill or FP-1 or FP-2 dry floodproofing requirements of section 10-13D-7-1 or
10-13D-7-2 of this article for new structures if any alteration is made to the
common wall in excess of installing a standard doorway.
      4.    If any nonconforming use is discontinued for twelve (12)
consecutive months, any future use of the building premises shall conform to
this article. The assessor shall notify the zoning administrator in writing of
instances of nonconforming uses that have been discontinued for a period of
twelve (12) months.
      5.    If any nonconforming use or structure is substantially damaged, as
defined in section
10-2-2 of this title, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with
the provisions of this title. The applicable provisions for establishing new
uses or structures in sections
10-13D-7-1 and
10-13D-7-2 of this article will apply, depending upon whether the use or
structure is in the floodway or flood fringe, respectively.
      6.    If a "substantial improvement" occurs, as defined in section
10-2-2 of this title, from any combination of a building addition to the
outside dimensions of the existing building or a rehabilitation,
reconstruction, alteration or other improvement to the inside dimensions of an
existing nonconforming building, then the building addition and the existing
nonconforming building must meet the requirements of sections
10-13D-7-1 and
10-13D-7-2 of this article for new structures, depending upon whether the
structure is in the floodway or flood fringe district, respectively.
   E.    Warning And Disclaimer Of Liability: This article does not imply that
areas outside the floodplain districts, or land uses permitted within such
districts, will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not
create liability on the part of the city or any officer or employee thereof for
any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any
administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.
   F.    Annexations: The flood insurance rate map panels adopted by reference
into subsection C of this section may include floodplain areas that lie outside
of the corporate boundaries of the city of Inver Grove Heights at the time of
adoption of this article. If any of these floodplain land areas are annexed
into the city of Inver Grove Heights after the adoption date hereof, the newly
annexed floodplain lands shall be subject to the provisions of this article
immediately upon the date of annexation into the city of Inver Grove Heights.
(Ord. 1243, 10-24-2011)
10-13D-7: DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED:
The floodplain areas within the jurisdiction of this article are hereby divided
into two (2) districts: floodway district (FW) and flood fringe district (FF).
   A.    Floodway District: The floodway district shall include those areas
designated as floodway on the flood insurance rate maps adopted in subsection
10-13D-6C of this article.
   B.    Flood Fringe District: The flood fringe district shall include those
areas designated as floodway fringe on the flood insurance rate maps adopted in
subsection 10-13D-6C of this article. (Ord. 1243, 10-24-2011)
10-13D-7-1: FW FLOODWAY DISTRICT:
   A.    Permitted Uses:
      1.    Enumerated:
General farming, pasture, grazing, outdoor plant nurseries, horticulture, truck
farming, forestry, sod farming, and wild crop harvesting.
Industrial-commercial loading areas, parking areas, and airport landing strips.
Private and public golf courses, tennis courts, driving ranges, archery ranges,
picnic grounds, boat launching ramps, swimming areas, parks, wildlife and
nature preserves, game farms, fish hatcheries, shooting preserves, target
ranges, trap and skeet ranges, hunting and fishing areas, and single or
multiple purpose recreational trails.
Residential lawns, gardens, parking areas and play areas.
Other uses listed as permitted uses by the underlying zoning district but not
permitted by this subsection shall be prohibited in the floodway district.
      2.    Standards:
         a.    The use shall have a low flood damage potential.
         b.    The use shall be permissible in the underlying zoning district
if one exists.
         c.    The use shall not obstruct flood flows or increase flood
elevation and shall not involve structures, fill, obstructions, excavations or
storage of materials or equipment.
   B.    Conditional Uses:
      1.    Enumerated:
Extraction and storage of sand, gravel, and other materials.
Marinas, boat rentals, docks, piers, wharves, and water control structures.
Placement of fill or construction of fences.
Railroads, streets, bridges, utility transmission lines, and pipelines.
Recreational vehicles either on individual lots of record or in existing or new
subdivisions or commercial or condominium type campgrounds, subject to the
exemptions and provisions of section 10-13D-12 of this article.
Storage yards for equipment, machinery or materials.
Structural works for flood control such as levees, dikes and floodwalls,
constructed to any height where the intent is to protect individual structures
and levees or dikes where the intent is to protect agricultural crops for a
frequency flood event equal to or less than the 10-year frequency flood event.
Structures accessory to the uses listed in subsection A of this section and in
the above entries in this subsection B1.
Other uses listed as conditional uses by the underlying zoning district but not
allowed by this subsection B1 shall be prohibited in the floodway district.
      2.    Standards:
         a.    No structure (temporary or permanent), fill (including fill for
roads and levees), deposit, obstruction, storage of materials or equipment, or
other uses may be allowed as a conditional use that will cause any increase in
the stage of the 100-year or regional flood or cause an increase in flood
damages in the reach or reaches affected.
         b.    All floodway conditional uses shall be subject to the procedures
and standards contained in subsection 10-13D-13B4 of this article.
         c.    The conditional use shall be permissible in the underlying
zoning district.
         d.    (1) Fill, dredge spoil and all other similar materials deposited
or stored in the floodplain shall be protected from erosion by vegetative
cover, mulching, riprap or other acceptable method.
            (2)    Dredge spoil sites and sand and gravel operations shall not
be allowed in the floodway unless a long term site development plan is
submitted which includes an erosion/sedimentation prevention element to the
plan.
            (3)    As an alternative, and consistent with subsection B2d(2) of
this section, dredge spoil disposal and sand and gravel operations may allow
temporary, on site storage of fill or other materials which would have caused
an increase to the stage of the 100-year or regional flood but only after the
city council has received an appropriate plan which assures the removal of the
materials from the floodway based upon the flood warning time available. The
conditional use permit must be title registered with the property in the office
of the county recorder.
            (4)    
Title 9, chapter 4 of this code shall apply to all fill and excavation
activities within the floodway district.
         e.    (1) Accessory structures shall not be designed for human
habitation.
            (2)    Accessory structures, if permitted, shall be constructed and
placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the flow
of floodwaters.
               (A) Whenever possible, structures shall be constructed with the
longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow; and
               (B) As far as practicable, structures shall be placed
approximately on the same flood flow lines as those of adjoining structures.
            (3)    Accessory structures shall be elevated on fill or
structurally dry floodproofed in accordance with the FP-1 or FP-2 floodproofing
classifications in the state building code. As an alternative, an accessory
structure may be floodproofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 floodproofing classification
in the state building code, provided the accessory structure constitutes a
minimal investment, does not exceed five hundred (500) square feet in size at
its largest projection, and for a detached garage, the detached garage must be
used solely for parking of vehicles and limited storage. All floodproofed
accessory structures must meet the following additional standards:
               (A) The structure must be adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure and shall be designed
to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls;
               (B) Any mechanical and utility equipment in a structure must be
elevated to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or properly
floodproofed; and
               (C) To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there
must be a minimum of two (2) "automatic" openings in the outside walls of the
structure having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every
square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. There must be openings on at
least two (2) sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings must be no
higher than one foot (1') above the lowest adjacent grade to the structure.
Using human intervention to open a garage door prior to flooding will not
satisfy this requirement for automatic openings.
         f.    (1)   The storage or processing of materials that are, in time
of flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal or
plant life is prohibited.
            (2)    Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if
readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning
and in accordance with a plan approved by the city council as part of the
conditional use permit.
         g.    Structural works for flood control that will change the course,
current or cross section of a protected wetlands or public waters shall be
subject to the provisions of Minnesota statutes chapters 103A, 103B, 103C,
103D, 103E, 103F and 103G. Community wide structural works for flood control
intended to remove areas from the regulatory floodplain shall not be allowed in
the floodway.
         h.    A levee, dike or floodwall constructed in the floodway shall not
cause an increase to the 100-year or regional flood, and the technical analysis
must assume equal conveyance or storage loss on both sides of a stream. (Ord.
1243, 10-24-2011)
10-13D-7-2: FF FLOOD FRINGE DISTRICT:
   A.    Permitted Uses:
      1.    Enumerated: Permitted uses shall be those uses or structures listed
as permitted uses in the underlying zoning district(s). All permitted uses
shall comply with the standards for flood fringe district permitted uses and
the standards for all flood fringe uses listed below.
      2.    Standards:
         a.    All structures, including accessory structures, must be elevated
on fill so that the lowest floor including basement floor is at or above the
regulatory flood protection elevation. The finished fill elevation for
structures shall be no lower than one foot (1') below the regulatory flood
protection elevation and the fill (maximum 4:1 slope) shall extend such
elevation at least fifteen feet (15') beyond the outside limits of the
structure erected thereon.
         b.    As an alternative to elevation on fill, accessory structures
that constitute a minimal investment and that do not exceed five hundred (500)
square feet at its largest projection may be internally floodproofed in
accordance with subsection
10-13D-7-1B2e(3) of this article.
         c.    The cumulative placement of fill where at any one time in excess
of one thousand (1,000) cubic yards of fill is located on the parcel shall be
allowable only as a conditional use unless said fill is specifically intended
to elevate a structure in accordance with subsection A2a of this section.
Title 9, chapter 4 of this code shall also apply to all fill and excavation
activities regardless of the quantitative amount of material.
         d.    The storage of any materials or equipment shall be elevated on
fill to the regulatory flood protection elevation.
         e.    The provisions of subsection C of this section shall apply.
   B.    Conditional Uses:
      1.    Enumerated: Conditional uses shall be those uses of land or
structures listed as conditional uses in the underlying zoning district(s) or
other applicable zoning overlay district(s).
         a.    Any structure not elevated on fill or floodproofed in accordance
with subsections A2a and A2b of this section and/or any use of land that does
not comply with the standards in subsections A2c and A2d of this section shall
only be allowed as a conditional use. An application for a conditional use
shall be subject to the standards and criteria and evaluation procedures
specified in subsections B2 of this section and
10-13D-13B4 of this article.
      2.    Standards:
         a.    Alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill may be
utilized to elevate a structure's lowest floor above the regulatory flood
protection elevation. These alternative methods may include the use of stilts,
pilings, parallel walls, etc., or above grade, enclosed areas such as crawl
spaces or tuck under garages. The base or floor of an enclosed area shall be
considered above grade and not a structure's basement or lowest floor, if: 1)
the enclosed area is above grade on at least one side of the structure; 2) it
is designed to internally flood and is constructed with flood resistant
materials; and 3) it is used solely for parking of vehicles, building access or
storage. These alternative elevation methods are subject to the following
additional standards:
            (1)    Design And Certification: A structure's design and as built
condition must be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect
as being in compliance with the general design standards of the state building
code and, specifically, that all electrical, plumbing and air conditioning
equipment and other service facilities must be at or above the regulatory flood
protection elevation or be designed to prevent floodwater from accumulating
within these components during times of flooding.
            (2)    Specific Standards For Above Grade, Enclosed Areas: Above
grade, fully enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages must be
designed to internally flood, and design plans must stipulate:
   (A) A minimum area of openings in the walls where internal flooding is to be
used as a floodproofing technique. There shall be a minimum of two (2) openings
on at least two (2) sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings shall
be no higher than one foot (1') above grade. The automatic openings shall have
a minimum net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of
enclosed area subject to flooding unless a registered professional engineer or
architect certifies that a smaller net area would suffice. The automatic
openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or
devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters
without any form of human intervention; and
   (B) That the enclosed area will be designed of flood resistant materials in
accordance with the FP-3 or FP-4 classifications in the state building code and
shall be used solely for building access, parking of vehicles or storage.
         b.    Basements, as defined by section
10-2-2 of this title, shall be subject to the following:
            (1)    Residential basement construction shall not be allowed below
the regulatory flood protection elevation.
            (2)    Nonresidential basements may be allowed below the regulatory
flood protection elevation, provided the basement is structurally dry
floodproofed in accordance with subsection 10-13D-6B3 of this article.
         c.    All areas on nonresidential structures including basements to be
placed below the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be floodproofed in
accordance with the structurally dry floodproofing classification in the state
building code. Structurally dry floodproofing must meet the FP-1 or FP-
2 floodproofing classification in the state building code, and this shall
require making the structure watertight with the walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of
buoyancy. Structures floodproofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 classification shall not
be permitted.
         d.    When at any one time more than one thousand (1,000) cubic yards
of fill or other similar material is located on a parcel for such activities as
on site storage, landscaping, sand and gravel operations, land fills, road,
dredge spoil disposal or construction of flood control works, an erosion/
sedimentation control plan must be submitted unless the city is enforcing a
state approved shoreland management ordinance. In the absence of a state
approved shoreland ordinance, the plan must clearly specify methods to be used
to stabilize the fill on site for a flood event at a minimum of the 100-year or
regional flood event. The plan must be prepared and certified by a registered
professional engineer or other qualified individual acceptable to the city
council. The plan may incorporate alternative procedures for removal of the
material from the floodplain if adequate flood warning time exists.
         e.    (1) The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of
flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal or
plant life is prohibited.
            (2)    Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if
readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning
and in accordance with a plan approved by the city council as part of the
conditional use permit.
         f.    The provisions of subsection C of this section shall also apply.
   C.    Standards For All Flood Fringe Uses:
      1.    All new principal structures must have vehicular access at or above
an elevation not more than two feet (2') below the regulatory flood protection
elevation.
      2.    Accessory land uses, such as yards, railroad tracks, and parking
lots, may be at elevations lower than the regulatory flood protection
elevation. However, a permit for such facilities to be used by the employees or
the general public shall not be granted in the absence of a flood warning
system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area would be
inundated to a depth and velocity such that when multiplying the depth (in
feet) times velocity (in feet per second) the product number exceeds four (4)
upon occurrence of the regional flood.
      3.    Measures shall be taken to minimize interference with normal plant
operations especially along streams having protracted flood durations. Certain
accessory land uses such as yards and parking lots may be at lower elevations
subject to requirements set out in subsection C2 of this section. In
considering permit applications, due consideration shall be given to needs of
an industry whose business requires that it be located in floodplain areas.
      4.    Fill shall be properly compacted, and the slopes shall be properly
protected by the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable method.
The federal emergency management agency (FEMA) has established criteria for
removing the special flood hazard area designation for certain structures
properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation. FEMA requirements
incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection standards for
multistructure or multilot developments. These standards should be investigated
prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of special flood hazard
area designation will be requested.
      5.    Floodplain developments shall not adversely affect the hydraulic
capacity of the channel and adjoining floodplain of any tributary watercourse
or drainage system where a floodway or other encroachment limit has not been
specified on the official zoning map.
      6.    Standards for recreational vehicles are contained in section 10-
13D-12 of this article.
      7.    All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system that resists flotation, collapse and lateral
movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over
the top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to
applicable state or local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
(Ord. 1243, 10-24-2011)
10-13D-8: SUBDIVISIONS:
   A.    No land shall be subdivided which is unsuitable for the reason of

building site outside of the floodway district at or above the regulatory flood
protection elevation.
   C.    All subdivisions shall have water and sewage treatment facilities that
comply with the provisions of this article and have road access both to the
subdivision and to the individual building sites no lower than two feet (2')
below the regulatory flood protection elevation.
   D.    For all subdivisions, the floodway and flood fringe boundaries, the
regulatory flood protection elevation and the required elevation of all access
roads shall be clearly labeled on all required subdivision drawings and
platting documents.
   E.    All subdivisions shall be in conformance with title 11 of this code
and other applicable zoning and zoning overlay districts. (Ord. 1243, 10-24-
2011)
10-13D-9: REMOVAL OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA DESIGNATION:
The federal emergency management agency (FEMA) has established criteria for
removing the special flood hazard area designation for certain structures
properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation. FEMA requirements
incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection standards for
multistructure or multilot developments. These standards should be investigated
prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of special flood hazard
area designation will be required. (Ord. 1243, 10-24-2011)
10-13D-10: PUBLIC UTILITIES AND TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES:
   A.    Public Utilities: All public utilities and facilities such as gas,
electrical, sewer, and water supply systems to be located in the floodplain
shall be floodproofed in accordance with the state building code or elevated to
above the regulatory flood protection elevation.
   B.    Public Transportation Facilities: Railroad tracks, roads and bridges
to be located within the floodplain shall comply with sections
10-13D-7-1 and
10-13D-7-2 of this article. Elevation to the regulatory flood protection
elevation shall be provided where failure or interruption of these
transportation facilities would result in danger to the public health or safety
or where such facilities are essential to the orderly functioning of the area.
Minor or auxiliary railroads may be constructed at a lower elevation where
failure or interruption of transportation services would not endanger the
public health or safety. (Ord. 1243, 10-24-2011)
10-13D-11: ON SITE SEWAGE TREATMENT AND WATER SYSTEMS:
Where public utilities are not provided: a) on site water supply systems must
be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the
systems; and b) new or replacement on site sewage treatment systems must be
designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems
and discharges from the systems into the floodwaters, and they shall not be
subject to impairment or contamination during times of flooding. Any sewage
treatment system designed in accordance with the state's current statewide
standards for on site sewage treatment systems shall be determined to be in
compliance with this article. (Ord. 1243, 10-24-2011)

home parks shall be subject to section 10-13D-7-2 of this article, chapter 9,
article D and chapter 15, article H of this title.
      3.    The placement of new or replacement manufactured homes in existing
manufactured home parks or on individual lots of record that are located in the
floodplain districts will be treated as a new structure and may be placed only
if elevated in compliance with subsection 10-13D-7-2C of this article. If
vehicular road access for preexisting manufactured home parks is not provided
in accordance with subsection 10-13D-7-2C1 of this article, then replacement
manufactured homes will not be allowed until the property owner(s) develops a
flood warning emergency plan acceptable to the city council.
      4.    All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system that resists flotation, collapse and lateral
movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to: use of over
the top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to
applicable state or local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
   B.    Recreational Vehicles:
      1.    Recreational vehicles that do not meet the exemption criteria
specified in subsection B2 of this section shall be subject to the provisions
of this article.

         b.    Existing condominium type associations.
         c.    Existing commercial recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds.
      4.    Recreational vehicles exempted from this article lose this
exemption when development occurs on the parcel exceeding five hundred dollars
($500.00) for a structural addition to the recreational vehicle or the
construction of an accessory structure such as a garage or storage building.
The recreational vehicle and all additions and accessory structures will then
be treated as a new structure and shall be subject to the elevation/
floodproofing requirements and use of land restrictions specified in sections
10-13D-7-1 and
10-13D-7-2 of this article. There shall be no development or improvement on the
parcel or attachment to the recreational vehicle that hinders the removal of
the recreational vehicle to a flood free location should flooding occur.
      5.    New commercial recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds and new
residential type subdivisions and condominium associations and the expansion of
any existing similar use exceeding five (5) units or dwelling sites shall be
subject to the following:
         a.    Any new or replacement recreational vehicle will be allowed in
the floodway or flood fringe district, provided said recreational vehicle and
its contents are placed on fill above the regulatory flood protection elevation
and properly elevated road access to the site exists in accordance with
subsection
10-13D-7-2C1 of this article. Any fill placed in a floodway for the purpose of
elevating a recreational vehicle shall be subject to the requirements of
section
10-13D-6 of this article.
         b.    All new or replacement recreational vehicles not meeting the
criteria of subsection B5a of this section, may, as an alternative, be allowed
as a conditional use if in accordance with the following provisions and the
provisions of subsection
10-13D-7-2B2 of this article. The applicant must submit an emergency plan for
the safe evacuation of all vehicles and people during the 100-year flood. Said
plan shall be prepared by a registered engineer or other qualified individual
and shall demonstrate that adequate time and personnel exist to carry out the
evacuation, and shall demonstrate the provisions of subsection B2 of this
section will be met. All attendant sewage and water facilities for new or
replacement recreational vehicles must be protected or constructed so as to not
be impaired or contaminated during times of flooding in accordance with section
10-13D-11 of this article. (Ord. 1243, 10-24-2011)
10-13D-13: ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT:
   A.    Administration And Enforcement Officials:
      1.    Zoning Administrator: The city planner, or other person so
designated by the city council, shall be the zoning administrator for the
purposes of the administration of this article.

provisions of this article shall be required prior to the erection, addition,
modification, rehabilitation (including normal maintenance and repair) or
alteration of any building, structure, or portion thereof; prior to the use or
change of use of a building, structure, or land; prior to the construction of a
dam, fence, or on site septic system; prior to the change or extension of a
nonconforming use; prior to the repair of a structure that has been damaged by
flood, fire, tornado, or any other source; and prior to the placement of fill,
excavation materials, or the storage of materials or equipment within the
floodplain. Said permit must be approved by the chief building official only
after review by the zoning administrator. A building permit must also be
approved in the same manner prior to the change of use of a building or land.
      2.    Fill/Excavation Permits: Prior to the placement of fill or the
excavation of material within the floodplain, an excavation permit pursuant to
title 9, chapter 4 of this code must be approved by the director of public
works only after review by the zoning administrator. Said permit must be found
to be in conformance with the provisions of this article.
      3.    State And Federal Permits: Prior to granting a building permit,
excavation permit, conditional use permit, variance or subdivision approval,
the applicant shall provide verification to the zoning administrator that all
necessary state and federal permits have been obtained.

mail to the commissioner of natural resources within ten (10) days of such
action.
      6.    The zoning administrator shall notify the applicant for a variance
that: a) the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood level will result in an increased premium rate for flood insurance up to
amounts as high as twenty five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars
($100.00) of insurance coverage; and b) such construction below the 100-year or
regional flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification
shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions.
      7.    The zoning administrator shall submit an annual report of all
variance actions during that year to the administrator of the national flood
insurance program.
      8.    The following additional variance criteria of the federal emergency
management agency must be satisfied:
         a.    Variances shall not be issued within any designated regulatory
floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
         b.    Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
         c.    Variances shall only be issued by a community upon: 1) showing a
good and sufficient cause, 2) a determination that failure to grant the
variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and 3) a
determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased
flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public
expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or
conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
   D.    Amendments:
      1.    The floodplain designation on the official zoning map shall not be
removed from floodplain areas unless it can be shown that the designation is in
error or that the area has been filled to or above the elevation of the
regulatory flood protection elevation and is contiguous to lands outside the
floodplain. Special exceptions to this rule may be permitted by the
commissioner of natural resources if he determines that, through other
measures, lands are adequately protected for the intended use.
      2.    All amendments to this article, including amendments to the
official zoning map, must be submitted to and approved by the commissioner of
natural resources prior to adoption.
      3.    Changes in the official zoning map must meet the federal emergency
management agency's (FEMA) technical conditions and criteria and must receive
prior FEMA approval before adoption. The commissioner of natural resources must
be given ten (10) days' written notice of all hearings to consider an amendment
to this article, and said notice shall include a draft of the amendment or
technical study under consideration.
   E.    Violations And Enforcement:
      1.    Violation of the provisions of this article or failure to comply
with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards
established in connection with grants of variances or conditional use permits)
shall constitute a misdemeanor and shall be punishable as defined by law.
      2.    Nothing contained herein shall prevent the city council from taking
such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.
Such actions may include, but are not limited to:
         a.    In responding to a suspected violation of this article, the
zoning administrator and city council may utilize the full array of enforcement
actions available to it including, but not limited to, prosecution and fines,
injunctions, after the fact permits, orders for corrective measures or a
request to the national flood insurance program for denial of flood insurance
availability to the guilty party. The community must act in good faith to
enforce these official controls and to correct ordinance violations to the
extent possible so as not to jeopardize its eligibility in the national flood
insurance program.
         b.    When violation of this article is either discovered by or
brought to the attention of the zoning administrator, the zoning administrator
shall immediately investigate the situation and document the nature and extent
of the violation of the official control. As soon as is reasonably possible,
this information will be submitted to the appropriate department of natural
resources and federal emergency management agency regional office along with
the city's plan of action to correct the violation to the degree possible.
         c.    The zoning administrator shall notify the suspected party of the
requirements of this article and all other official controls and the nature and
the extent of the suspected violation of these controls. If the structure and/
or use is under construction or development, the zoning administrator may order
the construction or development immediately halted until a proper permit or
approval is granted by the city council. If construction or development is
already completed, then the zoning administrator may either: 1) issue an order
identifying the corrective actions that must be made within a specified time
period to bring the use or structure into compliance with the official
controls; or 2) notify the responsible party to apply for an after the fact
permit/development approval within a specified period of time not to exceed
thirty (30) days.
         d.    If the responsible party does not appropriately respond to the
zoning administrator within the specified period of time, each additional day
that lapses shall constitute an additional violation of this article and shall
be prosecuted accordingly. The zoning administrator shall also, upon the lapse
of the specified response period, notify the landowner to restore the land to
the condition that existed prior to the violation of this article. (Ord. 1243,

10-13E-4 Boundaries
10-13E-5 Effect Upon Underlying Districts
10-13E-6 Conditional Uses
10-13E-7 Prohibited Uses
10-13E-8 Legal Nonconforming Prohibited Uses
10-13E-9 Review Criteria
10-13E-1: FINDINGS:
Mixed municipal solid waste landfills have the potential to cause negative
environmental impacts relating to storm water quality, ground water quality,
air emissions, aesthetics, general community and neighborhood image, and public
nuisances. As a result, the city has found that many land uses are not
compatible with and will not locate adjacent to or near a mixed municipal solid
waste landfill. This tends to restrict development opportunities on surrounding
properties, thus hindering the expansion of the city's commercial/industrial
tax base and employment opportunities. It also causes a public concern that
landfill expansion may be proposed for such undeveloped areas.
   A.    The city specifically finds that certain solid waste processing uses
are compatible with and may benefit from a location in proximity to a mixed
municipal solid waste landfill and other solid waste uses. This is evident from
the uses that have already been established near the Pine Bend mixed municipal
solid waste landfill and the continued interest on the part of other such uses
in the same area. The concentration of mixed municipal solid waste landfills
and solid waste facilities provides for: 1) effective and efficient public
facilities and services; 2) the potential for shared private facilities and
services; and 3) strong operational interrelationships. Concentrating solid
waste uses reduces the area of the city potentially subject to the negative
environmental impacts identified above from such facilities and enhances the
city's ability to protect the natural environment through monitoring,
regulation, and inspection of these uses. Furthermore, it is necessary to
further restrict the area in which solid waste uses are allowed and to continue
to place restrictions and conditions on these uses to protect the environment
and to promote sound land use planning.
   B.    The city also finds that the integrated resource management overlay
district boundaries encompass an area which is unique to the city. Since no
other area in the city exhibits these special characteristics, the district
boundaries will only be imposed within the defined boundaries and shall not be
expanded. The unique characteristics of this stated area include the following:
      1.    A concentration of existing solid waste facilities, including a
mixed municipal solid waste landfill, and other compatible heavy industries,
such as the Koch Refining Co. complex.
      2.    An area which is generally separated and buffered from surrounding
low density residential areas by large tracts of undeveloped or agricultural
lands.
      3.    An excellent transportation network, including railroads, a
regional highway, and a local collector street, that provides direct access to
the regional highway. This roadway system is undergoing improvements, such as
the recent intersection signals, frontage road, and intersection geometric
being installed at 117th Street. Further development of the transportation
system is anticipated, including additional frontage roads and an interchange.
      4.    Intensive environmental analysis and monitoring, including air
quality and ground water monitoring, that have occurred in recent years to
address environmental concerns.
      5.    A comprehensive plan land use designation of general industrial and
light industrial. This is further reflected in the I-1 and I-2 zoning of the
area.
      6.    Affordable land costs, due in part to the absence of sanitary
sewer, which makes the area suitable for those industries that require large
parcels but do not need city sewer services.
      7.    Level terrain with little vegetation that makes the area conducive
to large industrial facilities. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13E-2: PURPOSE:
The integrated resource management (IRM) overlay zoning district is created for
the following purposes:
   A.    Prevent the expansion of mixed municipal solid waste landfills by
encouraging industrial development on adjacent properties.
   B.    Encourage solid waste processing facilities, which can integrate their
operations with mixed municipal solid waste landfills to locate in proximity to
such landfills.
   C.    Promote orderly development of other properties in the community by
creating a buffer of compatible industrial development around mixed municipal
solid waste landfills.
   D.    Reduce the areas of the city subject to the potential adverse
environmental impacts of solid waste processing facilities by encouraging them
to locate in close proximity to mixed municipal solid waste landfills and each
other.
   E.    Delineate an area for select solid waste uses that exhibit minimal
environmental impacts and are generally environmentally friendly.
   F.    Provide an opportunity for solid waste uses that are consistent with
the state's waste management hierarchy of encouraging reduction, reuse,
recycling, composting, and discouraging incineration and landfilling.
   G.    Enhance regulation and inspection of solid waste processing facilities
by encouraging them to locate in proximity to one another.
   H.    Enhance the tax base by encouraging development around mixed municipal
solid waste landfills consistent with sound principles of municipal planning.
   I.    Provide additional employment opportunities for city residents by
encouraging industrial development.
   J.    Establish standards and restrictions for solid waste uses to protect
the environment and to promote sound land use planning. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)

10-13E-8: LEGAL NONCONFORMING PROHIBITED USES:
   A.    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this article, if
any of the prohibited uses listed in section 10-13E-7 of this article were
lawfully existing at the time the use became prohibited, either because of
adoption of this article, or any amendments hereto, then such use may continue
in the size and manner of operation lawfully existing or lawfully permitted to
exist upon the date such use became prohibited, but such uses shall not expand
or enlarge or add different types of waste.
   B.    If the owner or operator of an existing prohibited use applies for a
nonconforming use certificate, the application shall include the following
information in addition to the information normally required under chapter 16
of this title:
      1.    The types of prohibited use which existed on the effective date
hereof, which made the use prohibited.
      2.    The lot or lots owned or occupied by the use on the effective date
hereof, which made the use prohibited, with evidence of ownership or occupancy.
      3.    If the prohibited use is a landfill, the airspace authorized by the
metropolitan council or MOEA on the effective date hereof, which made the use
prohibited, with evidence of the metropolitan council or MOEA authorization.
      4.    If the prohibited use is a landfill, the remaining airspace
capacity last reported to the MPCA.
      5.    The waste types received by the facility on or prior to the
effective date hereof, which made the use prohibited, with evidence of receipt.
   C.    1. A number of factors make the prohibited uses unique from a land use
regulation standpoint including: a) the dynamic, evolutionary nature of solid
waste industry regulation; b) the overlapping regulations of various federal,
state, and local agencies which apply to a prohibited use; c) the differing
wastes disposed or processed now and in the past by prohibited uses; d) the
fluctuations in prohibited use disposal and processing rates; e) the number,
type, and intensity of accessory uses directly related to the prohibited uses;
f) the challenges posed to the city in monitoring and regulating a lawfully
existing prohibited use; and g) the many regulatory and financial uncertainties
which face the owner or operator of a lawfully existing prohibited use.
Therefore, the city council, sitting as the board of adjustments and appeals,
in approving a nonconforming use certificate, may include in the certificate,
by majority vote, provisions which vary from the requirements of sections
10-16-1 and
10-16-2 and subsection
10-16-4C of this title relating to nonconforming uses and structures and this
section relating to the continuation of lawfully existing prohibited uses. In
exercising this authority, the city council shall not: a) add a principal use
which did not legally exist on the property prior to the property becoming
nonconforming; b) enlarge the geographic boundaries of a nonconforming use
beyond the boundaries on the date the property became nonconforming; c) add to
the materials allowed to be processed or disposed on the property a major waste
category (e.g., industrial waste, hazardous waste) which was not processed or
disposed on the property prior to the property becoming nonconforming; or d) in
the case of landfills, add airspace capacity beyond the permitted capacity
which existed prior to the time the landfill became nonconforming.
      2.    Provided, however, with respect to demolition debris landfills
only, the city council, in approving a nonconforming use certificate, may
authorize the enlargement of the geographic boundaries where demolition debris
landfilling will occur and may authorize the enlargement of the air space
capacity as long as the following conditions are met:
         a.    Such expansions can only occur with respect to demolition debris
landfills;
         b.    The demolition debris landfill has obtained a nonconforming use
certificate;
         c.    The demolition debris landfill is in compliance with the
nonconforming use certificate;
         d.    The expansions shall only be granted one time; there shall be no
serial expansions;
         e.    The total airspace capacity of the entire demolition debris
landfill after the increase shall not exceed 3,928,280 cubic yards, not
including cover material;
         f.    The total geographic boundaries of the entire demolition debris
landfill after the increase where demolition debris landfill has and will occur
cannot exceed 29.4 acres;
         g.    The increased geographic area must be in the same fee ownership
as the rest of the demolition debris landfill;
         h.    The increased geographic area must be contiguous to the rest of
the demolition debris landfill;
         i.    The operator and the owner of the demolition debris landfill, as
a condition of approval relating to the expansions, must, in writing, agree to
close the entire demolition debris landfill, including the expanded areas, no
later than fifteen (15) years after the authorization for expansion is granted,
unless the council subsequently agrees to a longer duration;
         j.    The closure date for the entire landfill, including the expanded
areas, must be earlier than the date that the unexpanded landfill could have
closed under the nonconforming use rights of the unexpanded landfill; and
         k.    The council determines that the final grades, storm water
facilities and erosion control and mitigation measures for the expanded
landfill are more conducive to end use development and provide greater
protections than the grades, storm water facilities, and erosion control and
mitigation measures would have been with respect to the unexpanded landfill.
(Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13E-9: REVIEW CRITERIA:
For all conditional uses listed in this article, the following review criteria
shall be used to determine the acceptability of a proposed use. In addition,
the review criteria of chapter 3, article A of this title and this section
shall also be used to determine acceptability of a proposed use. The city
council may impose conditions and safeguards on a conditional use permit to
ensure the purpose and intent of this article are met. The review criteria of
this article are as follows:
   A.    All sites shall be landscaped in accordance with the city policy for
establishing minimum landscape standards and criteria for urban development.

This article is adopted pursuant to Minnesota statutes section 473.192,
metropolitan area aircraft noise attenuation act. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13F-2: FINDINGS:
The city finds that development within certain areas of the city is impacted by
aircraft noise; that said noise is beyond the regulatory authority of the city
to control; that certain uses of land are inappropriate in areas of high
aircraft noise; that some structures do not adequately attenuate aircraft noise
resulting in negative impacts on the health, safety and welfare of the
residents or inhabitants of the structures that, through proper construction
methods, the means exist to attenuate aircraft noise to interior levels which
alleviate such negative impacts; and that the requirements of this article are
necessary to promote and preserve the health, safety and welfare of the
citizens of the city. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)

The purpose of this article is to require that new or redeveloped buildings
within the city be constructed with materials and in such a manner that
aircraft noise is attenuated by the structure to an interior level which has no
adverse impact on the health, safety and general welfare of the residents, all
in accordance with the metropolitan council's guidelines for land use
compatibility with aircraft noise. These guidelines are part of the
transportation policy plan of the metropolitan development guide. (Ord. 1121,
11-28-2005)
10-13F-4: SCOPE AND EFFECT:
The aircraft noise zones established by this article shall overlay the zoning
districts so that any parcel of land lying in an overlay zone shall also lie in
one or more of the established zoning districts. Territory within a given
overlay zone shall be subject to the requirements established by the other
applicable ordinances and regulations of the city. Within each adopted overlay
zone, all uses shall be permitted in accordance with the regulations for the
underlying zoning districts; provided, however, that the appropriate building
permit is first obtained; and provided further, that no use designated as
inconsistent on the noise compatibility table, and incorporated herein, shall
be permitted. This article applies to all construction requiring a building
permit after the effective date hereof except decks, patios, swimming pools,
breezeways and similar outdoor uses and remodeling or rehabilitation of an
existing residential building, nor to the construction of an appurtenance to an
existing residential building. In the case of conflict between this article and
any other applicable codes or ordinances, the more restrictive requirement
shall be met. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13F-5: PREREQUISITES TO ISSUANCE OF BUILDING OR OCCUPANCY PERMIT:
Any application for a city building or occupancy permit pertaining to land
located in an aircraft noise zone must demonstrate compliance with the
provisions of this article prior to the issuance of such permit. Moreover, any
application for a building or occupancy permit pertaining to land located in
the aircraft buffer zone is encouraged to incorporate those provisions of this
article which apply to noise zone 4 into building plans. (Ord. 1121, 11-28-
2005)
10-13F-6: AIRCRAFT NOISE ZONES:
   A.    Established: The following aircraft noise zones are hereby established
as part of this title. These zones apply to the following airports:
Minneapolis-St. Paul International and South St. Paul municipal airports.
Aircraft buffer zone DNL < 60
   B.    Boundaries: The boundaries of the aircraft noise zones are as
delineated on the overlay district map of the city zoning map. (Ord. 1121, 11-
28-2005)
10-13F-7: NOISE COMPATIBILITY TABLES:
The noise compatibility table is adapted from the metropolitan council's
guidelines for land use compatibility with aircraft noise. The noise reduction
level numbers, expressed in dBA, specify for each type of land use the amount
of interior sound level reduction necessary for the use to be compatible in the
applicable aircraft noise zone. All construction or reconstruction requiring a
building permit and located within an aircraft noise zone (except remodeling or
rehabilitation of an existing residential building) shall be constructed in
such a way that the applicable noise level reduction requirements contained in
the noise compatibility table is met or exceeded. Where a particular structure
contains different land uses, the more stringent requirements of the applicable
table shall apply, except where it is architecturally possible to achieve the
appropriate noise reduction level for each different use, and the uses are
acoustically separated by a wall or partition with a minimum STC of 25.

All applicants for a building or occupancy permit shall include with the
application all plans, specifications or other information required by this
article. The plans and specifications shall describe in sufficient detail all
pertinent features of the building, building materials, heating and ventilation
systems, including, but not limited, to the STC ratings of roof/ceilings,
walls, windows, and doors, and other pertinent data as may be requested by the
building official to indicate conformance with the applicable noise reduction
level requirements as specified in the noise compatibility tables. To assure
the elimination of sound leaks, the plans and specifications shall demonstrate
compliance with the following standards:
   A.    All mechanical ventilation systems shall be installed that will
provide the minimum air circulation and fresh air supply requirements as
provided in the uniform building code for the proposed occupancy without the
need to open any exterior doors or windows.
   B.    The perimeter of all exterior windows and doorframes shall be sealed
airtight to the exterior wall construction.
   C.    Fireplaces shall be equipped with well fitted chimney cap devices.
   D.    All ventilation ducts, except range hoods, connecting interior space
to outdoors shall be provided with a bend such that no direct line of sight
exists from exterior to interior through the vent duct.
   E.    Doors and windows shall be constructed so that they are close fitting.
Weather stripping seals shall be incorporated to eliminate all edge gaps.
   F.    1. All penetrations through exterior walls by pipes, ducts, conduits
and the like shall be caulked airtight to the exterior construction. The
building official may require that plans and specifications be certified by a
recognized acoustical specialist for compliance with this article.
      2.    Within thirty (30) days of receipt of appropriate plans and
specifications, the building official shall approve or reject the plans based
upon the ability of the proposed materials and construction techniques to
adequately attenuate noise. The building official shall approve the plans and
specifications if:
         a.    They adequately document the use of construction assemblies that
meet or exceed the STC ratings required by table A1 (subsection 10-13F-7A of
this article). If the window plus sliding glass door area is greater than
thirty percent (30%) of the exterior wall area, 3 STC units should be added to
the required window STC value. Patio doors should have a rating of STC 28 or
greater; or
         b.    They have been certified by a recognized acoustical specialist
as achieving the interior noise level reduction required by the applicable
portion of the noise compatibility table (subsection 10-13F-7A of this
article); or
         c.    They have completed an aircraft noise assessment of the
structure following procedures contained in the builder's guide and prepared a
completed plan review certifying that the plans and specifications will provide
the needed noise level reduction according to table A2 (subsection 10-13F-7B of
this article).
      3.    In the event that the drawings are rejected, the reasons for such
rejection shall be submitted to the applicant in writing. No construction shall
occur prior to the approval of appropriate plans and specifications. All
construction shall be performed in accordance with the approved plans and
specifications. Construction done in accordance with the approved plans and
specifications as determined by the building official shall be deemed to meet
the noise attenuation requirements of this article. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13F-9: INSPECTIONS:
   A.    All construction or work for which a building permit is required shall
be subject to inspections by the building official. Inspections of noise
attenuation work shall be performed during the required building construction
inspections specified by the city building code.
   B.    When inspection indicates that the construction is not in accordance
with the approved plans, the building official may order such corrective action
as may be necessary to meet the noise attenuation requirements of this article.
In lieu of performing such corrective action, a building owner may submit a
test report based upon field tests showing compliance with the noise reduction
level requirements contained in the applicable noise compatibility table. The
field test shall be performed in accordance with the American Society for
Testing Materials Standard E 336-849 part A. 1.2.2. "Outside To Inside (Level
Reduction)". (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13F-10: FEES:
The building official is authorized to collect fees to cover administrative and
enforcement costs. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13F-11: NOTICE TO LANDOWNERS:
For all plats approved within the aircraft buffer zone after November 28, 2005,
the city shall file a notice in the chain of title of each lot advising
landowners that their property lies within the aircraft buffer zone, and that
the city encourages all new buildings within the aircraft buffer zone to be
constructed according to the aircraft noise mitigation standards required of
property in aircraft noise zone 4. (Ord. 1121, 11-28-2005)
10-13F-12: ENFORCEMENT:

surroundings, and for the restoration of the mining area after termination of
the removal operation to make the site compatible with the surroundings and
suitable for the urban development.
   E.    Controlling pollution caused by erosion or sedimentation. (Ord. 1098,
11-8-2004)
10-13G-2: CRITERIA:
In establishing a sand and gravel zoning district, the council shall find that:
   A.    The excavation, mining or processing of sand and gravel deposits will
be conducted over a limited time and in such manner that the excavation or
processing will not adversely affect the existing or anticipated development
for adjacent properties.
   B.    The rehabilitation of the area is designed particularly for those uses
to be permitted after the expiration of the temporary sand and gravel zoning
district.
   C.    There are sand and gravel deposits of sufficient quantities and
quality to warrant a sand and gravel operation on a continuing basis over the
area designated sand and gravel district.
   D.    The rehabilitation of the area is designed so that it will not detract
therefrom or materially alter the development anticipated for adjacent
properties.
   E.    Existing uses within the area will not be adversely affected.
   F.    The area has direct access to streets or highways of sufficient
loading capacity to serve truck traffic generated by the sand and gravel
operation, and such traffic will not cause undue damage to city or county
streets or highways.
   G.    The processing and storing or stockpiling of excavated material will
be conducted and visually screened in such a manner so as not to create an
eyesore, a nuisance or otherwise adversely affect the surrounding area.
Screening required shall not be more restrictive than that required for the
permanent zoning district in which the sand and gravel operation is located.
(Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13G-3: PERMITTED USES:
In a temporary sand and gravel district (SG), no building or land shall be used
except for one or more of the following reasons:
The excavation or mining of sand and gravel deposits and such buildings and
equipment, including construction yard storage, as are customarily incidental
thereto. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13G-4: CONDITIONAL USES:
   A.    Purpose: Certain uses can be unsuitable in the sand and gravel
district because of inherent nuisance characteristics created by the uses or
other conditions existing in the district. However, under certain conditions,
these uses may be properly located and developed in the district.
   B.    Criteria: No conditional use shall be granted in the sand and gravel
district unless the council shall find that those criteria used in establishing
the district are met.
   C.    Grounds For Issuance Of Permit: If the above conditions are met,
conditional use permits may be issued for the following uses:
      1.    The processing of sand and gravel deposits and such buildings and
equipment as are customarily incidental thereto for a time period specified by
the council. This shall include, but not be limited to, asphalt plants, block
plants and concrete ready mix operations.
      2.    The permitted and conditional uses in the zoning district over
which the temporary sand and gravel district exists are subject to those
regulations as stated for that certain district. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13G-5: PERFORMANCE STANDARDS:
In the temporary sand and gravel district (SG) the following performance
standards shall be observed:
   A.    Development Plan: An overall development plan shall be submitted and
approved by the city. Such development plan shall indicate:
      1.    Site analysis information such as trees, depth of topsoil, adjacent
and on site buildings and land uses, flood levels, watercourses, elevation and
percent slope within and one hundred feet (100') beyond the perimeter of the
site and such other existing information necessary to analyze the site.
      2.    An analysis of deposit information and cross sections indicating
the depth and quantities of existing sand and gravel deposits.
      3.    A master plan, drawn accurately to scale, illustrating the ultimate
land uses projected for the property (i.e., streets, building lots, water
bodies and elevations). The master plan shall be similar in detail to a
preliminary plat, and proposed elevations shall be shown at two foot (2')
intervals, and a boundary survey by a registered surveyor shall be required.
      4.    A plan indicating the operating pattern and staging or time
sequence schedule for excavation and restoration of the site.
      5.    Such geological and hydrological data as is necessary to determine
the feasibility of the proposed development plan.
   B.    Depth And Slope: Excavations not made to a water producing depth must
be graded or backfilled to meet the following requirements:
      1.    All banks shall be left with a slope not greater than one foot (1')
vertical to ten feet (10') horizontal, except that greater slope shall be
permitted in a development plan if it is in substantial conformity to the
immediately surrounding area and, in the opinion of the council, is not
expected to adversely affect future development of the site. All excavated
areas shall be finally graded in substantial conformity to the surrounding
natural topography.
      2.    The property shall be so graded that stagnant water will not be
permitted to collect thereon.
      3.    Excavations made to a water producing depth shall meet the
following requirements except where otherwise approved as a part of the
development plan:
         a.    The maximum depth shall not be less than eight feet (8')
measured at a low water mark.
         b.    All banks shall be sloped to a water line at a slope not greater
than one foot (1') vertical to four feet (4') horizontal. All banks shall be so
graded as to minimize erosion.
         c.    Such areas shall be integrated into the overall drainage plan of
the city and shall be utilized as needed by the city for storm water disposal
purposes.
   C.    Minimum Size Of Area: No sand and gravel operation will be permitted
on land of less than twenty (20) acres. (This limitation shall not apply when
the tract of land is contiguous to an active sand and gravel operation,
provided that both tracts are being operated by the same operator.)
   D.    Fencing: When any open excavation has a depth of twenty feet (20') or
more, or a slope of one foot (1') vertical to two feet (2') horizontal or
steeper, a fence effectively controlling access to the area shall be erected by
the sand and gravel operator. Said fence may be a snow fence or similar
temporary type of fence unless otherwise required by the council.
   E.    Hours Of Operation: The maximum hours of operation in the sand and
gravel district shall be seven o'clock (7:00) A.M. to seven o'clock (7:00)
P.M., Monday through Saturday, unless other permission is specifically granted
by the council. In no instance, however, shall said maximum hours be more
restrictive than that imposed by the city upon industrial or commercial uses
with similar noise characteristics for the permanent zoning district in which
said operator is located.
   F.    Setbacks:
      1.    Residential Dwellings: Production, processing, excavation,
sedimentation ponds and stockpiling shall not be conducted closer than three
hundred feet (300') to the boundary of any residential or multiple dwelling.
Nor shall such operations be conducted closer than fifty feet (50') to the
boundary of an adjoining property line, except that excavation may be conducted
within such limits in order to reduce the elevation thereof in conforming to
the adjoining property. Setbacks may be varied, provided they are approved by
the council and shown on the development plan.
      2.    Setback Along Streets: Sand and gravel operations shall not be
conducted closer than seventy five feet (75') to the right of way line of any
existing or proposed platted street, road or highway, except that excavation
may be conducted within such limits in order to reduce the elevation thereof in
conforming to a street grade established by the engineer.
      3.    Use For Access Roads: The setback area required may be, in part,
used for access roads as approved by the council.
      4.    Landscaping Of Setback Areas: The minimum required setback area
must be landscaped and planted in accordance with a professional landscape
plan. The landscape plan, through use of berms, foliage, or fencing, shall
provide a solid visual screen. This site plan must be approved and filed with
the city. Such areas where landscaping is required shall be owned or controlled
by an easement by the sand and gravel operator during his period of operation.
   G.    Weed Control: Weeds and other unsightly or noxious vegetation shall be
controlled as necessary to preserve the appearance of the area. Existing trees
and topsoil along the existing public rights of way or proposed public rights
of way shall be preserved, maintained and supplemented for the depth of the
setback.
   H.    Access Roadways:
      1.    Location: Insofar as practicable, all means of access to a sand and
gravel operation from any street shall be so located and designed as to avoid
the routing of vehicles from the property over streets that primarily serve
abutting residential development.
      2.    Paving: All access roads from sand and gravel operations to any
public paved roadway shall be paved for a distance of at least seventy five
feet (75') adjacent to the public roadway to minimize dust conditions. Said
access roads shall be cleaned as needed to maintain lowest possible dust
conditions.
      3.    Dust Control: All access roads from sand and gravel operations to
any unpaved public roadway shall be treated to minimize dust conditions at
least to the extent the unpaved public roadway is dust controlled.
   I.    Topsoil And Landscaping:
      1.    Graded and backfilled areas (or banks in the case of excavations
made to a water producing depth) shall be covered with topsoil to a minimum
depth of six inches (6"), except that no greater depth of topsoil or percentage
of organic material shall be required than that originally existing on the
property prior to commencement of operations.
      2.    Upon replacement of the topsoil, trees, shrubs, legumes, grasses or
other ground cover shall be planted upon such area in order to avoid erosion as
far as practicable. Such restoration shall be on a continuing basis as
excavation is completed, and no area shall be left unattended for more than one
year after excavation is completed.
   J.    Lighting: A lighting plan, including security lighting, shall be
submitted and approved by the city. Lighting shall be shielded so that no
direct glare can be seen from adjoining residences.
   K.    Travel Routes: When requested by the city, the operator shall submit a
report on the proposed travel routes and truck count to and from the site.
   L.    Termination Or Abandonment Of Operation:
      1.    Within a period of three (3) months after termination or
abandonment of a sand and gravel operation, all buildings, structures and
plants incidental to such operation shall be dismantled and removed by and at
the expense of the sand and gravel producer last operating such buildings,
structures or plants, or the owner of such property. If this is not done within
the specified time, the city may contract to complete the above work and charge
these costs to producers last operating on the property or the owner of the
property. Permanent structures, which conform to the permanent zoning district
requirements in which they are located, are not required to be removed.
      2.    Upon the completion or abandonment of a sand and gravel operation,
the producer last operating the area or the owner of the property will be
responsible for grading to the proposed grades the area of operation. The
proposed grades will provide for sufficient drainage so that both natural and
storm water leave the property at the original or natural drainage points
except where otherwise designated by the engineer. If this is not done within
five (5) months, the city may contract to complete the above work and charge
these costs to the producer last operating on the property or the owner of the
property. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13G-6: ADMINISTRATION OF PROVISIONS:
   A.    Excavation Permit: No person shall commence sand and gravel operations
within the city without first obtaining an excavation permit and renewing same
on an annual basis.
   B.    Change In Underlying District: The sand and gravel district shall be
overlying and in addition to another permanent zoning district as designated on
the zoning map, and the sand and gravel district shall only exist for the
length of time specified by the council when the district is established. The
permanent zoning district may be changed during the term of the overlying
temporary sand and gravel district zoning.
   C.    Term Of Allied Operations: Operations allied to the extraction or
mining of sand and gravel deposits such as asphalt plants, block plants, or
ready mix plants shall be phased out consistent with the depletion of said
deposits and not be considered nonconforming uses after said mining is
completed. Temporary sand and gravel district zoning is not intended for those
operations where sixty percent (60%) or more of the deposits used on an annual
basis in said allied operations must be hauled to the site. Said allied
operations shall otherwise only be conducted in the appropriate permanent
zoning district.
   D.    Variances: The council may grant variances to any provision of this
article where the intent and purpose is being met and where compliance would
cause an undue hardship. In the granting of said variance, the council may
impose special conditions.
   E.    Short Term Operations: The council may waive any part of this article,
or its entirety, and only require an excavation permit for sand and gravel
mining operations to be conducted over a very short period of time. This shall
include, but not be limited to, mining deposits for the sole purpose of
construction of a public highway.
   F.    Removal Of Zoning: The city shall initiate action to remove the
temporary sand and gravel district (SG) zoning from any property where the sand
and gravel operation is completed before the term of the temporary zoning. Said
action shall also be initiated where a sand and gravel operation has been
abandoned or where an excavation permit has been revoked or not renewed by the
city because of failure to comply with city ordinances. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)

10-13H-1: STATUTE AUTHORITY; PURPOSE:
The South St. Paul joint airport zoning board, created and established by joint
action of the councils of the cities of Inver Grove Heights, Newport, St. Paul
Park, and South St. Paul, pursuant to the provisions and authority of Minnesota
statutes section 360.063, hereby finds and declares that:
   A.    An airport hazard endangers the lives and property of users of the
South St. Paul municipal airport and property or occupants of land in its
vicinity, and also, if of the obstructive type, in effect reduces the size of
the area available for the landing, takeoff, and maneuvering of aircraft, thus
tending to destroy or impair the utility of the South St. Paul municipal
airport and the public investment therein.
   B.    The creation or establishment of an airport hazard is a public
nuisance and an injury to the region served by the South St. Paul municipal
airport.
   C.    For the protection of the public health, safety, order, convenience,
prosperity and general welfare, and for the promotion of the most appropriate
use of land, it is necessary to prevent the creation or establishment of
airport hazards.
   D.    The prevention of these airport hazards should be accomplished, to the
extent legally possible, by the exercise of the police power without
compensation.
   E.    The prevention of the creation or establishment of airport hazards and
the elimination, removal, alteration, mitigation, or marking and lighting of
existing airport hazards are public purposes for which political subdivisions
may raise and expend public funds. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13H-2: AIRSPACE OBSTRUCTION ZONING:
   A.    Airspace Zones: In order to carry out the purpose of this article, as
set forth in section 10-13H-1 of this article, the following airspace zones are
hereby established: primary zone, horizontal zone, conical zone, approach zone,
precision instrument approach zone, and transitional zone, the locations and
dimensions of which are as follows:
      1.    Primary Zone: All that land which lies directly under an imaginary
primary surface longitudinally centered on a runway and extending two hundred
feet (200') beyond each end of runway 16-34. The elevation of any point of the
primary surface is the same as the elevation of the nearest point on the runway
centerline. The width of the primary surface is five hundred feet (500') for
runway 16-34.
      2.    Horizontal Zone: All that land which lies directly under an
imaginary horizontal surface one hundred fifty feet (150') above the
established airport elevation, or a height of nine hundred seventy feet (970')
above mean sea level, the perimeter of which is constructed by swinging arcs of
specified radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of each
runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those arcs. The
radius of each arc is six thousand feet (6,000') for runway 16-34.
      3.    Conical Zone: All that land which lies directly under an imaginary
conical surface extending upward and outward from the periphery of the
horizontal surface at a slope of twenty to one (20:1) for a horizontal distance
of four thousand feet (4,000') as measured radially outward from the periphery
of the horizontal surface.
      4.    Approach Zone: All that land which lies directly under an imaginary
approach surface longitudinally centered on the extended centerline at each end
of a runway. The inner edge of the approach surface is at the same width and
elevation as, and coincides with, the end of the primary surface. The approach
surface inclines upward and outward at a slope of forty to one (40:1) for
runway 16-34. The approach surface expands uniformly to a width of three
thousand five hundred feet (3,500') for runway 16-34 at a distance of ten
thousand feet (10,000') to the periphery of the conical surface.
      5.    Transitional Zone: All that land which lies directly under an
imaginary surface extending upward and outward at right angles to the runway
centerline and centerline extended at a slope of seven to one (7:1) from the
sides of the primary surfaces and from the sides of the approach surfaces until
they intersect the horizontal surface or the conical surface. Transitional
surfaces for those portions of the precision instrument approach surface which
project through and beyond the limits of the conical surface extend a distance
of five thousand feet (5,000') measured horizontally from the edge of the
precision instrument approach surface and at right angles to the extended
precision instrument runway centerline.
   B.    Height Restrictions:
      1.    Restrictions Imposed: Except as otherwise provided in this article
and except as necessary and incidental to airport operations, no structure or
tree shall be constructed, altered, maintained, or allowed to grow in any
airspace zone created in subsection A of this section so as to project above
any of the imaginary airspace surfaces described in said subsection A. Where an
area is covered by more than one height limitation, the more restrictive
limitations shall prevail; provided, however, with respect to those areas
covered by subsection B2b of this section, the least restrictive limitations
shall prevail. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
      2.    Exceptions:
         a.    In those areas where existing terrain or trees penetrate one or
more of the imaginary airspace surfaces, the height of the structures shall be
restricted to the height of the imaginary airspace surface or to the height of
the tree canopy which provides a natural shield to the structure, whichever is
the greater height. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004; amd. 2008 Code)
         b.    In those areas described in subsection B3 of this section, the
highest point of a structure shall be restricted to the height of the imaginary
airspace surface or to one hundred feet (100') above the existing terrain,
whichever is the greater height, provided it is determined by the federal
aviation administration that no hazard will result from the structure being
erected. The elevation from which the one hundred feet (100') shall be measured
shall be determined by adding the lowest elevation of the existing terrain
under the proposed structure and the highest elevation of the existing terrain
under the proposed structure and dividing by two (2). Existing terrain shall be
that shown on the topographical surveys prepared by Mark Hurd, which shall be
on file in the office of the airport zoning administrator.
      3.    Legal Description: That portion of "Kassan Ridge" lying south of
the south right of way line of Interstate Highway 494; and that part of "Warren

10-13H-3: LAND USE SAFETY ZONING:
   A.    Safety Zone Boundaries: In order to carry out the purpose of this
article, as set forth in section 10-13H-1 of this article, and also, in order
to restrict those uses which may be hazardous to the operational safety of
aircraft operating to and from the airport, and furthermore to limit population
and building density in the runway approach areas, thereby creating sufficient
open space so as to protect life and property in case of an accident, there are
hereby created and established the following land use safety zones:
      1.    Safety Zone A: All land in that portion of the approach zones of a
runway, as defined in section 10-13H-2 of this article, which extends outward
from the end of primary surface a distance equal to two-thirds (2/3) of the
planned length of the runway, which distance shall be:
         a.    Two thousand six hundred sixty seven feet (2,667') for runway
34.
         b.    Two thousand six hundred sixty seven feet (2,667') for runway
16.
      2.    Safety Zone B: All land in that portion of the approach zones of a
runway, as defined in section 10-13H-2 of this article, which extends outward
from safety zone A a distance equal to one- third (1/3) of the planned length
of the runway, which distance shall be:
         a.    One thousand three hundred thirty three feet (1,333') for runway
34.
         b.    One thousand three hundred thirty three feet (1,333') for runway
16.

of the horizontal zone, as defined in section 10-13H-2 of this article, and
which is not included in zone A or zone B.
      4.    Exceptions For Established Residential Neighborhoods: The following
described lands are designated as established residential neighborhoods in
built up urban areas, based upon the state of development of the areas on July
2, 1979:
         a.    Land uses which were in existence in these areas on July 2,
1979, are exempt from the use restrictions of subsections B2 and B3 of this
section, and are subject to the provisions of subsection B5 of this section.
         b.    In South St. Paul and located under the approach to runway 16:
Hemmingsen's Replat, Fearing's Addition, Luella Addition, Walter and Arthur

   B.    Use Restrictions:
      1.    Generally: Subject at all times to the height restrictions set
forth in subsection 10-13H-2B of this article, no use shall be made of any land
in any of the safety zones defined in subsection A of this section which
creates or causes interference with the operations of radio or electronic
facilities on the airport or with radio or electronic communications between
airport and aircraft, makes it difficult for pilots to distinguish between
airport lights and other lights, results in glare in the eyes of pilots using
the airport, impairs visibility in the vicinity of the airport, or otherwise
endangers the landing, taking off, or maneuvering of aircraft.
      2.    Zone A: Subject at all times to the height restrictions set forth
in subsection 10-13H-2B of this article and to the general restrictions
contained in subsection B1 of this section, areas designated as zone A shall
contain no buildings, temporary structures, exposed transmission lines, or
other similar aboveground land use structural hazards, and shall be restricted
to those uses which will not create, attract, or bring together an assembly of
persons thereon. Permitted uses may include, but are not limited to, such uses
as agriculture (seasonal crops), horticulture, animal husbandry, raising of
livestock, wildlife habitat, light outdoor recreation (nonspectator),
cemeteries, and auto parking.
      3.    Zone B: Subject at all times to the height restrictions set forth
in subsection 10-13H-2B of this article, and to the general restrictions

subsection 10-13H-2B of this article, and to the general restrictions contained
in subsection A of this section.
      5.    Exemptions For Established Residential Neighborhoods:
         a.    Land uses which existed as of July 2, 1979, in the established
residential neighborhoods set forth in subsection A4 of this section, and as
shown on the zoning map, are subject to the height restrictions of subsection
10-13H-2B of this article and the general restrictions of subsection A of this
section. Land uses which come into existence after July 2, 1979, are treated as
though they were not in a designated established residential neighborhood and
are subject to the zone A or zone B restrictions as the case may be.
         b.    Land uses in established residential neighborhoods which violate
any of the following restrictions are prohibited as safety hazards and must be
acquired, altered or removed at public expense. Those conditions are as
follows: The following land uses, if they exist in safety zone A or B and in an
established residential neighborhood in a built up urban area, are considered
by the commissioner of transportation to constitute airport safety hazards so
severe, either to persons on the ground or to the air traveling public, or
both, that they must be prohibited under local airport zoning ordinances:
            (1)    Any structure which a person or persons customarily use as
principal residence and which is located entirely inside safety zone A within
one thousand feet (1,000') of the end of the primary zone;
            (2)    Any structure which a person or persons customarily use as a
principal residence and which is located entirely within safety zone A or B and
which penetrates an imaginary approach surface as defined by subsection 10-13H-
2A of this article;
            (3)    Any land use in safety zone A or B which violates any of the
following standards:
               (A) The land use must not create or cause interference with the
operation of radio or electronic facilities on the airport or with radio or
electronic communications between the airport and aircraft;
               (B) The land use must not make it difficult for pilots to
distinguish between airport lights and other lights;
               (C) The land use must not result in glare in the eyes of pilots
using the airport or impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport;
            (4)    Any isolated residential building lot zoned for single-
family or two-family residences on which any structure, if built, would be
prohibited by subsections B5b(1), (2), and (3) of this section. An "isolated
residential building lot" is one located in an area in which the predominant
land use is single-family or two-family residential structures; and
            (5)    Any other land use which presents, in the opinion of the
commissioner of transportation, a material danger to the landing, taking off or
maneuvering of aircraft or to the safety of person(s) on the ground. In making
such a determination, the commissioner shall consider the following factors:
               (A) Possibility that the land use may contribute to or cause a
collision of two (2) or more aircraft or an aircraft and some other object;
               (B) Possibility that the land use may, in case of an aircraft
accident, cause an explosion, fire or the release of harmful or noxious fumes,
gases or substances;
               (C) Tendency of the land use to increase the number of persons
that would be injured in case of an aircraft accident;
               (D) Effect of the land use on availability of clear areas for
emergency landings; and
               (E) Flight patterns around the airport, the extent of use of the
runway in question, the type of aircraft using the airport, whether the runways
are lighted, whether the airport is controlled, and other similar factors.
   C.    Boundary Limitations: The land use restrictions set forth in this
article shall apply for a distance not to exceed one mile beyond the perimeter
of the airport boundary and in that portion of an airport hazard area under the
approach zone for a distance not exceeding two (2) miles from the airport
boundary. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13H-4: AIRPORT ZONING MAP:
The several zones herein established are shown on the South St. Paul airport
zoning districts map, prepared by the Inver Grove Heights planning division,
and dated March 24, 1999, available in the planning division offices, which
map, together with such amendments thereto, as may from time to time be made,
and all notations, references, elevations, data, zone boundaries, and other
information thereon, shall be and the same is hereby adopted as part of this
article. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13H-5: NONCONFORMING USES:
The regulations prescribed by this article shall not be construed to require
the removal, lowering, or other changes or alteration of any structure or tree
not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date hereof, or otherwise
interfere with the continuance of any nonconforming use. Nothing herein
contained shall require any change in the construction, alteration, or intended
use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior
to the effective date hereof, and is diligently prosecuted and completed within
two (2) years thereof. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13H-6: PERMITS REQUIRED:
   A.    Future Uses:
      1.    Except as specifically provided in subsections A2 and A3 of this
section, no material change shall be made in the use of land and no structures
shall be erected, altered, or otherwise established in any zone hereby created
unless a permit therefor shall have been applied for and granted by the zoning
administrator, hereinafter provided. Each application for a permit shall
indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient
particularity to permit it to conform to the regulation herein prescribed. If
such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted.
      2.    However, a permit for a tree or structure of less than seventy five
feet (75') of vertical height above the ground shall not be required in the
horizontal and conical zones or in any approach and transitional zones beyond a
horizontal distance of four thousand two hundred feet (4,200') from each end of
the runway except when such tree or structure, because of terrain, land
contour, or topographic features, would extend the height or land use limit
prescribed for the respective zone.
      3.    Nothing contained in subsection A2 of this section shall be
construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, alteration, or
growth of any structure or tree in excess of any of the height limitations as
set forth in section 10-13H-2 and the land use limitations set forth in section
10-13H-3 of this article.
   B.    Existing Uses: Before any existing use or structure may be replaced,
substantially altered or repaired, or rebuilt within any zone established
herein, a permit must be secured authorizing such replacement, change, or
repair. No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or
creation of an airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree
to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date
hereof, or any amendments hereto, or than it is when the application for a
permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such permit shall be
granted.
   C.    Nonconforming Uses Abandoned Or Destroyed: Whenever the zoning
administrator determines that a nonconforming structure or tree, for purposes
of this article, has been abandoned or more than eighty percent (80%) torn
down, deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow
such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise
deviate from the zoning regulations. Whether application is made for a permit
under this subsection or not, the zoning administrator may order the owner of
the abandoned or partially destroyed nonconforming structure, at his own
expense, to lower, remove, reconstruct, or equip the same in the manner
necessary to conform to the provisions of this article. In the event the owner
of the nonconforming structure shall neglect or refuse to comply with such
order for ten (10) days after receipt of written notice of such order, the
zoning administrator may, by appropriate legal action, proceed to have the
abandoned or partially destroyed nonconforming structure lowered, removed,
reconstructed, or equipped and assess the cost and expense thereof against the
land on which the structure is or was located. Unless such an assessment is
paid within ninety (90) days from the service of notice thereof on the owner of
the land, the sum shall bear interest at the rate of eight percent (8%) per
annum from the date the cost and expense is incurred until paid, and shall be
collected in the same manner as are general taxes. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13H-7: VARIANCES:
Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit
the growth of any tree, or use his property not in accordance with the
regulations prescribed in this article may apply to the airport board of
adjustment and appeals, hereinafter provided, for a variance from such
regulations. If a person submits an application for a variance by certified
mail to the members of the airport board of adjustment and appeals, and the
airport board of adjustment and appeals fails to grant or deny the variance
within four (4) months after the last member received the application, the
variance shall be deemed to be granted by the airport board of adjustment and
appeals. When the variance is granted by reason of the failure of the board to
act on the variance, the person receiving the variance shall notify the board
and the commissioner of transportation, by certified mail, that the variance
has been granted. The applicant shall include a copy of the original
application for variance with this notice to the commissioner. The variance
shall be effective sixty (60) days after this notice is received by the
commissioner, subject to any action taken by the commissioner, pursuant to
Minnesota statutes section 360.063, subdivision 6a. Such variances shall be
allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the
regulations would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, and
relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest but do substantial
justice and be in accordance with the spirit of this article, provided any
variance so allowed may be subject to any reasonable conditions that the board
or commissioner may deem necessary to effectuate the purpose of this article.
(Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-13H-8: HAZARD MARKING AND LIGHTING:
   A.    Nonconforming Uses: The owner of any nonconforming structure or tree
is hereby required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance
thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the zoning
administrator to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the
airport the presence of such airport hazards. Such markers and lights shall be
installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the city of South St.
Paul.
   B.    Permits And Variances: Any permit or variance granted by the zoning
administrator or airport board of adjustment and appeals, as the case may be,
if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this article
and be reasonable in the circumstances, so condition such permit or variance as
to require the owner of the structure or tree in question, at his own expense,
to install, operate, and maintain thereon such markers and lights as may be
necessary to indicate to pilots the presence of an airport hazard. (Ord. 1098,
11-8-2004)

SECTION:
10-13J-1 Findings
10-13J-2 Purpose And Intent
10-13J-3 Sewer And Water Issues
10-13J-4 Boundaries; Application Of Provisions
10-13J-5 Planned Unit Development
10-13J-6 Performance Standards
10-13J-7 Subdivision Regulations
10-13J-1: FINDINGS:
The city finds that the northwest area of the community presents unique
development challenges and opportunities. Its varied physical topography, areas
of extensive tree cover and numerous landlocked, defined wetland basins not
only are valued natural features, but also would likely increase the costs for
storm sewer infrastructure if a traditional storm water management plan were
implemented. The "Northwest Quadrant Study" (prepared by Hoisington Koegler
Group, 2001) and "Northwest Quadrant Hydrologic & Hydraulic Analysis" (prepared
by Emmons & Olivier Resources, 2004) indicate that alternative land planning,
engineering and development practices may be more cost effective in addressing
infrastructure needs and meeting the city comprehensive plan goal of preserving
unique natural areas/open space. (Ord. 1148, 5-29-2007)
10-13J-2: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
   A.    The northwest area overlay district is established for the purpose of
regulating development consistent with the city comprehensive plan while
creating a cost efficient storm sewer system. In accordance with the city
comprehensive plan and the "Northwest Quadrant Study: City Of Inver Grove
Heights And South Robert Trail Neighborhood Association" (prepared by
Hoisington Koegler Group in 2001), the northwest area overlay district will
encourage development which provides:
      1.    Diverse housing styles;
      2.    Natural features as integral elements;
      3.    Cluster development practices which preserve significant natural
features;
      4.    Pedestrian connections;
      5.    Innovative storm water management practices;
      6.    A reduction in impervious cover to maximize natural storm water
infiltration;
      7.    On site retention of storm water; and
      8.    Open space areas as development amenities.
   B.    The provisions of the northwest area overlay district will also reduce
the amount of storm water runoff from the district through minimizing
impervious surface coverage. Provisions will also maximize the ability to
infiltrate storm water without piping to a remote outlet (i.e., Mississippi
River) through the preservation of natural areas for infiltration.
   C.    All development within the northwest area overlay district shall be by
planned unit development according to: 1) the platting procedures as
established in the city subdivision ordinance, title 11, chapters 2, 3, 4 and 5
of this code; 2) the planned unit development procedures established in article
A of this chapter; and 3) the provisions found in this article. If there are
any conflicts in these standards, the most restrictive standard shall apply,
unless specifically approved otherwise by the city council. (Ord. 1148, 5-29-
2007)
10-13J-3: SEWER AND WATER ISSUES:
   A.    No Municipal Water And Sewer Currently In District; Density
Requirements:
      1.    The northwest area overlay district does not have municipal sewer
or water available as of the effective date hereof. As municipal sewer and
water become available to properties in the northwest area overlay district,
development shall be allowed subject to this article. Until such time as
municipal sewer and water become available and final planned unit development
plans are approved by the city for the specific property, densities shall not
exceed one unit per ten (10) acres. All lots of record existing on the
effective date hereof shall be governed by the lot size regulations for the
underlying zoning district within which the lot of record is located.
      2.    The maximum density of one unit per ten (10) acres is established
for properties that do not yet have municipal sewer and water in order to:
         a.    Prevent parcelization of land before municipal sewer and water
become available.
         b.    Reduce the density of residential development in areas lying
outside the area of the city where municipal utilities are available in order
to prevent the untimely, noncost effective extension of city utilities due to
the failure of on site septic systems.
         c.    Prevent adverse effects upon the environment due to the failure
of on site waste disposal systems.
         d.    Promote the provision of residential lot areas that more easily
facilitate resubdivision when city utilities become available, particularly in
those areas where utility extensions may occur in the reasonably foreseeable
future.
         e.    Lessen the potential demand in the rural areas for city services
such as police and fire protection and street and park services.
         f.    Channel development of significant tax base into the areas of
the city that have municipal sewer.
   B.    Subdivision Of Property Not Served By Municipal Sewer And Water:
      1.    Subdivision of property in the northwest area overlay district that
is not served by municipal sewer and water shall be allowed only under the
following conditions:
         a.    The subdivision shall be memorialized through platting. No
waiver of plat or administrative subdivision procedure shall be allowed.
         b.    A property must have a minimum of twenty (20) acres (excluding
existing right of way) in order to be subdivided.
         c.    The subdivision shall result in a density no greater than one
home per ten (10) acres of land (excluding proposed right of way).
         d.    The resulting plat shall include buildable lots of a size no
less than one (1.0) acre and no greater than one and one-half (1.5) acres. The
remainder of the property shall be platted as an outlot or outlots. The outlot
(s) shall be considered unbuildable, and no further subdivision of the outlot
(s) shall be allowed until such time as municipal sewer and water become
available to the property. When municipal sewer and water become available to
the property, the outlot(s) may develop, but will be required to develop
according to: 1) the platting procedures as established in the city subdivision
ordinance, title 11, chapters 2, 3, 4 and 5 of this code; 2) the planned unit
development procedures established in article A of this chapter; and 3) the
provisions found in this article.
         e.    The underlying zoning district of the property to be subdivided
shall be rezoned to agricultural/PUD.
      2.    Planned unit development procedures and standards set forth in
article A of this chapter shall not apply to land divisions that are eligible
for subdivision according to the provision of this subsection. (Ord. 1148, 5-
29-2007)
10-13J-4: BOUNDARIES; APPLICATION OF PROVISIONS:
   A.    The northwest area overlay district, further defined herein, is hereby
established as a part of this title. The northwest area overlay district shall
be an overlay district such that any parcel lying in the overlay district shall
also lie within one or more of the underlying zoning districts. Regulations and
procedures set forth in underlying zoning districts shall apply unless
specifically addressed in article A of this chapter or this article or if
determined by the city council to be inconsistent with the purpose and intent
outlined in section
10-13J-2 of this article, approved by the city council as part of the final
planned unit development plans. For purposes of determining the application of
this article, the boundaries of the northwest area overlay district shall be
established and shown on the official zoning map of the city, on file in the
office of the city clerk and zoning administrator. Said map and the boundaries
shown thereon are hereby incorporated herein by reference with the same force
and effect as if fully set forth herein. (Ord. 1148, 5-29-2007; amd. 2008 Code)
   B.    Structures existing on or before the effective date hereof shall be
exempt from the standards set forth within the northwest area overlay district
until such time as the parcel is subdivided. (Ord. 1148, 5-29-2007)
10-13J-5: PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT:
All development in the northwest area overlay district shall be pursuant to an
approved final PUD plan, except as allowed in subsection
10-13J-3B of this article. The procedures and regulations set forth in article
A of this chapter (planned unit development district) shall apply unless
specifically addressed in this section. The following subsections are hereby
deemed to be requirements for all PUDs in the northwest area overlay district
unless exceptions as part of a PUD are otherwise approved by the city council
based on the project’s ability to protect public safety, the purpose and intent
of this article as outlined in section
10-13J-2 of this article, and the purpose and intent as outlined in section
10-13A-1 of this chapter. The city council must also determine that the
exceptions are consistent with the goals, policies, and plans of the city
comprehensive plan, including future land uses, utilities, streets and parks;
the exceptions are generally compatible and would not be materially injurious
to existing or future uses of surrounding properties; and the exceptions do not
have an undue adverse impact on existing or planned city facilities and
services, including streets, utilities, parks, police and fire and the
reasonable ability of the city to provide such services in an orderly, timely
manner.
   A.   Minimum Area: There is no minimum required site size for a PUD in the
northwest area overlay district. However, all land in the PUD must be
contiguous unless specifically approved otherwise by the city council based on
the criteria identified in this section.
   B.   Ownership: The tract of land may be held in single and separate
ownership or in multiple ownerships. However, when a tract is held in multiple
ownerships, it shall be planned as a single entity with common authority and
common responsibility as demonstrated through all property owners being
signatories on the PUD application.
   C.   Bulk Standards:
      1.   All perimeter setbacks of a PUD shall conform to the setbacks of the
underlying zoning district. Property in a PUD shall conform to the bulk
standards established in table 13J-1 of this section
      2.   Except as provided in table 13J-1 of this section, all other
setbacks of a PUD shall conform to the setbacks of the underlying zoning
district.

Notes:
   1.   Maximum density is calculated based on net developable area (see
section
10-13A-6 of this chapter and subsection E of this section). However, in no
instance shall the density exceed that established for the property in the city
comprehensive plan, and suchdensity limits are incorporated by reference and
hereby made a part of this article. The comprehensive plan refers to gross
density. The northwest area overlay refers to net density as described in
subsection E2b of this section.
   2.   Rear yard setbacks shall follow the underlying zoning district setback
standards.
   3.   Impervious surface percentages shall be applied to the whole project
during planning stages. The PUD shall establish a standard for each individual
lot regulated during the permitting process.
   4.   In no instance may a building (principal or accessory) lie within an
area of the lot encumbered by an easement.
   D.   Natural Area/Open Space:
      1.   An amount of land equal to at least twenty percent (20%) of the net
developable area within the PUD shall be preserved as natural area/open space,
which may include greenways as shown in the “City Of Inver Grove Heights
Natural Resources Inventory And Management Plan” (Bonestroo Rosene Anderlik &
Associates, 2004).
      2.   Natural area/open space shall be designated in the following
priority order:
         a.   The first priority is to protect slopes of twenty five percent
(25%) or greater in those subwatersheds that have a significant portion of
their drainage area (30 percent or more) covered in slopes of twenty five
percent (25%) or greater. The following subwatershed districts have thirty
percent (30%) or more of the developable area covered by slopes greater than
twenty five percent (25%): BP-032, EP-016e, EP-016g, EP-025b, EP-027d, EP-027f,
EP-035b, EP-049b, EP-049e, SP-17 and SP-29 as identified in the “Northwest
Quadrant Hydrologic & Hydraulic Analysis”, completed by Emmons & Oliver
Resources in 2004.
         b.   The second priority is to incorporate public trails or public
open space designated in the comprehensive plan. This would be in addition to
any land that would be used to satisfy the public park dedication requirement
found in the city subdivision ordinance, title 11 of this code.
         c.   The third priority for natural area/open space designation is the
protection of natural features such as slopes of twenty five percent (25%) or
greater, and environmentally sensitive areas and scenic features of the site
identified as manage 1 or 2 resources or priority sites in the “City Of Inver
Grove Heights Natural Resource Inventory And Management Plan For The Northwest
Expansion Area” (Bonestroo Rosene Anderlik & Associates, 2004).
         d.   The fourth priority is to create natural area/open space in and
around neighborhoods. This priority is satisfied by providing continuity of
adjacent natural area/open space corridors or parkways; network of
interconnected natural area/open space corridors; or buffers between
incompatible or conflicting land uses.
      3.   At least seventy five percent (75%) of the required natural area/
open space shall be contiguous with no portion less than one hundred feet
(100') wide, unless otherwise approved by the city council based on the
criteria identified in this section.
      4.   At least fifty percent (50%) of the required natural area/open space
shall be maintained in a natural, undisturbed condition with native vegetation
and shall not be graded or improved with any building, structure or other
impervious surface, except: a) public utilities; b) limited access in the form
of a paved walking or hiker/biker path, the total impervious area of which
shall not be more than two percent (2%) of the total required natural area/open
space; and c) unless otherwise approved by the city council based on the
criteria identified in this section.
      5.   The remaining fifty percent (50%) of designated required natural
area/open space may be used for passive or active recreation, public or private
utilities or the location of storm water management features. If used for
active recreation, impervious cover shall not exceed five percent (5%) of the
remaining area. The remaining fifty percent (50%) of designated required
natural area/open space may be graded.
      6.   The entire area set aside for natural area/open space shall be
maintained in perpetuity. This restriction shall run with the land and be
binding on successors and assigns of the landowner.
      7.   The boundaries of designated natural area/open space and recreation
areas shall be clearly delineated on the approved final PUD plans. These areas
shall be delineated in the field with signage approved by the city.
      8.   The designated natural area/open space may be owned and managed by
one or more of the following:
         a.   Property owner, provided either: 1) the deed to each lot includes
a proportionate share of the natural area/open space or common facilities; or
2) an easement for the natural area/open space is provided for the benefit of
the lots in the subdivision.
         b.   Homeowners’ association, provided all of the following conditions
are met:
         (1)   The homeowners’ association must be established prior to filing
of any plats.
         (2)   Membership must be mandatory for each owner and any successive
buyer.
         (3)   The association must be responsible for liability insurance,
local taxes and maintenance of the natural area/open space.
         (4)   Landowners must pay their pro rata share of the cost and the
assessment levied by the association that can become a lien on the property in
accordance with Minnesota statutes.
         (5)   The association must be able to adjust the assessment to meet
changed needs.
         c.   Third party (nonprofit) organization whose primary purpose is to
hold or manage the natural area/open space, subject to a reversionary clause in
the event of dissolution of the nonprofit organization.
         d.   Dedicated to the city, if the city council determines there is a
demonstrated public need.
      9.   The maintenance of the natural area/open space shall be the
responsibility of one of the entities identified in subsection D8 of this
section. Public storm water or utility improvements may be located within a
portion of the natural area/open space, as specified in subsections D4 and D5
of this section, in which case, the city shall be responsible for maintenance
of that portion of the natural area/open space.
      10.   Authorized representatives of the city may conduct inspections at
any reasonable time to ensure proper maintenance of such areas and/or to
respond to citizen complaints.
      11.   The legal instrument creating the restrictions, easements and
covenants in the natural area/open space shall be subject to approval by the
city, and the instrument recorded with the county shall state that the
restrictions, easements and covenants shall not be terminated or altered
without the written consent of the city. The legal instrument creating the
restrictions, easements and covenants in the natural area/open space shall be
enforceable by the city, and the documents shall recite the city’s right of
enforcement.
      12.   If the property to be subdivided contains natural resources
identified as manage 1 or 2 resources or priority sites in the “City Of Inver
Grove Heights Natural Resource Inventory And Management Plan For The Northwest
Expansion Area” (Bonestroo Rosene Anderlik & Associates, 2004), the city
council may, at its discretion, require the manage 1 or 2 resource or priority
site to be encumbered with a conservation easement to the public. Said
conservation easement would include at least the following provisions:
         a.   No vegetation shall be removed or mowed from the easement area,
except for invasive vegetation species when removed according to a plan
approved by the city.
         b.   No private structures may be placed within the easement area.
         c.   No grading shall be allowed, except as approved with the final
planned unit development plan, or subsequent city approved amendments thereto.
         d.   No gardening shall be permitted within the easement area.
         e.   Public utilities shall be permitted within the easement area.
   E.   Development Capacity Plan Required:
      1.   A development capacity plan shall be prepared by the developer as
part of the preliminary development plan for every residential project. The
intent of the development capacity plan is to determine the total number of
units that could be developed on the site according to the underlying zoning
district regulations which may be established through the sketch plan process.
The total unit count determined through the development capacity plan shall
then become the maximum number of units permitted under the northwest area
overlay district regulations. The total number of units for the overall project
shall not exceed the density as establish through the comprehensive plan.
      2.   Calculation of the total number of permitted residential units shall
be determined in the following manner:
         a.   Step 1: Determine the total net developable area (in acres) per
the definition of “net developable area” as found in section
10-2-2 of this title.
         b.   Step 2: Divide the developable area determined in step 1 above by
the minimum lot area as established for the applicable underlying zoning
district and found in chapter 9, articles A and B and sections
10-9C-1,
10-9C-2 and
10-9C-3 of this title. The result is the total number of units that could be
developed on the site in the underlying zoning district. The total number of
units divided by the net developable area equals the net density of the site.
         c.   Step 3: The total number of units determined in step 2 above
shall be the maximum number of units permitted under this article.
   F.   Allowed Uses:
      1.   Except those uses identified in subsection G of this section as
interim uses, all permitted, conditional, and accessory uses, as defined,
regulated and administered for the underlying zoning districts, shall be
allowed within the northwest area overlay district. If a final PUD plan is
approved by the city council, the underlying zoning for the subject property
shall remain as zoned, but within the Northwest Area Overlay District. The
permitted, conditional, and accessory uses shall be those found in the
underlying zoning district except that single family detached and single family
attached uses are allowed uses in the R-3B and R-3C multiple family residential
districts within the Northwest Area provided the overall development density
for the PUD remains consistent with the densities allowed for the applicable
land use categories identified in the City’s comprehensive plan. The total
number and location of housing units and housing types for a specific property
shall be established by the city council at the time of final PUD plan approval
for that specific property. The location and number of housing units approved
on the final PUD development plan shall not be altered without approval of the
city council.
   G.   Interim Uses:
      1.   Purpose And Intent: The northwest area overlay district is
envisioned to develop at urban development densities over the next twenty (20)
or more years. The premature development of this area in an estate type
development pattern (large residential lots with sizes of 21/2 to 5 acres with
private sanitary sewer systems and private wells) presents challenges to the
efficiency and coherency of future development. In addition to rural
development patterns, rural uses (boarding of horses, agriculture, etc.) that
are incompatible with urban development will also pose challenges to the
orderly development of the northwest area planned unit development overlay
district. Consequently, it is the purpose of this subsection to establish
interim uses that are appropriate to the northwest area overlay district while
preserving the reasonable use of private property.
      2.   Uses Requiring Interim Use Permit: Regardless whether the following
uses are permitted or conditional uses in the underlying A agricultural zoning
district, the following uses shall be considered interim uses in the northwest
area overlay district and shall require approval of an interim use permit by
the city council pursuant to the procedures established in chapter 14 of this
title:
      Agriculture buildings.
      Commercial greenhouse/nurseries.
      Commercial horse stables.
      Commercial kennels.
   H.   Storm Water Management1:
      1.   Design: All development in the northwest area overlay district shall
be designed such that storm water runoff is managed on site within the planned
unit development to match predevelopment runoff, as demonstrated by matching
predevelopment and postdevelopment runoff volume for the 5-year, 24-hour event.
The storm water system shall also have managed overflows to the regional system
of natural depressions such that the storm water rainfall/runoff for a 100-year
event is safely transported. Contingencies for emergency overflows at least one
foot (1') below the lowest structure shall be provided.
         a.   For any proposed PUD development, the developer shall submit a
storm water management plan which contains supporting computations, drawings
and sufficient information describing the manner, location and type of measures
in which storm water runoff will be managed from all phases of the PUD
development. The developer shall also submit soil borings for the site
including proposed storm water infiltration areas.
         b.   The storm water management plan shall be prepared by an
individual whose qualifications are acceptable to the city. The city may
require that the design be prepared by a professional licensed in the state of
Minnesota as necessary to protect the public or the environment.
         c.   Storm water management plans shall use one or more of the
following features to address on site storm water management. These measures
shall be designed in accordance with the most recent version of the “City Of
Inver Grove Heights Stormwater Manual” which is incorporated by reference into
this article. The performance criteria specified in the “City Of Inver Grove
Heights Stormwater Manual” shall be considered when selecting the appropriate
management features such as:
         (1)   Infiltration rainwater gardens (encumbered by public easement
and maintained by the city).
         (2)   Vegetated swales (encumbered by public or private easement and
maintained by the city or private parties, as approved by the city, together
with the final PUD plans and storm water management plan).
         (3)   Parking lot bioretention (encumbered by a private easement if
found necessary by the city and maintained by private parties).
         (4)   Infiltration basins/trenches (encumbered by public or private
easement and maintained by the city or private parties, as approved by the
city, together with the final PUD plans and storm water management plan).
         (5)   Disconnection of impervious surfaces, e.g., diverted roof
leaders, rain barrels, permeable pavement. (These features are to be encumbered
by a private easement if found necessary by the city and maintained by private
parties.)
         (6)   Green roofs (private maintenance).
         (7)   Other low impact development (LID) techniques.
         d.   Storm water management plans will stage construction and
specifically address temporary erosion and sediment control measures to
preserve the infiltration capacity of proposed on site and regional storm water
management features to ensure that such features are not impaired at conclusion
of construction.
         e.   Storm water easements over those storm water management features
that the city chooses to maintain shall be provided by the property owner for
access, facility inspections, replacements, and public maintenance. The
easements shall be fully executed and submitted to the city prior to the
release of the final plat from city offices for recording by the county.
         f.   Covenants and/or maintenance agreements found acceptable to the
city relating to all storm water management features not to be maintained by
the city shall be provided by the property owner. The covenants and/or
maintenance agreements shall be fully executed and submitted to the city prior
to the release of the final plat from city offices for recording by the county.
         g.   The legal instrument creating the restrictions, easements and
covenants governing privately maintained storm water management facilities
shall be subject to approval by the city, and the instrument recorded with the
county shall state that the restrictions, easements and covenants shall not be
terminated or altered without the written consent of the city. The legal
instrument shall be enforceable by the city, and the document shall recite the
city’s right of enforcement.
         h.   Final design of the storm water management plan shall be approved
by the city council and shall be filed in the chain of title for each property
that lies within the planned unit development. A condition of approval shall be
that the landowner shall enter into a license contract with the city allowing
authorized representatives from the city to conduct inspections on a regular
basis at any reasonable time to assure the safe and proper functioning of the
private storm water management features and/or to respond to citizen concerns.
The license contract shall also permit authorized representatives of the city
to enter upon the private property for the purpose of correcting or maintaining
any private storm water management feature approved as a part of the storm
water management plan if, after proper and reasonable notice by the city to the
landowner, the landowner has not corrected or maintained the storm water
management feature to the standards established in the approved storm water
management plan, the most recent version of the “City Of Inver Grove Heights
Stormwater Manual” and/or this article. Moreover, the license contract shall
permit the city to certify the costs of the maintenance/correction to the taxes
for the subject private property.
      2.   Ownership:
         a.   The boundaries of storm water management features shall be
clearly delineated on all plans, including final PUD plans, preliminary plats
and final plats.
         b.   The designated storm water management features may be owned by
one or more of the following:
         (1)   Property owner, provided the deed to each lot includes a
proportionate share of the storm water management features.
         (2)   Homeowners’ association, provided all of the following
conditions are met:
            (A) The homeowners’ association must be established prior to any
sale.
            (B) Membership must be mandatory for each owner and any successive
buyer.
            (C) The association must be responsible for liability insurance,
local taxes and maintenance of the storm water management features.
            (D) Landowners must pay their pro rata share of the cost and the
assessment levied by the association that can become a lien on the property in
accordance with Minnesota statutes.
            (E) The association must be able to adjust the assessment to meet
changed needs.
         (3)   Third party (nonprofit) organization whose primary purpose is to
hold or manage the stormwater management features, subject to a reversionary
clause in the event of dissolution of the nonprofit organization.
         (4)   The city will accept ownership by easement of the stormwater
management features, including rainwater gardens, when the features serve as a
part of the larger regional or neighborhood stormwater management needs as
defined by the “Northwest Quadrant Hydrologic & Hydraulic Analysis” completed
by Emmons & Olivier Resources in 2004 or the “Northwest Area Alternative Urban
Areawide Review” prepared by Bonestroo, Rosene, Anderlik & Associates in 2005.
The city will not accept ownership of such features as downspouts, cisterns,
green roofs, parking lot bioremediation or other such systems or features
interior to the parcel.
      3.   Maintenance:
         a.   Maintenance of all stormwater features encumbered by public
easements as described in subsection H1e of this section shall be the
responsibility of the city according to the measures outlined in the most
recent version of the “City Of Inver Grove Heights Stormwater Manual”.
         b.   All stormwater features that are not encumbered by public
easements as described in subsection H1e of this section shall be maintained
according to the covenants and/or maintenance agreements approved by the city
pursuant to subsection H1f of this section, the stormwater management plan
approved by the city with the planned unit development, the development
contract approved by the city, together with the planned unit development, and
the “City Of Inver Grove Heights Stormwater Manual” plans. (Ord. 1148, 5-29-
2007)
      4.   Inspections:
         a.   Authorized representatives of the city may conduct inspections at
reasonable times throughout the construction process to meet the specifications
in the “City Of Inver Grove Heights Stormwater Manual” and the stormwater
management plan approved by the city, together with the planned unit
development plans. (Ord. 1148, 5-29-2007; amd. 2008 Code)
         b.   Authorized representatives from the city may conduct inspections
on a regular basis at any reasonable time to assure the safe and proper
functioning of the features and/or to respond to citizen concerns. (Ord. 1148,
5-29-2007)
      5.   Stormwater Manual Adopted: All the contents, provisions and terms of
the “Inver Grove Heights Northwest Area Stormwater Manual”, dated July 2006,
prepared by Emmons & Olivier Resources, are hereby adopted and made a part of
this code. The adoption of said stormwater manual includes adoption of all the
chapters and appendices thereof. The stormwater manual is fully incorporated by
reference. For the convenience of the public, the stormwater manual shall be
kept in a book separate from this title so that the stormwater manual may be
more easily distributed and made available for public inspection. The contents,
provisions and terms of the stormwater manual shall constitute this subsection
H5. (Ord. 1148, 5-29-2007)
         a.   Amendment: The definition of impervious surface contained in
appendix C of the “Inver Grove Heights Northwest Area Stormwater Manual” dated
July 2006, prepared by Emmons & Olivier Resources, as codified in subsection H5
of this section, is hereby amended to read as follows:
         Impervious Surface. The term impervious surface, for purposes of the
Inver Grove Heights Northwest Area Stormwater Manual, shall have the same
meaning as that term is defined by Inver Grove Heights city code section
10-2-2.
         (Ord. 1180, 9-8-2008)
   I.   Procedures:
      1.   Sketch Plan: Preparation of a sketch plan by the developer is
strongly encouraged. Given the site design complexities of the northwest area
overlay district, a sketch plan should be prepared and submitted for each
development. Without a thoroughly prepared sketch plan, the likelihood
increases that the preliminary development plan application will be found
inadequate by the city. The sketch plan should be prepared following the
submittal requirements outlined in subsection
11-2-5A of this code. In addition, the sketch plan should include the following
elements: a) a preliminary stormwater management concept should be provided in
outline format identifying desired techniques for the development proposal
based upon the “City Of Inver Grove Heights Stormwater Manual”; b)
identification of the natural resources as included within the “City Of Inver
Grove Heights Natural Resource Inventory And Management Plan For The Northwest
Expansion Area” (Bonestroo, Rosene, Anderlik & Associates, 2004); c) a
conceptual development capacity plan as described in subsection E of this
section; and d) a conceptual scaled natural area/open space plan identifying
all natural area/open spaces as required in subsection D of this section. The
sketch plan should be prepared and presented to city staff thirty (30) days
prior to submittal of the preliminary PUD plan.
      2.   Preliminary Development Plan: A preliminary development plan shall
be prepared and submitted by the developer. It shall include: a) a preliminary
plat prepared pursuant to subsection
11-2-5B of this code; b) a preliminary PUD development plan prepared pursuant
to subsection
10-13A-11A of this chapter; c) a stormwater management plan consistent with the
“City Of Inver Grove Heights Stormwater Manual” and consistent with the
stipulations provided in subsection H of this section; d) a development
capacity plan as described in subsection E of this section; and e) a scaled
natural area/open space plan identifying all natural area/open spaces as
required in subsection D of this section.
      3.   Final Development Plan: A final development plan shall be prepared
and submitted by the developer. It shall include: a) a final plat prepared
pursuant to subsection
11-2-5C of this code; b) a final PUD development plan prepared pursuant to
subsection
10-13A-11B of this chapter; and c) the final development plans in the northwest
area overlay district shall follow the procedures outlines in section
9-5-6 of this code. No physical alteration or improvement of the property may
commence until after the final development plan and development contract are
approved by the city council, except that site grading may begin earlier if the
city council approves a land alteration permit for the grading. The location
and number of units approved in the final plan shall not be altered without
approval of the council through an amendment process. (Ord. 1148, 5-29-2007;
amd. Ord. 1482, 8-12-2024)
10-13J-6: PERFORMANCE STANDARDS:
Developments shall follow the standards of
Chapter 15  of this title unless otherwise addressed in this section.
   A.   Site Landscaping: Within the northwest area overlay district, the use
of native vegetation for landscaping is encouraged in common areas. Areas
preserved with natural landscaping shall be maintained in accordance with local
and state regulations governing control of noxious weeds. Mass grading for
landscaping areas shall be avoided to reduce compaction of natural area/open
space areas.
   B.   Off Street Parking And Loading:
      1.   Joint Parking: Joint parking arrangements are encouraged in the
northwest area overlay district.
      2.   Off Site Or Remote Parking Facilities: Within the northwest area
overlay district, remote parking is permitted so long as it is within
reasonable walking distance to the principal use and it does not require
crossing major physical barriers such as freeways, four-lane arterials, water
bodies or other nonpedestrian friendly features. Reasonable walking distance is
considered no more than a one-eighth (1/8) mile (660 feet) or a five (5) minute
walk.
      3.   Parking Surfaces: Parking surfaces may be made of pervious materials
such as pavers, pervious asphalt or concrete or other technology as identified
in the "City Of Inver Grove Heights Stormwater Manual". These areas shall still
be considered as impervious surfaces for storm water calculations; however, up
to fifty percent (50%) of pervious pavement areas will be credited toward the
twenty percent (20%) natural area/open space requirements (see subsection
10-13J-5 D1 of this article). Pervious material surfaces shall be clearly
delineated on the approved final PUD plans. Long term redevelopment and
maintenance must preserve the pervious pavement surface.
      4.   Parking Lot Curbing: Curbs shall be designed to meet the standards
set forth in the "City Of Inver Grove Heights Stormwater Manual" so as to
ensure safety and best management of storm water. Generally, curbs shall either
be flat or have breaks at regular intervals to convey runoff into the storm
water system unless a storm water management plan demonstrates that another
curbing system meets storm water management performance objectives.
      5.   Minimum And Maximum Number Of Permitted Off Street Parking Spaces:
         a.   Subsection
10-15A-3 J of this title establishes a minimum number of required off street
parking spaces for various land uses. With the exception of single-family
dwellings and two- family dwellings, this article reestablishes the minimum
required off street parking spaces and establishes a maximum allowed number of
parking spaces as well.
         b.   The minimum required off street parking spaces shall be no less
than seventy five percent (75%) of the minimum parking required by subsection
10-15A-3 J of this title. Pervious paving materials shall be used for the
portion of parking over the minimum required off street parking spaces.
         c.   The maximum allowed off street parking spaces shall be no more
than one hundred percent (100%) of the minimum parking required by subsection
10-15A-3 J of this title. (Ord. 1148, 5-29-2007)
         d.   The maximum allowed off street parking identified above may be
exceeded by no more than ten percent (10%) of the total number of parking
spaces, provided that at least fifty percent (50%) of the total parking lot
surface area is paved with a pervious material consistent with techniques
identified in the "City Of Inver Grove Heights Stormwater Manual" or fifty
percent (50%) of the parking spaces are in a deck structure or underground.
Parking in excess of the maximum shall be done with pervious paving materials.
(Ord. 1148, 5-29-2007; amd. 2008 Code)
      6.   Parking For Multi-Family Residential (Including Townhomes) And Mixed
Use: Fifty percent (50%) of total parking required for multi-family and mixed
use development shall be underground parking, tuck-under parking or structured
parking within or under the principal structure. The intent of this regulation
is to minimize impervious surface that would result from surface parking lots.
      7.   Proof Of Parking: Developments that can accommodate parking
allotments less than the minimum parking spaces required may do so, provided
that the final PUD plan includes the identification of area dedicated for
future parking needs to satisfy the minimum parking needs.
      8.   On Street Parking: Where on street parking is available, parking
spaces that are adjacent to the lot frontage of the subject use may be counted
towards the off street parking requirement.
      9.   Parking Lot Landscaping: Surface parking lots in excess of one
hundred (100) spaces shall provide landscaped islands between contiguous bays
of parking. Such landscaped islands shall also serve as a storm water cell and
shall be designed according to the guidelines established in the "City Of Inver
Grove Heights Stormwater Manual" (chapter 8, pages 14 and 91).
   C.   Driveways:
      1. Driveway widths for single-family detached residential dwellings, two-
family and twin home dwellings shall be no more than twenty feet (20')
throughout its entire length, and curb openings shall be no more than twenty
two feet (22'). In all other cases, driveway width shall be no more than thirty
five feet (35') and curb openings no more than forty feet (40'). Where
additional hard surface is desired, such as an additional parking space near
the garage, where a turn around/guest parking space is desired or where a
nonresidential development desires a boulevard or median design feature,
additional pavement beyond the maximum width must be of a permanent pervious
surface such as brick pavers, pervious concrete/asphalt or other technique as
approved through the "City Of Inver Grove Heights Stormwater Manual".
      2.   Shared driveways are encouraged within the northwest area overlay
district to reduce impervious surface coverage. No more than two (2) dwelling
units may be served by a shared driveway, unless otherwise approved by the city
council based on the criteria identified in section
10-13J-5  of this article. Shared driveways shall extend from a public or
private street and shall not connect to any other existing or planned public or
private street. Appropriate cross easements and maintenance agreements are
required with submittal of final PUD plan and shall be recorded with the final
plat.
      3.   Single-family residential driveways are encouraged to be constructed
of pervious materials such as pavers, pervious concrete or pervious asphalt.
   D.   Downspouts And Sump Pumps:
      1.   All residential downspouts and sump pumps shall discharge to
cisterns and/or permeable surfaces.
      2.   All nonresidential downspouts and sump pumps shall discharge to
permeable surfaces if reasonably possible. (Ord. 1148, 5-29-2007)
10-13J-7: SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS:
The standards and regulations identified in title 11 of this code shall be
followed except when standards are identified in this section.
   A.   Streets designated in the city comprehensive plan as collectors or
arterials shall be designed based on city standards.
   B.   Local streets may take the form of a two-way street, a pair of one-way
streets on either side of a landscaped median, or a one- way loop street.
   C.   Local streets shall have the following design standards as measured
from the back of curb to the back of curb:
      1.   Right of way widths shall be between fifty feet (50') and sixty feet
(60') as dictated by the location of storm water features.
      2.   Local public streets shall have a minimum twenty eight foot (28')
paved width in addition to a sidewalk or trail on one side of the street. This
street dimension shall restrict parking to only one side of the street.
      3.   Local private streets with a twenty four foot (24') width shall be
acceptable with no parking on either side. Approved development plans shall
demonstrate where guest parking is available.
   D.   The developer/applicant must demonstrate that access to the development
has the capacity to handle traffic generated by the proposed project and will
not endanger the safety of the general public.
   E.   Cul-de-sac dead end streets are discouraged. Cul-de-sac dead end
streets, designed to be so permanently, shall be provided at the closed end
with a turn around having an outside roadway radius of thirty five feet (35')
and a street property line (ROW) radius of fifty feet (50'). Cul-de-sacs can be
designed with larger diameters, provided a landscaped island is included and
designed for storm water storage. Landscaped medians are encouraged to be
designed in cul-de-sac bulbs to handle storm water runoff and provide a place
for snow storage during snow season.
   F.   Where proposed streets will connect with existing streets having
differing standards, the street dimension shall be the same as those of the
existing connecting street. All street widening shall occur at the nearest
intersection. (Ord. 1148, 5-29-2007)
ARTICLE K. LOT SIZE AND BULK STANDARDS FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF PUBLIC LAND
SECTION:
10-13K-1 Findings
10-13K-2 Purpose And Intent
10-13K-3 Exemptions
10-13K-1: FINDINGS:
The city finds that the minimum lot sizes and bulk standards for the zoning
districts may not rationally relate to the nature and function of certain types
of public land. Unless an exception is created for certain public lands, the
minimum lot sizes and bulk standards for the zoning districts would apply in
instances where the public lands were owned in fee title by a governmental
unit, as opposed to the governmental unit having an easement only. (Ord. 1246,
11-14-2011)
10-13K-2: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
The purpose and intent of this article is to create an exception for certain
public lands from the minimum lot size and bulk standards for the underlying
zoning districts. (Ord. 1246, 11-14-2011)
10-13K-3: EXEMPTIONS:
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this title, in instances where the
public land is owned in fee by a governmental unit, the following types of
public land are exempt from the lot size requirements and bulk standards for
the underlying zoning districts:
   A.    Trails.
   B.    Streets.
   C.    Areas restricted to open space or conservation land.
   D.    Stormwater ponds and stormwater facilities. (Ord. 1246, 11-14-2011)

10-14-2 Interim Uses Enumerated
10-14-3 Permit Requirements
10-14-4 Effect On Underlying Districts
10-14-1: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
In order to provide property owners with greater flexibility on the usage of
their property prior to final development, the city has defined specific uses
that may be approved for a property, subject to city council approval. Interim
uses are typically uses that are not appropriate based upon strict application
of restrictions of this title, existing development and proposed future land
use plans; however, they may have merit as uses as a precursor to final
development of a property. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
10-14-2: INTERIM USES ENUMERATED:
The following land uses shall be deemed interim uses within the city:
   A.    Within the B-3 and I-1 zoning districts only, portable or temporary
metal shipping containers or storage pods associated with mini-storage
facilities, subject to the conditions contained in an approved interim use
permit. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
   B.    Within A, R-1A, R-1B, R-1C, E-1, E-2 and R-2 zoning districts, a
second kitchen and bath facility shall be allowed in single- family homes for a
state licensed care provider (as permitted under Minnesota statutes section
245A.11a). (Ord. 1103, 2-14-2005)
   C.    Within the A agricultural zoning district, athletic fields used in
conjunction with an adjoining school shall be allowed. (Ord. 1132, 7-10-2006)
   D.    Within the I-2 general industry zoning district, a temporary
contractor's yard with outdoor storage shall be allowed. (Ord. 1129, 4-10-2006)
   E.    Within the I-1 limited industry and I-2 general industry districts
only, crushing of concrete, asphalt or asphalt cement shall be allowed, subject
to the conditions contained in an approved interim use permit and subject to
the following: (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
      1.    Crushing shall be limited to the crushing of concrete, asphalt or
asphalt cement, and "asphalt debris", defined as waste concrete or asphalt
rubble resulting from construction, repair, and demolition of roads, provided
the material to be crushed does not contain "hazardous waste", as defined in
section
10-2-2 of this title, and does not contain asbestos and glass. (Ord. 1098, 11-
8-2004; amd. 2008 Code)
      2.    Crushing shall be allowed only as long as the property is used as a
contractor's yard.
      3.    Crushing shall be allowed so long as it does not create a "public
nuisance" or cause land pollution, noise pollution or air pollution as defined
in Minnesota statutes section 116.06, subdivisions 14, 16 and 4, respectively,
as amended from time to time.
      4.    Crushing operation shall only be allowed on a parcel of ten (10.0)
acres or greater in size.
      5.    Crushing shall be restricted to a onetime, maximum eight (8)
workday period per calendar year.
      6.    The time period shall occur only between November 15 through April

thousand (10,000) tons per year.
      8.    The height of any rubble or recycled crushed pile shall not exceed
thirty five feet (35').
      9.    Crushing of asphalt and concrete shall cease if the property is
rezoned or if the principal use of the property changes from what was existing
as of the date of the interim use permit issuance. (Ord. 1139, 11-27-2006)
   F.    Allow a temporary ministorage facility with outdoor storage in the I-
1 and I-2 Zoning Districts. (Ord. 1165, 10-8-2007)
   G.    The crushing of concrete or asphalt shall be allowed on a temporary
basis associated with a public road construction project subject to the
following:
      1.    The crushing and any staging areas shall occur in the City of Inver
Grove Heights.
      2.    Crushing shall occur only between the hours of seven o'clock (7:00)
A.M. and four thirty o'clock (4:30) P.M. Monday through Friday.
      3.    The crushing of the material shall cease within thirty (30) days of
completion of the projects within the City of Inver Grove Heights.
      4.    The concrete or asphalt being crushed must come from a public road
construction project in the City of Inver Grove Heights and at least ninety
percent (90%) must be reused in a public road construction project in the City
of Inver Grove Heights. (Ord. 1183, 10-22-2008)
   H.    Within A, E-1, E-2, R-1A, R-1B, R-1C, and single-family PUD Zoning
Districts, the following form of supervised student housing shall be allowed
subject to the following:
      1.    The supervised student housing shall be under the general

sponsored by an organization holding a tax status of 501(c)(3) that promotes
education provided students are participating in an educational program located
in Dakota County.
      2.    The maximum number of students allowed shall be determined by the
following formula: Every bedroom used to house one student shall contain a
minimum of seventy (70) square feet. Every bedroom occupied by more than one
student shall contain a minimum of fifty (50) square feet of floor area for
each student, but in no case shall the maximum number of students allowed per
dwelling exceed eight (8).
      3.    The owner of the premises shall provide and maintain compliance
with all Building and Fire Safety Codes as required by the City building
official and Fire Marshal.
      4.    The single-family home shall be inspected for code compliance by
the chief building official prior to occupancy and annually thereafter.
      5.    The interim use shall expire if the organization sponsoring the
program changes or if there are no students occupying the premises for more
than one year.
      6.    Staff member(s) of the supervising organization may also occupy the
single-family dwelling, in a bedroom separate from the students, provided the
maximum number of students be reduced by the number of staff if the staff
person(s) are not part of the single family occupying the dwelling. (Ord. 1294,
6-8-2015)
   I.    Within the A Agricultural Zoning District, contractor's yard with
outdoor storage shall be allowed provided the parcel is guided commercial as
identified on the Inver Grove Heights comprehensive plan land use map. (Ord.
1316, 6-13-2016)
   J.    Within B-3, B-4, and P Zoning Districts, park-and-ride facilities such
as short-term parking and park-and-fly lots shall be allowed subject to the

10-15D-4: Education
10-15D-5: Exemptions
10-15D-1: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
The purpose of this article is to provide for minimal tree loss and mitigation
of tree removal in wooded areas of the city. Tree cover is beneficial in terms
of aesthetics, screening, cooling, wildlife habitat, watershed control, air
quality enhancements, erosion control and preservation and enhancements of
property values. Land alteration that causes large scale destruction of trees
diminishes and impairs the public health, safety and general welfare. The
intention of this article is to provide regulations relating to the cutting or
removal of trees in areas where the natural vegetation or topography are to be
significantly altered. (Ord. 1147, 5-14-2007)
10-15D-2: WOODLAND PROTECTION STANDARDS:
No land alteration within a woodland shall occur until the city finds that the
land alteration complies with the following:
   A.   Maximum Possible Preservation: The land alteration shall be conducted
so that the maximum amount of woodland is preserved by the clustering of
structures wherever possible, or by the use of other innovative design
techniques where appropriate. Measures shall be taken to protect and preserve
the preservation area as described in the city's "Guidelines For Preventing
Construction Damage".
   B.   Protection Of Root Zones: Grading, contouring, paving, and any
excavation or trenching, as well as parking of vehicles, material storage, dirt
stockpiling and other similar activities, shall not occur within or
detrimentally affect the aeration or permeability of the root zone in the
preservation area. The "root zone" shall be understood to mean the area within
a radius surrounding the tree trunk of one foot (1') per one inch (1") of tree
diameter.
   C.   Data Submission: The applicant shall submit data at the time of
preliminary plat submission to the city that outlines conformance to this
article. The data shall include:
      1.   Inventory of all significant and heritage trees by species, diameter
and condition.
      2.   Proposed building pad location for each lot including custom graded
lots.
      3.   Identification of significant and heritage trees to be preserved.
      4.   Identification of significant and heritage trees to be removed,
including those to be removed in the future for a proposed building pad by a
developer or builder.
      5.   Identification of all significant and heritage trees within the
thirty foot (30') grading limit.
   D.   Removal Thresholds:
      1.   Although the applicant must retain the maximum amount of woodland
possible, the city recognizes that a certain amount of significant trees and
tree cover removal is an inevitable consequence of the urban development
process.
      2.   Therefore, in the following zoning districts listed in column I, a
percentage of the woodland may be removed without any obligation for
reforestation, but only up to and including the threshold percentage of
woodland listed in column II. If the land alteration results in woodland
removal that is less than the percentage thresholds of column II, then the
applicant shall be given, for each percent under the thresholds, a credit of
one percent (1%), up to a maximum of ten percent (10%), toward the total park
dedication or park contribution requirement of sections
11-4-5 and
11-4-6 of this code. If the land alteration results in woodland removal that
exceeds the percentage listed in column II, then the applicant shall be
responsible for reforestation in accordance with the standards of this article.
 
Column I                  Column II
Zoning District           Threshold
A                         25 percent
E-1 and E-2               25 percent
R-1A, R-1B, R-1C and R-2  30 percent
R-3A, R-3B, R-3C and R-3D 40 percent
B-1, B-2 and P            50 percent
B-3, B-4, I-1 and I-2     60 percent
   E.   Reforestation:
      1.   If the land alteration results in woodland removal beyond the
woodland removal threshold, the applicant shall be required to submit a
reforestation plan. The reforestation plan must be submitted prior to final
plat approval. The reforestation plan shall include:
         a.   Location of proposed reforestation.
         b.   Species and size of proposed plantings.
         c.   Quantity of proposed plantings.
      2.   The reforestation plan shall comply with the following criteria:
         a.   Tree replacement will be predicated on total number of diameter
inches of significant and heritage trees removed beyond the threshold limits
outlined in subsection D of this section.
         b.   Actual replacement quantities shall be adjusted based on the type
of woodland removed in accordance with the following guidelines:
            (1)   Class A, fast growing deciduous species, predominantly aspen,
Siberian elm, American elm, silver maple, red maple, willow: fifty percent
(50%).
            (2)   Class B, conifer/mixed hardwoods, predominantly pine, spruce,
cedar and mixed hardwoods consisting of the following species: oak, birch,
sugar maple, black cherry, basswood, ironwood, walnut, ash, hackberry, locust:
one hundred percent (100%).
            (3)   Class C, heritage tree: one hundred percent (100%). For each
heritage tree saved, the developer may receive credit towards the required
replacement trees. This credit will be at a rate of two (2) caliper inches for
each one dbh inch saved. To receive this credit, the applicant must demonstrate
that extraordinary measures have been taken to preserve the heritage trees that
otherwise would not be saved.
         c.   Species replacement must meet site landscaping requirements
(subsection 10-15-11A of this chapter). Consideration should be given to a
replacement tree species' potential to disease, and emphasis on planting
diversity should be encouraged.
         d.   Where heritage trees have been removed, replacement trees shall
consist of the same species as the removed heritage tree, or a tree that has
the same potential value as the removed heritage tree. This value shall be
certified by a certified forester or arborist. For the purposes of this
subsection E2d, "value" is defined as a species which has the same growth and
life potential as the removed tree.
         e.   Required replacement trees shall be planted on the site being
developed in areas such as yard setbacks and outlots. These trees shall be
planted based on the frequency and density as determined by the city. Unless
found otherwise, at least seventy five percent (75%), but in no case less than
forty five percent (45%), of the required tree placement shall occur on the
site being developed. Should the development not have sufficient room on the
site to allow for all required reforestation, the balance may, at the city
council's discretion, either be: 1) planted upon public property in locations
approved by the city; or 2) a cash payment to the city in an amount equivalent
to the cost of the plantings, said payment to be used by the city for future
plantings on public property.
         f.   The reforestation plan shall be reviewed by the city planner and
shall be considered by the city council as part of final plat approval.
         g.   The actual replacement quantities for woodlands located on
commercial and industrial developments in tax increment financing districts may
be reduced according to such factors as: the stated purposes for creation of
the subject tax increment district, need for tax base generation in the tax
increment district, and mandatory landscaping requirements as specified in the
city's landscaping policy. The city administrator shall review each such
proposal prior to final plat approval and make a recommendation to the city
council on the actual percentage of replacement that will be required. At the
time of final plat approval, the city council shall make a final decision
regarding actual replacement quantities based upon the factors listed above. In
no instance will the replacement rate be less than ten percent (10%) for class
A species and twenty five percent (25%) for class B and C species, as defined
in subsection E2b of this section.
   F.   Construction Damage To Significant Trees In Or Near Preservation Area:
Significant and heritage trees which are within thirty feet (30') of the
proposed grading limits shall be surveyed by the applicant. Any significant or
heritage tree that the applicant commits to preserve that is subsequently
damaged, during or as a result of construction, shall be replaced by the
applicant on a one for one diameter inch basis.
   G.   Pruning Trees: Owners or developers pruning oak trees between April 15
and August 1 must apply an appropriate nontoxic wound sealant to any cut areas.
   H.   Landscape Security:
      1.   The applicant shall post with the city a landscape performance bond
or cash deposit or letter of credit in an amount equal to one hundred twenty
five percent (125%) of the cost of the plantings, plus installation, when the
land alteration exceeds the woodland removal threshold limit. The bond shall
ensure adherence to the requirements of this article.
      2.   The performance security shall remain in effect for at least one
year after the date that the last replacement tree has been planted. The city
may release the performance security at that time unless the city planner, upon
inspection, finds that any of the replacement trees have died or are unhealthy,
or if there was any encroachment upon the protective fencing surrounding any
tree to be saved. The city may retain that portion of the performance security
equal to the cost of removing dead or unhealthy trees and replanting
replacement trees. If the applicant supplies proof of a nursery guarantee which
is approved by the city planner, then the performance security posted by the
applicant shall be released upon planting of the last guaranteed tree. The
nursery guarantee shall remove liability from the applicant, and responsibility
will be placed upon the nursery or current landowner. (Ord. 1147, 5-14-2007)
10-15D-3: REPLACEMENT TREES:
Replacement trees shall be planted no more than twelve (12) months after the
date that land alteration has commenced. If the applicant is prevented from
performing within this time limit because of unforeseeable reasons beyond the
applicant's control, the city planner may extend the time for performance. The
applicant shall inform the city planner when all replacement trees have been
planted, at which time, the city planner shall inspect the site. (Ord. 1147, 5-
14-2007)
10-15D-4: EDUCATION:
The city parks and recreation director shall develop an education program which
shall be distributed to applicants and all general contractors prior to
receiving a contractor's license from the city. The information shall include,
but not be limited to, prevention of construction damage to trees, tree
replacement, pruning, general tree protection techniques and tree disease
information. (Ord. 1147, 5-14-2007)
10-15D-5: EXEMPTIONS:
   A.   All public improvement projects shall be exempt from the requirements
of this article.
   B.   The requirements of this article shall not apply to the removal of
trees seriously damaged by storm, other acts of nature, or disease. (Ord. 1147,
5-14-2007)

feet in surface area per sign surface. Maximum allowable extensions shall not
exceed ten percent (10%) of the total sign area.
   D.   Number Of Surfaces: Billboards shall not contain more than two (2) sign
surfaces. Said sign surfaces shall face in opposite directions with an interior
angle not to exceed forty five degrees (45°).
   E.   Height: Billboards shall not exceed forty feet (40') in height as
measured from the established grade of the site upon which the billboard is
located.
   F.   Location:
      1.   Billboards shall be set back a minimum of fifty feet (50') from the
edge of the right of way and all property lines.
      2.   Billboards shall not be closer than five hundred feet (500') from a
park, rest area or historic site, one thousand feet (1,000') from schools and
churches, and three hundred feet (300') from the A, E or R zoning districts.
   G.   Site Restrictions: Billboards shall not be placed upon any property

   H.   Removal: Billboards shall be removed prior to the city approving an
administrative subdivision, waiver of plat, or final plat of property upon
which the billboard is located, or prior to the city issuing a building permit
for the construction of a building or building addition for property upon which
the billboard is located. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)
   I.   Dynamic Display Billboards:
      1.   Findings, Purpose And Intent: The city council finds it necessary
for the promotion and preservation of the health, safety, welfare, and
aesthetics of the community that the construction, location, size, conspicuity,
brightness, legibility, operational characteristics and maintenance of dynamic
display billboards be controlled. Dynamic display billboards have a direct and
substantial impact on traffic safety, pedestrian safety, community aesthetics
and property values. The city council recognizes that signs provide a guide to
the physical environment and as such serve an important function in the
community and economy. With respect to dynamic display billboards, including
video display billboards, the city council finds that they are highly visible
from long distances and at very wide viewing angles both day and night and are
designed to catch the eye of persons in their vicinity and hold it for extended
periods of time. If left uncontrolled, dynamic display billboards, including
video display signs, constitute a serious traffic safety threat. Studies such
as "'Dynamic' Signage: Research Related To Driver Distraction And Ordinance
Recommendations" by SRF Consulting Group, Inc., June 7, 2007, reveal that
electronic signs are highly distracting to drivers and that driver distraction
continues to be a significant underlying cause of traffic accidents. The city
council intends by this subsection to establish a legal framework for dynamic
display billboard regulation in the city. The regulations promulgated in this
subsection are intended to facilitate an easy and agreeable communication
between people while protecting and promoting the public health, safety,
welfare and aesthetics of the community. It is not the purpose or intent of
this subsection to prefer or favor commercial messages or speech over
noncommercial messages or speech or to discriminate between types of
noncommercial speech or the viewpoints represented therein. Rather, the purpose
of the dynamic display billboard regulations promulgated in this subsection is:
         a.   To eliminate potential hazards to motorists and pedestrians using
the public streets, sidewalks, and rights of way;
         b.   To safeguard and enhance property values;
         c.   To control nuisances;
         d.   To preserve and improve the appearance of the city through
adherence to aesthetic principles, in order to create a community that is
attractive to residents and to nonresidents who come to live, visit, work, or
trade;
         e.   To eliminate excessive and confusing sign displays;
         f.   To encourage signs which by their design are integrated with and
harmonious to the surrounding environment and the buildings and sites they
occupy; and
         g.   To promote the public health, safety, and general welfare.
      2.   Location Of Dynamic Display Billboards: Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained within this code, dynamic display billboards may be
located only within the billboard overlay district. Dynamic display billboards
are prohibited in all zoning districts of the city other than the billboard
overlay district. Dynamic display billboards located in the billboard overlay
district must comply with all code requirements for permitted dynamic display
billboards and for billboards per Section
10-15E-6 of the City Code.
      3.   Nonconforming Billboards: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained within this code, a legal nonconforming sign or billboard shall not
be converted to a dynamic display billboard unless the legal nonconforming sign
or billboard is located in the billboard overlay district. A legal
nonconforming sign or billboard may be continued through repair, replacement,
restoration, maintenance, or improvement but shall not be expanded, enlarged,
intensified or moved to a new location. Replacement, reconstruction, or
restoration means construction that exactly matches preexisting conditions.
Expansion or intensification includes, but is not limited to, replacement of a

10-15F-2: Definitions
10-15F-3: Standards

The nature of adult uses is such that they are recognized as having adverse
secondary characteristics, particularly when they are accessible to minors and
located near residential property or related residential uses such as schools,

uses has an adverse effect upon the use and enjoyment of adjacent areas. The
nature of adult uses requires that they not be allowed within certain zoning
districts, or within minimum distances from each other or residential uses.
Special regulation of adult uses is necessary to ensure that the adverse
secondary effects will not contribute or enhance criminal activity in the area
of such uses nor will it contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the
surrounding property and the lessening of its value. (Ord. 1098, 11-8-2004)

property to be placed thereon in the future. A nonconforming use certificate
shall not allow a principal use that did not legally exist on the property
prior to the property becoming nonconforming. (Ord. 1198, 11-9-2009)
CHAPTER 17
OUTDOOR BURNERS/BOILERS
SECTION:
10-17-1: Restrictions For Outdoor Burners/Boilers
10-17-1: RESTRICTIONS FOR OUTDOOR BURNERS/BOILERS:
   A.   Findings: The city council of the city of Inver Grove Heights adopts
the following findings concerning outdoor burners/boilers and the need to
prohibit new outdoor burners/boilers:
      1.   Wood smoke is one of the chief causes of certain types of air
pollution in the United States. ("Smoke Gets In Your Lungs: Outdoor Wood
Boilers In New York State", Eliot Spitzer, attorney general of New York state,
environmental protection bureau, August 2005, p.6)
      2.   Residential wood smoke contains fine particles and toxic air
pollutants (e.g., benzene and formaldehyde). ("Strategies For Reducing
Residential Wood Smoke", outreach and information division, air quality
planning division, office of air quality planning and standards, U.S.
environmental protection agency, October 29, 2009, p.4)
      3.   Outdoor wood burners/boilers may emit significant pollution because
the basic design of the outdoor wood burner/boiler causes fuel to burn
incompletely, or smolder, which results in thick smoke and high particulate
emissions. ("Smoke Gets In Your Lungs: Outdoor Wood Boilers In New York State",
Eliot Spitzer, attorney general of New York state, environmental protection
bureau, August 2005, p.5)
      4.   Smoke emitted from outdoor wood burners/boilers can cause or
contribute to short term health harms such as eye, nose, throat and lung
irritation, coughing and shortness of breath, and may exacerbate asthma or
trigger asthma attacks. ("Smoke Gets In Your Lungs: Outdoor Wood Boilers In New
York State", Eliot Spitzer, attorney general of New York state, environmental
protection bureau, August 2005, p.5)
      5.   Chronic exposure to smoke can cause long term effects such as
asthma, heart and lung disease, and cancer. ("Smoke Gets In Your Lungs: Outdoor
Wood Boilers In New York State", Eliot Spitzer, attorney general of New York
state, environmental protection bureau, August 2005, p.5)
      6.   There is public concern about the use of older technology hydronic
heaters (also known as outdoor wood boilers) and their growing use,
particularly in the Northeast and Midwest. ("Strategies For Reducing
Residential Wood Smoke", outreach and information division, air quality
planning division, office of air quality planning and standards, U.S.
environmental protection agency, October 29, 2009, p.4)
      7.   As traditional sources of fuel (e.g., natural gas and heating oil)
prices have gone up over the last several years, the purchase and use of wood
fired hydronic heaters, also known as "outdoor wood boilers" have increased.
("Strategies For Reducing Residential Wood Smoke", outreach and information
division, air quality planning division, office of air quality planning and
standards, U.S. environmental protection agency, October 29, 2009, p.6)
      8.   Outdoor wood burner/boiler chimneys are often short and thus do not
carry the smoke past the heights of neighboring homes, thus resulting in
undispersed smoke and more concentrated pollution at lower elevations. ("Smoke
Gets In Your Lungs: Outdoor Wood Boilers In New York State", Eliot Spitzer,
attorney general of New York state, environmental protection bureau, August
2005, p.5, 12)
      9.   The United States environmental protection agency does not currently
regulate the manufacture, sale, or efficiency claims of outdoor wood burners/
boilers. ("Smoke Gets In Your Lungs: Outdoor Wood Boilers In New York State",
Eliot Spitzer, attorney general of New York state, environmental protection
bureau, August 2005, p.17)
      10.   In light of the significant harm that wood smoke can present, the
city council finds that the burning of other similar plantbased materials poses
similar risks when burned in outdoor burners/boilers.
      11.   Given the potential for significant harm to residents' health, the
city council hereby finds and declares that outdoor burners/boilers constitute
a public nuisance.
   B.   Definitions:
   OUTDOOR BURNER/BOILER: A freestanding device designed, intended or used for
the burning of wood or other biomass materials including, but not limited to,
wood pellets or corn that is located outside of the structure or building for
which it is primarily designed and intended to provide heat through pipes,
pumps or other apparatus by distributing, transferring or conveying heated
fluids or gases. This definition includes, but is not limited to, the following
commonly described devices: outdoor wood burners, outdoor wood boilers, outdoor
wood boiler systems, outdoor wood burning furnaces, outdoor wood heaters,
outdoor wood fired boilers, and outdoor wood fired furnaces, as well as outdoor
burners, outdoor boilers, outdoor boiler systems, outdoor furnaces, outdoor
boilers and outdoor heaters.
Outdoor burner/boiler does not include fire pits, recreational fires or
fireplaces. Outdoor burner/boiler does not include any device burning wood or
other biomass materials that is primarily designed, intended or used to heat
the structure within which the device is located. Outdoor burner/boiler does
not include any heating device that uses gas or oil as a primary fuel source.
   C.   Prohibition Of New Outdoor Burners/Boilers: From and after December 1,
2010, outdoor burners/boilers are prohibited subject to subsection D of this
section.
   D.   Prohibition Of Use And Operation Of Existing Outdoor Burners/Boilers:
The owner of an existing outdoor burner/boiler must not use or operate the
outdoor burner/boiler from and after October 1, 2011. (Ord. 1220, 11-8-2010,

   A.   Any proposed subdivision deemed premature for development may not be
approved by the City Council. The burden of proof shall be on the subdivider to
demonstrate to the City Council that the proposed subdivision is not premature.
A subdivision may be deemed premature if any of the following conditions exist:
      1.   Inconsistent with the Comprehensive Plan. A proposed subdivision may
be deemed premature if it is inconsistent with the goals, policies, phasing or
other requirements of the Comprehensive Plan. Application for a Comprehensive
Plan Amendment may be made concurrently with an application for subdivision
approval; however, a subdivision application will not be considered for
approval by the City Council until and unless any necessary Comprehensive Plan
Amendment is approved by the City Council.
      2.   Inconsistent with the Capital Improvement Plan. A proposed
subdivision may be deemed premature if it is inconsistent with the City’s
Capital Improvement Plan if public improvements, facilities, or services
necessary to accommodate the proposed subdivision would not be completed within
two (2) years of the date of application unless otherwise extended by the City
Council.
      3.   Lack of Adequate Water Supply. Unless guided as Rural Residential by
the Comprehensive Plan, a proposed subdivision may be deemed premature if
municipal water is not available to adequately serve the proposed subdivision.
Available and adequate service shall mean existing or readily extended; capable
of meeting the demands for pressure, fire flow, and system head loss for the
subdivision proposed without adverse impacts to the City’s existing water
supply system; and funded consistent with the phasing in the Comprehensive
Plan, the Capital Improvement Plan, and any relevant city ordinances, plans and
policies. If guided as Rural Residential by the Comprehensive Plan, a proposed
subdivision shall be deemed premature if a private well(s) cannot be suitably
located and permitted to adequately serve the proposed subdivision.
      4.   Lack of Adequate Waste Disposal System. Unless guided as Rural
Residential by the Comprehensive Plan, a proposed subdivision may be deemed
premature if the municipal sanitary sewer is not available to adequately serve
the proposed subdivision. Available and adequate service shall mean existing or
readily extended; capable of meeting the demands for capacity for the
subdivision proposed without adverse impacts to the City’s existing sanitary
sewer system; and funded consistent with the phasing in the Comprehensive Plan,
the Capital Improvement Plan, and any relevant city ordinances, plans and
policies. If guided as Rural Residential by the Comprehensive Plan, a proposed
subdivision shall be deemed premature if a private subsurface sewage treatment
system cannot be suitably located and permitted to adequately serve the
proposed subdivision.
      5.   Lack of Adequate Streets. A proposed subdivision may be deemed
premature if streets to serve the proposed subdivision are not available.
Available shall mean existing or readily extended; capable of meeting the
demands for traffic without adverse impacts to the existing public roadway
network; and funded consistent with the phasing in the Comprehensive Plan, the
Capital Improvement Plan, and any relevant city ordinances, plans and policies.
In addition, a proposed subdivision may be deemed premature if the traffic
volume generated by the proposed subdivision would create a hazard to public
safety and general welfare or create unacceptable levels of congestion on
existing or proposed streets as determined by the City Engineer.
      6.   Lack of Adequate Drainage. A proposed subdivision may be deemed
premature if municipal or private surface water management facilities are not
available to adequately meet minimum local, watershed and state treatment
requirements including downstream infrastructure to manage stormwater.
Available and adequate service shall mean existing or readily constructed;
capable of meeting the demands for flow capacity and flood protection for the
subdivision proposed without adverse impacts to the City’s existing storm sewer
system; and funded consistent with the phasing in the Comprehensive Plan, the
Capital Improvement Plan, and any relevant city ordinances, plans and policies.
In addition, a proposed subdivision may be deemed premature where flood plains,
poor soils or steep slopes exist in such a manner as to preclude adequate site
drainage or treatment of surface water runoff.
      7.   Inconsistent with State Environmental Review. A proposed subdivision
may be deemed premature if it is inconsistent with the rules and policies of
the Minnesota Environmental Quality Board, as may be amended. (Ord. 1445, 5-8-
2023)

CHAPTER 4
PARK, TRAIL AND RECREATION DEDICATION OR CASH IN LIEU
SECTION:
11-4-1: Purpose And Intent
11-4-2: Dedication Or Cash In Lieu Required
11-4-3: Suitability Of Land
11-4-4: General Requirements
11-4-5: Land Dedication
11-4-6: Cash Contribution
11-4-7: Combination Of Cash And Land
11-4-8: Mixed Uses
11-4-9: Park Acquisition And Development Fund
11-4-1: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
   A.   The city council recognizes it is essential to the health, safety and
welfare of the residents of the city and persons working in the city that the
character and quality of the environment be considered to be of major
importance in the planning and development of the city. In this regard, the
manner in which land is developed and used is of high priority. The
preservation of land for park, playground and public open space purposes as it
relates to the use and development of land for residential and commercial/
industrial purposes is essential to maintaining a healthful and desirable
environment for all citizens of the city. The city must not only provide these
necessary amenities for our citizens today, but also be insightful to the needs
of future citizens.
   B.   The city council recognizes that the demand for park, playground, trail
and public open space within a municipality is directly related to the density
and intensity of development permitted and allowed within any given area. Urban
type developments mean greater numbers of people and higher demands for park,
playground and public open space. To disregard this principle is to inevitably
overtax existing facilities and thus, diminish the quality of the environment
for all.
   C.   The city parks and recreation advisory commission has established
minimum community criteria for meeting the needs of the residents of the city.
In order to meet the community needs for parks, ten (10) acres of park shall be
required for each one thousand (1,000) residents. This shall be the standard
upon which the city shall establish its park land dedication and parks cash
contribution.
   D.   It is the policy of the city that the standards and guidelines of this
chapter for the dedication of land for park, playground and public open space
purposes (or cash contributions in lieu of such dedication) in the subdividing
and developing of land within the city shall be directly related to the density
and intensity of each subdivision and development.
   E.   The state has recognized the importance of providing for parks and open
space in Minnesota statutes section 462.358, subdivision 2(b), which clearly
gives the right to the city in its subdivision regulations to require
reasonable portions for public use. (Ord. 1157, 6-11-2007)
11-4-2: DEDICATION OR CASH IN LIEU REQUIRED:
As a prerequisite to subdivision approval, subdividers shall dedicate land for
parks, playgrounds, public open spaces, and trails and/or shall make a cash
contribution to the park acquisition and development fund as provided by this
chapter. Final approval of the park dedication/contribution requirements shall
be made by the city council. (Ord. 1157, 6-11-2007)
11-4-3: SUITABILITY OF LAND:
Dedicated land shall be reasonably suitable for its intended use, and shall be
at a location convenient to the people to be served, and shall be consistent
with the "Comprehensive Park Plan And Development Guide Plan" used in
evaluating the adequacy of proposed park and recreation areas. These factors
shall include size, shape, topography, geology, hydrology, tree cover, access
and location. Land with dead trees, trash, junk, pollutants and unwanted
structures is not acceptable, unless the developer first removes the
unacceptable material. (Ord. 1157, 6-11-2007)
11-4-4: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Parks And Recreation Advisory Commission Recommendation: Prior to the
preliminary plat approval, the parks and recreation advisory commission shall
recommend to the city council the land and/or cash contribution requirements
for proposed subdivision.
   B.   Change In Density: Any increase in density of a platted or proposed
subdivision shall be reviewed by the parks and recreation advisory commission
and the council for reconsideration of park land and/or cash contribution
requirements.
   C.   Additional Purchase: When a proposed park, playground, recreation area,
or other public ground is indicated in the city's official map or adopted
comprehensive plan and is located in whole or in part within a proposed
subdivision, it shall be designated as such on the plat. If the subdivider
elects not to dedicate an area in excess of the land required hereunder for
such proposed public site, the city may consider acquiring the site through
purchase.
   D.   Relationship To Other Open Space: The amount of land to be dedicated by
a subdivider shall be based on the gross area of the proposed subdivision. The
amount of land to be dedicated by a subdivider shall be based on the density of
development. Such dedication shall be consistent with the comprehensive plan
and "Comprehensive Park Plan And Development Guide Plan" for future parks.
   E.   Partial Credit: Where private open space for park and recreation
purposes is provided in a proposed subdivision, such areas may be used for
partial credit, at the discretion of the city council, against the land or cash
dedication requirement for park and recreation purposes, provided the city
council finds it is in the public interest to do so.
   F.   Change Of Requirements: The city, upon consideration of a particular
type of development, may require larger or smaller parcels of land than
provided in section
11-4-5 of this chapter to be conveyed to the city if the city determines that
present or future residents would require greater or lesser land for park and
playground purposes. (Ord. 1157, 6-11-2007)
11-4-5: LAND DEDICATION:
   A.   In a subdivision where a land dedication is required, the following
formula will be used as a guide to the park land dedication requirements which
shall be made at time of final plat approval:
Zoning District Land Dedication
                (Percentage Of Land To Be Dedicated To The City)
Zoning District    Land Dedication
                   (Percentage Of Land To Be Dedicated To The City)
A and E-1 and E-2  To be determined by council at time of final plat
R-1 and R-2        9
R-3A and R-3B      18
R-3C               30
B-1, B-2, B-3, B-4 4.5
I-1 and I-2        4.0
P                  4.5
Pursuant to Minnesota statutes 462.358, subdivision 2b(a), the percentages
shown above shall be multiplied by the buildable land within the subdivision.
For this calculation, the "buildable land" means the area being subdivided
remaining after excluding those portions that are either:
      1.   Encumbered by right of way for arterial roads as defined in the
Inver Grove Heights comprehensive plan;
      2.   Lying below the ordinary high water level of public waters as
identified in the shoreland management overlay district (see
title 10, chapter 13, article B of this code); or
      3.   Lying within the boundaries of wetlands delineated according to the
Minnesota wetland conservation act; or
      4.   Bluffs in shoreland management overlay districts abutting public
waters.
When outlots are part of the subdivision and are intended to be replatted into
buildable lots in the future, the percentages of dedication shown above shall
not be applied to the land area within the outlots; when the outlots are later
replatted into buildable lots, the dedication percentages shall then be
applied. If the outlots are not intended to be replatted, but are intended to
remain as outlots, the dedication percentages shown above shall be applied to
the land area contained in such outlots.
   B.   Land proposed to be dedicated for public purposes shall meet identified
needs of the city as contained in the "Comprehensive Park Plan And Development
Guide Plan" and the comprehensive plan.
   C.   Prior to dedication, the subdivider shall deliver to the city attorney
a title insurance commitment and a title insurance policy in favor of the city.
The dedicated land shall be conveyed by warranty deed. Such title shall vest in
the city good and marketable title, free and clear of any mortgages, liens,
encumbrances, assessments and taxes. The conveyance documents shall be in such
form acceptable to the city.
   D.   The required dedication and/or payment of fees in lieu of land
dedication shall be made at the time of final plat approval.
   E.   The removal of trees and topsoil, the storage of construction
equipment, the burying of construction debris, and stockpiling are strictly
forbidden without the written approval of the director of parks and recreation.
   F.   Grading and utility plans which may affect or impact the proposed park
dedication shall be reviewed and approved by the parks and recreation director
prior to dedication, or at such time as reasonably determined by the director
of parks and recreation.
   G.   1. To be eligible for park dedication credit, land dedicated must be
located outside of drainways, floodplains or ponding areas. Land with grades
exceeding twelve percent (12%) or unsuitable for parks development shall be
considered for partial dedication.
      2.   Where ponding has been determined by the city council to have a park
function, credit will be given at a rate of fifty percent (50%) of the pond and
adjoining land area below the high water level. A minimum of seventy percent
(70%) of land above the high water mark shall be dedicated before pond credit
is granted. Other city park dedication policies relating to pond dedication
must also be complied with.
      3.   In those cases where the subdividers and developers of land provide
significant amenities such as, but not limited to, swimming pools, tennis
courts, handball fields, etc., within the development for the benefit of those
residing or working therein, and where, in the judgment of the director of
parks and recreation, such amenities significantly reduce the demands for
public recreational facilities to serve the development, the director of parks
and recreation may recommend to the parks and recreation advisory commission
and the city council that the amount of land to be dedicated for park,
playground, and public open area space (or cash contributions in lieu of such
dedication) be reduced by an amount not to exceed twenty five percent (25%) of
the amount calculated under this section.
   H.   The city may determine that the subdivider create and maintain some
form of on site recreation use by the site residents such as tot lots and open
play space. This requirement may be in addition to the land or cash dedication
requirement.
   I.   The subdivider must provide finished grading and ground cover for all
park, playground, trail and public open spaces within the development as part
of the development contract or site plan approval responsibilities. Landscape
screening shall be in accordance with city policy.
   J.   The subdivider must establish park boundary corners for the purpose of
erecting park limit signs. The developer shall contact the appropriate parks
and recreation department personnel for the purpose of identifying park
property corners.
   K.   The subdivider must provide sufficient public road frontage of not less
than three hundred feet (300') for neighborhood parks and additional frontage
for community parks. (Ord. 1277, 2-24-2014)
11-4-6: CASH CONTRIBUTION:
   A.   Residential Subdivisions: The following cash contribution fees per
residential unit shall be made at the time of final plat approval:
