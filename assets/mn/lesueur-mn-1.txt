CHARTER
Editor’s note:
   According to “History of the Minnesota Valley” (pages 480, 481), by the Rev.
Edward D. Nell, 1882, North Star Publishing Co., Minneapolis, Le Sueur “dates
its birth in 1852, one year previous to the creation of Le Sueur County... In
its early history there were three villages, Le Sueur, Middle Le Sueur and Le
Sueur City, also the township of Le Sueur.” Rev. Neill goes on to relate that
Le Sueur was first incorporated June 10, 1858, and Le Sueur City was first
incorporated seven days later. “For nine years thereafter the two villages vied
with each other, neither observing any regularity in civil matters. On March 9,
1867, by special act of the legislature, the two rival villages were
incorporated in one borough town, Le Sueur,” and village officers were
appointed. “In February, 1871, to avoid the necessity of two sets of officials,
the township organization was done away with, and the entire territory included
in one borough town of Le Sueur.”
   Le Sueur is now a city of the fourth class, and the home rule Charter set
out herein was adopted at a special election held March 9, 1971, at which more
than 51% of the votes cast were marked in favor of adoption; it took effect 30
days thereafter, as provided in §
1.05. Copies of the Charter have been filed by the city clerk in his own office
and in the offices of the secretary of state and the register of deeds of Le
Sueur County, together with certification and information as required by M.S. §
410.11.
   In setting out the Charter herein, the editors have adopted a uniform system
of capitalization and, in a few sections, have added words in brackets for
purposes of clarification. Some of the section catchlines have been changed and
enlarged so as to more fully indicate the contents of such section, and the
catchlines are not to be regarded as official. No other changes have been made
in the Charter as herein set out.
   For state law as to requirement that courts take judicial notice of home
rule charters as attested and filed in office of secretary of state, county
recorder and municipal clerk, see M.S.A. § 410.11. As to the City Charter here
set out being prima facie evidence in the courts, see §
10.01 of this Code, and cross-references thereunder to applicable state law.
For state law as to home rule charters generally, and procedures for amendment
thereof, see M S.A. Chapter 410.

   No member of any initiative, referendum, or recall committee, no circulator
of a signature paper, and no signer of any such paper, or any other person,

in connection with the circulation thereof, but this shall not prevent the
committee from paying for legal advice or from incurring expenses for
stationery, copying, printing and notaries' fees. Any violation of the
provisions of this section is a misdemeanor.
(Ord. 556, passed 6-27-2016)

addresses as sponsors.
SEC. 5.05 FORM OF PETITION AND OF SIGNATURE PAPERS.
   The petition for the adoption of any ordinance shall consist of the

attached. Such petition shall not be complete unless signed by a number of
voters equal to at least fifteen per cent of the total number of votes cast in
the municipality at the last preceding presidential year general election. All
the signatures need not be on one signature paper, but the circulator of every
such paper shall make an affidavit that each signature, appended to the paper
is the genuine signature of the person whose name it purports to be. Each
signature paper shall be in substantially the following form:
   “INITIATIVE PETITION

SEC. 5.06 FILING OF PETITIONS AND ACTION THEREON.
   All the signature papers shall be filed in the office of the city clerk as
one instrument on or before thirty days after the verified copy of the
ordinance is filed as required by section 5.04 above. Within fifteen (15) days
after the filing of the petition the city clerk shall ascertain by examination
the number of electors whose signatures are appended thereto and whether this
number is at least fifteen per cent of the total number of electors who cast
their votes in the municipality at the last preceding presidential year general
election. If the clerk finds the petition insufficient or irregular, the clerk
shall at once notify one or more of the committee of sponsors of that fact,
certifying the reasons for the finding. The committee shall then be given
fifteen (15) days in which to file additional signature papers and to correct
the petition in all other particulars. If at the end of that period the
petition is found to be still insufficient or irregular, the clerk shall file
it in their office and shall notify each member of the committee of that fact.
The final finding of the insufficiency or irregularity of a petition shall not
prejudice the filing of a new petition for the same purpose, nor shall it
prevent the council from referring the ordinance to the electors at the next
regular election at its option.
(Ord. 556, passed 6-27-2016)
SEC. 5.07 ACTION OF COUNCIL ON PETITION.
   If the petition is found to be sufficient, the city clerk shall so certify
to the council at its next meeting, stating the number of petitioners and the
percentage of the total number of voters which they constitute, and the council
shall at once read the ordinance and refer it to an appropriate committee,
which may be a committee of the whole. The committee or council shall thereupon
provide for public hearings upon the ordinance, after the holding of which the
ordinance shall be finally acted upon by the council not later than sixty-five
(65) days after the date upon which it was submitted to the council by the city
clerk. If the council fails to pass the proposed ordinance, or passes it in a
form different from that set forth in the petition and unsatisfactory to the
petitioners, the proposed ordinance shall be submitted by the council to the
vote of the electors at the next regular municipal election; but if the number
of signers of the petition is equal to at least twenty-five per cent (25%) of
the total number of voters voting in the municipality at the last preceding
presidential year general election, the council shall call a special election
upon the measure. Such special election shall be held not less than thirty (30)
nor more than forty-five (45) days from date of final action on the ordinance
by the council or after the expiration of sixty-five (65) days from the date of
submission to the council when there has been no final action; but if a regular
election is to occur within three months, the council may submit the ordinance
at that election. If the council passes the proposed ordinance with amendments
and at least four-fifths (4/5) of the committee of petitioners do not express
their dissatisfaction with such amended form by a statement filed with the city
clerk within ten (10) days of the passage thereof by the council, the ordinance
need not be submitted to the electors.
SEC. 5.08 INITIATIVE BALLOTS.
   The ballots used when voting upon any such proposed ordinance shall state
the substance of the ordinance and shall give the voters the opportunity to
vote either “yes” or “no” on the question of adoption, if a majority of the
electors voting on any ordinance vote in favor of it, it shall thereupon become
an ordinance of the city. Any number of proposed ordinances may be voted upon
at the same election but the voter shall be allowed to vote for or against each
separately, in case of inconsistency between two initiated ordinances approved
at one election, the one approved by the higher percentage of electors voting
on the question shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.
SEC. 5.09 INITIATION OF CHARTER AMENDMENTS.
   Nothing in this Charter shall be construed as in any way affecting the right
of the electors under the Constitution and statutes of Minnesota to propose
amendments to this Charter.
REFERENDUM
SEC. 5.10 THE REFERENDUM.
   If prior to the date when an ordinance takes effect a petition signed by
qualified electors of the city equal in number to fifteen (15) per cent of the
total vote voting in the municipality at the last preceding presidential year
general election is filed with the city clerk requesting that any such
ordinance be repealed or be submitted to a vote of the electors, the ordinance
shall thereby be prevented from going into operation. The council shall
thereupon reconsider the ordinance at its next regular meeting, and either
repeal it, or by yes and no vote re-affirm its adherence to the ordinance as
passed. In the latter case the council shall immediately order a special
election to be held thereon, or submit the ordinance at the next regular
municipal election, pending which the ordinance shall remain suspended. If a
majority of the electors voting thereon is opposed to the ordinance, it shall
not become effective; but if a majority of the electors voting thereon favors
the ordinance, it shall go into effect immediately on canvass of the ballots
and announcement and publications of the result thereof or on the date provided
in said ordinance whichever may be later upon compliance with all of the
provisions of chapter 3 hereof with reference to ordinances.
SEC. 5.11 REFERENDUM PETITIONS.

5.04 and

one or more members of the committee. The committee shall then be given ten
days in which to file additional signature papers and to correct the petition
in all other respects, but they may not change the statement of the grounds
upon which the recall is sought. If at the end of that time the city clerk
finds the petition still insufficient or irregular, the clerk shall notify all
the members of the committee to that effect and shall file the petition in the
clerk's office. No further action shall be taken thereon.
(Ord. 556, passed 6-27-2016; Ord. 558, passed 7-11-2016)
SEC. 5.16 RECALL ELECTION.
   If the petition or amended petition is found sufficient, the city clerk
shall transmit it to the council without delay, and shall also officially
notify the person sought to be recalled of the sufficiency of the petition and
of the pending action. The council shall at its next meeting, by resolution,
provide for the holding of a special recall election not less than thirty (30)
nor more than forty-five (45) days after such meeting, but if any other
election is to occur within sixty (60) days after such meeting, the council may
in its discretion provide for the holding of the recall election at that time.
SEC. 5.17 PROCEDURE AT RECALL ELECTION.
   The city clerk shall include with the published notice of the election the
statement of the grounds for the recall and also, in not more than five hundred

receipt by the council of the completed recall petition, the form of the ballot
at such election shall be as near as may be: "Shall
                                       be recalled?", the name of the officer
whose recall is sought being inserted in the blank, and the electors shall be
permitted to vote separately "Yes" or "No" upon this question. The ballot shall
also contain the names of the candidates to be voted upon to fill the vacancy
in case the recall is successful under the caption "Candidates to fill the
place of                                           , if recalled"; but the
officer whose recall is sought shall not themselves be a candidate upon such
ballot. If a majority of those voting on the question of recall vote in favor
of recall, the official shall be thereby removed from office, and the candidate
who receives the highest number of votes for their place shall be elected
thereto for the remainder of the unexpired term. If the officer sought to be
recalled resigns within ten days after the receipt by the council of the
completed recall petition, the form of ballot at the election shall be the

unforeseen cause become insufficient for the ordinary expenses of the city or
if any calamity or other public emergency should subject the city to the
necessity of making extraordinary expenditures, by provisions of section
7.07 or
7.08, the council may by ordinance authorize such expenditures and issue
emergency debt certificates to run not to exceed two years. A tax sufficient,
to pay principal and interest on such certificates with the margin required by

City Administrator deems it applicable, in his or her sole discretion, the
Police Department is authorized to do a criminal history background
investigation and/or driver’s license investigation on applicants for city
licenses and permits. Before the investigation is undertaken, the applicant
must authorize the Police Department in writing to undertake the investigation
and to release the information to the City Council, City Administrator and
other city staff as appropriate. If after the investigation, the City
Administrator is satisfied that all requirements of law and this code have been
met, the City Clerk shall present the application to the City Council for
action or if the license or permit does not require City Council approval, the
City Clerk shall issue the license or permit.
      (2)   Except in the case of exceptions set forth in M.S. § 364.09, as it
may be amended from time to time, should the city deny the applicant’s request
for a license or permit due partially or solely to the applicant’s prior
conviction of a crime, the City Administrator shall notify the applicant in
writing of the following:
         (a)   The grounds and reasons for denial;
         (b)   The applicant complaint and grievance procedure set forth in
M.S. § 364.06, as it may be amended from time to time;
         (c)   The earliest date the applicant may reapply for a license; and
         (d)   That all competent evidence of rehabilitation will be considered

§ 30.07 PREPAYMENT OF LEVIED SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS.
   (A)   The owner of any property that has levied against it a special
assessment may at any time prior to certification of the assessment or the
first installment thereof to the County Auditor, pay the whole assessment on
the property with interest accrued to the date of payment to the City Treasurer
except that no interest shall be charged if the entire assessment is paid
within 30 days from the adoption of the resolution that levied the assessment
against the property.
   (B)   The owner may at any time prior to November 15 of any year prepay to
the City Treasurer the whole assessment remaining due with interest accrued to
December 31 of the year in which the prepayment is made.
   (C)   In addition, the owner of the property subject to the levied special
assessment may make a partial payment on the assessment interest free if done
so within 30 days of the date that the resolution that caused the assessment to
be levied is passed. The remaining balance after the prepayment within the 30-
day period shall be dealt with in the same manner as all other levied special
assessments that have not been paid within the 30-day period.
(Ord. 508, passed 12-10-2007)
§ 30.08 ADMINISTRATIVE CITATIONS AND CIVIL FINES.
   (A)   Purpose. The administrative enforcement procedures established within
this chapter are intended to provide the city with an informal, cost-effective
and more efficient supplement or alternative to criminal prosecution or civil
litigation for certain violations of the adopted city code. The city retains
the right, at its sole discretion, to enforce provisions of this code by
bringing criminal charges or commencing civil litigation in any case where the
city determines it is appropriate or necessary, but finds that an
administrative process is beneficial to the residents of the city and further
finds that such a process is a legitimate and necessary alternative method of
enforcing code violations. This method of enforcement is in addition to any
other legal remedy that may be pursued for violation of the city code.
   (B)   General provisions.
      (1)   Administrative offenses. Any violation of any section or chapter of
the city code, and any violation of the terms and/or conditions of any license,
permit, or other approval issued pursuant to the city code, is an
administrative offense that may be subject to an administrative citation and
administrative fines.
      (2)   Continuing violations. Each day a violation exists constitutes a
separate and distinct offense for which a separate penalty can be imposed. The
City Administrator can exercise discretion in imposing an administrative fine
for more than one day of a continuing offense.
      (3)   Schedule of fines. The City Council shall adopt by ordinance, as
part of the fee schedule, a schedule of administrative fines for offenses for
which an administrative citation is issued. A current fee schedule shall be
kept on file at City Hall.
      (4)   Code Compliance Officer. The Code Compliance Officer shall be any
person so appointed to carry out such duties so assigned by the City
Administrator, including but not limited to, the Building Official, Zoning
Administrator, Public Works Director, City Clerk, Fire Chief, and any member of
the Police Department.
      (5)   No limitation on remedies. Nothing herein is intended or shall
require the city to utilize the administrative citation process or otherwise
pursue the remedies outlined in this section. The city retains the right to
pursue any and all other remedies authorized by law to enforce the city code or
penalize violations of city ordinances, including, but not limited to, issuance
of a stop work order, abatement, criminal prosecution, and/or application for
civil penalties or injunctive relief.
   (C)   Administrative procedure.
      (1)   Administrative notice. A Code Compliance Officer may issue, either
in person or by United States first class mail, an administrative notice to a
person suspected, alleged or known to have committed a code offense and/or to
be the owner of property upon which a code offense is being committed. The
administrative notice shall identify the code offense, the location upon which
the code offense is alleged to have occurred or is occurring, and the
corrective action for the code offense. The administrative notice may also
state that the alleged violator has, at the discretion of the Code Compliance
Officer, no more than 20 days to correct or abate the code offense. Immediate
compliance may be required upon the existence of a public health or safety
condition. If the alleged violator and/or owner of property upon which a code
offense is being committed is unable to correct or abate the code offense
within the prescribed time, that person may request in writing an extension of
no more than 30 additional days from the Code Compliance Officer. Any extension
granted by the Code Compliance Officer shall be in writing and shall
specifically state the date of expiration, which shall be determined at the
discretion of the Code Compliance Officer. If the code offense is not corrected
or abated, as outlined in the administrative notice, within the prescribed time
or any extension thereto, the Code Compliance Officer may issue a citation, as
provided in § 30.08(C)(3).
      (2)   Exceptions to administrative notice. For violations of any of the
following, the city shall not be required to issues an administrative notice or
compliance letter and may proceed directly to an administrative citation as
provided for in § 30.08(C)(3):
         (a)   Repeat offenders. If the same owner or person commits a
subsequent violation within 12 months after an administrative notice or
citation has been issued for the same or similar offense, no compliance letter
or administrative notice shall be required for the new violation.
         (b)   License violations. For any license violations, including not
having a license, no compliance letter or administrative notice shall be
required.
         (c) Building code order. For a violation of any official order from
the Building Official, no compliance letter or administrative notice shall be
required.
      (3)   Citation. Upon receiving no response or continued noncompliance
following issuance of the administrative notice or code compliance letter as
stated in § 30.08(A), the Code Compliance Officer may issue a citation. The
citation shall be given to the person responsible for the violation and/or to
the owner of the property upon which the alleged violation has occurred, either
by personal service or by United States first class mail. Said citation shall
state the nature of the code offense, the time and date said alleged code
offense occurred, the civil penalty applicable to that code offense as set
forth in a schedule of civil penalties which shall be adopted by resolution of
the City Council from time to time, and the manner for paying the civil penalty
or requesting a hearing before a hearing officer to contest the citation.
      (4)   Responding to a citation. Once a citation is issued, the alleged
violator and/or the owner of the property upon which the alleged violation has
occurred shall, within ten days of the time of issuance of the citation, either
pay the civil penalty set forth in the citation or request a hearing in writing
according to the procedure set forth in § 30.08(D)(1). The civil penalty may be
paid either in person at City Hall, or by United States first class mail,
postage prepaid and postmarked within said prescribed ten days. Payment of the
civil penalty shall be deemed to be an admission of the code offense. A late
payment fee of 10% of any scheduled fine amount shall be imposed.
      (5)   Payment of penalty.
         (a)   Payment of a penalty and correction of violation. If the owner
pays the administrative civil penalty and corrects the city code violation, no
further action will be taken against the owner or the owner's real property for
that same violation.
         (b)   Payment of penalty without correction of violation. If the owner
pays the administrative civil penalty but fails to correct the city code
violation, the city may issue subsequent administrative citations, initiate
criminal proceedings, or initiate any other proceeding or remedies available in
order to enforce correction of the city code violation.
         (c)   No payment of penalty and no correction of violation. If the
owner fails to pay the administrative civil penalty and fails to correct the
city code violation, the city may do any of the following, or any combination
thereof:
            1.   Assess the administrative civil penalty against the property
pursuant to M.S. Chapter 429 or any other statutory authority.
            2.   Issue a subsequent administrative citation, thereby commencing
a new administrative penalties process.
            3.   Initiate criminal proceedings.
            4.   Initiate any other enforcement action authorized by law.
   (D)   Appeal and hearing.
      (1)   Requesting a hearing. Any person receiving an administrative
citation may contest the alleged violation and the amount of the administrative
civil penalty. In order to contest any part of the administrative citation, the
owner or individual contesting the citation must notify the City Clerk in
writing within ten calendar days after the citation is mailed or otherwise
delivered. The written request shall state the name of the individual, indicate
whether they are contesting the alleged violation, the amount of the penalty,
or both and must also specify the reason and facts upon which the individual is
contesting the citation.
      (2)   Hearing officer. The hearing officer shall be a neutral third party
appointed by the City Council and shall preside over the hearing and make any
judgment as authorized. The hearing officer shall be compensated by the city in
a reasonable manner under the direction of the City Administrator.
      (3)   Conduct at hearing. A hearing officer shall conduct an informal
hearing to determine if a violation has occurred. The hearing officer shall
consider the record and any additional evidence presented at the hearing and
accepted into the record by the hearing officer before making a determination.
The officer shall receive and give weight to evidence, including hearsay
evidence that possesses probative value commonly accepted by reasonable and
prudent people in the conduct of their affairs. The city will have the burden
of proving the existence of a violation and the reasonableness of any required
corrective action by a preponderance of the evidence. The determination of the
enforcement officer will be given substantial weight by the hearing officer in
determining the reasonableness of any required corrective action.
      (4)   Authority of hearing officer. The independent hearing officer has
the authority to do any of the following, or a combination thereof:
         (a)   Make a finding that a violation has occurred;
         (b)   Reduce, stay, or waive a scheduled administrative civil penalty
either unconditionally or upon compliance with reasonable conditions;
         (c)   Require compliance with the city code within a specified time
frame;
         (d)   Make a finding that no violation has occurred and dismiss the
administrative citation.
      (5)   Owner/individual found in violation. If the violation is sustained
by the hearing officer, the violator shall pay the penalty imposed plus an
additional administrative hearing fee as prescribed by the city's fee schedule
to cover the cost of the hearing within ten days of the date of the decision.
      (6)   Failure to appear. Failure to appear at the hearing shall result in
a default judgment against the party who fails to appear. If the owner fails to
appear, the administrative citation shall be sustained. If the city fails to
appear, the administrative citation shall be dismissed.
   (E)   Judicial review. The hearing officer's decision is final without any
further right of administrative appeal. Further appeal shall be to the Le Sueur
County District Court.
   (F)   Violation a misdemeanor. The following are misdemeanors, punishable in
accordance with state law:
      (1)   Failure to pay an administrative fine imposed by administrative
citation within ten days after it has been imposed unless the matter is
appealed to the city as provided herein.
      (2)   Failure to pay an administrative fine within ten days after it has
been imposed by the hearing officer, or such other time as may be established
by the hearing officer, unless the matter is appealed to district court as
provided herein. If the final determination in the administrative penalty
process is a finding that no violation occurred, then the city may not
prosecute a criminal violation in district court based on the same set of
facts. This does not preclude the city from pursuing a criminal prosecution for
a violation for the same provision based on a different set of facts. A
different date of violation will constitute a different set of facts.

Administrator shall be submitted to the City Council for approval prior to the

FEES
§ 30.50 FEES FOR EMERGENCY PROTECTION SERVICES.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. This section is adopted for the purpose of
authorizing the city to charge for services as authorized by M.S. §§ 366.011,
366.012 and 415.01, as they may be amended from time to time.
   (B)   Collection of unpaid service charges and fees. If the city is
authorized to impose a service charge or fee on the owner, lessee, or occupant
of property, or any of them, for a governmental service provided by the city,
the city may certify to the County Auditor, on or before October 15 for each
year, any unpaid services charges or fees which shall then be collected
together with property taxes levied against the property. A charge or fee may
be certified to the Auditor only if, on or before September 15, the city has
given written notice to the property owner of its intention to certify the
charge or fee to the Auditor. The service charges or fees shall be subject to
the same penalties, interest, and other conditions provided for the collection
of property taxes. This section is in addition to any other law authorizing the
collection of unpaid costs and services charges or fees.
   (C)   Charges for emergency services; collection.
      (1)   The city or any other entity of the city may impose a reasonable
service charge for emergency services, including police, fire, rescue, medical,
and related services provided by the city or contracted for by the city. If the
service charge remains unpaid 30 days after a notice of delinquency is sent to
the recipient of the service or the recipient's representative or estate, the
city or its contractor on behalf of the city may use any lawful means allowed
to a private party for the collection of an unsecured delinquent debt. The city
will collect unpaid service charges of this kind from delinquent recipients of
services, and may certify such delinquent charges to the County Auditor for
collection in the county in which the recipient of such services owns real
property anywhere in the State of Minnesota pursuant to M.S. §§ 366.011 and
366.012.
      (2)   The powers conferred by this section are in addition and
supplemental to the powers conferred by any other law for a city to impose a
service charge or assessment for a service provided by the city or contracted
for by the city.
      (3)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
         CONTRACT AREA. Those areas encompassing townships, municipalities, or
other entities for which the city has contracted to provide emergency services
and includes in-service areas as defined by the Fire District and the city.
         EMERGENCY PROTECTION CHARGE. A charge imposed by the city for
providing emergency service.
         EMERGENCY SERVICES. Any deployment of any personnel, whether it be
fire, rescue, medical, paramedic or related service to extinguish any fire,
perform any preventative measure, assist medical response or any other related
service in an effort to protect property, equipment or life.
         EVENT. Each occurrence in which emergency service is requested from
any entity from the time of the request until emergency personnel determine the
services provided for the request are no longer necessary.
         PROPERTY OWNER. An individual receiving emergency services who owns
real estate within the contract area or an individual that rents or leases
property within the contract area.
      (4)   Rates. The emergency protection charge rate schedule for emergency
services shall be adopted and amended from time to time in the City of Le Sueur
Governmental Fee Schedule.
      (5)   Collection.
         (a)   Parties requesting and receiving emergency services may be
billed an emergency protection charge directly by the city. Additionally, if
the party receiving emergency services did not request services for a fire or
other situation in which emergency services are required, they may still be
billed for the services. All parties will be billed whether or not the
emergency service is covered by insurance and any billable amount of the
emergency protection charge not covered by party's insurance remains a debt of
the party receiving the emergency service.
         (b)   Parties billed an emergency protection charge for emergency
service will have 30 days to pay. If the emergency protection charge is not
paid by that time, it will be considered delinquent and the city will send a
notice of delinquency.
         (c)   If the emergency protection charge remains unpaid for 30 days
after this notice of delinquency is sent, the city will use all practical and
reasonable legal means to collect the emergency protection charge. The party
receiving emergency services shall be liable for all collection costs incurred
by the city including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney's fees and court
costs.
         (d)   If the emergency protection charge remains unpaid for 30 days
after the notice of delinquency is sent, the City Council may also, on or
before October 15 of each year, certify the unpaid emergency service charge to
the County Auditor in which the recipient of the services owns real property
for collection with the property taxes. The County Auditor then remains
responsible for remitting to the city all charges collected on behalf of the
city and the city must give the property owner notice of its intent to certify
the unpaid fee service charge by September 15.
      (6)   Mutual aid agreement. When the Emergency Services Department
provides service to another department pursuant to a mutual aid agreement, the
billing for the service will be determined by the mutual aid agreement.
      (7)   Application of collections to budget. All collected emergency
protection charges will be city funds and used to offset the expense of the
city's department providing the emergency service.

city planning and preparation for emergency government operations in time of
disasters;
   (B)   To provide for the exercise of necessary powers during emergencies and
disasters;

maximum extent practicable. The officers and personnel of all city departments
and agencies shall, to the maximum extent practicable, cooperate with and
extend services and facilities to the city’s emergency management organization
and to the Governor upon request. The head of each department or agency in
cooperation with the Director shall be responsible for the planning and
programming of those emergency activities as will involve the utilization of
the facilities of the department or agency.
   (F)   The Director shall, in cooperation with those city departments and
agencies affected, assist in the organizing, recruiting and training of

§ 35.06 EMERGENCY REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Whenever necessary, to meet a declared emergency or to prepare for an
emergency for which adequate regulations have not been adopted by the Governor
or the Council, the Council may by resolution promulgate regulations,
consistent with applicable federal or state law or regulation respecting: the
conduct of persons and the use of property during emergencies; the repair,
maintenance, and safeguarding of essential public services, emergency health,

preliminary training, and all other matters which are required to protect
public safety, health and welfare in declared emergencies.
   (B)   Every resolution of emergency regulations shall be in writing; shall
be dated; shall refer to the particular emergency to which it pertains, if so

as the Council shall designate in the resolution. By resolution, the Council
may modify or rescind a regulation.

emergency regulation promulgated by the Council shall be suspended during the
period of time and to the extent conflict exists.
   (D)   During a declared emergency, the city is, under the provisions of M.S.
§ 12.37, as it may be amended from time to time and notwithstanding any

acting within or without the corporate limits of the city, to enter into
contracts and incur obligations necessary to combat the disaster by protecting
the health and safety of persons and property and providing emergency
assistance to the victims of a disaster. The city may exercise these powers in
the light of the exigencies of the disaster without compliance with the time-
consuming procedures and formalities prescribed by law pertaining to the
performance of public work, entering rental equipment agreements, purchase of
supplies and materials, limitations upon tax levies, and the appropriation and

§ 50.02 DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICE UPON NONPAYMENT OF CHARGES OR VIOLATION BY
CUSTOMER; RESTORATION OF SERVICE UPON FULL SETTLEMENT WITH CITY.
   (A)   When any customer of the municipal utilities becomes in arrears with
respect to the payment of any municipal utility bill due the city under any
provision of this chapter, the city through its City Clerk, may discontinue
furnishing municipal utility services to the customer of the municipal
utilities.
   (B)   No municipal utilities may be discontinued until a delinquent utility
notice and an opportunity for a hearing has first been given to the customer.
   (C)   The delinquent utility notice shall be sent by regular mail to the
customer whose name the utilities are in and shall state that if payment is not
made on or before the date stated in the notice, the utilities supply to the
premises will be discontinued.
   (D)   Between April 16 and October 14 (warm weather months), the delinquent
utility notice will include the following information.
      (1)   The customer may, before the disconnection date, request a hearing
on the issue of the amount of utility charges billed and the amount paid on the
bill, in which case the utilities will not be discontinued until after the
hearing is held. If as a result of the hearing, the amount claimed to be owing
is actually due and unpaid and that there is no legal reason why the municipal
utilities service of the delinquent customer may not be discontinued in
accordance with this section, the city may discontinue utility service. A
hearing will be arranged through the City Clerk. The City Clerk will notify the
City Administrator that a utility committee meeting needs to be held to review
the claim. The Utility Committee will make a final determination on the claim,
based on information submitted by the customer and the City Clerk’s office.
      (2)   The delinquent utility notice will also include telephone numbers
of the Minnesota Valley Action Council Energy Assistance Program and Le Sueur
County Human Services and it shall allow 20 days from the date of the notice
until disconnection takes place. Disconnection shall not take place on Friday
or the day before a holiday.
      (3)   In the event any municipal utilities service is discontinued in
accordance with the above provisions, the service shall not be restored by the
city until the delinquent obligation, together with a reconnection charge has

arrangements are not made for repayment with the City Clerk.
   (E)   Between October 15 and April 15 (cold weather months), the delinquent
utility notice will include the following information.
      (1)   The customer may, before the discontinuation date, request a
hearing on the issue of utility charges billed and the amount paid on the bill,
in which case the utilities will not be discontinued until after the hearing is
held. If as a result of the hearing, the amount claimed to be owing is actually
due and unpaid and that there is no legal reason why the municipal utilities
service of the delinquent customer may not be discontinued in accordance with
this section, the city may discontinue utility service. A hearing will be
arranged through the City Clerk. The City Clerk will notify the City
Administrator that a utility committee meeting needs to be held to review the
claim. The utility committee will make a final determination on the claim,
based on information submitted by the customer and the City Clerk’s office.

the day before a holiday.
      (3)   In the event any municipal utilities service is discontinued in
accordance with the above provisions, the service shall not be restored by the
city until the delinquent obligation, together with a reconnection charge has
been paid. The reconnection charge shall be established from time to time by
resolution of the City Council.
   (F)   The notice will also include the customer’s rights and
responsibilities and an inability to pay declaration form.
   (G)   During the “cold weather months,” the municipal utilities may install
a service limiter on delinquent utility customer’s meters, instead of total
disconnection. The service limiter will limit the amount of electricity
available to the utility customer. The limiter will only allow enough
electricity (ten amps) to operate the primary heat source. No other electricity
will be able to be used. If a customer tries to use other electricity, the
limiter shuts off the electricity and the customer will have to reset the
limiter.
   (H)   In order for a customer to be protected by the “cold weather rule,”
they must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Utility disconnection would affect the customer’s primary heat
source;
      (2)   The customer has declared inability to pay on forms provided by the
utility;
      (3)   The household income of the customer is less than 185% of the
federal poverty level, as documented by the customer to the utility; and
      (4)   The customer’s account is current for the billing period
immediately prior to October 15 or the customer has entered into a payment
schedule and is reasonably current with payments under the schedule.
   (I)   Annually, between August 15 and October 15, the municipal utilities
must mail to all residential customers, an annual notice explaining the
Minnesota cold weather rule.

      (1)   New accounts. All new accounts (contracts) for utility service,

the respective property owners. The utility customer shall be the property
owner regardless of who occupies the property or who receives the bill for
utility service.
      (2)   Existing accounts.
         (a)   For all existing accounts, the property owner shall be the
utility customer regardless of who occupies the property or who receives the
bill, notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary between an owner and a

property owner is responsible for all utility account charges to the property,
and the city will ensure that all utility accounts are in the property owner's
name.
         (b)   If an owner of a rental property for all existing accounts
provides the city with a copy of the written lease governing the lease of the

         (a)   The city will send the bill for services to the property owner
unless the property is rental property and the owner agrees to have the city
send a copy of the bill to the tenant, and the owner provides a written
authorization for the city to send bills for that property to the tenant.
         (b)   A property owner may assign, and a tenant may agree to assume,
the duty to pay for utility services. However, the property owner shall remain
ultimately responsible to the city for all utility account charges
notwithstanding any agreement between the owner and tenant.
   (D)   Certification.
      (1)   The city hereby establishes a procedure to certify severely
delinquent utility accounts to the County Auditor for collection with the
subsequent year's property taxes due against the parcel for which said past due
billing is owed.
      (2)   Procedure.
         (a)   After August 1 of each year, the city shall prepare a list of
severely delinquent accounts.
         (b)   Prior to August 8 of each year, the City Council shall select a
date and time for a public hearing at which the Council will hear disputes on
severely delinquent accounts. The date of the public hearing shall be during
the month of September.
         (c)   Prior to August 10 of each year, the city shall send a letter to
the severely delinquent account property owner advising the owner of the
following:
            1.   That the account is severely delinquent along with the balance
owed on the account;

accrued late fees, interest, and/or certification fee) will be certified to the
County Auditor for collection with the following year's property taxes; and
            4.   That the owner has the right to dispute the account only at
the public hearing on the date and time specified in the resolution.
         (d)   The Council shall hold a public hearing on the date selected to
hear account disputes. Any property owner who has a utility account that is
severely delinquent and disputes the delinquent amount shall be entitled to
speak at the public hearing on the matter in dispute before the delinquent
amount is certified. The Council may accept relevant evidence during the
hearing, and shall make and announce their decision prior to the deadline for
certification. A tenant's failure to pay for services shall not in and of
itself constitute grounds to delay or prevent certification of the amount due
for collection.
(Ord. 550, passed 6-22-2015)
§ 50.99 PENALTY.
   It shall be unlawful for any person to do or perform any act or thing

§ 53.122 ESTABLISHMENT OF A SEWERS SERVICE CHARGE SYSTEM.
   (A)   The city hereby establishes a sewer service charge system whereby all
revenue collected from users of the wastewater treatment facilities will be
used to affect all expenditures incurred for annual operation, maintenance and
replacement and for debt service on capital expenditure incurred in
constructing the wastewater treatment works.
   (B)   Each user shall pay its proportionate share of operation maintenance
and replacement costs of the treatment works, based on the users proportionate
contribution to the total wastewater loading from all users.
   (C)   Each user shall pay debt service charges to retire local capital costs
as determined by the City Council.
   (D)   Sewer service rates and charges to users of the wastewater treatment
facility shall be determined and fixed in a “sewer service charge system”
developed according to the provisions of this chapter. The sewer service charge
system developed with the assistance of Bolton & Menk, Inc. shall be adopted by
resolution upon enactment of this chapter, shall be published in the local
newspaper and shall be effective upon publication. Subsequent changes in sewer
service rates and charges shall be adopted by Council resolution and shall be
published in the local newspaper.
   (E)   Revenues collected for sewer service shall be deposited in a separate
fund known as the Sewer Service Fund. Income from revenues collected will be
expended to offset the cost of operation, maintenance and equipment replacement
for the facility and to retire the debt for capital expenditure.

land use.
(Ord. 567, passed 10-23-2017)
§ 55.02 PURPOSE AND POLICY.
   It is the intent of this chapter to establish a stormwater utility within
the city to build, construct, reconstruct, repair, enlarge, improve, or in any
other manner obtain stormwater drainage systems, including mains, holding areas
and ponds, drainage channels, waterways and other appurtenances and related
facilities for the collection and disposal of stormwater and maintain and

derived subject to the provisions of this article and state statutes. The
stormwater drainage utility shall be a part of the Public Services Department
and under the administration of the Public Services Director and City
Administrator.
(Ord. 567, passed 10-23-2017)
§ 55.03 FEE DETERMINATION.
   (A)   Stormwater utility fees for particular parcels of land shall be
determined by multiplying the residential equivalent factor for the parcel
acreage range, as provided in this section, times the base rate established by
the council, times the maximum acreage allowed per tier of the parcel of land.
   (REF)(BASE RATE)(MAX ACREAGE) = MONTHLY CHARGE
 
Parcel Acreage Range       REF  Max Acreage
>0 Acres and <0.5 Acres    1.5  0.5
>=0.5 Acres and <1.0 Acres 1.0  1
>=1.0 Acres and <2.0 Acres 0.8  2
>=2.0 Acres and <3.0 Acres 0.7  3
>=3.0 Acres                0.25 10
 
      Example 1 - 0.33 ACRE PARCEL - REF = 1.5 and Max Acreage = 0.5
      Example 2 - 0.89 ACRE PARCEL - REF = 1.0 and Max Acreage = 1.0
      Example 3 - 7.2 ACRE PARCEL - REF = 0.25 and Max Acreage = 10.0
   (B)   Parcels that fall within the FEMA designated 100-year or 500-year
floodplain will be charged the minimum amount for any parcel within the city.
(>0 acres and <0.5 acres)
   (C)   Exemptions. The following land uses are exempt from stormwater utility
fees:
      (1)   Public rights-of-way;
      (2)   City-owned land except that which is leased to non-governmental
entities or persons;
      (3)   Public and private cemeteries; and
      (4)   Land outside city limits.
(Ord. 567, passed 10-23-2017; Ord. 574, passed 6-11-2018)
§ 55.04 PAYMENT.
   Statements for stormwater utility fees shall be computed and invoiced by the
city along with other utility bills such as sewer, water and garbage
collection. Any prepayment or overpayment of charges shall be retained by the
city and applied against subsequent fees.
(Ord. 567, passed 10-23-2017)
§ 55.05 RECALCULATION.
   If a property owner or person responsible for paying the stormwater utility
fee questions the correctness of an invoice for such charge, such person may
have the determination of the charge recomputed by written request to the
Public Services Director made within two months of the mailing of the invoice
in question by the city. In the event an error in calculation is discovered, no
adjustment of fees shall be made retroactive more than one billing cycle prior
to the date recalculation was requested.
(Ord. 567, passed 10-23-2017)
§ 55.06 CERTIFICATION OF PAST DUE FEES ON TAXES.
   Stormwater utility fees shall constitute a lien against the property against
which they are charged from the date they are due and until they are paid in
full. Any stormwater utility fees in excess of 90 days past due on October 1 of
any year may be certified to the county auditor for collection with real estate
taxes in the following year pursuant to M.S. § 444.075, Subdivision 3. The city
shall also have the right to bring a civil action and to pursue any other
available legal remedies to collect unpaid fees.

owner of a dangerous dog if the owner presents sufficient evidence that:
         (a)   There is a proper enclosure;
         (b)   Written proof that there is a surety bond by a surety company
authorized to conduct business in Minnesota in the sum of at least $300,000,

section must post a sign with the uniform dangerous dog warning symbol on the
property in order to inform children that there is a dangerous dog on the
property. The sign will be provided by the city upon issuance of the license.

for a dangerous or potentially dangerous dog.
   (E)   Properly restrained in proper enclosure or outside of proper
enclosure. While on the owner’s property, an owner of a dangerous or
potentially dangerous dog must keep it in a proper enclosure. Inside a
residential home, there must be a secured area maintained where the dog will
stay when persons other than family members are present. If the dog is outside
the proper enclosure, the dog must be muzzled and restrained by a substantial
chain or leash no longer than four feet and under the physical restraint of an
adult. The muzzle must be made in a manner that will prevent the dog from
biting any person or animal but that will not cause injury to the dog or
interfere with its vision or respiration.
   (F)   Notification requirements to city.
      (1)   Relocation or death. The owner of a dog that has been declared
dangerous or potentially dangerous must notify the City Police in writing if
the dog is to be relocated from its current address or if the dog has died. The
notification must be given in writing within 30 days of the relocation or
death. The notification must include the current owner’s name and address, and
the new owner’s name and the relocation address. If the relocation address is
outside of the city, the city may notify the local law enforcement agency of
the transfer of the dog into its jurisdiction.
      (2)   Renter’s obligations. A person who owns or possess a dangerous or
potentially dangerous dog and who will rent property from another where the dog
will reside must disclose to the property owner prior to entering the lease
agreement and at the time of any lease renewal periods that the person owns or
possesses a dangerous or potentially dangerous dog that will reside at the
property. A dog owner, who is currently renting property, must notify the
property owner within 14 days of city notification if the owned dog is newly
declared as dangerous or potentially dangerous and the owner keeps the dog on
the property.
      (3)   Transfer of ownership into the city. No dog that has been
previously determined to be dangerous or potentially dangerous by another
jurisdiction shall be kept, owned or harbored in the city unless the dog’s
owner complies with the requirements of this section prior to bringing the dog
into the city. Dogs in violation of this division are subject to impoundment

order that the dog be destroyed in a proper and humane manner and the owner pay
the maintenance costs. If the owner is not convicted and the dog is not
reclaimed by the owner within seven days after the owner has been notified that

until a time as the hearing officer issues an opinion;

The hearing officer must be an impartial employee of the city or an impartial
person retained by the city to conduct the hearing.
         (c)   If the declaration or destruction is upheld by the hearing
officer, actual expenses of the hearing up to a maximum of $1,000, as well as
all maintenance costs, will be the responsibility of the dog’s owner. The
hearing officer shall issue a decision on the matter within ten days after the
hearing. The decision shall be delivered to the dog’s owner by hand delivery or
registered mail as soon as practical and a copy shall be provided to the city.
The decision of the hearing officer is final.
   (K)   Destruction of certain dogs. The Police Chief and/or hearing officer
are authorized to order the destruction or other disposition of any dog, after

period of five years after the original declaration. Any dog found to be in
violation, may be impounded until due process is completed, pursuant to
division (J) above.
      (3)   If any member of a household is prohibited from owning a dog in
division (M)(1) or (M)(2) above, unless specifically approved with or without
restrictions by the city, no person in the household is permitted to own a dog.
   (N)   Dog ownership prohibition review. Beginning three years after a
conviction under division (M)(1) above that prohibits a person from owning a

at variance with the corridors established by the city shall, no later than at
the time of the next reconstruction or excavation of the area where the
facilities are located, move the facilities to the assigned position within the
right-of-way, unless this requirement is waived by the city for good cause
shown, upon consideration of the factors as the remaining economic life of the
facilities, public safety, customer service needs and hardship to the
registrant.
   (C)   Nuisance. As of January 1, 2002, any facilities found in a right-of-
way that have not been registered shall be deemed to be a nuisance. The city
may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but
not limited to, abating the nuisance or taking possession of the facilities and
restoring the right-of-way to a useable condition all at the expense of the
owner of the facilities.
   (D)   Limitation of space. To protect health, safety and welfare of persons
or when necessary to protect the right-of-way and its current use, the city
shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional
facilities within the right-of-way.
(Ord. 460, passed 8-28-2000) Penalty, see §

maintain, support or move a registrant’s facilities to protect it, the city
shall notify the local representative as early as is reasonably possible. Any
costs incurred by the city will be billed to that registrant and must be paid
within 30 days from the date of billing. Each registrant shall be responsible
for the cost of repairing their facilities in the right-of-way that are
damaged. Each registrant shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any
damage to the facilities of another registrant caused during the city’s
response to an emergency occasioned by that registrant’s facilities.
(Ord. 460, passed 8-28-2000)
§ 92.105 RIGHT-OF-WAY VACATION.

(Ord. 460, passed 8-28-2000)
§ 92.106 INDEMNIFICATION.
   By registering with the city or by accepting a permit under this subchapter,
a registrant or permittee agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the
city from all liability or claims of liability for bodily injury or death to
persons or for property damage, in which the claim:
   (A)   Alleges a negligent or otherwise wrongful act or omission of the
registrant or permitee or its employees, agents or independent contractors in
installing, maintaining or repairing the permitee’s or registrant’s facilities;
and alleges that the city is liable without alleging any independent, negligent
or otherwise wrongful act or omission on the part of city;
   (B)   Is based on the city’s negligent or otherwise wrongful act or omission
in issuing the permit or registering the registrant or in failing to properly
or adequately inspect or enforce compliance with a term, condition or purpose
of the permit granted to the permittee. The registrant or permittee is not
required to indemnify the city for losses or claims occasioned by the negligent
or otherwise wrongful act or omission of the city except to the extent
authorized in the previous sentence regarding the issuance of a permit or the
inspection or enforcement of compliance with a permit or when otherwise
provided in an applicable franchise agreement;
   (C)   A defense or indemnification of the city by a registrant or permittee
is deemed not to be a waiver of any defense or immunity otherwise available to
city. A registrant or permittee, in defending any action on behalf of the city,
is entitled to assert every defense or immunity that the city could assert on
its own behalf; and
   (D)   The city’s authorization to proceed with excavation or obstruction in
the right-of-way pursuant to notice Minnesota Rules 7819.1200 is deemed a
permit for the purpose of this section.
(Ord. 460, passed 8-28-2000)

facilities in the right-of-way under this subchapter have been lawfully assumed
by another registrant.
   (B)   Removal. Any registrant who has abandoned facilities in any right-of-
way shall, at registrant’s expense, remove it from that right-of-way if
required in conjunction with other right-of-way repair, excavation or
construction, unless this requirement is waived by the city.
(Ord. 460, passed 8-28-2000)
§ 92.108 APPEAL.
   A right-of-way user that has been denied registration, has been denied a
permit, has had its permit revoked or believes that the fees imposed are
invalid, may have the denial, revocation or fee imposition reviewed, upon
written request, to the City Council. The City Council shall act on the written
request within 30 days of its receipt. A decision of the City Council will be
in writing and supported by written findings of fact.
(Ord. 460, passed 8-28-2000)
§ 92.999 PENALTY.

§ 93.01 DECLARATION OF POLICY.
   Discrimination with regard to housing on the basis of race, color, sex,
creed, religion, marital status, national origin, status with regard to public
assistance, disability or age adversely affects the health, welfare, peace and
safety of a community. Persons subject to discrimination suffer depressed
living conditions and create conditions which endanger the public peace and
order. The public policy of the city is declared to be to foster equal
opportunity for all persons to obtain decent, safe and sanitary housing without
regard to race, color, sex, creed, religion, marital status, national origin,
status with regard to public assistance, disability or age and strictly in
accord with their individual merits as human beings. It is also the policy of
the city to protect all persons from unfounded charges of discrimination.
(Ord. 350, passed 5-29-1979)
§ 93.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   DISABILITY. A mental or physical condition which constitutes a handicap.
   DISCRIMINATE or DISCRIMINATION. Includes segregate or separate.
   MARITAL STATUS. The standing, state or condition of one as single or a
married person.
   STATUS WITH REGARD TO PUBLIC ASSISTANCE. The condition of being a recipient
of federal, state or local assistance including medical assistance or of being
a tenant receiving federal, state or legal subsidies including rental
assistance or rent supplements.
(Ord. 350, passed 5-29-1979)
§ 93.03 PROHIBITIVE ACTS IN REGARD TO HOUSING.
   It shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice to do any act or omission
designated as an unlawful discriminatory practice by M.S. § 363A.09, as it may
be amended from time to time.
(Ord. 350, passed 5-29-1979) Penalty, see §
93.99
§ 93.04 EXEMPTIONS.
   The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to:
   (A)   Rooms in a temporary or permanent residence home run by a non-profit
organization if the discrimination is by sex;
   (B)   The rental by an owner or occupier of a one-family accommodation in
which he or she resides or a room or rooms in the accommodation to another
person or persons if the discrimination is by sex, marital status, status with
regard to public assistance or disability. Nothing in this chapter shall be
construed to require any person or group of persons selling, renting or leasing
property to modify the property in any way, to exercise a higher degree of care
for a person having a disability than for a person that does not have a
disability, nor shall this chapter be construed to relieve any person or
persons of any obligations generally imposed on all persons regardless of any
disability in a written lease, rental agreement or contract of purchase or sale
or to forbid distinctions based upon the inability to fulfill the terms and
conditions including financial obligations of the lease, agreement or contract;
and
   (C)   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prohibit any program,
service, facility or privilege afforded to a person with a disability which is
intended to habilitate, rehabilitate or accommodate that person. It is a
defense to a complaint or an action brought under this chapter that the person
bringing the complaint or action suffers from a disability which in the
circumstances poses a serious threat to the health or safety of the disabled
person or others. The burden of proving this defense is on the respondent.
(Ord. 350, passed 5-29-1979)
§ 93.05 AIDING, ABETTING AND OBSTRUCTION.

   (A)   Intentionally to aid, abet, incite, compel or coerce a person to
engage in any of the practices forbidden by this chapter;
   (B)   Intentionally to attempt to aid, abet, incite, compel or coerce a
person to engage in any of the practices forbidden by this chapter; and
   (C)   To intentionally obstruct or prevent any person from complying with
the provisions of this chapter or any order issued thereunder or to resist,
prevent, impede or interfere with the Director of the Housing and Redevelopment
Authority or his or her agents or employees in the performance of their duties
under this chapter.
(Ord. 350, passed 5-29-1979)
§ 93.06 GRIEVANCES.
   (A)   Charge filing.  Any person aggrieved by a violation of this chapter
may file a verified charge with the Director of the Housing and Redevelopment
Authority, hereinafter referred to as Director, stating the name and address of
the person alleged to have committed an unfair discriminatory practice setting
out the details of the practice complained of and any other information
required by the Director. The Director, within five days of the filing, shall
serve a copy of the charge upon the respondent personally or by registered or
certified mail return receipt requested.
   (B)   Charge; issuance by Director. Whenever the Director has reason to
believe that a person is engaging in any unfair discriminatory practice, the
Director may issue a charge stating the specific section of this chapter that
is alleged to be violated.
   (C)   Time for filing charge. No action may be brought for civil enforcement
or criminal prosecution under this chapter unless the charge alleging
discriminatory practice was filed with the Director within 180 days from the
occurrence of the alleged discriminatory practice.
   (D)   Inquiry into charge. When a charge has been filed, the Director shall
promptly inquire into the truth of the allegations of the charge. The Director
shall make an immediate inquiry when necessary to prevent a charging party from
suffering irreparable loss in the absence of immediate action. On each charge,
the Director shall make a determination as to whether or not there is probable
cause to credit the allegation of unfair discriminatory practice.
      (1)   If the Director shall determine after investigation that no
probable cause exists to credit the allegations of the unfair discriminatory
practice, the Director shall, within ten days of the determination,
serve upon the charging party and respondent written notice of the
determination. Within ten days after receipt of this notice, the charging party
may request in writing that the Director reconsider his or her determination.
The request shall contain a brief statement of the reasons for and any new
evidence in support of the request for reconsideration. At the time of
submission of the request to the Director, the charging party shall deliver or
mail to the respondent a copy of the request for reconsideration. The Director
shall either reaffirm or reverse his or her determination of no probable cause
within 20 days after receipt of the request for reconsideration and he or she
shall within ten days thereafter notify in writing the charging party and the
respondent of his or her decision to reaffirm or reverse.
      (2)   If the Director shall determine after investigation that probable
cause exists to credit the allegations of unfair discriminatory practice, the
Director shall issue a complaint and serve on the respondent by registered or
certified mail a written notice of hearing together with a copy of the
complaint requiring the respondent to answer the allegations of the complaint
at a hearing before the authority at a time and place specified in the notice
not less than ten days after service of the complaint. A copy of the notice
shall be furnished to the charging party, the City Attorney and the chairperson
of the Housing and Redevelopment Authority.
      (3)   At any time after the Director has determined that there is
probable cause to believe that the respondent has engaged in an unfair
discriminatory practice, the Director may file a petition in the County
District Court seeking appropriate temporary relief against the respondent
pending final determination of proceedings under this chapter including an
order or decree restraining him or her from doing or procuring any act tending
to render ineffectual any order the Director may enter with respect to the
complaint. The court shall have power to grant the temporary relief or
restraining order as it deems just and proper but no relief or order extending
beyond ten days shall be granted except by consent of the respondent or after
hearing upon notice to the respondent and a finding by the court that there is
reasonable cause to believe that the respondent has engaged in a discriminatory
practice. The Minnesota Rules of Civil Procedure shall apply to the application
and the District Court shall have the authority to grant or deny the relief
sought on the conditions as it deems just and equitable.
      (4)   If any lessor, after he or she has engaged in a discriminatory
practice defined in this chapter, shall lease or rent the dwelling unit to a
person who has no knowledge of the practice or of the existence of any charge
with respect thereto, the lessor shall be liable for actual damages sustained
by the person by reason of any final order requiring the person to be evicted
from the dwelling unit.
(Ord. 350, passed 5-29-1979)
§ 93.07 HEARINGS.
   (A)   Conduct of hearing. A complaint issued by the Director shall be heard
as a contested case by a majority of members of the Housing and Redevelopment
Authority, hereinafter referred to as the Authority. The hearing shall be
conducted at a place designated by the Director within the city.
   (B)   Determination of discriminatory practice. The Authority shall make
findings of fact, conclusions of law and if the Authority finds that the
respondent has engaged in an unfair and discriminatory practice, the Authority
shall issue an order directing the respondent to cease and desist from the
unfair discriminatory practice found to exist and to take affirmative action as
in the judgment of the Authority will effectuate the purposes of this chapter.
The order shall be a final decision of the Authority. In all cases, the
Authority may order the respondent to pay an aggrieved party for mental anguish
or suffering and in all cases may also order the respondent to pay an aggrieved
party who has suffered the discrimination punitive damages in an amount to be
determined by Authority. In addition to the aforesaid remedies, the Authority
may order the sale, lease or rental of the housing accommodation or other real
property to an aggrieved party who has suffered discrimination or the sale,
lease or rental of a like accommodation or other real property owned by or
under the control of the person against whom the complaint was filed according
to terms as listed with the real estate broker or if no listing has been made
as otherwise advertised or offered by the vendor or lessor or any other relief
the Authority deems just and equitable. The Authority shall cause the findings
of fact, conclusions of law and order to be served on the respondent personally
and the charging party by registered or certified mail.
   (C)   Dismissal of hearing. If the Authority makes findings of fact,
conclusions of law and order in favor of the respondent, the order shall be the
final decision of the Department.
   (D)   Subpoenas. After the issuance of a complaint pursuant to this chapter,
the charging party or respondent may request that the Authority issue subpoenas
requiring the presence of witnesses or the production for examination of books
or papers not privileged and relevant to any matter in question at the hearing.

Authority reached after a hearing held pursuant to this chapter may seek
judicial review in the same manner and under the same circumstances and
limitations as to time for review as the review of state agency decisions set
forth in M.S. §§ 14.63 through 14.69, as it may be amended from time to time.
   (B)   The District Court review proceedings shall conform to those
proceedings for the review of state agency decisions set forth in M.S. §
15.0424, as it may be amended from time to time, and the scope of the judicial
review shall be the same as the scope for review of state agency proceedings
set forth in M.S. § 15.0425, as it may be amended from time to time.
(Ord. 350, passed 5-29-1979)
§ 93.99 PENALTY.

misdemeanor.

§ 97.08 DUTIES OF CITY OFFICERS.
   The designated city officials for applying and enforcing the provisions of
this chapter relating to public nuisances within this jurisdiction are law
enforcement officers and the appropriate zoning administrator. The designated
city official shall have the power to inspect private premises and take all
reasonable precautions to prevent the commission and maintenance of public
nuisances. Except in emergency situations of imminent danger to human life and
safety, no city official will enter private property for the purpose of
inspecting or preventing public nuisances without the permission of the owner,
resident or other person in control of the property, unless the officer or
person designated has obtained a warrant or order from a court of competent
jurisdiction authorizing entry.
(Ord. 517, passed 10-26-2009)
§ 97.09 ABATEMENT PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Procedure. Whenever a designated official determines that a public
nuisance is being maintained or exists on the premises in the city, the
official shall notify in writing the owner of record or occupant of the
premises of the fact and order that the nuisance be terminated or abated. The
notice of violation shall specify the steps to be taken to abate the nuisance
and the time within which the nuisance is to be abated, which time shall in no
event exceed 30 days. Service of notice shall be proved by filing an affidavit
of service in the office of the city administrator setting forth the manner and
time thereof.
   (B)   Appeal. The occupant or owner of record who feels aggrieved by an
order issued pursuant to this section may request a hearing before the City
Council. Such request shall be filed in writing with the city within seven days
after the date of service of the notice by the city. The city shall notify the
individual requesting a hearing of the date, time and place of the hearing
before the Council. The hearing shall be held no more than 30 days after the
filing of the request. The City Council shall make findings to determine if a
nuisance condition exists, as set forth in the notice of violation. If the
Council determines a nuisance condition exists that is not set forth in the
notice of violation it may cause a new notice of violation to be issued. If the
Council determines a nuisance condition exists that is not set forth in the
notice of violation it may cause a new notice of violation to be issued. If the
Council determines a nuisance condition exists, the Council shall specify the
steps to be taken to correct the condition and set a compliance date no more
than 20 days from the date of the hearing.
   (C)   Failure to hold the hearing within the timelines set forth herein
terminates the process identified in division (A) of this section but does not
preclude the officer of the city from issuing any subsequent notices or
criminal charges.
   (D)   Order of abatement. Upon lack of compliance by the date in the notice
in division (A) of this section or in the Council order in division (B) of this
section, the city may issue an order of abatement as identified in § 97.10.
(Ord. 517, passed 10-26-2009; Am. Ord. 553, passed d3-14-2016) Penalty, see §
97.99
§ 97.10 ABATEMENT.
   (A)   Abatement by Council.  When any notice given pursuant to §
97.09 is not complied with, such noncompliance shall be reported forthwith to
the council for such action as may be necessary and deemed advisable by the
council to abate and enjoin the further continuation of such nuisance. Unless
the nuisance shall constitute a present serious threat to the health or safety
of the habitants of the city, prior to authorizing expenditures to abate and
enjoin the further continuation of such nuisance, the City Administrator shall
notify in writing the occupant or owner of record whom, shall have seven days
from the mailing of such notice to file a written objection to the contemplated
action with the City Administrator. The written objections shall be deemed
complete upon the delivery of a signed written objection at City Hall during
business hours. A hearing on such objection shall be set by the City
Administrator for the next available meeting of the City Council and the
occupant or owner of record objecting shall be notified of the time, date and
place of such hearing. Notice shall be considered served upon mailing to the
property owner or posting such notice on the premises, upon holding the
hearing, the Council may order abatement of the nuisance by obtaining an
administrative search and seizure warrant and abate the nuisance. Such search
and seizure shall authorize the city to enter the premise to correct the
nuisance and to dispose of any and all conditions constituting a nuisance in a
commercially reasonable manner, including the destruction or sale of the
property. Nothing in this section prevents law enforcement or the designated
city official to request the City Attorney's office bring criminal charges for
violation of this chapter or other federal or state law regulating the
activity.
   (B)   Emergency procedure; summary enforcement. In cases of emergency, where
delay in abatement required to complete the procedure and notice requirements
as set forth in divisions (A) and (B) of this section will permit a continuing
nuisance to unreasonably endanger public health, safety or welfare, the City
Council may order summary enforcement and abate the nuisance. To proceed with
summary enforcement, the designated official shall determine that a public
nuisance exists or is being maintained on premises in the city and that delay
in abatement will unreasonably endanger public health, safety or welfare. The
designated official shall notify in writing the occupant or owner of the
premises of the nature of the nuisance, whether public health, safety or
welfare will be unreasonably endangered by delay in abatement required to
complete the procedure set forth in division (A) of this section and may order
that the nuisance be immediately terminated or abated. If the nuisance is not
immediately terminated or abated, the City Council may order summary
enforcement and abate the nuisance.
   (C)   Immediate abatement. Nothing in this section shall prevent the city,
without notice or other process, from immediately abating any condition that
poses an imminent and serious hazard to human life or safety.
   (D)   Unlawful parties or gatherings. When a designated official determines
that a gathering is creating a noise disturbance as prohibited under §
97.04, the officer may order all persons present, other than the owner or
tenant of the premises where the disturbance is occurring, to disburse
immediately. No person shall refuse to leave after being ordered to do so by
law enforcement. Every owner or tenant of the premises who has knowledge of the
disturbance shall make every reasonable effort to see that the disturbance is
stopped.
   (E)   Judicial remedy. Nothing in this section shall prevent the city from
seeking a judicial remedy rather than proceeding with administrative abatement
procedures.
(Ord. 553, passed 3-14-2016) Penalty, see §
97.99
§ 97.11 RECOVERY OF COST.
   (A)   Personal liability. The owner of the premises on which a nuisance has
been abated by the city, or a person who has caused a public nuisance on
property not owned by that person, shall be personally liable for the cost to
the city of the abatement, including administrative costs. As soon as the work
has been completed and the cost determined, the City Clerk or other city
official shall prepare a bill for the cost and mail it to the owner. Thereupon
the amount shall be immediately due and payable at the office of the City
Clerk.
   (B)   Assessment. After notice and hearing as provided in M.S. § 429.061, as
it may be amended from time to time, if the nuisance is a public health or
safety hazard on private property, the City Clerk shall, on or before September
1 next following abatement of the nuisance, list the total unpaid charges along
with all other charges as well as other charges for current services to be
assessed under M.S. § 429.101, as it may be amended from time to time, against
each separate lot or parcel to which the charges are attributable. The City
Council may then spread the charges against the property under that statute and
any other pertinent statutes for certification to the County Auditor and
collection along with current taxes the following year or in annual
installments, not exceeding ten, as the City Council may determine in each
case.

§ 97.12 DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY.
   The city maintains the right to dispose of all property that it removes from
public and private property through abatement procedures as outlined in this
chapter. Disposal of property deemed to have a value shall occur 30 days or
more after the property is secured, unless the property owner obtains a court
order to the contrary and/or pays all costs associated with the removal and
storage of said property within 30 days. The city may immediately dispose of
any property deemed to have no value in the sole opinion of the designated city
official.
(Ord. 553, passed 3-14-2016)
§ 97.99 PENALTY.

a misdemeanor and shall be punished by a fine not to exceed $1,000 or
imprisonment for not more than 90 days, or both, plus the costs of prosecution
in either case.

limit set forth by the notice, the Tree Inspector may proceed to abate the
nuisance. The cost of the abatement, plus a $300 administrative fee, shall be
assessed against the owner of the property involved, or against the property
itself in the same manner as a special assessment in accordance with M.S. §§
429.011 et seq., as they may be amended from time to time.
   (B)   High risk elm trees. High risk elm trees shall be those trees that are
dead, barren or have extensive wilt (30% or more of the tree is wilted). The
trees shall be identified and marked prior to June 25. These high risk trees
shall be removed within 20 days of notification of the property owner.
   (C)   Low risk elm trees. Low risk elm trees shall be those trees that show
early stages of infection in June or subsequently during the growing season
with those symptoms not progressing beyond the 30% wilting point. Every
reasonable effort shall be made to have low risk trees removed within 20 days
of notification of the property owner, but in no case shall it be later than
April 1 of the year following the appearance of symptoms.
   (D)   Oak trees.
      (1)   All oak trees within the city diagnosed as having oak wilt shall be
isolated from neighboring healthy oak trees of the same species by chemical or
mechanical disruption of common root systems to prevent root graft transmission
of the oak wilt fungus.
      (2)   To control overland spread of oak wilt, the pruning of oaks shall
be avoided during the most susceptible period of infection, from April 15 until
July 1. If wounding is unavoidable during this period, as in the aftermath of a
storm or when the tree interferes with utility lines, a tree wound dressing
shall be applied immediately.
         (a)   Prevention.
            1.   To prevent the oak wilt fungus from producing spores and to
prevent overland spread of this fungus, any diseased material of the red oak
group wilting in July and August of one year shall be declared hazardous the
following spring, from April 15 until July 1.
            2.   Any hazardous oak wood to be used as fuel wood or to be
salvaged for other purposes must be debarked or else completely covered by
heavy plastic (four mil or greater) from April 15 until July 1 of the year
following the appearance of symptoms. After this time, there is no danger of
spore production and the wood does not need to be covered.
            3.   Any branch greater than two inches in diameter of the red oak
group determined to be hazardous and not salvaged shall be disposed of by
burning, chipping or removal to an authorized dump site prior to April 15 of
the year following the appearance of symptoms. Dead standing red oaks that have
advanced beyond the potential for spore production need not be removed except
where they constitute a hazard to life and/or property. The Tree Inspector will
advise accordingly.
            4.   Stumps of trees of the red oak group removed due to oak wilt
shall be completely covered, removed or debarked to the ground line to
eliminate all possibilities of spore formation and overland disease spread.
         (b)   White oaks. Trees of the white oak group (such as white oak, bur
oak, bicolor oak) diagnosed as having oak wilt shall be isolated by root graft
disruption as previously stated. Diseased material originating from the trees
will rarely ever support spore formation and salvaged material therefore will
not require special treatment to prevent overland spread. Standing trees of
this group showing early symptoms of oak wilt may be saved by removing affected
branches. The Tree Inspector will advise accordingly.
(Ord. 419, passed 3-9-1992)
§ 98.32 ROOT GRAFT DISRUPTION (BARRIERS AT PROPERTY BOUNDARIES).
   Because oak wilt is a community problem and because oak wilt control may
benefit an entire neighborhood, the Tree Inspector shall recommend and
encourage neighborhood participation and cooperation, including cost sharing,
in root graft disruption and other control efforts, especially where oak wilt
is in danger of spreading across property boundaries.
(Ord. 419, passed 3-9-1992)
§ 98.99 PENALTY.
   Any person, firm or corporation who violates this chapter shall be deemed
guilty of a misdemeanor.

(Ord. 549, passed 10-12-2015)
§ 115.21 OFFENDER TRANSITIONAL HOUSING.
   (A)   Purpose. In order to reduce the likelihood of recidivism, provide for
the public safety, provide protection and security for crime victims, maintain
neighborhood stability, re-integrate former offenders into the mainstream, law-
abiding community, prevent homelessness among returning offenders, and
facilitate support and supervision for offenders, the city finds it desirable
to provide for locations within the city where offender transitional housing
can be established subject to the limitations of this code. In addition, the
offender transitional housing shall comply with all other provisions of the
city code regarding rental licensing requirements. If there is a conflict
between this section and another provision of the Le Sueur City Code, the more
restrictive provisions shall prevail.
   (B)   Separation and concentration in zoning districts. Offender
transitional housing may be established in a zoning district that allows
residential occupancy and only on a parcel that is at least as far as the
distances indicated in the table below from another existing, or approved but
not yet constructed, offender transitional housing use in any zoning district:
 
Zoning Designation Separation Required                 Separation Required
R-1 and special districts and PUD's with underlying R- > = 1,000 feet
1 zoning
R-2 and special districts and PUD's with underlying R- > = 1,000 feet
2 zoning
All other Residential Districts                        > = 1,000 feet
All other Zoning Districts                             > = 800 feet
 
   (C)   Concentration in residential zones. In residentially zoned areas (R-
1 through R-5 and special districts and planned unit developments with
underlying residential zoning), a proposed offender transitional housing use
may not cause the number of offender transitional housing uses within a radius
of 1.5 times the required separation distance of the proposed offender
transitional housing use to exceed 0.5% of the total number of dwellings for
developed neighborhoods within that radius, of 0.5% of the planned dwellings or
permissible dwellings within that radius for partly undeveloped neighborhoods.
   (D)   Offender transitional housing in non-residential zones. In non-
residential zones where dwelling and/or lodging units are permitted, a proposed
offender transitional housing use that is within 1,000 feet of a residential
zone may not cause the sum of the population capacity of offender transitional
housing to exceed 10% of the sum of the dwelling units and lodging units in
parcels within a radius of 1,000 feet of a proposed offender transitional
housing use, except that where the sum of dwelling and lodging units within
1,000 feet is fewer than 100, the population capacity of offender transitional
housing or lodging units shall not exceed ten persons.
   (E)   Offender transitional housing for sex offenders. Any offender
transitional housing providing or intending to provide housing to a designated
sex offender as defined by state law or administrative rule must meet the
separation requirements provided in this division. Except where otherwise
specified, the separation distances shall be measured from the property lines
of both the offender housing and the facility and/or property from which it
shall be separated. Separation by distance of not less than 2,000 feet is
required from the following facilities:
      (1)   Public parks in existence at the date of application for a license
under this division;
      (2)   A licensed family day care or child care facility in existence at
the date of application for a license under this division;
      (3)   Public or private nursery schools, elementary schools, secondary
schools, and post-secondary schools, in existence at the date of application
for a license under this division.
      (4)   A state licensed residential facility as referenced in M.S. §
462.357, §
115.07 of this code, and in existence at the date of application for a license
under this division; and
   (F)   The residents of the offender transitional housing shall be limited to
only those offenders that were convicted of an offense while residents of Le
Sueur County and the residents shall only reside in the premises for a period
not to exceed 12 months.
   (G)   Offender transitional housing license. An offender transitional
housing use must obtain a license prior to any occupancy of such use. The
license shall be subject to the occupancy restrictions of the underlying zoning
district requirements. In non-residential districts a license shall only be
issued if the underlying zoning district permits such use.
   (H)   The license shall be subject to suspension or revocation if conditions
of approval are violated or if a violation of Federal, state or local law
occurs by a tenant or license holder that impacts the safety and welfare of the
tenants or public. If an offender transitional housing use is discontinued for
a period of 12 consecutive months or if a license is revoked, there shall be no
presumed right to reinstatement and any use at the location shall be considered
in the same manner as a new use.
   (I)   Prior to the establishment of offender transitional housing, the state
agency responsible for the supervision of the offender shall send notice to all
property owners within 2,000 feet of the property to be used for offender
transitional housing. The notice shall state the intent of the state agency to
establish offender transitional housing and the place and time of a public
meeting, to be held within the city limits of the city, at which meeting the
state agency will provide details to the public regarding the proposed offender
transitional housing.
   (J)   The rental license for a dwelling used for offender transitional
housing shall contain the contact information for the state agency and a local
agent that is employed by the state agency. At the public meeting, the name and
contact information of the local contact/agent shall be supplied to the
attendees.
   (K)   Existing offender transitional housing. Offender transitional housing
existing on the date of the enactment of this ordinance shall immediately
obtain a license under this division and shall comply with the other provisions
of this section within 12 months of chapter adoption. If the property currently
used for offender transitional housing does not conform to the provisions of
this section, it shall cease operation within 12 months of the adoption of this
section or adjust the operation of the offender transitional housing to comply
with this section.

legal remedies.

be assessed against the property, it shall be levied and collected as a special

submission of the assessment to the county, the City Council shall, on the date
the assessment is adopted, add an administrative fee of up to 15% (depending on
the amount of administrative and related expense otherwise included in the
amount of the special assessment itself) of the amount then due. The assessment
shall be payable in a single installment.
   (D)   Certification to County Auditor per Minn. Stat. § 366.012. If the City
Council orders the charge shall be certified to the County Auditor per M.S. §
366.012, the property owner shall be notified in writing of such proposed
certification prior to September 15, and such charge shall be certified to the
County Auditor prior to October 15 in any given year. Penalties and interest
shall accrue on such charge in the same manner as provided for in the
collection of property taxes.
   (E)   Repayment of funds. All money recovered by payment of the charge or
assessment or from the sale of the property at foreclosure sale shall be paid
to the repair and demolition fund or other fund from which the costs were
drawn.

whether real or personal, movable or immovable, and without limitation,
including documents of value, electricity, gas, water, domestic animals, dogs,
pets, fowl and further including things growing on, affixed to or found in

§ 131.23 GOVERNMENTAL FUNCTIONS NOT TO BE WILLFULLY HAMPERED.
   (A)   The City Council takes cognizance of reported activities of organized
groups of individuals in other cities in the United States, such as so-called
“sit-ins” held in the offices and hallways of buildings in which governmental
business is transacted; disruption of vehicular and pedestrian traffic designed
to prevent or delay governmental personnel from reaching their places of duty;
failing or refusing to obey the lawful orders of police officers and others in
authority and the like, and as is generally known to all who read the
newspapers, all for the avowed purpose of preventing public officers and
employees from performing their duties and thereby preventing altogether, or
hindering and delaying, the transaction of governmental business and nullifying
important functions of government.
   (B)   The City Council takes further cognizance of the fact that this city
is a municipal corporation existing under the laws of the state, with a
representative form of government in harmony with the Constitutions of the
United States and the State of Minnesota, and that the primary purpose of the
city government is to serve the people of the city; and the City Council finds
that activities of groups of individuals or of individuals which are intended
and designed to prevent, delay, hinder or otherwise impair the lawful
transaction of city business or functions of the city government constitute a
clear and present danger to the good order and government of the city for its
established purposes; for though but one organized effort may not be wholly
effective, nevertheless, if it is not promptly and firmly dealt with, other
efforts may be expected to follow, so that any one organized effort does in
fact constitute a clear and present danger to the ability of the city
government to serve the people of the city, and to the very survival of the
city as a lawful municipal corporation.
   (C)   Therefore, and in view of the foregoing findings, it shall be unlawful
for any person, acting alone or in concert with one or more other persons, to
commit any act or omission, otherwise lawful, with intent to prevent, delay,
confuse, disrupt, pervert or render ineffective the orderly and timely
transaction of any city business or any governmental or proprietary function of
the city.

It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare by minimizing these losses and disruptions.
   (B)   This chapter is adopted in the public interest to promote sound land
use practices, and floodplains are a land resource to be developed in a manner
which will result in minimum loss of life and threat to health, and reduction
of private and public economic loss caused by flooding.
   (C)   This chapter is adopted to maintain eligibility in the National Flood
Insurance Program.

   CONDITIONAL USE. A land use or development that would not be appropriate
generally, but may be allowed with appropriate restrictions upon a finding that
certain conditions as detailed in the zoning ordinance exist, the use or
development conforms to the comprehensive land use plan of the community, and
the use is compatible with the existing neighborhood.
   CRITICAL FACILITIES. Buildings and structures that contain essential
facilities and services necessary for emergency response and recovery, or that
pose a substantial risk to the public in the event of failure, disruption of
function, or damage by flooding. Specifically, this includes facilities
identified as Flood Design Class 4 in ASCE 24-14, Flood Resistant Design and
Construction, as amended. Examples include health care facilities, facilities
required for emergency response, power generating stations, communications
towers, or electrical substations.

of the floodway.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map on which the Federal
Insurance Administrator has delineated both the special flood hazard areas and
the risk premium zones applicable to the community. A FIRM that has been made
available digitally is called a DIGITAL FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (DFIRM).
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The study referenced in §
151.021, which is an examination, evaluation and determination of flood
hazards, and if appropriate, corresponding surface elevations, or an
examination, evaluation, and determination of mudslide (i.e., mudflow) and/or
flood-related erosion hazards.
   FLOODPLAIN. The beds, channel and the areas adjoining a wetland, lake or
watercourse, or other source which have been or hereafter may be inundated by
the base flood.
   FLOODPROOFING. A combination of structural and non-structural additions,
changes, or adjustments to properties and structures subject to flooding,
primarily for the reduction or elimination of flood damages.
   FLOODWAY. The bed of a wetland or lake and the channel of a watercourse and
those portions of the adjoining floodplain which must be reserved to carry or
store the base flood discharge without cumulatively increasing the water
surface elevation more than one-half foot.

      (3)   Basic vehicle frontal area less than 45 square feet.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking
of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a basement area,
is not considered a building’s LOWEST FLOOR; provided, that such enclosure is
not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-
elevation design requirements of 44 CFR §
60.3.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include the term “recreational vehicle.”
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. Structures for which the start of construction commenced
on or after the effective date of an adopted floodplain management regulation,
and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
   PRINCIPAL STRUCTURE. The main building or other structure on a lot that is
utilized for the property’s principal use.
   REACH. A hydraulic engineering term to describe a longitudinal segment of a
stream or river influenced by a natural or man-made obstruction. In an urban

would most typically constitute a REACH.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle that is built on a single chassis, is 400
square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, is
designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and
is designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary
living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. Those
vehicles not meeting this definition shall be considered a structure for the
purposes of this chapter. For the purposes of this chapter, the term
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE is synonymous with the term “travel trailer/travel
vehicle.”
   REGULATORY FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION (RFPE). An elevation that is one foot
above the elevation of the base flood plus any increases in the water surface
elevation caused by encroachments on the floodplain that result from
designation of a floodway. These increases in water surface elevations are
typically identified in the Floodway Data Tables, found in the Flood Insurance
Study.
   REPETITIVE LOSS. Flood related damages sustained by a structure on two
separate occasions during a ten year period for which the cost of repairs at
the time of each such flood event on the average equals or exceeds 25% of the
market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   STAGE INCREASE. Any increase in the water surface elevation during the 1%
annual chance flood caused by encroachments on the floodplain.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Includes substantial improvement, and means the date
the permit was issued, provided the ACTUAL START OF CONSTRUCTION, repair,
reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was
within 180 days of the permit date. The ACTUAL START means either the first
placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the
pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of
columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land
preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the
installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a
basement, footings, piers, foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor
does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such
as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main
structure. For a substantial improvement, the ACTUAL START OF CONSTRUCTION
means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural
part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the building.
   STRUCTURE. A roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that
is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. Recreational
vehicles not considered travel ready, as detailed in §
151.111(B), shall also be considered a STRUCTURE for the purposes of this
chapter.
   SUBDIVISION. Land that has been divided for the purpose of sale, rent, or
lease, including planned unit developments.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure where the
cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or
exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred substantial
damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
historic structure. For the purpose of this chapter, HISTORIC STRUCTURE is
defined in 44 CFR § 59.1.
   VARIANCE. The same as that defined in 44 CFR § 59.1 and M.S. § 462.357,
subd. 6(2).
   WATERCOURSE. A channel in which a flow of water occurs either continuously
or intermittently in a definitive direction. The term applies to either natural
or artificially constructed channels.

REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL FLOODPLAIN DISTRICTS
§ 151.035 PERMIT REQUIRED.
   A permit must be obtained from the Zoning Administrator to verify compliance
with all applicable standards outlined in this chapter prior to the following
uses or activities:
   (A)   The erection, addition, modification, rehabilitation, repair, or
alteration of any building, structure, or portion thereof. Normal maintenance
requires a permit to determine if such work, either separately or in
conjunction with other planned work, constitutes a substantial improvement, as
specified in §
151.130(C).
   (B)   The construction of a fence, pool, deck, or placement of anything that
may cause a potential obstruction. Farm fences, as defined in §
151.013, are not considered to be an obstruction, and as such, do not require a
permit.
   (C)   The change or expansion of a nonconforming use.
   (D)   The repair of a structure that has been damaged by flood, fire,
tornado, or any other source.
   (E)   The placement of fill, excavation, utilities, on-site sewage treatment
systems, or other service facilities.
   (F)   The storage of materials or equipment, in conformance with §
151.037(B).
   (G)   Relocation or alteration of a watercourse (including stabilization
projects or the construction of new or replacement dams, culverts and bridges).
A local permit is not required if a public waters work permit has been obtained
from the Department of Natural Resources, unless a significant area above the
ordinary high water level is also to be disturbed.
   (H)   Any other type of development, as defined in §
151.013.
(Ord. 406, passed 11-27-1989; Ord. 607, passed 7-8-2024)
§ 151.036 NO PERMIT REQUIRED.
   Certain uses or activities may be exempt from obtaining a permit, such as
planting a garden, farming, or other obviously insignificant activities such as
putting up a mailbox or flagpole. The continuation of existing uses, when the
associated activities do not encroach further on the regulatory floodplain or
trigger associated standards in this chapter, do not require a permit.
(Ord. 607, passed 7-8-2024)
§ 151.037 MINIMUM DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   (A)   All development must:
      (1)   Be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement resulting from hydrodynamic and
hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy;
      (2)   Be constructed with materials and equipment resistant to flood
damage;
      (3)   Be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
      (4)   Be constructed with heating, ventilation, duct work, and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities elevated at least up to the
Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation (RFPE). Water, sewage, electrical, and
other utility lines below the RFPE shall be constructed so as to prevent water
from entering or accumulating within them during conditions of flooding;
      (5)   Be reasonably safe from flooding and consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage;
      (6)   Be assured to provide adequate drainage to reduce exposure to flood
hazards;
      (7)   Not be detrimental to uses in adjoining areas; and
      (8)   Not adversely affect the efficiency or restrict the flood carrying
capacity of the channel and adjoining floodplain of any tributary watercourse
or drainage system.
      (9)   Ensure that any fill or other materials are protected from erosion,
discharge, and sediment entering surface waters by the use of vegetative cover
or other methods as soon as possible.
   (B)   Materials that, in time of flooding, are buoyant, flammable,
explosive, or could be injurious to human, animal, or plant life shall be
stored at or above the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation (RFPE),
floodproofed, or protected by other measures as approved by the Zoning
Administrator. Storage of materials likely to cause pollution of the waters,
such as sewage; sand; rock; wrecked and discarded equipment; dredged spoil;
municipal, agricultural or industrial waste; and other wastes as further
defined in M.S. §
115.01, are prohibited unless adequate safeguards approved by the Minnesota
Pollution Control Agency are provided. For projects not requiring approvals by
the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, adequate safeguards must be approved by
the Zoning Administrator prior to issuance of a permit.
   (C)   Critical facilities shall be located so that the lowest floor is not
less than two feet above the Base Flood Elevation (BFE), or the 0.2% annual
chance flood elevation, whichever is higher.

FLOODWAY DISTRICT
§ 151.045 PERMITTED USES IN FLOODWAY.
   Development allowed in the Floodway District is limited to that which has
low flood damage potential and will not obstruct flood flows, increase
velocities, or increase the water surface elevations of the 1% annual chance
flood. The following uses and activities may be allowed with a permit, subject
to the standards in §
151.046:
   (A)   Agricultural uses, recreational uses, parking lots, loading areas,
airport landing strips, water control structures, navigational facilities, as
well as public open space uses.
   (B)   Roads, driveways, railroads, trails, bridges, and culverts.
   (C)   Public utility facilities and water-oriented industries which must be
in or adjacent to watercourses.
   (D)   Grading, filling, land alterations, and shoreline stabilization
projects.
   (E)   No structures, as defined in §
151.013, are allowed in the Floodway District, except structures accessory to
the uses detailed in division (A) above and §
151.047(A), which require a CUP under §
151.047(B).

top of the dike does not exceed the 10% annual chance flood event.
(Ord. 406, passed 11-217-1989; Ord. 607, passed 7-8-2024)
§ 151.046 STANDARDS FOR PERMITTED USES IN FLOODWAY.
   In addition to the applicable standards detailed in §§
151.035 through
151.037:
   (A)   The applicant must demonstrate that the development will not result in
any of the following during the 1% annual chance flood: cause a stage increase
of 0.00 feet or greater, obstruct flood flows, or increase velocities. This
shall be demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed by a
professional engineer, or using other standard engineering practices (e.g.
projects that restore the site to the previous cross-sectional area). This is
commonly documented through a no-rise certification.
   (B)   Any development that would result in a stage increases greater than
0.00 feet may only be allowed with a permit if the applicant has applied for
and received approval for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) in
accordance with 44 CFR § 65.12. Map revisions must follow the procedures in §§
151.120,
151.150 and
151.151.
   (C)   Any development resulting in decreases to the water surface elevation
of the base flood identified in the Flood Insurance Study requires a Letter of
Map Revision (LOMR) following the procedures in §§
151.120(D),
151.150 and
151.151.
   (D)   Any development in the beds of public waters that will change the
course, current or cross section is required to obtain a public waters work
permit in accordance with M.S. § 103G.245 or a utility crossing license in
accordance with M.S. § 84.415, from the Department of Natural Resources, or
demonstrate that no permit is required, before applying for a local permit.
   (E)   Any facility used by employees or the general public must be designed
with a flood warning system acceptable to the Zoning Administrator that
provides adequate time for evacuation, or be designed to ensure that within the
area inundated during the base flood event, the depth (in feet) multiplied by
the velocity (in feet per second) is less than four.
   (F)   Fill and other land alteration activities must offer minimal
obstruction to the flow of flood waters, and be protected from erosion and
sediment entering surface waters by the use of vegetative cover, riprap or
other methods as soon as possible.

GENERAL FLOODPLAIN DISTRICT
§ 151.075 PERMITTED USES IN GENERAL FLOODPLAIN DISTRICT.
   (A)   Until the floodway is delineated, allowable uses will be restricted to
those listed in the Floodway District, §§
151.045 through
151.048.
   (B)   All other uses are subject to a floodway/flood fringe determination as
provided in §
151.078, in addition to the standards provided in §§
151.076 and
151.077. Permitted uses shall be determined as follows:
      (1)   If the development is determined to be in the Floodway District, §§
151.045 through
151.048 apply.
      (2)   If the development is determined to be in the Flood Fringe
District, §§
151.060 through
151.064 apply.
(Ord. 607, passed 7-8-2024)
§ 151.076 DETERMINING FLOOD ELEVATIONS.
   (A)   All development requires a determination of the Base Flood Elevation
(BFE). Exceptions to this requirement include projects that restore the site to
the previous cross-sectional area, such as shore stabilization or culvert
replacement projects. Base Flood Elevations (BFE) may be found using best
available data from any federal, state, or other source (including MNDNR’s Lake
& Flood Elevations Online (LFEO) Viewer).
   (B)   The Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation (RFPE) can be determined by
assuming a one-half foot stage increase to accommodate for future cumulative
impacts.
(Ord. 607, passed 7-8-2024)
§ 151.077 ENCROACHMENT ANALYSIS.
   (A)   Encroachments due to development may not allow stage increases more
than one-half foot at any point, unless through a map revision following the
procedures in §§
151.120(E),
151.150 and
151.151. This evaluation must include the cumulative effects of previous
encroachments, and must be documented with hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
performed by a professional engineer, or using other standard engineering
practices. A lesser water surface elevation increase than one-half foot is
required if, due to the water surface level increase, increased flood damages
would potentially result.
   (B)   Alterations or changes that result in stage decreases are allowed and
encouraged.
(Ord. 607, passed 7-8-2024)
§ 151.078 STANDARDS FOR THE ANALYSIS OF FLOODWAY BOUNDARIES.
   (A)   Requirements for detailed studies. Any development, as requested by
the Zoning Administrator, shall be subject to a detailed study to determine the
Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation (RFPE) and the limits of the Floodway
District. This determination must be consistent with the minimum standards for
hydrologic and hydraulic mapping standards and techniques, as detailed in
Minnesota Rules, part 6120.5600, Subp. 4 and FEMA Guidelines and Standards for
Flood Risk Analysis and Mapping, as revised. Additionally:
      (1)   A regulatory floodway necessary to carry the discharge of the 1%
annual chance flood must be selected without increasing the water surface
elevation more than one-half foot at any point. This determination should
include the cumulative effects of previous encroachments. A lesser water
surface elevation increase than one-half foot is required if, due to the water
surface level increase, increased flood damages would potentially result; and
      (2)   An equal degree of encroachment on both sides of the stream within
the reach must be assumed in computing floodway boundaries, unless topography,
existing development patterns, and comprehensive land use plans justify a
modified approach, as approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
   (B)   Other acceptable methods. For areas where a detailed study is not
available or required:
      (1)   Development prohibited in floodways (e.g., most buildings) requires
a floodway/flood fringe determination to verify the development is within the
flood fringe. This determination must be done by a professional engineer or
utilize other accepted engineering practices. The Department of Natural
Resources may also provide technical assistance and must approve any
alternative methods used to determine floodway boundaries.
(Ord. 607, passed 7-8-2024)
SUBDIVISION STANDARDS

under this chapter.
   (A)   All lots within floodplain districts must be suitable for a building
site outside of the Floodway District.
   (B)   Subdivision of lands within the floodplain districts may not be
approved if the cost of providing governmental services would impose an
unreasonable economic burden on the city.
   (C)   All subdivisions must have vehicular access both to the subdivision
and to the individual building sites no lower than two feet below the
Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation (RFPE), unless a flood waming/emergency
evacuation plan has been approved by the city.
   (D)   The Floodway and Flood Fringe District boundaries, the Regulatory
Flood Protection Elevation (RFPE) and the required elevation of all access
roads must be clearly identified on all required subdivision drawings and
platting documents.

PUBLIC AND PRIVATE UTILITIES; SERVICE FACILITIES;
ROADS; BRIDGES; RAILROADS
§ 151.100 PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES.
   Railroad tracks, roads, and bridges must be elevated to the Regulatory Flood
Protection Elevation (RFPE) where such facilities are essential to the orderly
functioning of the area, or where failure or interruption would result in
danger to public health or safety. Minor or auxiliary roads or railroads may be
constructed at a lower elevation where failure or interruption of
transportation services would not endanger the public health or safety. All
public transportation facilities should be designed to minimize increases in
flood elevations.

criteria must be satisfied:
      (1)   Variances must not be issued within any designated regulatory
floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
      (2)   Variances from the provisions of this chapter may only be issued by
a community upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      (3)   Variances from the provisions in this chapter may only be issued
upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering
the flood hazard, to afford relief.
      (4)   Variances must be consistent with the general purpose of these
standards and the intent of applicable provisions in state and federal law.
      (5)   Variances may be used to modify permissible methods of flood
protection, but no variance shall permit a lesser degree of flood protection
than the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation (RFPE).
      (6)   The Zoning Administrator must notify the applicant for a variance
in writing that:
         (a)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the
base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and
         (b)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property. Notification must be maintained with a record of all

§ 151.131 SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT AND SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE DETERMINATIONS.
   Prior to issuing any pennits for additions, modifications, rehabilitations,
repairs, alterations, or maintenance to nonconforming structures, the Zoning
Administrator is required to determine if such work constitutes substantial
improvement or repair of a substantially damaged structure. A determination
must be made in accordance with the following procedures:
   (A)   Estimate the market value of the structure. In the case of repairs,
the market value of the structure shall be the market value before the damage
occurred and before any restoration or repairs are made.
   (B)   Estimate the cost of the project. The property owner shall accommodate
for inspection, and furnish other documentation needed by the Zoning
Administrator to evaluate costs.
      (1)   Improvement costs shall be comprised of the market rate of all
materials and labor, as well as the costs of all ordinary maintenance and
upkeep carried out over the past one year.
      (2)   Costs to repair damages shall be comprised of the market rate of
all materials and labor required to restore a building to its pre-damaged
condition regardless of the work proposed, as well as associated improvement
costs if structure is being restored beyond its pre-damaged condition.
   (C)   Compare the cost of the improvement, repairs, or combination thereof
to the estimated market value of the structure, and determine whether the
proposed work constitutes substantial improvement or repair of a substantially
damaged structure, as defined in §
151.013.
      (1)   For the purposes of determining whether the proposed work would
constitute substantial improvement, the evaluation shall also include all
rehabilitations, additions, or other improvements completed since the community
has adopted floodplain standards impacting this structure.
      (2)   If any nonconforming structure experiences a repetitive loss, as
defined in §
151.013, it shall be considered substantially damaged and must not be
reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
   (D)   Based on this determination, the Zoning Administrator shall prepare a
determination letter and notify the property owner accordingly. Structures
determined to be substantially damaged or substantially improved may not be
reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.001 TITLE.
    This chapter shall be known as the “Subdivision Ordinance of the City of Le
Sueur,” and will be referred to herein as “this chapter.”

§ 152.002 INTENT AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   The process of dividing raw land into separate parcels for other uses
including residential, industrial and commercial sites, is one of the most
important factors in the growth of any community. Once the land has been
subdivided and the streets, homes and other structures have been constructed,
the basic character of this permanent addition to the community has become
firmly established. It is, therefore, in the interest of the general public,
the developer and the future landowners that subdivisions be conceived,
designed and developed in accordance with the highest possible standards of
excellence.
   (B)    All subdivisions of land hereafter submitted for approval shall fully
comply, in all respects, with the regulations set forth in this chapter to
assure new subdivisions will contribute toward an attractive, orderly, stable
and wholesome community environment, and be designed with adequate municipal
services and efficient movement of traffic. It is the purpose of regulations
to:
      (1)   Encourage well planned, efficient and attractive subdivisions by
establishing adequate standards for design and construction;
      (2)   Provide for the health and safety of residents by requiring the
necessary services such as properly designed streets and adequate sewage and
water service;
      (3)   Place the cost of improvements against those benefitting from the
construction project;
      (4)   Secure the rights of the public with respect to public land and
waters;
      (5)   Improve land records by establishing standards for surveys and
plats;
      (6)   Protect the environmentally sensitive areas in the city;
      (7)   Ensure all subdivision of property conform as nearly as possible to
the comprehensive plan;
      (8)   Secure equitable handling of all subdivision plans by providing
uniform procedures and standards; and
      (9)   Assure the general design of subdivisions complies with the zoning
chapter, State Building Code and other pertinent regulations of the city, the
county, and the State of Minnesota.

§ 152.020 ADMINISTRATIVE SUBDIVISIONS.
   (A)   Qualification. The following circumstances may be considered an
administrative subdivision:
      (1)   In the case of a request to divide a portion of a lot where the
division is to permit the adding of a parcel of land to an abutting lot so that
no additional lots are created and both resulting lots conform to minimum
requirements of the zoning ordinance;
      (2)   In the case of a request to combine two or more existing lots; or
      (3)   In the case of a request to divide a base lot upon which a two-
family dwelling, townhouse, or a quadraminium which is a part of a recorded
plat, where the division is to permit individual private ownership of a single
dwelling unit within such a structure and the newly created property lines will
not cause any of the unit lots or the structure to be in violation of this
chapter or the city zoning ordinance.
   (B)   Application. Whenever any subdivision of land is proposed, before any
contract is made for the sale of any part of such subdivision, and before any
permit for the erection of a structure on such proposed subdivision shall be
granted, the subdividing owner or his or her authorized agent shall file an
application and secure approval of an administrative subdivision. The
administrative subdivision application shall be considered to be officially
filed when the Zoning Administrator or designee has received the application
and has determined that the application is complete.
   (C)   Submittal requirement. Unless otherwise waived by the Zoning
Administrator, the submittal requirements are the same as for a minor
subdivision as found in §

planning, engineering, and legal staff, as appropriate, and shall forward
copies of the application to agencies and utility companies responsible for
review of the application.
      (3)   The Zoning Administrator shall have authority to request supportive
information pertinent to the administrative subdivision. Failure to provide the
necessary supportive information may be grounds for denial of the request.
      (4)   Decision. The Zoning Administrator shall reach a decision on the
requested administrative subdivision within 60 days of complete application,
unless the applicant agrees to an extension of the review period.
         (a)   Approval. The Zoning Administrator may approve the
administrative subdivision with conditions that shall be met to ensure the
administrative subdivision is compliant with the regulations of the subdivision
and zoning ordinances, as may be amended, and other applicable requirements
including consistency with the comprehensive plan.
         (b)   Denial. The Zoning Administrator shall prepare findings and deny
a subdivision if the administrative subdivision is found to be premature as
defined in this chapter or fails to comply with regulations of this chapter and
the zoning ordinance, as may be amended, or other applicable requirements
including consistency with the comprehensive plan.
         (c)   Decision appeal. The applicant may appeal an administrative
subdivision denial following the appeal procedure outlined in §
153.021.
         (d)   Dedication of easements. Prior to certification by the city of
the approval of the administrative subdivision, the applicant shall supply the
deed(s) granting to the city any easements as required by the Zoning
Administrator.
         (e)   Rezoning. If an administrative subdivision would cause one of
the parcels to have two different zoning classifications, the applicant must
rezone the property to achieve a consistent zoning classification for the newly
created parcel in a manner consistent with the comprehensive plan and zoning
ordinance. The zoning shall be successfully resolved or the administrative
subdivision shall be denied.
         (f)   Vacation of easements. Any easements that become unnecessary as
a result of the combination of lots must be vacated.
   (E)   Recording. If the administrative subdivision is approved by the Zoning
Administrator, the applicant shall record the deed, and the accompanying

approval, otherwise the approval of the administrative subdivision shall be
considered void.

152.999
§ 152.021 MINOR SUBDIVISIONS.
   (A)   In the case of a subdivision of un-platted land or a re-subdivision of
platted land into three parcels or less, situated in a locality where
conditions are well defined, and the subdividing will not be detrimental to the
public welfare or injurious to other property in the locality in which the
property in question is located and newly created, and property lines will not
cause any resulting lot to be in violation of this chapter or the zoning code,
the applicant may seek approval of the subdivision as an un-platted minor
subdivision.
   (B)   Divisions by metes and bounds creating new parcels shall follow the
same procedure as established for a preliminary plat. Application requirements
may be waived at the discretion of the Zoning Administrator.
   (C)   At minimum, the application shall be accompanied by or contain the

preliminary plat shall not be taken until the minimum 30 day review period has
elapsed.
         (h)   Upon receipt of a complete application, the Zoning Administrator
shall prepare a report and refer the application to the Park Commission and the
Planning Commission.
         (i)   The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing on the
proposed preliminary plat. Notice of the public hearing shall be published in
the official newspaper designated by the City Council at least ten days prior
to the hearing. The city shall mail written notification of the proposed
preliminary plat to property owners located within 350 feet of the subject
site. Timing of the mailed notice shall be the same as that for the published
notice. The failure to give mailed notice to individual property owners or
defects in the notice shall not invalidate the proceedings, provided a bona

welfare.
         (m)   The City Council may deny or require modifications to a proposed
preliminary plat when said plat fails to comply with any of the requirements of
this chapter, or other applicable regulations, including the zoning ordinance.
In addition, the City Council may deny or require modifications to a proposed
preliminary plat when the City Council finds that despite technical compliance
with applicable ordinances, the plat design results in a likelihood of
extraordinary public costs for future maintenance, extraordinary threat to
existing natural or environmental features (including woodlands, wetlands, and
other water resources), or the potential for public safety hazards that are not
typical for subdivisions in Le Sueur.
         (n)   The City Council shall take action on the application which
shall include findings of fact and shall be entered in the proceedings of the
City Council and transmitted to the applicant in writing. The lack of a simple
majority Council vote to affirmatively approve a preliminary plat shall be a
denial of the requested application.

in the preliminary plat may occur after approval of the preliminary plat and
the approval and recording of a development agreement for the grading work,
including financial securities.
   (F)   Denial of plat.
      (1)   Premature subdivisions. Any preliminary or final plat of a proposed
subdivision deemed premature for development shall be denied by the City
Council.
         (a)   Conditions establishing premature subdivisions. A subdivision
may be deemed premature should any of the conditions set forth in the
provisions which follow exist:
            1.   Lack of adequate drainage. A condition of inadequate drainage
exists.
               a.   A condition of inadequate drainage shall be deemed to exist
if:
                  i.   Surface or subsurface water retention and runoff is such
that it constitutes a danger to the structural security of the proposed
structures and/or adjacent properties; or
                  ii.   The proposed subdivision will cause pollution of water
sources or damage from erosion and siltation on downhill or downstream land.
               b.   The proposed site grading and development will cause
harmful and irreparable damage from erosion and siltation on downstream land.
               c.   Factors to be considered in making these determinations may
include: average rainfall for the area; the relation of the land to
floodplains; the nature of soils and subsoils and their ability to adequately
support surface water runoff and waste disposal systems; the slope of the land
and its effect on effluents; and the presence of streams as related to effluent
disposal.
            2.   Lack of adequate water supply. There is a lack of adequate
water supply. A proposed subdivision shall be deemed to lack an adequate water
supply if joint power water is not available to the plat. With the extension of
municipal water, all private wells must be capped in accordance with state
statutes.
            3.   Lack of adequate roads or highways to serve subdivision. There
is a lack of adequate roads or highways to serve the subdivision. A proposed
subdivision shall be deemed to lack adequate roads or highways to serve the
subdivision when:
               a.   Roads which serve the proposed subdivision are of such a
width, grade, stability, vertical and horizontal alignment, site distance, and
surface condition that an increase in traffic volume generated by the proposed
subdivision would create a hazard to public safety and general welfare or
seriously aggravate an already hazardous condition; and when, with due regard
to the advice of the City Engineer, the county, and/or the Minnesota Department
of Transportation, the roads are inadequate for the intended use;
               b.   The traffic volume generated by the proposed subdivision
would create unreasonable street congestion or unsafe conditions on streets
existing at the time of the application or proposed for completion within the
next two years; or
               c.   The roads fail to meet minimum city standards.
            4.   Lack of adequate waste disposal systems. There is a lack of
adequate waste disposal systems. A proposed subdivision shall be deemed to lack
adequate waste disposal systems if municipal sanitary sewer is not available to
the plat or if in subdivisions for which sewer lines are proposed there is
inadequate sewer capacity in the present system to support the subdivision if
developed to its maximum permissible density indicated in the city
comprehensive plan, as may be amended.
            5.   Inconsistency with comprehensive plan. The proposed
subdivision is inconsistent with the purposes, objectives, and recommendations
of the duly adopted city comprehensive plan, as may be amended.
            6.   Providing public improvements. Public improvements, such as
recreational facilities, or other public facilities reasonably necessitated by
the subdivision which must be provided at public expense cannot be reasonably
provided for within the next two fiscal years.
            7.   Minnesota Environmental Quality Board (MEQB) policies. The
proposed subdivision is inconsistent with the policies of MEQB 25, as may be
amended, and could adversely impact critical environmental areas, or
potentially disrupt or destroy historic areas which are designated or
officially recognized by the City Council, in violation of federal and state
historical preservation laws.
         (b)   Burden of establishing. The burden shall be upon the applicant
to show that the proposed subdivision is not premature.
      (2)   Denial of plat. The Planning Commission may recommend denial and
the Council may deny the subdivision if it makes any one or more of the
following findings:
         (a)   That the proposed subdivision is in conflict with adopted
applicable general and specific comprehensive plans of the city;
         (b)   That the physical characteristics of this site, including but
not limited to topography, percolation rate, soil conditions, susceptibility to
erosion and siltation, susceptibility to flooding, water storage, drainage, and
retention, are such that the site is not suitable for the type of development,
design, or use contemplated;
         (c)   That the site is not physically suitable for the proposed
density of development;
         (d)   That the design of the subdivision or the proposed improvements
are likely to cause environmental damage;
         (e)   That the design of the subdivision or the type of improvements
are likely to cause public health problems;
         (f)   That the design of the subdivision or the type of improvements
will conflict with easements of record or with easements established by
judgement of a court;
         (g)   That the proposed subdivision, its site, or its design adversely
affects the flood-carrying capacity of the floodway, increases flood stages and
velocities, or increases flood hazards within the floodway fringe or within
other areas of the city;
         (h)   The proposed subdivision is inconsistent with the policies and
standards of the state-defined Shoreland, Floodplain, and Wetland Districts;
         (i)   The City Council deems the subdivision to be premature;
         (j)   The design of the subdivision does not conform to minimum city
standards; and
         (k)   That the proposed subdivision will not provide adequate
extension of infrastructure including roads or utilities to surrounding
property.

shall submit three full size mylar copies of the final plat, one 11" x 17"
reduction of the final plat and dedication page, and one electronic copy in a
format compatible with the city's engineering standards.
      (2)   After approval and execution of the development contract, the
contract shall be recorded.
      (3)   The developer shall record the plat within 90 days after the date
of approval, otherwise the approval of the final plat shall be considered void,
unless the developer requests an extension, in writing, and receives approval
from the City Council. The subdivider shall, immediately upon recording,
furnish the City Clerk with a print and reproducible tracing of the final plat
showing evidence of the recording. No building permits shall be issued for
construction of any structure on any lot in said plat until the city has
received evidence of the plat being recorded by the county.
         (a)   When the land for which the final plat abuts a state highway,
county road, or county state aid highway, a certificate or other evidence
showing submission of the preliminary plat to the Minnesota Department of
Transportation and/or the County Highway Department shall be filed with the
County Recorder of Deeds, along with the final plat.
         (b)   When the final plat includes outlots to be used for drainage or
other city purposes, such outlots shall be dedicated to the city prior to the
issuance of building permits and shall provide city access.
      (4)   Recording final plats of multi-phased plats. The recording of final
plats of multi-phased plats shall be addressed as part of the development
contract.
   (F)   Record plans and mapping. Upon completion of construction of roads,
sanitary sewer, water mains, storm sewer facilities, grading, and tree
preservation, the developer shall submit to the City Engineer field marked
construction plans showing changes in the work, and one electronic copy of the
original plans in a format compatible with the city's computer system. The City
Engineer shall prepare record drawings at the developer's expense using the
data provided as well as supplemental survey information to be gathered by the
City Engineer. The City Engineer will also update city base and utility maps to
include the new subdivision and infrastructure improvements at the developer's
expense.

   (A)   The length of blocks shall not exceed 1,200 feet nor be less than 300
feet. Pedestrian ways at least ten feet wide at their approximate centers may
be required for blocks over 800 feet long.
   (B)   Blocks intended for commercial and industrial use must be designed as
such, and the block must be of sufficient size to provide for adequate off-
street parking, loading and any other requirements of the city.
   (C)   The width of a block shall normally be sufficient to allow two tiers
of lots of appropriate length.
(Ord. 582, passed 8-26-2019)
§ 152.074 LOTS.
   (A)   Area/width. The minimum lot area and width shall not be less than that
established by the city zoning ordinance in effect at the time of adoption of
the subdivision.
   (B)   Corner lots. Corner lots for residential use shall have additional
width to permit appropriate building setback from both streets as required in
the zoning ordinance.
   (C)   Side lot lines. Side lines of lots shall be approximately at right
angles to street lines or radial to curved street lines.
   (D)   Building sites and drainage. Each lot shall provide an adequate
building site upon the basis of plans submitted showing alternative, acceptable
surface drainage measures. Lots shall be graded so as to provide drainage away
from building locations, subject to the approval of the City Engineer. A
grading plan shall be submitted showing all lot grading and drainage
provisions.
   (E)   Frontage. Every lot must have the minimum frontage on a city-approved
street, as required in the city zoning ordinance.
   (F)   Access. Each lot shall directly access a public street.
   (G)   Setback lines. Setback or building lines shall be shown on all lots
intended for residential use and shall not be less than the setback required by
the city zoning ordinance, as may be amended.
   (H)   Watercourses. Watercourses shall be contained within abutting lots.
Watercourses shall be protected by easement to the anticipated high-water level
(as determined by the city). Lots with easements protecting watercourses shall
have sufficient dimensions and area above the normal water.
   (I)   Ground slope limitations. Subdivision design shall be consistent with
limitations presented by steep slopes. Subdivisions shall be designed so that
no construction or grading will be conducted on slopes steeper than 12% in
grade, unless approved by the City Engineer.
   (J)   Features. In the subdividing of any land, due regard shall be shown
for all-natural features, such as tree growth, watercourses, historic spots, or
similar conditions which, if preserved, will add attractiveness and stability
to the proposed development.
   (K)   Lot remnants. All remnants of lots below minimum size left over after
subdividing of a larger tract must be added to adjacent lots or platted as an
outlot rather than be allowed to remain as unusable parcels.
   (L)   Political boundaries. No subdivision shall extend over a political
boundary or school district line without document notification to affected
units of government.
   (M)   Frontage on two streets. Double frontage (lots with frontage on two
parallel streets) or reverse frontage shall not be permitted except where lot
rear yards back on an arterial or collector street. The lots shall have an
additional depth of at least ten feet in order to allow for screen planting
along the rear yard back lot line. As part of the subdivision review process,
the submission of a buffering and screening plan shall be required.
   (N)   Access to major collector streets. In the case where a proposed
subdivision is adjacent to a major collector street, said streets to be defined
by the city's comprehensive plan, there shall be no direct vehicular access
from individual lots to such streets and roads. In the subdividing of small
tracts of land fronting on limited access highways or major collector streets
where there is no other alternative, a temporary access may be granted, subject
to terms and conditions defined by the City Council and applicable county or
state agencies. As neighboring land becomes subdivided and more preferable
access arrangements become possible, temporary access permits shall become
void. In cases where direct lot access to collector or arterial streets is
allowed, special traffic safety measures including, but not limited to,
provisions for on-site vehicle turnaround shall be required. In cases where a
proposed subdivision is adjacent to a county or state highway, the subdivision
shall be subject to county and/or state approval.
   (O)   Outlots. Lot remnants and future subdivision development phases shall
be platted as outlots. In cases where outlots are created or exist, their area
shall not be utilized in calculating minimums for buildable lot area
requirements. Outlots are also prohibited from qualifying for building permits.
(Ord. 582, passed 8-26-2019) Penalty, see §
152.999
§ 152.075 STREETS AND ALLEYS.
   (A)   General street design.
      (1)   The design of all streets shall be considered in relation to public
safety, existing and planned streets, efficient circulation of traffic,
topographical conditions, run-off of storm water, proposed use of the land to
be served by those streets, and the comprehensive plan of the community.
      (2)   When a new subdivision adjoins un-subdivided land that is
susceptible to being divided, the arrangement of streets shall allow for their
appropriate continuation into adjoining areas. The streets shall be carried to
the boundaries of the un-subdivided land.
      (3)   Where the parcel is subdivided into larger tracts than for building
lots, the parcels shall be divided so as to allow for the opening of major
streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent minor streets.
   (B)   Street names. Street names shall not duplicate the names of other
streets.
   (C)   Street width and grades. The following standards for street width and
grades shall be followed by the subdivider.
 
Type of Highway or Street Minimum Width (Feet) Maximum Grade Minimum Grade
Collectors                60                   8%            .5%
Cul-de-sacs radius        40                   10%           .5%
Frontage roads            60                   10%           .5%
Highway and arterials     80 - 120             5%            .5%
Local streets             60                   10%           .5%
Turn around diameters     80                   10%           .5%
 
   (D)   Street intersections. Insofar as practical, streets shall intersect at
right angles. In no case shall the angle formed by the intersection of two
streets be less than 60 degrees. Intersections having more than four corners
shall be prohibited. Adequate land for future intersection and interchange
construction needs shall be dedicated to the city.
   (E)   Tangents. A tangent of at least 100 feet shall be introduced between
reverse curves on collector streets and 50 feet on lesser streets.
   (F)   Deflections. When connecting street lines deflect from each other at
one point by more than ten degrees, they shall be connected by a curve with a
radius adequate to ensure a sight distance of no less than 500 feet for
arterials, 300 feet for collectors, and 100 feet for all other streets.
   (G)   Street jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 150 feet
shall be prohibited.
   (H)   Local streets. Local streets shall be laid out so as not to encourage
through traffic.
   (I)   Cul-de-sac. The maximum length of a street terminating in a cul-de-sac
shall be 300 feet, measured from the centerline of the street of origin to the
end of the right-of-way. Each cul-de-sac shall be provided with a turn-around
having a minimum outside roadway diameter of 80 feet and a minimum street
property line diameter of 100 feet.
   (J)   Access to arterial streets. In the case where a proposed plat is
adjacent to a limited access highway (arterial), there shall be no direct
vehicular or pedestrian access from individual lots to highways. As a general
requirement, access arterials shall be at intervals of not less than one-fourth
a mile and through existing and established crossroads where possible. The City
Council may require the developer to provide local service drives along the
right-of-way of the facilities, or they may require that lot rear yards back on
the arterials, in which case vehicular and pedestrian access between the lots
and arterial shall be prohibited.
   (K)   Half streets. Half streets shall be prohibited except where it will be
practical to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining
property is subdivided, in which case the dedication of a half street may be
permitted. The probable length of time elapsing before dedication of the
remainder shall be considered in this decision. No permanent street improvement
shall be permitted within a half street right-of-way. All lots having frontage
or access solely from a half street are prohibited from being eligible for
building permits.
   (L)   Private streets. Private streets shall be prohibited and not
maintained.
   (M)   Corners. Curb lines at street intersections shall be rounded at a
radius of not less than 15 feet.
   (N)   Alleys. Alleys, where permitted by the city, shall be at least a
minimum of 15 feet wide in residential areas and at least 24 feet wide in
commercial areas. The city may require alleys in commercial areas where
adequate off-street loading space is not available. Dead-end alleys, alley
intersections and sharp changes in alignment shall be prohibited.
   (O)   Pedestrian walkways. The Planning Commission and/or Council may
require the provision of pedestrian ways in proximity to public service areas
such as parks, schools, shopping facilities or in other appropriate locations
as need exists or as required by city officials, Planning Commission and/or the
City Council. The design of the pedestrian walkways shall be considered in
their relation to existing and planned pedestrian walkways, to reasonable
circulation of traffic, to topographic conditions, to runoff of storm water and
to the proposed uses of the area to be served. Pedestrian rights-of-way shall
be a minimum of at least ten feet wide.
   (P)   Hardship to owners of adjoining property. The street arrangements
shall not be such as to cause hardship to owners of adjoining property in
platting their own land and providing convenient access to it.
   (Q)   Street plans for future subdivisions. Where the subdivision to be
submitted includes only part of the tract owned or intended for development by
the applicant, a tentative plan of a proposed future street system for the un-
subdivided portion shall be prepared and submitted by the applicant. When
determined necessary by the city, the plan shall extend streets and utilities
to the property line of the adjacent tract and/or tracts.
   (R)   Compliance with city, county and state transportation plans. All
subdivisions adjacent to or incorporating planned streets which are identified
in the city, county and state transportation plans, as amended, or existing
streets shall comply with the minimum right-of-way, surfaced width and design
standards as outlined in the plans or as recommended by the City Engineer.
   (S)   Reserve strips. Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be
prohibited except under conditions accepted by the City Council.
   (T)   Temporary cul-de-sacs. In those instances where a street is terminated
pending future extension in conjunction with future subdivision, a temporary
turnaround facility shall be provided at the closed end, in conformance with
cul-de-sac requirements.
   (U)   Subdivisions abutting major rights-of-way. Wherever the proposed
subdivision contains or is adjacent to the right-of-way of a U.S. or state
highway or county thoroughfare, provision may be made for a marginal access
street approximately parallel and adjacent to the boundary of the right-of-way;
provided, that due consideration is given to proper circulation design, or for
a street at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of land between the
street and right-of-way. The distance shall be determined with due
consideration of the minimum distance required for approach connections to
future grade separations, or for lot depths.
   (V)   Grading. The full width of the right-of-way of all streets and alleys
dedicated in the plat shall be graded to the lines and cross sections as shown
on the grading plan submitted to and approved by the City Engineer. Exceptions
to the width of grading may be granted where topography or tree cover warrant.
   (W)   Soil investigation. To determine sub-grade soils classification and
bearing capacity of the soils in the proposed development, a soil investigation
report shall be prepared under the supervision of a soils engineer associated
with a qualified soil testing service and be provided to the City Engineer. The
report shall contain the design recommendation for street section based on
seven ton design. In proposed streets, soils investigation shall be performed
at intervals not to exceed 500 lineal feet. The soil borings completed during
the investigation shall be at least ten feet in depth below the proposed
finished grade and five feet below the proposed elevations of utilities. Ground
water levels shall be reported at each boring. Elevations shall be in mean sea
level datum. Locations of borings shall be measured in the field and accurately
shown on the plans.
   (X)   Base and surfacing. All streets shall be improved with a concrete or
bituminous surface. Pavement sections shall be in accordance with city standard
detail plates. Except in the case of model homes, as may be approved by the
city, no building permit shall be issued for any lot or parcel in a subdivision
prior to the installation of the base course of bituminous. The wear course of
bituminous shall be placed following the construction season or, if so
designated by the City Council, up to two years from the date of final plat
approval. Exceptions to this provision may be granted by the City Council at
their discretion as part of a development contract. This requirement may, for
plats in the urban reserve district, be modified or held in abeyance, or
gravel-based, oiled or dust palliative treated streets may be substituted if
recommended by the City Engineer, and approved by the City Council. All roads
to be constructed will be constructed per specifications by the City Engineer.
   (Y)   Concrete curb and gutter. All curb shall be concrete with integral
gutter. The standard curb shall be in accordance with the city engineering
development standards.
   (Z)   Boulevards. All boulevards shall be sodded.
   (AA)   Sidewalks. Concrete sidewalks are required on one side of all public
streets and may be required on both sides of the streets with the outside edge
located one foot from the property line, and on major pedestrian ways as
directed by the City Council. The Council may also require a bituminous trail
to be installed in lieu of the sidewalk when appropriate. All sidewalks and
trails shall be built to the specifications (including width) of the City
Engineer as found in the city development standards. The City Council may waive
this requirement in rural subdivisions or in areas where there may be limited
need or feasibility. Sidewalks shall be installed prior to the installation of
the bituminous wear course. The developer shall notify all lot purchasers of
sidewalk construction plans.
   (BB)   Driveways. All concrete aprons and driveways shall be constructed
from the curb to the property line. In cases where driveways are constructed
after curbing and sidewalks are in place, the sidewalk for the width of the
driveway shall be reconstructed to driveway specifications for thickness but
shall not alter the grade or lines of the sidewalk. Where driveways shall be
permitted to access onto thoroughfare or collector streets, provisions shall be
made for an on-site turn around area which would provide access to the
thoroughfare or collector street in a forward direction. All driveway aprons
between the back of curb and sidewalk shall be concrete.
   (CC)   Lighting. Streetlights conforming to city specifications shall be
installed at the locations approved by the City Engineer. Easements may be
required along property lines from utility easements on rear lot lines to
rights-of-way so as to provide for a streetlight interval not to exceed 350
feet.
   (DD)   Signs. All signs shall be installed by the developer in accordance
with the Minnesota Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices and the City
Engineering Development Standards.

§ 152.076 TRAILS.
   Trails shall be established in accordance with the city's comprehensive
plan, and in other areas where trails will serve an important transportation or
recreational purpose as recommended and approved by the City Council. Trail
corridors shall meet the following minimum requirements unless otherwise
permitted by the City Council:
   (A)   Dedicated to the city as an easement for public trail purposes;
   (B)   Minimum 20-foot wide corridor;
   (C)   Minimum six-foot wide surface;
   (D)   Handicap accessibility wherever possible;
   (E)   No above-ground utilities (i.e. lift stations, utility boxes) may be
within the trail corridor; and
   (F)   A landscape plan, including shrubs and trees, shall be required on
trail corridors located in the side yard of residential lots.
   (G)   Due regard shall be shown for trees, wetlands and other environmental
features when locating and constructing trails.
(Ord. 582, passed 8-26-2019)
§ 152.077 EASEMENTS.
   (A)   Width and location. An easement for drainage and utilities at least
ten feet wide shall be provided around the perimeter of a subdivision, along
front lot lines and centered along shared side and rear lot lines. If
necessary, for the extension of main water, sewer lines, similar utilities, or
drainage purposes, or to incorporate wetlands easements of greater width or
area may be required.
   (B)   Continuous utility easement locations. Drainage and utility easements
shall connect with easements established in adjoining properties. These
easements, when approved, shall not thereafter be changed without the approval
of the City Council after a public hearing.
   (C)   Guy wires. Additional easements for pole guys should be provided,
where appropriate, at the outside of turns. Where possible, lot lines shall be
arranged to bisect the exterior angle so that pole guys fall alongside lot
lines.
   (D)   Storm water management ponds. New storm water management ponds that
are constructed as part of subdivisions shall be covered by drainage and
utility easements that are dedicated to the city. At least one side of a pond
should be located adjacent to public right-of-way and adequate easement
dedicated to provide access for future maintenance.

152.999
§ 152.079 DRAINAGE.
   (A)   The grade and drainage requirements for each subdivision shall be
approved by the City Engineer at the expense of the applicant. Every
subdivision presented for final signature shall be accompanied by a certificate
of the City Engineer that the grade and drainage requirements have been met on
the grading plan. In an area not having municipal storm sewers, the applicant
shall be responsible, before subdividing, to provide for a storm water disposal
plan, without damage to properties outside the subdivided area, and the storm
water disposal plan shall be submitted to the City Engineer, who shall report
to the City Council on the feasibility of the plan presented. No subdivision
shall be approved before an adequate storm water disposal plan is presented and
approved by the City Council.
   (B)   Storm drainage facilities shall be installed in accordance with the
standards and specifications as required by the City Council and subject to the
approval of the City Engineer. In providing the facilities, specific attention
shall be given to culvert locations, trash guards, riprap, and in-place storm
drainage facilities.
(Ord. 582, passed 8-26-2019) Penalty, see §
152.999
§ 152.080 PUBLIC UTILITIES.
   (A)   Watermain. Watermain size shall be a minimum eight inch diameter,
unless otherwise stated in the city's comprehensive plan. Watermain shall be
poly vinyl chloride (PVC-C900) pipe and shall meet all the requirements of the
City Engineer's Association of Minnesota standard utility specification for
watermain and service line installation and American Water Works Association
standard.
      (1)   Mains shall be valved at intervals not to exceed 800 feet. Valve
type shall be in accordance with city standard specifications.
      (2)   "Dead end" mains shall be looped if exceeding the allowed length of
a cul-de-sac. The distribution system may require installing a larger main to
benefit the entire water service in the city. The City Engineer shall determine
location and size of mains larger than eight inches in residential areas. In
commercial/industrial areas, watermain up to 12 inches may be required to meet
normal distribution required in the development. The cost of normal
distribution size and appurtenances shall be the responsibility of the
developer. Size of pipe over and above the normal shall be installed and
financed in accordance with city policy. All pipe sizes shall be consistent
with the city's comprehensive plan.
   (B)   Water supply. Service connections shall be stubbed into the property
line and new individual wells are not permitted as a primary water source for
parcels created in the urban service area. In all subdivisions outside the
urban service area, the subdivider shall either:
      (1)   Install a system providing each lot with an adequate supply of
portable water; or
      (2)   State on his or her preliminary plat that purchasers of individual
lots will be required to install their own approved wells. Private wells shall
comply with all requirements of state law.
   (C)   Fire hydrants. Installation shall be pursuant to plans approved by the
City Engineer and the Fire Department and shall be located in accordance with
Insurance Service Office (ISO) and International Fire Code standards. Hydrants
shall be placed at the end of all "dead ends," cul-de-sacs and at street
intersections. Hydrant type and installation shall be in accordance with city
standard specifications and shall not exceed 500 foot spacing in the urban
service area.
   (D)   Sanitary sewer. Sanitary sewer shall be a minimum of eight inch pipe
and shall be of a material approved for use in the city by the City Engineer.
Main size will be determined by the sewage flow and grade in accordance with
the city sanitary sewer plan.
      (1)   Size of pipe shall be determined by lateral service and/or trunk
service. Lateral service shall be the responsibility of, and cost shall be
borne by, the serviced property. The incremental cost to install trunk sewer in
lieu of lateral sewer will be borne by the city for developments not deemed
premature and provided sufficient funds are available in the trunk sewer fund.
      (2)   House services. All services shall be installed in accordance with
the city's standard specifications.
      (3)   Electronic final design plans shall be submitted to the city in the
format required by the City Engineer, typically AutoCAD, to allow the
completion of record plans by the City Engineer.
   (E)   Sanitation. Water and sewer lines shall be installed and connected to
the public system to serve all lots within the proposed subdivision under the
provisions of applicable statutes and ordinances. The City Council shall
require the installation of water and sewer mains, at the applicant's expense
or under the provisions of applicable statutes and ordinances.
   (F)   Telephone, electric, cable, gas service lines and/or other public
utilities are to be placed underground in accordance with the city's right-of-
way ordinance.
   (G)   Conduit shall be installed for all road crossings by the developer in
cooperation with the utilities prior to street construction.

§ 152.081 PROTECTED AREAS.
   (A)   Where land proposed for subdivision is deemed environmentally
sensitive by the city due to the existence of wetlands, drainage ways,
watercourses, floodable areas, or steep slopes, the design of the subdivision
shall clearly reflect all necessary measures of protection to insure against
adverse environmental impact.
   (B)   Based upon the necessity to control and maintain certain sensitive
areas, the city shall determine whether protection will be accomplished through
lot enlargement and redesign or dedication of those sensitive areas in the form
of easements or outlots.
   (C)   In general, measures of protection shall include design solutions
which allow for construction and grading involving a minimum of alteration to
sensitive areas. Where these areas are to be incorporated into lots within the
proposed subdivision, the applicant shall be required to demonstrate that the
proposed design will not require construction on slopes over 18%, or result in
significant alteration to the natural drainage system such that adverse impacts
cannot be contained within the plat boundary.

§ 152.082 PARK AND OTHER PUBLIC LAND DEDICATION REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Findings of the City Council.
      (1)   The City Council finds that as the city continues to increase in
population, planning is needed to ensure the identification and economic
development of park lands, and that such lands are preserved for public use
during the land subdivision and development process and not developed for other
purposes. The provisions by the city of adequate park land facilities to serve
the recreational needs of new residents and workers within the city is an
important factor in the maintenance of a high quality of life in the city and
contributes to the health and safety of citizens. In addition, adequate open
space land should be reserved to retain the character of the city, protect
wildlife habitats, cleanse the air and storm water runoff, and provide passive
recreational opportunities.
      (2)   It is therefore in the best interest of all of the citizens of the
city to ensure that when new development is hereinafter created or made
possible by subdivision of lands, that adequate measures are provided in the
subdivision process to permit the city to identify land suitable for
development as new park land, and to obtain and develop such lands for the use
of the public at a reasonable cost. It also is in the best interest of all the
citizens of the city to ensure that adequate open space is dedicated and
reserved.
   (B)   Purpose. The provisions of this section are intended by the city to be
an exercise of the authority granted pursuant to M.S. § 462.358, Subdivision 2
(b) to require that a reasonable portion of any proposed subdivision of lands
within the city be dedicated to the public as park lands; or that a reasonable
cash payment be received from the developer in lieu thereof in order to
facilitate development of similar facilities.
   (C)   Scope. The provisions of this section shall apply to a person who
applies for a subdivision of land (where, as determined by the city, the
proposed subdivision causes an increased demand on city parks), regardless of
the intended use of land, whether residential, commercial, industrial or other.
   (D)   Parks and open spaces.
      (1)   All developers, landowners, or persons requesting subdivision of
land shall convey to the city, or dedicate to the public use, a percentage of
such land for the public use as parks, playgrounds, trails or open space. The
city, at its discretion, may require cash in lieu of land to be dedicated or a
combination of land and cash dedication, as established in the city's fee
schedule and adopted by the City Council from time to time.
         (a)   City's deposit of funds. Sums of money so received by the city
shall be placed in a special account to be known as the "Park Fund" and
allocated by the City Council solely for the development of park land. Eligible
expenditures shall include the acquisition of land, purchase of equipment,
construction of facilities, development of existing parks and recreational
areas, or debt retirement in connection with such improvements previously
expended.
         (b)   Dedication formula. The amount of land required to be dedicated
by a developer shall be based upon the gross area of the subdivision or
development which could be developed for residential, commercial, or industrial
purposes, and shall be determined as follows:
            (1)   Residential development. The park dedication requirement for
a residential subdivision or development shall be 10% of the gross area
included in the subdivision or development.
            (2)   Commercial and industrial development. The park dedication
requirement for an industrial subdivision or development shall be 5% of the
gross area included in the subdivision or development.
         (c)   Park land calculation. In determining the amount of park land
that must be dedicated for a specific subdivision, the following shall not be
included within the calculation unless an exception is granted by the City
Council based upon the appropriateness given the intended use of the dedicated
land: land within an existing watercourse; land within a 100-year floodway or
floodplain; land within a drainage easement or storm water ponding area; or
land shown as being within a wetland, as shown on the National Wetlands
Inventory or wetland delineation study, when available.
         (d)   Cash-in-lieu of dedication. The city shall require a cash
payment in lieu of park dedication whenever the proposed dedication of land for
public use is not needed, is not suitable for the intended use, is too small
for practical maintenance, inconsistent with the comprehensive plan, or
whenever cash payment would be more beneficial to the development of the
overall park system than dedication of land within the property to be
developed. If the city elects to accept a cash payment in lieu of land
dedication, the amount paid shall be consistent with the fees found in the
city's fee schedule.
         (e)   Time of dedication or cash payment.
            1.   The requirements of this division shall apply at the time of
the final approval of the plat, replat, subdivision, waiver of platting, or
plot plan approval and shall apply to any plat, replat, subdivision, waiver of
platting, or development requirements of this division receiving final approval
after the effective date of this division.
            2.   No final plat shall be approved by the city until all amounts
owned under this division for cash payment in lieu of park dedication have been
paid to the city.
            3.   The city may approve a development contract that specifies a
different payment schedule where appropriate.
         (f)   Conformance with comprehensive plan. Land dedicated under this
provision shall reasonably conform to the comprehensive plan. The Park
Commission and the Planning Commission shall review proposed dedication of land
or proposed payment of cash in lieu of land and shall recommend to the Council
appropriate action.
      (2)   In the event that the developer objects to the required fee, the
city shall, at the developer's request and expense, conduct a specific
dedication study of the park system and the increased demand that the city
determines will likely be placed on the park system if the proposed plat is
approved.
   (E)   Lands for public use. Pursuant to M.S. § 462.358(2)(b), as amended,
and this section, all owners or developers, as a prerequisite to approval of a
plat, subdivision or development of any land, shall convey to the city, or
dedicate to the public use, a reasonable portion of any such land for public
use as streets, roads, sewers, electric, gas and water facilities, storm water
drainage and holding areas or ponds, similar utilities and improvements or
parks, playgrounds, trails or open space, such portions to be approved and
acceptable to the city.
   (F)   Dedicated land requirements. Any land to be dedicated as a requirement
of this section shall be reasonably adaptable for its proposed use and shall be
at a location convenient to the people to be served. Factors used in evaluating
the adequacy of proposed park and recreation areas shall include size, shape,
topography, geology, tree cover, access and location.
   (G)   Miscellaneous requirements for park dedications. The following
requirements shall apply to all dedications or conveyances for park,
playground, trail or public open space purposes:
      (1)   Land conveyed or dedicated pursuant to provisions of this section
shall, at the option of the City Council, be located outside of drainage ways,
floodplains and ponding areas after the site has been developed.
      (2)   Standards for location. The Park Board shall make a recommendation
to the Planning Commission prior to preliminary plat approval, as to the
location and type of park facility required for each development. The Park
Board shall consider the city's comprehensive plan for other resources and site
development in making its recommendation.
      (3)   Land areas so conveyed or dedicated for park, playground, trail and
open space purposes may not be used by an owner or developer as an allowance
for purposes of calculating the density requirements of the development as set
out in the zoning code (Chapter 155) and shall be in addition to, and not in
lieu of, open space requirements for planned unit developments pursuant to the
zoning code, as amended.
   (H)   Open space privately owned. Open space privately owned and maintained
shall not be given credit for park land dedication. Where private open space
for park, playground, trail, open space or other recreation purposes is
provided in a proposed subdivision and such space is to be privately owned and
maintained by the future residents of the subdivision, the following standards
shall be met:
      (1)   All yards, court areas, setbacks and other open space required to
be maintained by the zoning code shall not be included in the computation of
such private open space;
      (2)   The private ownership and maintenance of the open space shall be
adequately provided for by written agreement;
      (3)   The private open space shall be restricted for park, playground,
trail, open space or recreational purposes by recorded covenants which run with
the land in favor of the future owners of the property within the tract and
which cannot be eliminated without the consent of the City Council; and
      (4)   The proposed private open space shall be reasonably adaptable for
use for such purposes, taking into consideration such factors as size, shape,
topography, geology, access and location of the private open space.
   (I)   Marketability; evidence of good title. Prior to such park land
dedication, the developer shall deliver to the City Attorney a title commitment
issued by a recognized issuer of title policies in the state establishing that
the developer has marketable title to the land intended to be dedicated or
conveyed for park land purposes. No subdivision of the land shall be approved
until the City Attorney has determined that the developer has good and
marketable title to the land intended to be dedicated or conveyed to the city
as park land.
   (J)   Taxes and special assessments. The city shall not be responsible for
the payment of any special assessments levied against or otherwise attributable
to the land proposed to be dedicated or conveyed to the city for park land
purposes. Any special assessment shall be paid by the developer prior to the
dedication or conveyance of the land to the city.

line of the property to be included with the plat to be fully dimensioned; all
angles of the boundary excepting the closing angle to be indicated; all
monuments and surveyor's irons to be indicated, each angle point of the

in or adjacent to the property shall be preserved in precise position and shall
be recorded on the plat. All lot and block dimensions shall be shown on the
plat and all necessary angles pertaining to the lots and blocks, as an aid to
future surveys, shall be shown on the plat. No ditto marks will be permitted in
indicating dimensions.
   (C)   To insure that all irons and monuments are correctly in place
following the final grading of a plat, a second monumentation shall be in the
form of a surveyor's certificate and this requirement shall additionally be a
condition of certificate of occupancy as provided for in the city zoning
ordinance, as may be amended.
   (D)   All lot corners and survey control monuments shall be set and in place
at the time the plat is recorded. An exception to this requirement may be

§ 152.085 PAYMENT FOR INSTALLATION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   All public improvements for new subdivisions shall be furnished and
installed at the sole expense of the developer. If any improvement installed
within the subdivision will be of substantial benefit to lands beyond the
boundaries of the subdivision, provision may be made for causing a portion of
the cost of the improvement (representing the benefit to such lands) to be
allocated in accordance with city policies and shall be outlined in the
development agreement.
   (A)   Prior to installation of any required improvements by the developer
and prior to recording of the final plat, the developer shall enter into a

guarantees to the city related to performance, and/or for installation of
public improvements, and/or developer to install improvements.
      (1)   The developer shall furnish and construct improvements at their

contract conditions. This shall include provision for supervision of details of
construction by the City Engineer and shall grant to the City Engineer
authority to coordinate the work and improvements to be done under said
development contract by any subcontractor authorized to proceed thereunder and
with any other work being done or contracted by the city in the vicinity. The

installation requirements to be met and shall be approved by the City Engineer.
      (2)   The agreement shall require the applicant to make an escrow deposit
or furnish an irrevocable letter of credit or certified check determined by the
city. The amount of the deposit or security is to be based on the City
Engineer’s estimate of the total cost of the improvements to be furnished under
the contract, including the cost of inspection. The deposit amount shall be
equal to 125% of the Engineer’s estimate.
      (3)   On request of the applicant, but at the sole discretion of the
city, the contract may provide for completion of part or all of the
improvements covered thereby prior to acceptance of the plat. In such event,

paid for, the amount of the deposit may be reduced in a sum equal to the
estimated cost of the improvements so completed prior to the acceptance of the
plat.
      (4)   Guaranteed completion of the required improvements undertaken by
the developer as approved by the city within a specified time after
commencement of any construction in the subdivision, or the portion thereof

period of time in which the improvements must be installed.
      (5)   If the required improvements are not completed within the specified
time period or a period approved by the City Council as hereinabove provided,
all financial securities shall be turned over to the city and applied toward
the cost of the required improvements. Any balance after the improvements have
been made shall be returned to the developer upon written request.
      (6)   No developer shall be permitted to start work on any other
subdivision improvements without special written approval of the City Council.

constitute a subdivision to which this chapter applies shall attach to the
instrument of conveyance either:
      (1)   A recordable certification by the City Clerk that this chapter does

      (9)   Presentation of application. The applicant or a representative of
the applicant shall appear before the Planning Commission in order to present
the case for the application and to answer questions concerning the request.
Failure of the proponent to appear at either the Planning Commission or City
Council, consideration of the matter may constitute grounds for rejection of
the application. The City Council may require sworn testimony and a verified
transcription of the proceedings at the expense of the city. The applicant
shall have the same privilege of presenting sworn testimony and may provide for
a transcript of the proceedings at the expense of the applicant.
      (10)   Recommendations of Planning Commission. The Planning Commission
shall recommend such actions or conditions relating to the application as
deemed necessary or desirable to carry out the intent and purpose of this
chapter and the comprehensive plan. Such recommendation shall be either in the
minutes or by written resolution and forwarded to the City Council.
      (11)   Record before City Council. The Zoning Administrator shall place
the report and recommendation of the Planning Commission and the city staff on
the agenda for the next regular City Council meeting after Planning Commission

Such reports and recommendations shall be entered in and made part of the
permanent written record of the City Council meeting.
      (12)   City Council review. Subject to the limitations of M.S. § 15.99,
the City Council shall act upon an application after it has received the report
and recommendation from the Planning Commission. If, upon receiving the reports
and recommendations of the Planning Commission and Zoning Administrator, the
City Council desires further consideration, or finds that inconsistencies exist
in the review process, data submitted or recommended action, the City Council
may, before taking final action, refer the matter back to the Planning
Commission with a statement detailing the reasons for referral.
      (13)   City Council action. Upon receiving the request and any report and
recommendations of the Planning Commission and the city staff, the City Council
shall have the option to set and hold a public hearing if deemed necessary and
shall make recorded findings of fact.
         (a)   The City Council may adopt and amend a zoning ordinance by a
majority vote of all its members. The adoption or amendment of any portion of a
zoning ordinance which changes all or part of the existing classification of a
zoning district from residential to either commercial or industrial requires a
two-thirds majority vote of the City Council.
         (b)   In the case of a conditional use permit, the Council may impose
any condition it considers necessary to protect the public health, safety, and
welfare.
         (c)   In the case of an amendment, the amendment shall not become
effective until such time as the City Council approves an ordinance or code
provision reflecting the amendment and after the ordinance or code provision is
published in the official newspaper.
      (14)   Notice to applicant. The Zoning Administrator shall notify the
applicant of the decision of the City Council in writing, including any
relevant resolution and findings which may have been passed by the City
Council.
      (15)   Filing of notice of action. A certified copy of any zoning
ordinance amendment, conditional use permit, interim use permit, or variance
authorized shall be filed with the Le Sueur County Recorder.
      (16)   Reconsideration. Whenever an application for an amendment or
conditional use permit has been considered and denied by the City Council, a
similar application for the amendment or conditional use permit affecting
substantially the same property shall not be considered again by the Planning
Commission or City Council for at least six months from the date of its denial;
and a subsequent application affecting substantially the same property shall
likewise not be considered again by the Planning Commission or City Council for
an additional six months from the date of the second denial unless a decision
to reconsider such matter is made by not less than four-fifths vote of the full
City Council.
   (D)   Expiration of zoning approvals.
      (1)   Unless otherwise specified by the City Council at the time it is
authorized, a conditional use permit, interim use permit, or variance shall be
null and void and expire if the applicant fails to implement such approvals and
fulfill each and every condition attached thereto within one year from the date
of its authorization unless a petition for an extension of time in which to
implement the approved plans has been granted by the Zoning Administrator
provided that:
         (a)   The extension is requested in writing and filed with the city at
least 30 days prior to the expiration of the initial request;
         (b)   The request for extension states facts demonstrating that a good
faith attempt has been made to complete or utilize the use or activity
permitted in the approval;
         (c)   A maximum of one administrative extension shall be granted;
         (d)   The extension shall not exceed six months from the initial
expiration date; and

provided that:
         (a)   The conditions described in divisions (1)(a) through (1)(c)
above are satisfied;
         (b)   The extension shall not exceed one additional year; and
         (c)   The filing of a petition for extension is subject to fee
requirements established by the city's fee schedule.
   (E)   Performance agreement. Upon approval of a conditional use permit,
interim use permit, variance, permit with zoning requirements, or other such
action authorized by this chapter, the city may require the applicant to enter
into a performance agreement prior to the issuing of building permits or
initiation of work on the proposed improvement or development. Said agreement
shall guarantee conformance and compliance with the conditions of the approval
and the codes of the city. The performance agreement shall be prepared and
approved by the City Attorney and shall contain, but not be limited to, the
following items and conditions:
      (1)   Performance security. The performance agreement shall require the
applicant to provide financial security to assure compliance with the agreement
and conditions of the approval. The security may be in the form of a surety
bond, cash escrow, certificate of deposit, irrevocable letter of credit,
securities or cash deposit. The security shall be in an amount determined by
the City Engineer or Building Official under the direction of and approved by
the Council, to cover estimated costs of labor and materials for the proposed
improvements or development. The project can be handled in stages with prior
approval of the city.
      (2)   Security release. The city shall hold the security until completion
of the proposed improvements or development and a certificate of occupancy
indicating compliance with the application approval and building code of the
city has been issued by the city Building Official.
      (3)   Security forfeiture. Failure to comply with the conditions of the
application approval and/or the ordinances of the city shall result in
forfeiture of the security.
      (4)   Hold harmless and indemnification of city. The applicant shall
agree to indemnify and hold harmless the city and its agents and employees
against any and all claims, demands, losses, damages and expenses (including
attorney fees) arising out of or resulting from the applicant's negligent or
intentional acts, violation of any safety law, and regulation or any code in
the performance of this agreement, without regard to any inspection or review
made or not made by the city, its agents or employees or failure to take any
other prudent precaution. In the event any city employee, agent or
representative shall come under the direct or indirect control of the
applicant, or the city, upon failure of the applicant to comply with any
conditions of the approval, performs said conditions pursuant to the bond, the
applicant shall indemnify and hold harmless the city, its employees, agents and
representatives for its own negligent or intentional acts in the performance of
the applicant's required work under the permit.
      (5)   Fees. The applicant shall agree to pay any and all attorney and
consultant fees incurred by the city to enforce the terms and conditions of any
application approval or provisions of any performance agreement relating to
said permits.
   (F)   Cost recovery.
      (1)   Purpose. The costs of the city for receiving, analyzing,
processing, hearing and final process for requests of changes, modification, or
special consideration under this chapter, such as requests for amendments (map
or text), site and building plan reviews, conditional use permits, interim use
permits, and variances are considered to be unique to the applicant requesting
such consideration, and it is the intent of this section to provide that all
costs of the city occasioned by such requests shall be borne by the applicant.
The reimbursement to the city shall be limited to actual costs of the city.
Actual costs shall include all engineering, legal, planning, or other
consultant fees or costs paid by the city for other consultants for expert
review of a development application.
      (2)   Base zoning fee. Each applicant shall pay a non-refundable base
zoning fee at the time an application is presented to the city for a zoning
change of any nature, site and building plan review, a conditional use, an
interim use, or a variance. This fee is intended to reimburse the city for its
costs for administrative processing a development application. If this fee
proves to be insufficient to cover such costs, such additional costs will be
charged as a part of the zoning deposit, or the supplemental zoning deposit.
      (3)   Escrow deposit. In addition to the non-refundable base zoning fee,
each applicant shall pay an escrow deposit in an amount established by City
Council on the fee schedule at the time of application. All actual costs
including, but not limited to, planning, engineering, legal, or other
consultant fees or costs, incurred by the city in the processing of the
application shall be paid from or reimbursed to the city, from the escrow
deposit. Actual costs not fully paid or reimbursed from the base zoning fee
shall be paid or reimbursed from this escrow or supplemental deposit.
      (4)   Supplemental deposit. At any time while the application is pending
and before its final conclusion, if the Zoning Administrator determines that
the amount of the escrow deposit is or is estimated to be insufficient to pay
for present or anticipated actual costs of the application, a supplementary
deposit shall be required by the Zoning Administrator to be paid by the
applicant. The one or more supplemental deposits shall be in an amount
sufficient to pay all actual costs of the city.
      (5)   Refunds, administrative costs. The base zoning fee, intended to
cover administrative costs, is non-refundable.
      (6)   Refunds, direct costs. If the direct costs of the city in
processing the application are less than the amount of the escrow deposit and
any supplemental deposit, any such unexpended amount shall be refunded to the
applicant upon the conclusion of the proceedings, and any such costs in excess
of the supplemental deposits on hand with the city shall be paid by the
applicant prior to completion of the proceedings by the city.

§ 153.021 APPEALS AND THE BOARD OF ZONING ADJUSTMENTS.
   The City Council, serving as the Board of Appeals and Adjustments, shall,
after receiving the written report of the Zoning Administrator, make findings
of fact and make a decision on appeals where it is alleged by the appellant
that error has occurred in any order, interpretation requirement, decision or
determination made by any administrative office or the Zoning Administrator in
the enforcement of this chapter. However, said appeal shall be filed not later
than 60 days after the applicant has received a written order from the city or
the appeal shall be void

§ 153.023 CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of a conditional use permit is to provide the
city with a reasonable degree of discretion in determining the suitability of
certain designated uses upon the general welfare, public health and safety. A
conditional use is a use which because of certain characteristics cannot be
properly classified as a permitted use in the zoning district within which it
is proposed. Conditional use permits are designed to meet the problem which
arises where certain uses, although generally compatible with the basic use
classification of a particular zone, should not be permitted to be located as a
matter of right in every area included within the zone because of hazards
inherent in the use itself or special problems which its proposed location may
present. In making this determination, whether or not the conditional use is to
be allowed, the city may consider the nature of the adjoining land or
buildings, the effect upon traffic into and from the premises, or on any
adjoining streets, and all other or further factors as the city shall deem a
prerequisite of consideration in determining the effect of the use on the
general welfare, public health and safety.
   (B)   Procedure. An application for a conditional use permit requires a
public hearing and is to be processed in accordance with the procedures
outlined in §
150.20 of this chapter.
   (C)   Application requirements. The information required for all conditional
use permit applications generally consists of the following items and shall be

         (d)   Vehicular circulation;
         (e)   Architectural elevations (type and materials used in all
external surfaces);
         (f)   The location and candle power of all luminaries; and
         (g)   Curb cuts, driveways, and number of parking spaces.
      (2)   Dimension plan. A dimension plan, which shall include:
         (a)   Lot dimensions and area;
         (b)   Dimensions of proposed and existing structures;
         (c)   Building floor plan;
         (d)   Setbacks of all buildings located on the property in question;

         (e)   Spot elevations; and
         (f)   A proposed road profile.
      (4)   Landscape plan. A landscape plan, which shall include;
         (a)   The location of all existing trees, their type and diameter, and
which trees will be removed;
         (b)   The location, type, and diameter of all proposed plantings; and
         (c)   The location of and material used for all screening devices.
      (5)   A legal description of the property under consideration.
      (6)   Proof of ownership of the land for which a conditional use permit
is requested.
   (D)   Criteria. The Planning Commission and City Council shall consider
possible effects of the proposed conditional use. Its judgment shall be based
upon, but not limited to, the following factors:
      (1)   The proposed action has been considered in relation to the specific
policies and provisions of and has been found to be consistent with the
comprehensive plan;
      (2)   The proposed use is or will be compatible with present and future
land uses of the area;
      (3)   The proposed use conforms with all performance standards contained
in this chapter;
      (4)   The proposed use can be accommodated with existing public services
and will not overburden the city's service capacity; and
      (5)   Traffic generation by the proposed use is within capabilities of
streets serving the property.
   (E)   Additional conditions. In permitting a new conditional use or in the
event of the modification of an existing conditional use, the City Council may
impose, in addition to the standards and requirements expressly specified by
this chapter, additional conditions which the City Council considers necessary

in the conditional use permit.
   (F)   Revocation. The Planning Commission may recommend, and the City
Council may direct, the revocation of any conditional use permit for cause upon
determination that the authorized conditional use is not in conformance with
the conditions of the permit or is in continued violation of this chapter, city
codes, or other applicable regulations. The City Council or Planning Commission
shall initiate an application and the Zoning Administrator shall notify the
responsible person that they have an opportunity to show cause why the permit
should not be revoked. The revocation shall be processed and considered
pursuant to §
153.020(C) of this chapter. The Zoning Administrator shall provide the
responsible person a copy of the proceedings and findings of the Planning
Commission and City Council.
   (G)   Permit modifications. Conditional use permits must be maintained
consistent with the terms of their approval. Modifications and amendments shall
be processed and reviewed consistent with the terms of this chapter.
   (H)   Abandonment. In the event the conditional use is discontinued, the

2019)
§ 153.024 INTERIM USE PERMITS.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose and intent of allowing interim uses is:
      (1)   To allow a use for a temporary period of time until a permanent
location is obtained or while the permanent location is under construction;
      (2)   To allow a use that is presently judged acceptable by the City
Council, but that with anticipated development or redevelopment, will not be
acceptable in the future or will be replaced in the future by a permitted or
conditional use allowed within the respective district; and
      (3)   To allow a use which is reflective of anticipated long-range change
to an area and which is in compliance with the comprehensive plan provided that
said use maintains harmony and compatibility with surrounding uses and is in
keeping with the architectural character and design standards of existing uses
and development.
   (B)   Application, submission requirements, and procedure. The application,
public hearing, public notice, and procedure requirements for an interim use
permit shall be the same as those for a conditional use permit as provided in
this chapter.
   (C)   Criteria. The Planning Commission and City Council shall consider
possible effects of the proposed interim use. Its judgment shall be based upon,
but not limited to, the factors outlined in §
153.023 of this chapter.
   (D)   General performance standards. As may be applicable, the evaluation of
any proposed interim use permit request shall be subject to and include, but
not be limited to, the general performance standards and criteria outlined in
this chapter, and:
      (1)   The date or event that will terminate the use can be identified
with certainty;
      (2)   The use will not impose additional unreasonable costs on the
public;
      (3)   The user agrees, in writing, to any conditions that the City

shall lapse by non-use one year after notice from the city.
(Ord. 583, passed 8-26-2019)
§ 153.025 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of a variance is to provide for deviations from
the literal provisions of this chapter in instances where their strict
enforcement would cause practical difficulties because of circumstances unique
to the individual property under consideration, and to grant such variances
only when it is demonstrated that such actions will be in keeping with the
spirit and intent of this chapter.
   (B)   Procedures. An application for variance from the provisions of this
chapter requires a public hearing and is to be processed in accordance with the
procedures set forth in §
153.020.
   (C)   Board of Adjustment and Appeals. The City Council shall act as the
Board of Adjustment and Appeals.
   (D)   Criteria. The Board of Adjustment and Appeals shall not approve any
variance request unless they find all of the following criteria have been met:
      (1)   A variance shall only be granted when it is in harmony with the
general purposes and intent of the ordinance.
      (2)   A variance shall only be granted when it is consistent with the
comprehensive plan.
      (3)   A variance may be granted when the applicant for the variance
establishes that there are practical difficulties in complying with the zoning
ordinance. Economic considerations alone do not constitute a practical
difficulty. In order for a practical difficulty to be established, all of the
following criteria shall be met:
         (a)   The property owner proposes to use the property in a reasonable
manner. In determining if the property owner proposes to use the property in a
reasonable manner, the board shall consider, among other factors, whether the
variance requested is the minimum variance which would alleviate the practical
difficulty and whether the variance confers upon the applicant any special
privileges that are denied to the owners of other lands, structures, or
buildings in the same district;
         (b)   The plight of the landowner is due to circumstances unique to
the property not created by the landowner; and
         (c)   That the granting of the variance will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood in which the parcel of land is located.
      (4)   The variance does not involve a use that is not allowed within the
respective zoning district.
   (E)   Conditions. The Board of Adjustment and Appeals may impose conditions
in the granting of variances. A condition must be directly related to and must
bear a rough proportionality to the impact created by the variance.
   (F)   Application requirements. In addition to any other requirements
outlined in the city code and this chapter, site and construction plans shall
be required and shall be submitted to and subject to approval by the Building
Official prior to the issuance of any building permit. The applicant shall file
with the Zoning Administrator a completed application form which shall contain
all necessary exhibits including, but not limited to:
      (1)   Site development plan. A site development plan, which shall
include:
         (a)   A certified survey of the property in question.
         (b)   The location and design of all buildings on lots, including both
existing and proposed structures;
         (c)   The location of all adjacent buildings located within 200 feet
of the exterior boundaries of the property in question;
         (d)   The location and number of existing and proposed parking spaces;
         (e)   Vehicular circulation;
         (f)   Architectural elevations (type and materials used in all
external surfaces);
         (g)   Photometric plan, including the location and candle power of all
luminaries; and
         (h)   Curb cuts, driveways, and number of parking spaces.
      (2)   Dimension plan. A dimension plan, which shall include:
         (a)   Lot dimensions and area;
         (b)   Dimensions of proposed and existing structures;
         (c)   A "typical" floor plan and a "typical" room plan;
         (d)   Setbacks of all buildings located on the property;
         (e)   Proposed setbacks; and
         (f)   A sanitary sewer and water plan with estimated use per day.
      (3)   Grading plan. A grading plan, which shall include:
         (a)   Existing contours;
         (b)   Proposed grading elevations;
         (c)   Drainage configurations;
         (d)   Storm sewer catch basins and invert elevations;
         (e)   Spot elevations; and
         (f)   A proposed road profile.
      (4)   Landscape plan. A landscape plan, which shall include:
         (a)   The location of all existing trees, their type and diameter, and
which trees will be removed;
         (b)   The location, type, and diameter of all proposed plantings; and
         (c)   The location of and material used for all screening devices.

(Ord. 583, passed 8-26-2019)
§ 153.027 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS.
   (A)   Purpose. This section is established to provide comprehensive
procedures and standards to allow for the mixing of uses and flexibility from
the general performance standards to allow for more innovative and efficient
design for the development of neighborhoods or areas. The Planned Unit
Development (PUD) process, by allowing flexibility from the strict provisions
of this chapter related to setbacks, heights, lot area, width, depth, yards,
and other equivalent performance standards by rezoning to a PUD District (or as
a conditional use when applicable), is intended to encourage:
      (1)   Innovations in development to the end that the growing demands for
all styles of economic expansion may be met by greater variety in type, design,
and sighting of structures and by the conservation and more efficient use of
land in such developments;
      (2)   Higher standards of site and building design through the use of
trained and experienced land planners, architects and landscape architects;
      (3)   More convenience in location and design of development and service
facilities;
      (4)   The preservation and enhancement of desirable site characteristics
such as existing vegetation, natural topography and geologic features and the
prevention of soil erosion;
      (5)   A creative use of land and related physical development which
allows a phased and orderly transition of land from one activity to another;
      (6)   An efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities
and streets thereby lowering development costs and public investments;
      (7)   A development pattern in harmony with the objectives of the
comprehensive plan. (PUD is not intended as a means to vary applicable planning
and zoning principals);
      (8)   A more desirable and creative environment than might be possible
through the strict application on zoning and subdivision regulations of the
city; and
      (9)   That the flexibilities granted through the PUD process for the
development produce a clear and identified benefit to the city that would not
have been achievable following the standard zoning procedure.
   (B)   General requirements and standards.
      (1)   Ownership. An application for PUD must be filed by the landowner or
jointly by all landowners of the property included in a project. The
application and all submissions must be directed to the development of the
property as a unified whole. In the case of multiple ownership, the approved
final plan shall be binding on all owners.
      (2)   Comprehensive plan consistency. The proposed PUD shall be
consistent with the city's comprehensive plan.
      (3)   Compatibility. The proposed PUD shall be compatible with the
adjacent land uses.
      (4)   Common open space. Common open space at least sufficient to meet
the minimum requirements established in the comprehensive plan and such
complementary structures and improvements as are necessary and appropriate for
the benefit and enjoyment of the residents/users of the PUD shall be provided
within the area of the PUD development.
      (5)   Operating and maintenance requirements for PUD common open space/
facilities. Whenever common open space or service facilities are provided
within the PUD, the PUD plan shall contain provisions to assure the continued
operation and maintenance of such open space and service facilities to a pre-
determined reasonable standard. Common open space and service facilities within
a PUD may be placed under the ownership of one or more of the following, as
approved by the city:
         (a)   Dedicated to public, where a community-wide use is anticipated,
and the city agrees to accept the dedication;
         (b)   Property owner control, where only use by tenants is
anticipated; and
         (c)   Property Owners Association, provided all of the following
conditions are met:
            1.   Prior to the use or occupancy or sale or the execution of
contracts for sale of an individual building unit, parcel, tracts or common
area, a declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions or an equivalent
document or document such as specified by M.S. Chapter 515 and other applicable
laws of the State of Minnesota shall be filed with the city, said filing with
the city to be made prior to the filings of said declaration or document or
floor plans with the recording officers of the county.
            2.   The declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions or
equivalent document shall specify that deeds, leases or documents of conveyance
affecting buildings, units, parcels, tracts, townhouses or apartments shall
subject said properties to the terms of said declaration.
            3.   The declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions
shall provide that an owner's association or corporation shall be formed and
that all owners shall be members of said association or corporation which shall
maintain all properties and common areas in good repair and which shall assess
individual property owner's proportionate shares of joint or common costs. This
declaration shall be subject to the review and approval of the City Attorney.
The intent of this requirement is to protect the property values of the
individual owner through establishing private control.
            4.   The declaration shall additionally, amongst other things,
provide that in the event the association or corporation fails to maintain
properties in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the city
or fails to pay taxes or assessments on properties as they become due and in
the event the city incurs any expenses in enforcing its rules and regulations,
which said expenses are not immediately reimbursed by the association or
corporation, then the city shall have the right to assess each property its
prorate share of said expenses. Such assessments, together with interest
thereon and costs of collection, shall be a lien on each property against which
each such assessment is made.
            5.   Membership must be mandatory for each owner and all successors
or assigns.
            6.   The open space restrictions must be permanent and not for a
given period of years.
            7.   The Association must be responsible for liability insurance,
local taxes, and the maintenance of the open space facilities to be deeded to
it.
            8.   Property owners must pay a prorate share of the cost of the
Association by means of an assessment to be levied by the Association which
meets the requirements for becoming a lien on the property in accordance with
Minnesota Statutes.
            9.   The Association must be able to adjust the assessment to meet
changed needs.
            10.   The by-laws and rules of the Association and all covenants
and restrictions to be recorded must be approved by the City Council prior to
the approval of the final PUD plan.
      (6)   Staging of public and common open space. When a PUD provides for
common or public open space, and is planned as a staged development over a
period of time, the total area of common or public open space or land escrow
security in any stage of development shall, at a minimum, bear the same
relationship to the total open space to be provided in the entire PUD as the
stages or units completed or under development bear to the entire PUD.
      (7)   Density. The maximum allowable density in a PUD zoning district
shall be determined by standards negotiated and agreed upon between the
applicant and the city. In all cases, the negotiated standards shall be
consistent with the development policies as contained in the comprehensive
plan. A PUD by conditional use permit must comply with the applicable base
zoning district.
      (8)   Utilities. In any PUD, all utilities, including but not limited to
fiber, telephone, electricity, gas and cable shall be installed underground,
unless approved specifically by the City Council.
      (9)   Utility connections. The following requirements must be met with
regards to utility connections.
         (a)   Water connections. Where more than one property is served from
the same service line, individual unit shut off valves shall be provided as
required by the city.
         (b)   Sewer connections. Where more than one unit is served by a
sanitary sewer lateral which exceeds 300 feet in length or other dimension as
required by the City Engineer, provision must be made for a manhole to allow
adequate cleaning and maintenance of the lateral. All maintenance and cleaning
shall be the responsibility of the Property Owner's Association or owner.
      (10)   Roadways. All streets, whether private or public, shall conform to
the design standards contained in the subdivision chapter of the city code,
unless otherwise approved by the city. In no case shall streets be designed to
support less than a seven-ton weight capacity. In staged residential PUDs, no
stage shall proceed which results in access to external public roadways in more
than 75 residential units per access road.
      (11)   Landscaping. In any PUD, landscaping shall be provided according
to a plan approved by the city, which shall include a detailed planting list
with sizes and species indicated as part of the final plan. In assessing the
landscaping plan, the city shall consider the natural features of the
particular site, the need to buffer the use from adjoining land uses, the
objectives of providing a pleasant usable open space environment, the
architectural characteristics of the proposed structures and the overall scheme
of the PUD plan.
      (12)   Urban servicing requirements. All development shall be carefully
phased so as to ensure that all developable land will be accorded a present
vested right to develop at such time as services and facilities are available.
Lands which have the necessary available municipal facilities and services may
be granted approval in accordance with existing city code provisions and
development techniques.
      (13)   Setbacks. No residential garage face shall be located less than 20
feet from the back of the curb line along those roadways that are part of an
internal street pattern.
   (C)   Submission requirements. A minimum of one digital copy, three large
scale copies and six reduced scale (not less than 11" x 17") copies of the
following exhibits, analysis and plans shall be submitted to the city during
the PUD process, at the times specified in §

   (D)   Procedure for processing a planned unit development.
      (1)   Application conference. Prior to filing of an application for PUD,
the applicant of the proposed PUD is encouraged to arrange for and attend a
conference with the Zoning Administrator. The primary purpose of the conference
shall be to provide the applicant with an opportunity to gather information and
obtain guidance as to the general suitability of the proposal for the area for
which it is proposed and its conformity to the provisions of this section
before incurring substantial expense in the preparation of plans, surveys and
other data.
      (2)   General concept plan.
         (a)   Purpose. The general concept plan provides an elective
opportunity for the applicant to submit a plan to the city showing the basic
intent and the general nature of the entire development without incurring
substantial cost. A concept plan is recommended but not required and is not
part of the formal PUD application. The following elements of the proposed
general concept plan represents the immediately significant elements for city
review and comment:
            1.   Overall maximum PUD density/intensity range;
            2.   General location of major streets and pedestrian ways;
            3.   General location and extent of public and common open space;
            4.   General location of residential and non-residential land uses
with approximate type and intensities of development;
            5.   General architectural design and features of buildings;
            6.   Narrative generally describing the project and flexibilities
from standard sought;
            7.   Staging and time schedule of development; and
            8.   Other special criteria for development.
         (b)   Schedule.
            1.   The applicant shall file the concept stage request, together
with all supporting data and filing fee as established by City Council
resolution.
            2.   Within 15 business days after verification by the city that
the request and required supportive material is completed and adequate, the
Zoning Administrator shall schedule the concept plan for review and comment by
the Planning Commission and City Council at the next available meetings.
Concept review is not a formal public hearing, and city may choose to notify
neighboring property owners of the consideration of said review but shall not
be required to do so.
         (c)   Effect of concept plan consideration. Concept plan consideration
is advisory and non- binding. The concept plan review provides an opportunity
for the applicant to receive city review and feedback to informal preliminary
concepts and is only intended to guide the applicant's preparation of
development stage PUD plans.
      (3)   Development stage.
         (a)   Purpose. The purpose of the development stage plan is to provide
a specific and particular plan upon which the Planning Commission will base its
recommendation to the Council and with which substantial compliance is
necessary for the preparation of the final plan.
         (b)   Submission of development stage. The applicant shall file with
the city a development stage PUD plan consisting of the information and
submissions required by this chapter for the entire PUD.
         (c)   Review and action by city staff and Planning Commission.
Immediately upon receipt of a completed development stage plan, said plan shall
be referred to the following city staff and/or official bodies for the
indicated action:
            1.   The City Attorney for legal review of all documents;
            2.   The City Engineer for review of all engineering data and the
City/Developer Agreement;
            3.   The Building Official for review of all building plans;
            4.   The Zoning Administrator or designated agent for review of all
plans for compliance with the intent, purpose and requirements of this chapter
and conformity with the general concept plan and comprehensive plan;
            5.   The Planning Commission for review and recommendation to the
Council; and
            6.   When appropriate, as determined by the Zoning Administrator to
other special review agencies and governmental jurisdictions.
         (d)   PUD enactment. Final approval of a PUD conditional use permit or
PUD zoning district map amendment shall be considered granted only at the time
of development stage plan approval by the City Council.
         (e)   Limitation on development stage plan approval. Unless a final
plan covering the area designated in the development stage plan as the first
stage of the PUD has been filed within one year from the date City Council
grants development stage plan approval, or in any case where the applicant
fails to file final plans and to proceed with development in accordance with
the provisions of this chapter and/or an approved development stage plan, the
approval shall be null and void and shall expire. Upon application by the
applicant, the City Council, at its discretion, may extend for not more than
one year, the filing deadline for any final plan when, for good cause shown,
such extension is necessary.
         (f)   Site improvements. At any time following the approval of a
development stage plan by the City Council, and completion and execution of a
PUD agreement governing the project, the applicant may, pursuant to the
applicable city code provisions apply for, and the city may issue, grading
permits for the area within the PUD for which development stage plan approval
has been given. Securities as appropriate may be required of the applicant.
      (4)   Final plan.
         (a)   Purpose. The final plan is to serve as a complete, thorough and
permanent public record of the PUD and the manner in which it is to be
developed. It shall incorporate all prior approved plans and all approved
modifications thereof resulting from the PUD process. It shall serve in
conjunction with other city code provisions as the land use regulation
application to the PUD. The final plan is intended only to add detail to, and
to put in final form, the information contained in the development stage plan
and shall conform to the development stage plan in all respects.
         (b)   Schedule.
            1.   Upon approval of the development stage plan, the applicant
shall file with the city a final plan consisting of the information and
submissions required in this section for the entire PUD or for one or more
stages. This plan will be reviewed and approved or denied by city staff,
subject to appeal.
            2.   Within 30 days of its approval, the applicant shall cause the
final plan, or such portions thereof as are appropriate, to be recorded with
the County Recorder. The applicant shall provide the city with a signed copy
verifying county recording within 40 days of the date of approval or the
approval shall be null and void.
         (c)   Building and other permits. Except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, upon receiving notice from the city that the approved final
plan has been recorded and upon application of the applicant pursuant to the
applicable city code provisions, the city may issue building and other permits
to the applicant for development, construction and other work in the area
encompassed by the approved final plan provided, however, that no such permit
shall be issued unless the city is first satisfied that the requirements of all
codes and city code provisions in which are applicable to the permit sought,
have been met.
         (d)   Limitation of final plan approval. Within one year after the
approval of a final plan for PUD, or such shorter time as may be established by
the approved development schedule, construction shall commence in accordance
with such approved plan. Failure to commence construction within such period
shall, unless an extension shall have been granted as hereinafter provided,
automatically render void the PUD and all approvals of the PUD plan and the
area encompassed within the PUD shall thereafter be subject to those provisions
of this chapter, and other city code provisions, applicable in the district in
which it is located. In such cases, the Council shall forthwith adopt an
ordinance repealing the PUD and all PUD approvals and re-establishing the
zoning and other city code provisions that would otherwise be applicable. The
time limit established may, at the discretion of the Council, be extended for
not more than one year.
         (e)   Inspections during development.
            1.   Compliance with overall plan. Following final plan approval of
a PUD, or a stage thereof, the city shall, at least annually until the
completion of the development, review all permits issued and construction
undertaken and compare actual development with the approved development
schedule.
            2.   If the city finds that development is not proceeding in
accordance with the approved schedule, or that it fails in any other respect to
comply with the PUD plans as finally approved, the city shall either by
ordinance revoke the PUD, and the land shall thereafter be governed by the
regulations applicable in the district in which it is located; or shall take
such steps as it shall deem necessary to compel compliance with the final plans
as approved; or shall require the landowner or applicant to seek an amendment
to the final plan.
   (E)   PUD progress evaluation. If periodic review of a PUD project is
included as a condition to the approval of a PUD, such a project shall be
reviewed by the City Council. The Council may, at its discretion, call a public
hearing as part of its review.
   (F)   Amendment of a PUD.
      (1)   Application procedures. Any substantive deviation or modification
in size, extent, density, or other element from the terms or conditions of an
approved PUD or any alteration in a project for which a PUD has been approved
shall require an amendment of the original development stage plan. The same
application and hearing procedure for an amendment of a PUD shall be followed
as was followed with respect to the applicant's initial request. The Zoning
Administrator may waive the requirement for an amendment where a change is
minor in extent, will have no impact on neighboring properties or public
services and roads, and which does not constitute an expansion of the density
or uses originally approved by the City Council.
      (2)   Action by the Planning Commission and City Council. The same review
procedure by the Planning Commission and City Council shall be followed for an
amendment of a PUD permit as was followed with respect to the applicant's
initial request.
   (G)   General requirements.
      (1)   Records. The Zoning Administrator shall maintain a record of all
PUDs including information on a project's permitted uses, all pertinent project
plans, any conditions imposed on a project by the City Council, and such other
information as the Zoning Administrator may deem appropriate.
      (2)   Withdrawal of an application. Any application under this section
may be withdrawn by an applicant without prejudice at any time prior to final
City Council action thereon.
      (3)   Financial security to assure compliance. In order to insure that
all improvements contained in a PUD are completed in accordance with said plan
and to insure that an applicant fully complies with all conditions of a PUD
permit, the applicant may be required to post a letter of credit guaranteeing
the faithful performance of such work and compliance with such conditions. Such
security shall be in a form satisfactory to the city, shall be in an amount
established by the City Council, and shall cover each segment or each phase of
a PUD project. The amount of said security may be reduced or a portion of said
bond may be released as specific segments of each phase of development have
been completed, upon approval by the City Council.
      (4)   Conveyance of property within a PUD project. In the event that any
real property within an approved PUD project is conveyed in total or in part,
the buyer(s) thereof shall be bound by all provisions of the PUD permit and the
plan of development for that project. However, nothing in this chapter shall be
construed as to make such conveyed property non-conforming with regard to
normal zoning standards as long as the conveyed property conforms with the
approved PUD permit and the plan of development for a project.
   (H)   PUD by conditional use. Commercial and industrial planned unit
developments may be approved as a conditional use permit in all commercial and
industrial zoning districts provided the only flexibilities being granted are
from performance standards applicable in the underlying zoning district or to
allow for the placement of more than one principal structure on a lot.
(Ord. 583, passed 8-26-2019)

§ 153.047 STORM WATER MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   Findings. The city hereby finds that uncontrolled and inadequately
planned use of wetlands, woodlands, natural habitat areas, areas subject to
soil erosion and areas containing restrictive soils adversely affects the
public health, safety and general welfare by impacting water quality and
contributing to other environmental problems, creating nuisances, impairing
other beneficial uses of environmental resources and hindering the ability of
the city to provide adequate water, sewage, flood control and other community
services. In addition, extraordinary public expenditures may be required for
the protection of persons and property in the area and in areas which may be
affected by unplanned land usage.
   (B)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to promote, preserve and
enhance the natural resources within the city and protect them from adverse
effects occasioned by poorly sited development or incompatible activities by
regulating land disturbing or development activities that would have an adverse
and potentially irreversible impact on water quality and unique and fragile
environmentally sensitive land; by minimizing conflicts and encouraging
compatibility between land disturbing and development activities and water
quality and environmentally sensitive lands; and by requiring detailed review
standards and procedures for land disturbing or development activities proposed
for those areas, thereby achieving a balance between urban growth and
development and protection of water quality and natural areas.
   (C)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      APPLICANT. Any person who wishes to obtain a building permit or zoning or
subdivision approval.
      CONTROL MEASURE. A practice or combination of practices to control
erosion and attendant pollution.

been or may be covered by a regional flood.
      FLOODWAY. The channel of the watercourse, the bed of water basins and
those portions of the adjoining flood plains that are reasonably required to
carry and discharge floodwater and provide water storage during a regional
flood.
      HYDRIC SOILS. Soils that are saturated, flooded or ponded long enough
during the growing season to develop anaerobic conditions in the upper part.
      HYDROPHYTIC VEGETATION. Macrophytic plant life growing in water, soil or
on a substrate that is at least periodically deficient in oxygen as a result of
excessive water content.
      LAND DISTURBING OR DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. Any change of the land surface
including removing vegetative cover, excavating, filling, grading and the
construction of any structure.
      PUBLIC WATERS. Waters of the state as defined in M.S. § 103G.005,
Subdivision 15, as it may be amended from time to time.
      REGIONAL FLOOD. A flood that is representative of large floods known to
have occurred generally in the state and reasonably characteristic of what can
be expected to occur on an average frequency in the magnitude of a 100-year
recurrence interval.

   (F)   Plan review procedure.
      (1)   Process.
         (a)   Storm water management plans meeting the requirements of
division (E) above shall be submitted to the Zoning Administrator for review in
accordance with the standards of division (G) below. In cases where the plan is
reviewed independently of other applications, the Zoning Administrator shall
review the plan in accordance with the process outlined in §
153.026.
         (b)   In the event that the applicant receives a decision from the
Zoning Administrator denying the application for approval of the storm water
management plan, the applicant, if the applicant so desires, may appeal the
decision to the Board of Zoning Adjustments as more specifically set forth in §
153.021. If the Board of Zoning Adjustments affirms the Zoning Administrator's
decision to deny the application for the applicant's storm water management
plan, the applicant may further appeal the decision of the Board of Zoning
Adjustments to the District Court, subject to the provisions of M.S. § 462.361,
as it may be amended from time to time.
      (2)   Duration. Approval of a plan submitted under the provisions of this
section shall expire one year after the date of approval unless construction
has commenced in accordance with the plan. However, if prior to the expiration
of the approval, the applicant makes a written request to the Zoning
Administrator for an extension of time to commence construction setting forth
the reasons for the requested extension, the Zoning Administrator may grant one
extension of not greater than one single year. Receipt of any request for an
extension shall be acknowledged by the Zoning Administrator within 15 days. The
Zoning Administrator shall make a decision on the extension within 30 days of
receipt. Any plan may be revised in the same manner as originally approved.
      (3)   Conditions. A storm water management plan may be approved subject
to compliance with conditions that are reasonable and necessary to ensure that
the requirements contained in this section are met. The conditions may, among
other things, limit the size, kind or character of the proposed development,
require the construction of structures, fences, drainage facilities, storage
basins and other facilities, require replacement of vegetation, establish
required monitoring procedures, stage the work over time, require alteration of
the site design to ensure buffering and require the conveyance to the city or
other public entity of certain lands or interests therein.
      (4)   Performance bond.
         (a)   Prior to approval of any storm water management plan, the
applicant shall submit an agreement to construct the required physical
improvements, to dedicate property or easements, or to comply with the
conditions as may have been agreed to. The agreement shall be accompanied by a
bond to cover the amount of the established cost of complying with the
agreement. The agreement and bond shall guarantee completion and compliance
with conditions within a specific time, which time may be extended in
accordance with division (F)(2) of this section.
         (b)   The adequacy, condition and acceptability of any agreement and
bond shall be determined by the City Attorney.
      (5)   Fees. All applications for storm water management plan approval
shall be accompanied by a processing and approval fee in an amount determined
in the city's fee schedule.
   (G)   Approval standards.
      (1)   Generally. No storm water management plan which fails to meet the
standards contained in this section shall be approved by the Zoning
Administrator.
      (2)   Tracking. Each site shall have graveled access drives and parking
areas of sufficient width and length to prevent sediment from being tracked
onto public or private roadways. Any sediment reaching a public or private road
shall be removed by street cleaning (not flushing) before the end of each
workday.
      (3)   Drain inlet protection. All storm drain inlets shall be protected
during construction until control measures are in place with a straw bale, silt
fence or equivalent barrier meeting accepted design criteria, standards and
specifications contained in the MPCA publication Protecting Water Quality in
Urban Areas.
      (4)   Storm water management criteria for permanent facilities.
         (a)   An applicant shall install or construct, on or for the proposed
land disturbing or development activity, all storm water management facilities
necessary to manage increased runoff so that the two-year, ten-year and 100-
year storm peak discharge rates existing before the proposed development shall
not be increased and accelerated channel erosion will not occur as a result of
the proposed land disturbing or development activity.
         (b)   The applicant shall give consideration to reducing the need for
storm water management facilities by incorporating the use of natural
topography and land cover such as wetlands, ponds, natural swales and
depressions as they exist before development to the degree that they can
accommodate the additional flow of water without compromising the integrity or
quality of the wetland or pond.
   (H)   Other controls. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of
this section and the provisions of an erosion control or shore land protection
ordinance adopted by the City Council, the more restrictive standard prevails.
(Ord. 583, passed 8-26-2019)
§ 153.048 SOIL EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL.
   (A)   General regulations.
      (1)   Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) requirements. Every
applicant for a building permit, subdivision approval, or a grading permit to
allow land disturbing activities shall adhere to erosion control measure
standards and specifications contained in the MPCA publication "Protecting
Water Quality in Urban Areas," as may be amended, or as approved by the City
Engineer and applicable city's storm water management requirements as stated in
Chapter 93 of this code.
      (2)   Prohibited development. No land shall be developed, and no use
shall be permitted that results in water runoff causing flooding, erosion, or
deposit of sediment on adjacent properties. Such runoff shall be properly
channeled into a storm drain, watercourse, ponding area, or other public
facilities subject to the review and approval of the City Engineer.
      (3)   City approval. In the case of all single-family lots, multiple-
family lots, business, industrial and institutional developments, the drainage
and erosion control plans shall be subject to the City Engineer or Zoning
Administrator's written approval. No modification in grade and drainage flow
through fill, cuts, erection of retaining walls or other such actions shall be
permitted until such plans have been reviewed and received written approval
from the City Engineer.
      (4)   Approval of erosion control measures. Proposed erosion control
measures may be approved by the City Engineer as part of grading plan review.
Erosion control may be specified by the City Engineer as part of a site survey
for individual building permits. Erosion control measures may also be specified
by the City Engineer as needed and deemed appropriate during the construction
and post-construction periods separate from the above.
      (5)   Storm sewer inlets. All storm sewer inlets which are functioning
during construction shall be protected so that sediment laden water does not
enter the conveyance system without first being filtered or otherwise treated
to remove sediment.
      (6)   Storm water channels. All on-site storm water conveyance channels
shall be designed and constructed to withstand the design volume of storm water
with appropriate stabilization to prevent scour and erosion. Erosion controls
shall be provided at the outlets of all storm sewer pipes.
      (7)   Sediment control practices. All temporary and permanent erosion and
sediment control practices shall be maintained and repaired whenever necessary
to assure the continued performance of their intended function.
      (8)   Tracking. Each site shall have graveled roads, access drives and
parking areas of sufficient width and length to prevent sediment from being
tracked onto public or private roadways. Any sediment reaching a public or
private road shall be removed by street cleaning (not flushing) before the end
of each workday.
      (9)   Seeding. All disturbed ground left inactive for seven or more days
shall be stabilized by seeding or sodding or by mulching or covering or other
equivalent control measure.
      (10)   Sites one acre and more. For sites with more than one acre or more
disturbed at one time, or if a channel originates in the disturbed area, one or
more temporary or permanent sedimentation basins shall be constructed. Each
sedimentation basin shall have a surface area of at least 1% of the area
draining to the basin and at least three feet of depth and constructed in
accordance with accepted design specifications. Sediment shall be removed to
maintain a depth of three feet. The basin discharge rate shall also be
sufficiently low as to not cause erosion along the discharge channel or the
receiving water.
      (11)   Sites under one acre. For sites with less than one acre disturbed
at one time, silt fences, straw bales, or equivalent control measures shall be
placed along all side slope and down slope sides of the site. If a channel or
area of concentrated runoff passes through the site, silt fences shall be
placed along the channel edges to reduce sediment reaching the channel. The use
of silt fences, straw bales, or equivalent control measures must include a
maintenance and inspection schedule.
      (12)   Removal. All temporary erosion control devices including silt
fence, gravel, hay bales or other measures shall be removed from the
construction site and properly disposed of or recycled. This removal and
disposal shall occur within 30 days of the establishment of permanent
vegetative cover on the disturbed area.
      (13)   Site dewatering. Water pumped from the site shall be treated by
temporary sedimentation basins, grit chambers, sand filters, up flow chambers,
hydro-cyclones, swirl concentrators or other controls as appropriate. Water may
not be discharged in a manner that causes erosion or flooding of the site or
receiving channels of a wetland. All dewatering shall be in accordance with all
applicable county, state, and federal rules and regulations.
      (14)   Waste and material disposal. All waste and unused building
materials (including garbage, debris, cleaning wastes, wastewater, toxic
materials or hazardous materials) shall be properly disposed of off-site and
not allowed to be carried by runoff into a receiving channel or storm sewer
system.
      (15)   Stop work order. The city's Building Official or City Engineer may
issue stop work orders for any violation of this chapter. Where the topsoil is
removed, sufficient topsoil shall be set aside for re-spreading over the
developed area. The topsoil shall be restored to a depth of four inches and
shall be of a quality at least equal to the soil quality prior to development.
      (16)   Public and private properties adjacent to the development site
shall be protected from the effects of sedimentation. Any violation of this
provision must be corrected by the owner to the satisfaction of the city within
five days of receiving written notification from the city. If the violation is
not remedied within the time period specified, the city may correct the problem
and assess the costs incurred to the property owner.
   (B)   Exposed slopes. The following control measures shall be taken to
control erosion during construction.
      (1)   Exposed slopes steeper in grade than five feet horizontal to one-
foot vertical shall be contour plowed to direct runoff of water.
      (2)   At the foot of each exposed slope, a channel and berm shall be
constructed to control runoff. The channeled water shall be diverted to a
sedimentation basin (debris basin, silt basin or silt trap) before being
allowed to enter the natural drainage system.
      (3)   Along the top of each exposed slope, a berm shall be constructed to
prevent runoff from flowing over the edge of the slope. Where runoff collected
behind the berm cannot be diverted elsewhere and must be directed down the
slope, appropriate measures shall be taken to prevent erosion. The measures
shall consist of either an asphalt paved flow apron and drop chute laid down
the slope or a flexible slope drain. At the base of the slope drain or flow
apron, a gravel energy dispatcher shall be installed to prevent erosion at the
discharge end.
      (4)   Exposed slopes shall be protected by whatever means will
effectively prevent erosion, considering the degree of slope, soil material and
expected length of exposure. Slope protection shall consist of mulch, sheets of
plastic, burlap or jute netting and blankets, fast-growing grasses or temporary
seeding of annual grasses. Mulch consists of hay, straw, wood chips, corn
stalks, bark or other protective material. Mulch shall be anchored to slopes
with liquid asphalt, stakes and netting, or shall be worked into the soil to
provide additional slope stability.
      (5)   Control measures other than those specifically stated above may be
used in place of the above measures if it can be demonstrated that they will be
as effective in protecting exposed slopes.

Administrator. In all cases, appropriate screening and buffering shall be
provided for the entire site.
      (3)   No building permit for any construction shall be issued until a
landscape plan is approved and a security is obtained by the city. Guidelines
for the security are found in division (B)(6) of this section.
      (4)   The landscaping plan is required to be placed into effect with the
site development as may be stated by this chapter.
   (C)   General plan requirements. Landscape plans shall be prepared by a
landscape architect or other qualified person for all development projects
other than single-family residential uses. Such plan shall be acceptable to the
Zoning Administrator, drawn at a legible scale and shall include the following:
      (1)   Boundary lines of the property with accurate dimensions;
      (2)   Locations of existing and proposed buildings, parking lots, roads
and other improvements;
      (3)   Proposed grading plan with two-foot contour intervals;
      (4)   Location, size and common name of all existing 'significant' trees
at least eight inches in diameter or greater as measured 54 inches above the
ground. (For changes to developed sites, the location, size and common name of
all trees and shrubs on the site must be identified);
      (5)   A planting schedule containing symbols, quantities, common and
botanical names, size of plant materials, root condition and special planting
instructions;

      (9)   Location and details of irrigation systems; and
      (10)   Details and cross-sections of all required screening.
   (D)   Design standards and guidelines. All landscape plans shall adhere to
the following:
      (1)   Landscaped areas.
         (a)   All open areas of a lot which are not used or improved for
required parking areas, drives or storage shall be landscaped with a
combination of over-story trees, under-story trees, coniferous trees, shrubs,
flowers and ground cover materials.
         (b)   Single-family residential lots must maintain vegetation in the
city's right-of-way and along the five-foot perimeter of the property, except
in areas where the required driveway access is located. An exception to this
restriction would be landscaping materials (two to three feet in width)
adjacent to a residential driveway.
      (2)   Number of trees. The minimum number of major or over-story trees on
any given site shall be as indicated below. These are the minimum substantial
plantings, in addition to other under-story trees, shrubs, flowers, and ground
cover, deemed appropriate for a complete quality landscape treatment of the
site.
         (a)   Each one- and two-family residential dwelling unit shall contain
two or more trees with four inches of combined diameter in the front yard. Each
tree must be at least one inch in diameter and at least one of the trees must
be an over-story (shade) tree. An evergreen tree at least four feet in height
is equivalent to two inches of tree diameter for purposes of this requirement.
         (b)   Trees must be planted within the front yard within 120 days
after the city has issued a certificate of occupancy or within 15 months of the
issuance of the building permit, whichever comes first. The counting of the 120
days shall be tolled during the time between October 1 and May 1 but said count
shall be resumed after May 1.
         (c)   Except in the B-1 District, all other development shall contain,
at a minimum, the greater of: one tree per 1,000 square feet of gross building
floor area; or one tree per 800 square feet of landscaped area; or one tree per
40 lineal feet of site perimeter; or one tree per multi-residential dwelling

      (3)   Sodding and seeding. All front (including boulevards), side or rear
yards facing a right-of- way shall be sodded with the following exceptions:
         (a)   Single-family residential lots are not required to sod, but turf
must be established within 120 days after the city has issued a certificate of
occupancy or within 15 months of the issuance of the building permit, whichever
comes first. The counting of the 120 days shall be tolled during the time
between October 1 and May 1 but said count shall be resumed after May 1. All
silt fence or hay bale erosion controls must be maintained until turf is
established. A financial security in an amount determined by the city will be
required if turf is not established within the front yard (including to the
rear of the structure abutting the street on a corner lot) prior to occupancy.
         (b)   All other zoning districts may seed their lots when the city
determines sod is not practical or desirable such as, but not limited to,
campus areas of schools, recreational playfields, open space, sites that are
rough graded and areas that cannot be developed (such as those in a power line
easement).
         (c)   Seeding of future expansion areas as shown on approved plans.
         (d)   Undisturbed areas containing existing viable natural vegetation
which can be maintained free of foreign and noxious plant materials.
         (e)   Areas designated as open space or future expansion areas
properly planted and maintained with prairie grass.
      (4)   Building ground cover. Except in the B-1 District, a minimum five-
foot strip from the building edge must be treated with decorative ground cover
and/or foundation plantings, except for garage/loading and pedestrian access
areas.
      (5)   Softening of walls and fences. Plants shall be placed
intermittently against long expanses of building walls, fences, and other
barriers to create a softening effect. Plantings shall also be proportionate to
the height of the building. Additional depth along buildings may be required to
accommodate this landscaping.
      (6)   Existing trees.
         (a)   A reasonable attempt shall be made to preserve as many existing
trees as practical and to incorporate them into the site plan. Significant
trees are any over-story or coniferous tree over eight inches in diameter, as
measured 54 inches from the ground. Sites containing significant existing trees
which will be retained may be given credit against the required number of
trees.
         (b)   As a condition of subdivision approval or the issuance of
grading or building permit, the city may require the applicant to replace any
significant trees which are damaged or destroyed as a result of development or
construction activities. Significant trees that are damaged or destroyed shall
be replaced by at least two trees meeting the minimum planting requirements.
      (7)   Minimum planting size.
         (a)   All multi-family residential, commercial, industrial, public/
institutional and association-maintained residential landscaping materials
shall conform to the following minimum size requirements:
            1.   Over-story trees: Two-inch diameter, as measured six inches
above the ground.
            2.   Under-story trees: 1½ inch diameter, as measured six inches

the site.
         (b)   All deciduous trees proposed to satisfy the minimum requirements
of this policy shall be long-lived hardwood species.
         (c)   The complement of trees fulfilling the requirements of this
section shall be not less than 25% deciduous and not less than 25% coniferous.
Single-family residential development is exempt from this requirement.
         (d)   No required tree shall be any of the following:
            1.   A species of the genus Ulmus (elm), except those elms bred to
be immune to Dutch Elm disease;
            2.   Box Elder;
            3.   A species of the genus Populus (poplar) except when counted as
an under-story tree;
            4.   Female ginko; or
            5.   Ash (Fraxinus spp).
      (9)   Parking lots/planting islands. All parking lots designed for 45 or
more parking spaces shall provide landscaping areas dispersed throughout the
parking lot, in order to avoid the undesirable monotony, heat and wind
associated with large parking areas. Parking lots with less than 45 spaces
shall not be required to provide landscaping other than yard area and buffer
landscaping requirements as specified in other sections of this chapter.
         (a)   Plant materials. At least one over-story/shade tree must be
provided for each 24 parking spaces. Ornamental trees, shrubs, hedges and other
plant materials may be used to supplement the shade trees but shall not be the
sole contribution to such landscaping.
         (b)   Additional perimeter plantings may be used to satisfy this
requirement in parking facilities less than 42 feet in width.
      (10)   Detention/retention ponds. Storm water ponds shall be landscaped
with an average of a ten-foot buffer strip of shade and ornamental trees,
evergreens, shrubbery, natural grasses, groundcover and/or other plant
materials to provide an aesthetically appealing setting. This landscaping shall
be in addition to the required landscaping.
      (11)   Slopes and berms. Final slopes of greater than 3:1 will not be
permitted without special treatment such as terracing or retaining walls. All
berms must incorporate trees and plantings into the design. In no situation
shall berms be used as the sole means of screening.
      (12)   Location of plantings. No required plantings except ground cover
shall be within two feet of any public easement or right-of-way.
      (13)   Landscape guarantee. All trees and plant materials that do not
survive for at least two full growing seasons must be replaced by the
landowner.
   (E)   Screening and buffering. Where any business or industrial use abuts
property zoned or guided for residential use, that business or industry shall
provide screening along the boundary of the residential property. Screening
shall also be provided where a business or industry is across the street from a
residential zone, except on the side of a business or industry considered to be
the front (as determined by the Zoning Administrator). A green planting strip
shall consist of over-story trees, evergreen trees, shrubs, berms and fencing
of sufficient width and density to provide an effective visual year-round
screen to a minimum height of six feet.
      (1)   Size of buffer: a minimum ten feet wide along entire property line
abutting the residential property;
      (2)   Height of buffer: the buffer shall fully screen the bottom six
feet;
      (3)   Berms may be used but shall not be used to achieve more than three
feet of the required screen; and
      (4)   The landscaping, berming and fencing materials shall be subject to
the approval of the Zoning Administrator. The landowner must demonstrate how
the proposed plan will provide the desired screening effect.
   (F)   Additional screening requirements.
      (1)   General business screening. Screening from public streets and
residential districts shall be provided for outdoor storage of materials,
goods, parking and loading areas. The screening may consist of either a fence,
compact hedge, berm or similar opaque material. Screening shall be maintained
by the property owner and replaced if plants die or are damaged.
      (2)   Screening of mechanical equipment. All rooftop and ground mounted
mechanical equipment of non-residential buildings shall comply with the
following standards:
         (a)   All rooftop and ground mounted mechanical equipment shall be
buffered so as to mitigate noise.
         (b)   All rooftop and ground mounted mechanical equipment shall be
designed (including exterior color) and located so to be aesthetically
harmonious and compatible with the building. Screening of the equipment may be
required where the design, color, and location of the equipment are found to
not effectively buffer noise or provide aesthetic harmony and compatibility as
observed by a six-foot tall individual standing at ground level on the adjacent
property or public right-of-way. Screening shall be constructed of durable
materials which are aesthetically compatible with the structure and which may
be an integral part of the structure. Applicable requirements for access to the
equipment shall be observed in the design and construction of the screening.
         (c)   Rooftop mechanical equipment less than three feet in height,
solar panels, and wind energy conversion systems (WECS) shall be exempt from
these requirements.
      (3)   Trash receptacle screening. Except as otherwise provided, all
multiple family dwellings and non-residential buildings having exterior trash
receptacles shall provide an enclosed area in conformance with the following:
         (a)   Exterior wall treatment shall be similar and/or complement the
principal building.
         (b)   For residential uses, the minimum setback for an enclosed trash
receptacle area shall be the same as the setback prescribed for accessory
structures. For non-residential uses, the minimum setback for an enclosed trash
receptacle area shall be the same as the setback prescribed for the principal
building.
         (c)   The trash enclosure shall be in an accessible location for
servicing vehicles and shall not conflict with site circulation.
         (d)   The trash receptacles shall be fully screened from view of
adjacent properties and the public right-of-way.
         (e)   The design and construction of the trash enclosure shall be
subject to the approval of the Building Official.
         (f)   Recycling space shall be provided as required by the Minnesota
State Building Code.
         (g)   Noise emanating from trash collection activities shall be
minimized so as not to constitute a nuisance.
         (h)   The trash enclosure shall not be located within a front yard.
   (G)   Security.
      (1)   When screening, landscaping or other similar improvements to
property are required by this chapter, a security shall be supplied by the
owner in an amount equal to 125% of the City Engineer's estimate of the value
of such screening and landscaping. The security shall be provided prior to the
issuance of a certificate of occupancy and shall be valid for a period of time
equal to two full growing seasons after the actual date of installation of the
landscaping. In the event construction of the project is not completed within
the time prescribed by building permits and other approvals, or if the plant
materials have died within two full growing seasons, the city may, at its
option, complete the work required or replace the landscaping at the expense of
the owner and the security.
      (2)   The city may allow an extended period of time for completion of all
landscaping if the delay is due to conditions which are reasonably beyond the
control of the developer. Extensions may be granted by the Zoning Administrator
for a period not to exceed nine months, due to seasonal or weather conditions.
When an extension is granted, the city shall require such additional security
as it deems appropriate.

   In all districts, any lighting used to illuminate an off-street parking
area, sign or other structure shall be placed in a manner as to deflect light
away from any adjoining residential zone or away from public streets. Direct or
reflected glare, whether from artificial lighting or from combustion or welding
shall be hooded or controlled so as not to adversely affect adjacent property.
Exposed light bulbs shall not be permitted in view of adjacent property or
public rights-of-way. Any light or combination of lights which shine on a
street shall not exceed one foot-candle (meter reading) as measured from the
centerline of the street. Any light or combination of lights which have the
potential to cast light on residential property shall be hooded or screened and
shall not exceed 0.4 foot-candles (meter reading) as measured at the property
line. The foot candle level of a light source shall be taken after dark with
the light meter held six inches above the ground with the meter facing the
light source. A reading shall be taken with the light source on, then with the
light source off. The difference between the two readings will be identified as
the light intensity.

§ 153.062 PRESERVATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES.
   (A)   Waterways.
      (1)   Natural drainage systems shall be used if feasible for storage and
flow of runoff. Storm water drainage may be discharged to marshlands, swamps,
retention basins or other treatment facilities. Diversion of storm water to
marshlands or swamps shall be considered for existing or planned surface
drainage. Marshlands and swamps used for storm water shall provide for natural
or artificial water level control. Temporary storage areas or retention basins
scattered throughout developed areas shall be encouraged in order to reduce
peak flow, erosion damage and construction cost.
      (2)   The widths of a constructed waterway shall be sufficiently large to
channel runoff from a ten-year storm. Adequacy shall be determined by the
expected runoff when full development of the drainage area is reached.
      (3)   No fences or structures shall be constructed across the waterway
that will reduce or restrict the flow of water.
      (4)   The banks of the waterway shall be protected with permanent
vegetation.
      (5)   The banks of the waterway shall not exceed five feet horizontal to
one-foot vertical.
      (6)   The gradient of the waterway bed shall not exceed a grade that will
result in a velocity that will cause erosion of the banks of the waterway.
      (7)   The bed of the waterway shall be protected with turf, sod or
concrete. If turf or sod will not function properly, rip-rap may be used. Rip-
rap shall consist of quarried limestone, field stone (if random rip-rap is
used) or construction materials and concrete. The rip-rap shall be no smaller
than two inches square nor larger than two feet square. Construction materials
shall be used only in those areas where the waterway is not used as part of a
recreational trail system.
      (8)   If the flow velocity in the waterway is such that erosion of the
turf sidewall will occur and the velocity cannot be decreased via velocity
control structures, then other materials may replace turf on the sidewalls.
Either gravel or rip-rap would be allowed to prevent erosion at these points.
      (9)   Development of housing and other structures shall be restricted
from the area on either side of the waterway.
   (B)   Sediment control of waterways.
      (1)   To prevent sedimentation of waterways, pervious and impervious
sediment traps, and other sediment control structures, shall be incorporated
throughout the watershed.
      (2)   Temporary pervious sediment traps may consist of bales of hay with
a low spillway embankment section of sand and gravel that permits a slow
movement of water while filtering sediment. The structures would serve as
temporary sediment control features during the construction phase of
development.
      (3)   Permanent impervious sediment control structures shall consist of
sediment basins (debris, desilting basins or silt traps) and shall be utilized
to remove sediment from runoff prior to its disposal in any permanent body of
water.
   (C)   Wetlands.
      (1)   Delineation report. Any person seeking to conduct wetland
disturbing activities shall submit a wetland delineation report to the City
Engineer. No permit to allow wetland disturbing activities shall be issued
until approval of the wetland replacement plan application or a certificate of
exemption has been obtained in strict conformance with the provisions of this
chapter and the Minnesota Wetland Conservation Act.
      (2)   Impacts. Utilization and development impacts to wetlands shall be
consistent with the storm water management policies of the city.
      (3)   Impacts to wetlands.
         (a)   Storm water discharge into wetlands shall be consistent with the
requirements of this chapter.
         (b)   A building setback of 20 feet shall exist from the delineated
edge of all wetlands at the time of development within areas developed or
redeveloped after the effective date of this chapter, unless otherwise stated
within the zoning district. If a wetland buffer strip is required around the
wetland, no structures shall be placed within this strip.
         (c)   Wetlands shall not be drained or filled, wholly or partially,
unless replaced by restoring or creating wetland areas of at least equal public
value in accordance with the Minnesota Wetland Conservation Act.

steep or open fields shall be constructed and maintained to a width and base
material depth sufficient to support access by emergency vehicles. In these
cases, further review may be required by the City Engineer.
   (G)   The number and type of access drives onto major streets may be
controlled and limited by the city in the interests of public safety and
efficient traffic flow.

purpose of this chapter is to create such a regulatory scheme to further the
city's compelling interest in maintaining public safety by prescribing where
predatory offenders may reside within the city.
