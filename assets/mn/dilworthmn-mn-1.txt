existence at the time this code was adopted, unless there is clear intention
expressed in the code to the contrary.
   (B)   It is the intention of the City Council that, when adopting this code

existence at the time this code was enacted, unless there is clear intention
expressed in the code to the contrary.
§ 10.20 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Any licensed peace officer of the city’s Police Department, or the
County Sheriff, or any Deputy Sheriff shall have the authority to enforce any
provision of this code.
   (B)   As permitted by M.S. § 626.862, as it may be amended from time to
time, the City Administrator shall have the authority to administer and enforce
this code. In addition, under that statutory authority, certain individuals
designated within the code or by the City Administrator or City Council shall
have the authority to administer and enforce the provisions specified. All and
any person or persons designated may issue a citation in lieu of arrest or
continued detention to enforce any provision of the code.
   (C)   The City Administrator and any city official or employee designated by
this code who has the responsibility to perform a duty under this code may with
the permission of a licensee of a business or owner of any property or resident
of a dwelling, or other person in control of any premises, inspect or otherwise
enter any property to enforce compliance with this code.
   (D)   If the licensee, owner, resident or other person in control of a
premises objects to the inspection of or entrance to the property, the City
Administrator, peace officer or any employee or official charged with the duty
of enforcing the provisions of this code may, upon a showing that probable
cause exists for the issuance of a valid search warrant from a court of
competent jurisdiction, petition and obtain a search warrant before conducting
the inspection or otherwise entering the property. This warrant shall be only
to determine whether the provisions of this code enacted to protect the health,
safety and welfare of the people are being complied with and to enforce these
provisions only, and no criminal charges shall be made as a result of the
warrant. No warrant shall be issued unless there be probable cause to issue the
warrant. Probable cause occurs if the search is reasonable. Probable cause does
not depend on specific knowledge of the condition of a particular property.
   (E)   Every licensee, owner, resident or other person in control of property
within the city shall permit at reasonable times inspections of or entrance to
the property by the City Administrator or any other authorized city officer or
employee only to determine whether the provisions of this code enacted to
protect the health, safety and welfare of the people are being complied with
and to enforce these provisions. Unreasonable refusal to permit the inspection
of or entrance to the property shall be grounds for termination of any and all
permits, licenses or city service to the property. Mailed notice shall be given
to the licensee, owner, resident or other person in control of the property,
stating the grounds for the termination, and the licensee, owner, resident or
other person in control of the property shall be given an opportunity to appear
before the City Administrator to object to the termination before it occurs,
subject to appeal of the City Administrator’s decision to the City Council at a
regularly scheduled or special meeting.
   (F)   Community service officers have the same powers of law enforcement
officers in the city to issue a citation in lieu of arrest for violations of
the city code. Nothing in this section is to be construed as giving community
service officers any powers of law enforcement officers other than the
authority set forth in this section. For purposes of this code, a COMMUNITY
SERVICE OFFICER means an employee of the city designated by the Council and
assigned to the Police Department, exercising limited law enforcement, code
enforcement and related duties under the supervision of the Chief of Police.
   (G)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of
the city to enter private property in urgent emergency situations where there
is an imminent danger in order to protect the public health, safety and
welfare.
(Ord. 21-04, passed 4-12-2021)
§ 10.98 SUPPLEMENTAL ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES.
   (A)   In addition to those administrative penalties established in this code
and the enforcement powers granted in §
10.20, the City Council is authorized to create by resolution, adopted by a
majority of the members of the Council, supplemental administrative penalties.
The resolution may be in the form established in
Appendix A. Such resolution may not proscribe administrative penalties for
traffic offenses designated by M.S. § 169.999, as it may be amended from time
to time.
   (B)   These administrative penalty procedures in this section are intended
to provide the public and the city with an informal, cost effective and
expeditious alternative to traditional criminal charges for violations of
certain provisions of this code. The procedures are intended to be voluntary on
the part of those who have been charged with those offenses.
   (C)   Administrative penalties for violations of various provisions of the
code, other than those penalties established in the code or in statutes that
are adopted by reference, may be established from time to time by resolution of
a majority of the members of the City Council. In order to be effective, an
administrative penalty for a particular violation must be established before
the violation occurred.
   (D)   In the discretion of the peace officer, City Administrator or other
person giving notice of an alleged violation of a provision of this code, in a
written notice of an alleged violation, sent by first class mail to the person
who is alleged to have violated the code, the person giving notice may request
the payment of a voluntary administrative penalty for the violation directly to
the City Treasurer within 14 days of the notice of the violation. A sample
notice is contained in
Appendix A to this chapter. In the sole discretion of the person giving the
notice of the alleged violation, the time for payment may be extended an
additional 14 days, whether or not requested by the person to whom the notice
has been given. In addition to the administrative penalty, the person giving
notice may request in the notice to the alleged violator to adopt a compliance
plan to correct the situation resulting in the alleged violation and may
provide that if the alleged violator corrects the situation resulting in the
alleged violation within the time specified in the notice, that the payment of
the administrative penalty will be waived.
   (E)   At any time before the payment of the administrative penalty is due,
the person who has been given notice of an alleged violation may request to
appear before the City Council to contest the request for payment of the
penalty. After a hearing before the Council, the Council may determine to
withdraw the request for payment or to renew the request for payment. Because
the payment of the administrative penalty is voluntary, there shall be no
appeal from the decision of the Council.
   (F)   At any time after the date the payment of the administrative penalty
is due, if the administrative penalty remains unpaid or the situation creating
the alleged violation remains uncorrected, the city, through its Attorney, may
bring criminal charges in accordance with state law and this code. Likewise,
the city, in its discretion, may bring criminal charges in the first instance,
rather than requesting the payment of an administrative penalty, even if a
penalty for the particular violation has been established by Council
resolution. If the administrative penalty is paid, or if any requested
correction of the situation resulting in the violation is completed, no
criminal charges shall be initiated by the city for the alleged violation.
§ 10.99 GENERAL PENALTY AND ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Any person, firm or corporation who violates any provision of this
code for which another penalty is not specifically provided, shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor. The penalty which may be imposed for
any crime which is a misdemeanor under this code, including Minnesota Statutes
specifically adopted by reference, shall be a sentence of not more than 90 days
or a fine of not more than $1,000, or both.
   (B)   Any person, firm or corporation who violates any provision of this
code, including Minnesota Statutes specifically adopted by reference, which is
designated to be a petty misdemeanor shall, upon conviction be guilty of a
petty misdemeanor. The penalty which may be imposed for any petty offense which
is a petty misdemeanor shall be a sentence of a fine of not more than $300.
   (C)   Pursuant to M.S. § 631.48, as it may be amended from time to time, in
either the case of a misdemeanor or a petty misdemeanor, the costs of
prosecution may be added. A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon
each day during which a violation occurs or continues.
   (D)   The failure of any officer or employee of the city to perform any
official duty imposed by this code shall not subject the officer or employee to
the penalty imposed for a violation.
   (E)   In addition to any penalties provided for in this section or in §
10.98, if any person, firm or corporation fails to comply with any provision of
this code, the Council or any city official designated by it, may institute
appropriate proceedings at law or at equity to restrain, correct or abate the
violation.
APPENDIX A: NOTICE OF CODE VIOLATION
NOTICE OF CODE VIOLATION

From: (Name and title of city official giving the notice)
Re: Alleged violation of section of the city code, relating to (give title of
section)
Date: (Date of notice)
   I hereby allege that on (date of violation) you violated §       of the city
code relating to             .
   The City Council has by resolution established an administrative penalty in
the amount of $       for this violation.
   Payment of this administrative penalty is voluntary, but if you do not pay
it the city may initiate criminal proceedings for this alleged violation.
   Payment is due within 14 days of the date of this notice. Before the due
date, you may request an additional 14-day extension of the time to pay the
administrative penalty.
   As an alternative to the payment of this administrative penalty, if the
situation that gave rise to this alleged violation is corrected by (establish
date), then the payment of the administrative penalty will be waived.
   Even if the administrative penalty is paid, the city reserves the right to
institute appropriate proceedings at law or at equity to restrain, correct or
abate the violation.
   Before the due date, you may request to appear before the City Council to
contest the request for payment of the penalty. After a hearing before the
Council, the Council may determine to withdraw the request for payment or to
renew the request for payment. Because the payment of the administrative
penalty is voluntary, there shall be no appeal from the decision of the
Council.
   If you pay the administrative penalty, the city will not initiate criminal
proceedings for this alleged violation. However, the Council, or any city
official designated by it, may institute appropriate proceedings at law or at
equity to restrain, correct or abate the violation.
   Payment of the administrative penalty may be made by check, cash or money
order to the City Treasurer.

CHAPTER 35: ADMINISTRATIVE CITATIONS AND CIVIL PENALTIES
Section
   
35.01   Administrative citations and civil penalties
§ 35.01 ADMINISTRATIVE CITATIONS AND CIVIL PENALTIES.
   (A)   Purpose. The City Council finds that there is a need for alternative
methods of enforcing this City Code. While criminal penalties have been the
most frequent enforcement mechanism, there are certain negative consequences
for both the city and the accused involved, and the delay inherent in that
system does not ensure prompt resolution. Additionally, the City Council finds
that there is a need for alternative methods of enforcing nuisance offenses
because they are prone to occur repeatedly. Chronic nuisance offenses are a
financial and resource burden to the city as a result of repeated calls to
ameliorate those conditions. Accordingly, the City Council finds that the use
of this administrative procedure and of administrative citations is a
legitimate and alternative method of enforcement. This method of enforcement is
in addition to any other legal remedy that may be pursued under this City Code.
   (B)   General provisions.
      (1)   Administrative citations and civil penalties. The City Council may,
by resolution or ordinance, establish a schedule of civil penalties for
administrative violations. Civil penalties shall be imposed according to the
schedule adopted by the City Council. The City Council may also adopt a
schedule of fees to be paid to administrative hearing officers.
      (2)   General civil penalty structure. As identified throughout the City
Code, violations of certain provisions of the City Code may be considered
administrative offenses that may be subject to this administrative procedure
and administrative citations and civil penalties. Administrative offenses,
except for those identified in the following division, are subject to the non-
graduated civil penalty structure established by the City Council.
      (3)   Graduated civil penalty structure. The City Council finds
violations of
Chapter 94 of this City Code are administrative offenses that are more prone to
repeat violations. These administrative offenses are subject to the graduated
civil penalty structure established by the City Council based on the number of
offense occurrences within a rolling 12-month period. A prior offense
occurrence is counted for penalty purposes if the prior offense was a violation
of the same provision of the City Code as the current offense occurrence. If a
prior administrative offense was dismissed or the offense occurrence was based
on a violation of a different provision of the City Code, it will not count
toward the number of offense occurrences.
      (4)   Each day a violation exists constitutes a separate offense. The
city may elect to pursue either the administrative offense or the applicable
criminal offense, but not both, for the same offense.
      (5)   The City Administrator may adopt procedures for administering the
administrative citation program.
   (C)   Administrative citation.
      (1)   A person authorized to enforce the provisions of this City Code
which constitute an administrative offense may issue an administrative citation
upon belief that an offense has occurred. The citation must be issued in person
or by mail to the person responsible for the offense. The citation must state
the date, time, and nature of the offense, the name of the issuing officer, the
amount of the scheduled fine, and the manner for paying the fine or appealing
the citation.
      (2)   The person responsible for the offense must either pay the
scheduled fine or submit a written request for an appeal to the City
Administrator within seven calendar days after issuance. Payment of the fine
constitutes admission of the offense. A late payment fee of 10% of the
scheduled fine amount may be imposed under division (F) of this section.
   (D)   Administrative review hearing process.
      (1)   City Administrator review.
         (a)   Upon receipt of an accused’s written request for an appeal, the
City Administrator will contact the accused and set a time to discuss the
offense. The City Administrator will also contact the officer who issued the
citation and set a separate time to discuss the offense. After meeting with the
accused and the officer, the City Administrator has the authority to determine
that an offense occurred, to dismiss a citation, to impose the scheduled fine,
and/or to reduce, stay, or waive a scheduled fine either unconditionally or
upon compliance with appropriate conditions. The City Administrator will not
issue verbal findings of his or her determination on an administrative citation
during a meeting with either the accused or the officer but, instead, will
issue written findings of his or her determination following such meetings.
         (b)   The failure to attend the meeting with the City Administrator
constitutes a waiver of the accused’s rights to an appeal and an admission of
the offense. The City Administrator may waive this result upon good cause
shown. Examples of good cause are death or incapacitating illness of the
accused or a court order requiring the accused to appear for another hearing at
the same time. Good cause does not include forgetfulness and intentional delay.
The City Administrator may exercise discretion to impose a fine for more than
one day of continuing offense but only upon a finding that: (i) the offenses
caused a serious threat of harm to the public health, safety, or welfare; or
that (ii) the accused intentionally and unreasonably refused to comply with the
City Code requirements.
         (c)   If the accused would like to appeal the decision of the City
Administrator, the person must submit a written request for a hearing to the
City Administrator within seven calendar days after the issuance of the City
Administrator’s opinion. If no appeal is made, the accused must pay the
scheduled fine within seven calendar days after the issuance of the City
Administrator’s opinion.
      (2)   Hearing Board review.
         (a)   The city will compile a three person Hearing Board to hear
appeals of the decisions of the City Administrator. The Hearing Board will
consist of two City Council members and one citizen appointee. The accused will
have the right to request no later than five calendar days before the date of
the hearing that an assigned hearing officer be removed from the appeal. One
request for each case will be granted automatically by the City Administrator.
A subsequent request must be directed to the assigned Hearing Officer who will
decide whether he or she cannot fairly or objectively review the case. The City
Administrator may remove a Hearing Officer only by requesting that the assigned
Hearing Officer find that he or she cannot fairly and objectively review the
case. If such a finding is made, the Hearing Officer shall remove himself or
herself from the case, and the City Administrator will assign another Hearing
Officer. The Hearing Officers are not judicial officers but are public officers
as defined by M.S. §609.415, as may be amended from time to time. The Hearing
Officers may not be city employees.
         (b)   Notice of the hearing must be served in person or by mail on the
accused at least ten calendar days in advance unless a shorter time is accepted
by all parties. Notice need not be provided by certified mail.
         (c)   At the hearing, the parties will have the opportunity to present
testimony and question any witnesses, but strict rules of evidence will not
apply. Each party is responsible for providing its own documents and witnesses
to argue its position. The Hearing Board must record the hearing and receive
testimony and exhibits. The Hearing Board must receive and give weight to
evidence, including hearsay evidence, that possesses probative value commonly
accepted by reasonable and prudent people in the conduct of their affairs.
         (d)   The Hearing Board has the authority to determine that an offense
occurred, to dismiss a citation, to impose the scheduled fine, and/or to
reduce, stay, or waive a scheduled fine either unconditionally or upon
compliance with appropriate conditions. The Hearing Board may exercise
discretion to impose a fine for more than one day of continuing offense but
only upon a finding that: (i) the offenses caused a serious threat of harm to
the public health, safety, or welfare; or that (ii) the accused intentionally
and unreasonably refused to comply with the City Code requirements. The Hearing
Board’s decision and supporting reasons must be in writing and will be made by
a majority vote of the Hearing Officers.
         (e)   The failure to attend the hearing constitutes a waiver of the
accused’s rights to an administrative hearing and an admission of the offense.
A Hearing Board may waive this result upon good cause shown. Examples of good
cause are death or incapacitating illness of the accused; a court order
requiring the accused to appear for another hearing at the same time; and lack
of proper service of the notice of the hearing. Good cause does not include
forgetfulness and intentional delay.
   (E)   Judicial review. An accused may obtain judicial review of the decision
of the Hearing Board by filing a written appeal setting forth the party’s
grounds for the appeal to the Clay County District Court within 30 calendar
days of the date of the order of the Hearing Board. The Clerk of District Court
will notify the city of any such appeal, and the city shall file with the Court
all exhibits and the recording of the hearing before the Hearing Board. The
Court will review such record, and either uphold, reverse, or modify the order
of the Hearing Board, or, if the Court feels the record is insufficient, or
desires to hear arguments on the appeal, may schedule a new evidentiary hearing
on the matter, or arguments on the record, or both. The Court, unless it
schedules an evidentiary hearing, will uphold the order of the Hearing Board
unless the Court determines that the order was clearly erroneous or the civil
penalty imposed is clearly excessive.
   (F)   Recovery of civil penalties.
      (1)   If a civil penalty is not paid within the time specified, it will
constitute:
         (a)   A lien on the real property upon which the offense occurred if
the property or improvements on the property were the subject of the offense
and the property owner was found responsible for that offense; or
         (b)   A personal obligation of the offender in all other situations.
      (2)   A lien may be assessed against the property and collected in the
same manner as taxes.
      (3)   A personal obligation may be collected by appropriate legal means.
      (4)   A late payment fee of 10% of the fine may be assessed for each 30
calendar day period, or part thereof, that the fine remains unpaid after the
due date.
      (5)   The city may request the District Court, after a hearing, to hold
the offender in contempt of court for not paying the fine, and the court may
impose any such additional penalties that the Court could impose for not paying
a fine for a criminal sentence imposed by the District Court.
   (G)   Double jeopardy. If the final adjudication in the administrative
procedure is a finding of no offense, then the city may not prosecute a
criminal violation in District Court based on the same set of facts. This does
not preclude the city from pursuing a criminal conviction for a violation of
the same provision based on a different set of facts.

wastewater to a level acceptable to City of Dilworth and City of Moorhead shall
be provided, operated and maintained at the user’s expense. Detailed plans
showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted
to City of Dilworth and City of Moorhead for review, and shall be acceptable to
City of Dilworth and City of Moorhead before construction of the facility. The
review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user
from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an
effluent acceptable to City of Dilworth and City of Moorhead under the
provisions of this section. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment
facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to
City of Dilworth and City of Moorhead prior to the user’s initiation of the

pretreatment standards promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(E.P.A.) pursuant to the Act shall be met by all users which are subject to
such standards in any instance where they are more stringent than the
limitations in this section unless City of Moorhead has applied for and
obtained from the M.P.C.A. approval to modify the specific limits in the
national categorical pretreatment standards. When requested, an application for
modification of the national categorical pretreatment standards will be
considered for submittal by City of Moorhead when City of Moorhead wastewater
treatment system achieves consistent removal of the pollutants. CONSISTENT
REMOVAL shall be defined as in 40 C.F.R. § 403.7(a)(1) of the General
Pretreatment Regulations for Existing and New Sources of Pollution. Conditional
revisions of national categorical pretreatment standards may be made by the
City of Moorhead in accordance with 40 C.F.R. § 403.7(b)(2)(i-iv) of the
General Pretreatment Regulations of Existing and New Sources of Pollution if
requested by the industry(ies) in accordance with requirements of 40 C.F.R. §
403.7(b)(1)(i).

plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection
shall be submitted to the City of Dilworth and City of Moorhead for review, and
shall be approved by the City of Dilworth and City of Moorhead before
construction of the facility. Review and approval of such plans and operating
procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to
modify the user’s facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this
section.
      (2)   Accidental discharges of prohibited waste into the City of Dilworth
wastewater collection system directly or through another disposal system, or to
any place from which such waste may enter the City of Dilworth wastewater
collection system shall be reported to the Cities of Dilworth/Moorhead by the
person responsible for the discharge, or by the owners or occupants of the
premises where the discharge occurs, promptly upon obtaining knowledge of the
fact of such discharge.
   (J)   Basis for industrial wastewater charge.
      (1)   When an industrial waste discharged into the Cities of Dilworth/
Moorhead wastewater disposal system has a total biochemical oxygen demand
(TBOD) of 250 mg/l or greater or a total suspended solids (TSS) concentration
of 250 mg/l or greater, or a rated flow of 25,000/50,000 gallons or more per
day where the rated flow is:
         (a)   The daily design flow multiplied by 24 and divided by the actual
hours of discharge in a single day; and
         (b)   Flow greater than 5% of the total daily design flow of the City
of Moorhead wastewater disposal system, the normal waste charges shall be as
stated in §
52.08 hereof.
      (2)   In the event where an industrial waste charge is applicable because
of high strength waste, but the revenue generated using the charge method is
less than the revenue generated based upon flow, then the user shall be charged
the higher of the two rates.
      (3)   Whenever an industrial waste charge is determined to be applicable
to an unusually high strength waste, the analysis of which indicates total
biochemical oxygen demand and/or total suspended solids concentrations greater
than the base values to 250 mg/l and 250 mg/l respectively, then the City of
Moorhead shall apply the industrial charge to the waste of the person(s)
discharging such waste or causing it to be discharged into its disposal system.
      (4)   Industrial waste charges attributable to this section and collected
by the City of Moorhead shall be for and account of and payable to the City of
Moorhead as compensation for the costs resulting from the discharge of such
high strength waste.
      (5)   Discharges with TBOD5 concentrations between 1,000 and 1,500 mg/
l and TSS concentrations between 500 and 1,000 mg/l are accepted only under a
special contract or agreement with the City of Moorhead. Discharges above 1,500
mg/l TBOD5 and 1,000 mg/l TSS in significant volumes are prohibited. Property
owners or tenants with abnormal sewage must install and maintain devices to
sample, on a flow proportional basis, and continuously measure the wastewater
flows. The City of Moorhead shall inspect for proper operation of the devices
in regards to sample collection.

GENERAL PROVISIONS, STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
§ 53.01 PURPOSE.
   (A)   This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for storm water
management systems within the city. In the event of any conflict between the
provisions of this chapter or other regulations adopted by the city, Clay
County, State or Federal authorities, the more restrictive standard prevails.
   (B)   The objectives of this chapter are as follows:
      (1)   To promote, preserve, and enhance the natural resources within the
city from adverse or undesirable impacts occasioned by development or other
activities;
      (2)   To protect and promote the health, safety, and welfare of the
people and property through effective storm water quantity and quality
management practices.
      (3)   To regulate land development activity, land disturbing activity, or
other activities that may have an adverse and/or potentially irreversible
impact on storm water quantity, water quality and/or environmentally sensitive
lands and to encourage compatibility between such uses;
      (4)   To establish detailed review standards and procedures for land
development activities throughout the city, thereby achieving a balance between
urban growth and development and the protection of water quality; and
      (5)   To provide for adequate storm water system analysis and design as
necessary to protect public and private property, water quality and existing
natural resources.
   (C)   This chapter applies in the city and to persons outside the city who
are, by contract or agreement with the city, users of the city storm water
management system. Except as otherwise provided herein, the city shall
administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 15-02, passed 2-9-2015)
§ 53.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES (BMPs).
      (1)   The most effective and practicable means of erosion prevention and
sediment control, and water quality management practices that are the most
effective and practicable means of to control, prevent, and minimize
degradation of surface water, including avoidance of impacts,
construction-phasing, minimizing the length of time soil areas are exposed,
prohibitions, pollution prevention through good housekeeping, and other
management practices published by state or designated area-wide planning
agencies.
      (2)   Individual BMPs found in this permit are described in the current
versions of Protecting Water Quality in Urban Areas, MPCA and The Minnesota
Stormwater Manual, MPCA. BMPs must be adapted to the site and can be adopted
from other sources. However, they must be similar in purpose and at least as
effective and stringent as MPCA's BMPs. (Other sources include manufacturers
specifications, Storm Water Management for Construction Activities: Developing
Pollution Prevention Plans and Best Management Practices, U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency 1992, and Erosion Control Design Manual, Minnesota Department
of Transportation, et al., 1993).
   CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY. Includes construction activity as defined in 40
C.F.R. § 122.26(b)(14)(x) and small construction activity as defined in 40
C.F.R. § 122.26(b)(15) and CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY as defined by Minn. Rule
7090.0080, subp. 4. This includes a disturbance to the land that results in a
change in the topography, existing soil cover (both vegetative and non-
vegetative), or the existing soil topography that may result in accelerated
stormwater runoff, leading to soil erosion and movement of sediment into
surface waters or drainage systems. Examples of construction activity may
include clearing, grading, filling, and excavating. CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY
includes the disturbance of less than one acre of total land area that is a
part of a larger common plan of development or sale if the larger common plan
will ultimately disturb one acre or more. CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY does not
include a disturbance to the land of less than five acres for the purpose of
routine maintenance that is performed to maintain the original line and grade,
hydraulic capacity, or original purpose of the facility.
   DEWATERING. The removal of surface or ground water to dry and/or solidify a
construction site to enable construction activity. Dewatering may require a
Minnesota Department of Natural Recourses water appropriation permit and, if
dewatering water is contaminated, discharge of such water may require an
individual MPCA NPDES/SDS permit.
   ENERGY DISSIPATION. Methods employed at pipe outlets to prevent erosion
caused by the rapid discharge of water scouring soils. Examples include, but
are not limited to: concrete aprons, riprap, splash pads, and gabions that are
designed to prevent erosion.
   EROSION PREVENTION. Measures employed to prevent erosion. Examples include
but not limited to: soil stabilization practices, limited grading, mulch,
temporary erosion protection or permanent cover, and construction phasing.
   INFEASIBLE. Not technologically possible or not economically practicable and
achievable in light of the best industry practices. Page 13 of 14 October 2013
| wq-strm4-59q .
   INITIATED IMMEDIATELY. Taking an action to commence stabilization as soon as
practicable, but no later than the end of the work day, following the day when
the earth-disturbing activities have temporarily or permanently ceased, if the
permittee(s) know that construction work on that portion of the site will be
temporarily ceased for 14 or more additional calendar days or seven calendar
days where Appendix A.C.1.a applies. The following activities can be taken to
initiate stabilization:
      (1)   Prepping the soil for vegetative or non-vegetative stabilization;
      (2)   Applying mulch or other non-vegetative product to the exposed soil
area;
      (3)   Seeding or planting the exposed area;
      (4)   Starting any of the activities in (1) through (3), above, on a
portion of the area to be stabilized, but not on the entire area; and
      (5)   Finalizing arrangements to have stabilization product fully
installed in compliance with the applicable deadline for completing
stabilization .
   PERMANENT COVER. Surface types that will prevent soil failure under erosive
conditions. Examples include: gravel, asphalt, concrete, rip rap, roof tops,
perennial cover, or other landscaped material that will permanently arrest soil
erosion. A uniform perennial vegetative cover (i.e. evenly distributed, without
large bare areas) with a density of 70% of the native background vegetative
cover for the area must be established on all unpaved areas and areas not
covered by permanent structures, or equivalent permanent stabilization
measures. PERMANENT COVER does not include the practices listed under temporary
erosion protection.
   PROJECT(S). All construction activity that is planned and/or conducted under
a particular permit. The project will occur on the site or sites described in
the permit application, and in the associated plans, specifications and
contract documents.
   PUBLIC WATERS. All water basins and watercourses that are described in M.S.
§ 103G.005, subd. 15, as it may be amended from time to time.
   NATURAL BUFFER. An area of undisturbed cover surrounding surface waters
within which construction activities are restricted. NATURAL BUFFER includes
the vegetation, exposed rock, or barren ground that exists prior to
commencement of earth-disturbing activities.
   NORMAL WETTED PERIMETER. Te area of a conveyance, such as a ditch, channel,
or pipe that is in contact with water during flow events that are expected to
occur from a two-year 24-hour storm event.
    PERMITTEE. Ay owner or operator of a construction site that is providing
information to the City of Dilworth in order to prove that their stormwater BMP
design for during and post construction activities adequately addresses all
requirements of this chapter.
   STABILIZE, STABILIZED, STABILIZATION. The exposed ground surface has been
covered by appropriate materials such as mulch, staked sod, riprap, erosion
control blanket, mats or other material that prevents erosion from occurring.
Grass, agricultural crop or other seeding alone is not stabilization. Mulch
materials must achieve approximately 90% ground coverage (typically 2-ton/
acre).
   SEDIMENT CONTROL. Methods employed to prevent sediment from leaving the
site. SEDIMENT CONTROL practices include silt fences, sediment traps, earth
dikes, drainage swales, check dams, subsurface drains, bio rolls, rock logs,
compost logs, storm drain inlet protection, and temporary or permanent
sedimentation basins. A floating silt curtain placed in the water is not a
sediment control BMP to satisfy perimeter control requirements, except as
provided for in the SEDIMENT CONTROL part.
   STEEP SLOPES. Slopes that are 1:3 (V:H) (33.3%) or steeper in grade.
   STORMWATER. Defined under Minn. Rule 7077.0105, subpart 41(b), and includes
precipitation runoff, stormwater runoff, snowmelt runoff, and any other surface
runoff and drainage.
   SURFACE WATER or WATERS. All streams, lakes, ponds, marshes, wetlands,
reservoirs, springs, rivers, drainage systems, waterways, watercourses, and
irrigation systems whether natural or artificial, public or private, except
that surface waters do not include treatment basins or ponds that were
constructed from upland development.
   TEMPORARY EROSION PROTECTION. Methods employed to prevent erosion during
construction activities. Examples of temporary erosion protection include, but
are not limited to: straw, wood fiber blanket, wood chips, vegetation, mulch,
and rolled erosion control products.
   WATERS OF THE STATE. (As defined in M.S. § 115.01, subd. 22, as it may be
amended from time to time) means all streams, lakes, ponds, marshes,
watercourses, waterways, wells, springs, reservoirs, aquifers, irrigation
systems, drainage systems and all other bodies or accumulations of water,
surface or underground, natural or artificial, public or private, which are
contained within, flow through, or border upon the state or any portion
thereof.
(Ord. 15-02, passed 2-9-2015)
§ 53.03 CONSTRUCTION SITE STORMWATER RUNOFF CONTROL.
   (A)   Construction site stormwater runoff control.
      (1)   Permittees must develop a construction site stormwater runoff
control program that reduces pollutants in stormwater from construction
activity. The permittee must develop a stormwater pollution prevention plan
(SWPPP) for the construction site that is at least as stringent as the MPCA's
current General permit authorization to discharge stormwater associated with
construction activity under the national pollutant discharge elimination system
(NPDES) construction general permit (CGP). A copy of the permittee’s permit
coverage must be provided prior to any construction activity taking place on
sites that disturb more than one acre of land.
      (2)   The permittee shall take into consideration with their design
sections of the CGP that qualify as erosion and sediment controls or waste
controls, as follows:
         (a)   Stormwater discharge design requirements consisting of the
following:
            1. Stormwater pollution prevention plan for during construction.
            2.   Temporary sediment basins when ten acres or more drain to a
common location.
            3.   Record retention.
            4.   Training requirements.
         (b)   Construction activity requirements consisting of the following:
            1.   Stormwater pollution prevention plan implementation.
            2.   Erosion prevention practices.
            3.   Sediment control practices.
            4.   Dewatering and basin draining.
            5.   Inspections and maintenance.
            6.   Pollution prevention management measures.
            7.   Final stabilization.
   (B)   Violations and suspensions.
      (1)   Reports of violations. The city shall document the reporting of a
violation in writing. Such violations may be obtained via a site inspection or
a public complaint followed by a site inspection. At a minimum the complaint
file shall contain the name and address of the owner, date, time and nature of
the violation as well as other information as deemed necessary to document site
conditions, including photos and personal conversation records. In the case of
a public complaint the file shall also, if voluntarily provided, contain the
name address and phone number of the individual filing the complaint. In
addition the complaint file shall contain records documenting subsequent site
inspections, compliance actions and a memo outlining the determination of the
city and any enforcement action taken and/or any applicable noncompliance fees
levied.
      (2)   Emergency suspension.
         (a)   The city may for cause order the suspension of all construction
on site when the city determines that an actual or threatened discharge
presents or may present an imminent or substantial danger to the health or
welfare of persons downstream, or substantial danger to the environment. If a
suspension occurs, all work in the area shall cease immediately. If any person
is notified of such suspension and then fails to comply voluntarily with the
suspension order, the city shall commence whatever steps are necessary to
obtain compliance. The city may reinstate the construction activities on site
upon proof of compliance with all plan or applicable permit conditions.
         (b)   The city may also order the immediate suspension of all work if
a person or entity is conducting an activity for which another governing
entity's permit is needed without first obtaining the appropriate permit or
city approval. The suspension shall remain in effect until the required permit
(s) and/or city approval are obtained. Whenever the city orders the suspension
of work on a site, pursuant to the emergency provisions of this section, the
city shall serve notice on the contractor, land owner, developer or the
developer's designated representative personally, via email, or by registered
or certified mail. Any person or entity served notice has the right to an
informal hearing before the city upon request made in writing and filed with
the city.
      (3)   Non-emergency suspension. The city may order the suspension of all
construction on site for a non-emergency cause, including but not limited to:
         (a)   Violation of any terms or conditions of the applicable plan or
permit;
         (b)   False statements on any required reports and applications;
         (c)   Obtaining a plan or state permit by misrepresentation or failure
to disclose fully all relevant facts; or
         (d)   Any other violation of this chapter or related ordinance.
      (4)   Hearing. If a person requests a hearing to contest the order of the
city, a notice of hearing must be served on the person appealing the order,
specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held regarding the order of
the city, and directing the person appealing to show cause why the order of the
city should not be upheld. Unless the city has suspended the project and/or
permit or ordered work to stop pursuant, any order stopping all work shall be
stayed until after the hearing. The notice must be served personally or by
registered or certified mail at least five days before the hearing. The
evidence submitted at the hearing shall be considered by the city who shall
then uphold, modify or rescind the order of the city. An appeal of the decision
may be taken to the District Court according to law. Provided, that if the city
upholds the order stopping work, such work suspension shall not be stayed as a
result of the appeal to the District Court.
      (5)   Legal action.
         (a)   The discharge of deposited or eroded materials onto public
rights-of-way or public storm sewer systems within the city shall be considered
an offense and may result in an order to remove such materials. Removal of such
materials shall be at the Landowners or Developers expense based on the
properties from which they originated. The landowner and/or developer shall
have three days after receiving the notice to remove these materials. If such
materials are not removed, others may remove them under the city's direction
and any associated costs shall be the responsibility of the landowner and/or
developer and, if unpaid within 90 days, may be recommended for assessment
action by the City Council against property of the violator.
         (b)   If any person commences any Land disturbing activities which
result in increased storm water quantity or storm water quality degradation
into the city's storm water management system contrary to the provisions of
this chapter, federal or state requirements or any order of the city, the city
attorney may commence action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief
including administrative or criminal penalties.
   (C)   Enforcement, penalties and noncompliance fees.
      (1)   Enforcement, penalty and noncompliance fees. Any person who is
found to have violated an order of the city made in accordance with this
chapter, or who has failed to comply with any provision of this chapter and the
orders, rules, approvals, regulations and permits issued hereunder, may be
charged with a misdemeanor and be subject to the penalty provisions of §
10.99 or, alternatively, may be issued an administrative citation and be
subject to the civil penalty provisions of §
35.01. Each day on which a violation occurs or continues to exist shall be
deemed a separate and distinct offense. All land use and building permits may
be suspended until the Permittee has corrected the violation. A schedule for
noncompliance and re-inspection fees, which may be imposed for violation of
this chapter, shall be approved by the City Council.
      (2)   Liability for damage; violation. Any person violating any of the
provisions of this chapter or who initiates an activity which causes a deposit,
obstruction, or damage or other impairment to the city's stormwater system is
liable to the city for any expense, loss, or damage caused by the violation or
the discharge. The city may bill the person violating this chapter the costs
for any cleaning, repair or replacement work caused by the violation of storm
water discharge, and if unpaid within 90 days may result in assessment of such
costs against the violator's property.
      (3)   Fees recoverable. In addition to the penalties provided herein, the
city may recover reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, court reporter's
fees, and other expenses of litigation by appropriate action against the person
found to have violated this chapter or the orders, rules, approvals,
regulations and permits issued hereunder.
      (4)   Falsifying information. Any person who knowingly makes any false
statements, representations, or certification in any applicable record, report,

(Ord. 15-02, passed 2-9-2015; Ord. 22-08, passed 9-26-2022)
§ 53.04 POST CONSTRUCTION STORMWATER TREATMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   The following are post construction stormwater treatment requirements.
   (A)   Permittees must develop a post construction stormwater management
system that is at least as stringent as the current post construction
stormwater management permit conditions (Minimum Control Measure 5) as required
by the general stormwater small municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4)
permit issued to the city by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA).
   (B)   The Permittee shall take into consideration with their design sections
of the city's current MS4 permit as follows:
      (1)   Post construction stormwater management.
         (a)   Post-construction stormwater management program. Prior to start
of any construction activity, permittee shall develop and implement a post-
construction stormwater management program that utilizes any combination of
BMPs necessary to meet the following conditions on the site of a construction
activity to the maximum extent practicable (MEP):
            1.   For new development projects, no net increase from pre-project
conditions (on an annual average basis) of:
               a.   Stormwater discharge volume, unless precluded by the
stormwater management limitations outlined in division (B)(1)(b) listed below.
               b.   Stormwater discharges of total suspended solids (TSS).
               c.   Stormwater discharges of total phosphorus (TP).
            2.   For redevelopment projects, a net reduction from pre-project
conditions (on an annual average basis) of:
               a.   Stormwater discharge volume, unless precluded by the
stormwater management limitations outlined in division (B)(1)(b) listed below.
               b.   Stormwater discharges of TSS.
               c.   Stormwater discharges of TP.
         (b)   Infiltration as stormwater treatment method. The use of
infiltration as a stormwater treatment method is prohibited in the following
areas:
            1.   Where industrial facilities are not authorized to infiltrate
industrial stormwater under an NPDES/SDS industrial stormwater permit issued by
the Agency.
            2.   Where vehicle fueling and maintenance occur.
            3.   With less than three feet of separation distance from the
bottom of the infiltration system to the elevation of the seasonally saturated
soils.
            4.   Where high levels of contaminants in soil or groundwater will
be mobilized by the infiltrating stormwater.
         (c)   Infiltration as stormwater treatment method; restrictions.
            1.   The use of infiltration as stormwater treatment method will be
restricted without a detailed engineering review, to achieve no post
construction net increase in volume, TSS or TP when the infiltration device
will receive discharges from, or be constructed in:
               a.   Areas of predominately Hydrologic Soil Group D (clay)
soils.
               b.   Areas within a drinking water supply management area
(DWSMA) as defined in Minn. Rule 4720.5100, subpart. 13.
            2.   The restrictions above do not preclude proposers of
construction activity from infiltrating stormwater. Rather, the restrictions
simply require that a higher level of design and review is needed.
            3.   The permittee may have a lesser volume reduction requirement
than required division (B)(1)(a)1. and (B)(1)(a)2., above, if the project meets
one of the prohibitions or restrictions listed above and if the owner or
operator of the construction activity implements to the maximum extent
practicable (MEP) other volume reduction techniques such as evapotranspiration,
reuse/harvesting, conservation design, green roofs, etc. on site. If other
volume reduction techniques are not used, documentation must be provided on why
that decision was made.
         (d)   Linear projections, exception. For linear projects where the
lack of right-of-way precludes the installation of volume control practices
that meet the conditions for post-construction stormwater management listed
above, the permittee may be allowed an exception. This exception will only be
allowed if it is proven that a reasonable attempt was made to obtain right-of-
way during the project planning process.
         (e)   Exceptions for stormwater discharge volume. The permittee may be
allowed lesser volume control on the site of the original construction only
under the following circumstances:
            1.   The owner and/or operator of a construction activity is
precluded from infiltrating stormwater through a designed system due to any of
the infiltration related limitations described above; and
            2.   The owner and/or operator of the construction activity
implements, to the MEP, volume reduction techniques, other than infiltration,
(e.g., evapotranspiration, reuse/harvesting, conservation design, green roofs,
etc.) on the site of the original construction activity that reduces stormwater
discharge volume, but may not meet the conditions for post-construction
stormwater management in division (B)(1)(a)1. and (B)(1)(a)2., above.
         (f)   Mitigation.
            1.   Where TSS and TP has not been addressed on the site of the
original construction activity, permittee may mitigate project areas in the
following order of preference:
               a.   Locations that yield benefits to the same receiving water
that receives runoff from the original construction activity.
               b.   Locations within the same Minnesota Department of Natural
Resource (DNR) catchment area as the original construction activity.
               c.   Locations in the next adjacent DNR catchment area up-
stream.
               d.   Locations anywhere within the city's jurisdiction.
            2.   Mitigation projects must involve the creation of new
structural stormwater BMPs or the retrofit of existing structural stormwater
BMPs, or the use of a properly designed regional structural stormwater BMP.
This can include permanent stormwater ponding.
            3.   Routine maintenance of structural stormwater BMPs already
required by this permit cannot be used to meet mitigation requirements of this
part.
            4.   Mitigation projects shall be completed within 24 months after
the start of the original construction activity.
            5.   The city shall determine, and document, who will be
responsible for long-term maintenance on all mitigation projects of this part.
            6.   If the city receives payment from the owner and/or operator of
a construction activity for mitigation purposes in lieu of the owner or
operator of that construction activity meeting the conditions for post-
construction stormwater management called out in this chapter, the city shall
apply any such payment received to a public stormwater project, and all
projects must be in compliance with this division (B)(1)(f), above.
         (g)   Wet sedimentation basins as a method of mitigation.
            1.   It is recognized that the vast majority of the city has Class
D soils unsuitable for infiltration.
            2.   If permittee provides supporting documents that this is the
case for the construction site and chooses to proceed with the installation of
a wet sedimentation basin as a means of mitigation, the following requirements
shall be met.
               a.   For new development projects in currently undeveloped
areas: Wet sedimentation basins shall be constructed as required by the current
MPCA CGP permit with the additional requirement that live storage in wet
sedimentation basins shall be of sufficient size to retain the 100-year rain
event for the watershed area and shall release stormwater runoff at a rate
required by the current MPCA CGP permit.
               b.   For currently developed areas or re-development areas: Wet
sedimentation basins shall be constructed as required by the current MPCA CGP
permit.
               c.   Permittee shall submit to the city design calculations
showing that the above criteria has been met for the construction site.
         (h)   Long-term maintenance of structural stormwater BMPs. Where BMP's
are to remain in place post construction as part of the post-construction
stormwater management, permittee shall comply with the following:
            1.   All BMPs shall be designed to minimize the need for
maintenance, to provide easy vehicle (typically eight feet or wider) and
personnel access for maintenance purposes, and to be structurally sound. All
BMPs shall have a plan of operation and maintenance that assures continued
effective removal of pollutants carried in storm water runoff. The city or City
Engineer may inspect all public and private BMPs at any time. Inspection
records will be kept on file at the city's office. It shall be the
responsibility of the permittee to obtain any necessary easements or other
property interests to allow access to the BMPs for inspection and maintenance
purposes. The city shall retain enforcement powers for assuring adequate
operation and maintenance activities through approval conditions, penalties,
noncompliance orders and fees.
            2.   In the event that a structural stormwater BMP becomes less
effective, new or improved structural stormwater BMPs must be implemented to
ensure the conditions for post-construction stormwater management in division
(B)(1)(a)1. and (B)(1)(a)2., above.
         (i)   Site plan review.
            1.   Prior to any construction activities taking place, permittee
shall provide to the city two sets of legible copies of the site plan prepared
to a scale appropriate to the site of the project and suitable for performing
the review. The site plan shall include post-construction stormwater management
BMPs.
            2.   Site plan approval issued under this chapter runs with the
land and is a condition of plat or development approval. Any landowner or
subsequent landowner of any parcel within the plat or development area must
comply with the plan or any approval, condition, revision or modification of
the plan. Failure to comply with this plan shall constitute a violation and
subject the permittee, developer, and/or landowner to enforcement provisions,
penalties and any applicable noncompliance fees.
   (C)   It is unlawful to initiate any land development activity, land
disturbing activity, or other activities which may result in an increase in
storm water quantities, degradation of storm water quality, or restriction of
flow in any storm sewer system, open ditch or natural channel, storm water
easement, water body, or wetland outlet within the jurisdiction of the city,
without having first complied with the terms of this chapter.
   (D)   A processing and approval fee may be adopted by the City Council. This
fee shall accompany all applications for site plan review and approval.
   (E)   Approval of any plan submitted under the provisions of this chapter
shall expire one year after the date of approval unless construction has
commenced in accordance with the plan. However, if prior to the expiration of
approval, the Applicant makes a written request to the City for an extension of
time to commence construction setting forth the reasons for the requested
extension, the City may grant one extension of not greater than one year. The
city shall make a decision on the extension within 30 days of receipt. Any plan
may be revised following the same procedure for an original approval. The city
may waive all or part of any applicable application fees if the revision is
minor. Any denied or expired application may be resubmitted with additional
information addressing the concerns contained within the denial or the reason
why the original plan was allowed to expire. The resubmitted application shall
be subject to all applicable fees and review time lines as if it were a new
application.
   (F)   It shall be the applicant's responsibility to obtain any required
permits from other governmental agencies having any jurisdictional authority
over the work to be performed. Typically, such agencies include, but are not
limited to the Buffalo-Red River Watershed District, Clay County, the Minnesota
Department of Natural Resources, the Minnesota Department of Transportation,
the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, the State Historical Preservation
Office, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Minnesota Department of Health
and others. The City may choose to obtain some of the required permits. The
Applicant will be notified which permits are to be obtained by the city.
   (G)   Other than those outlined in the SWPPP or as required in section 2-01,
any hydrologic models and/or design methodologies used to determine runoff
conditions and to analyze storm water management structures and facilities,
shall be approved in advance by the city or City Engineer. All storm water
management plans, drawings, specifications, and computations for storm water
management facilities submitted for review shall contain a validated seal and
shall be signed by a professional engineer registered in the State of
Minnesota. The requirement of having a professional engineer sign the documents
may be waived by the city.
   (H)   The city for just cause upon 30-day notice may modify any city
approval that was made regarding any storm water management plan proposed by
the permittee. Just cause shall include but not be limited to:
      (1)   Promulgation of new federal, state or local regulatory
requirements;
      (2)   Changes in the requirements of this chapter;
      (3)   Changes in the process used by the permittee or changes in
discharge rate, volume, or character; and
      (4)   Changes in the design or capability of receiving storm water
systems.
   (I)   Upon completion of all required construction activities, the permittee
shall submit to the city record drawings to document any changes or material
modifications to the original plan concept. The record drawings shall show the
final configuration for all improvements as constructed. A professional
engineer registered in the State of Minnesota shall certify the record
drawings. If no significant or material changes occurred between the approved
plan and final construction, the record drawings need not be submitted to the
city. The permittee, however, is responsible to retain copies of said drawings
and provide them to the city upon request. Failure to provide these drawings
upon written request constitutes a violation of this chapter.

shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm
drain system or watercourses through the use of these structural and non-
structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premise that
is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to
implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and non-structural
BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the MS4. Compliance with
all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of
storm water associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable,
shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs
shall be part of a storm water management plan (SWMP) as necessary for
compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.

responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response
for a facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release
of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or
pollutants discharging into storm water, the storm drain system, or waters of
the United States, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the
discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a
release of hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency
response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the
event of a release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the
city in person or by phone no later than the next business day. Notifications
in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed
to the city within two business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of
prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment,
the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site
written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its
recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least five years.
   (B)   Failure to provide notification of a release as provided above is a
violation of this chapter.

to the penalties set forth in this chapter or to the enforcement actions
outlined in this section or may be restrained by injunction or otherwise abated
in a manner provided by law.
      (2)   In the event the violation constitutes an immediate danger to
public health or public safety, the city is authorized to enter upon the
subject private property, without giving prior notice, to take any and all
measures necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property. The city
is authorized to seek costs of the abatement as outlined in §
53.30.
   (B)   Warning notice. When the city finds that any person has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, or any order issued
hereunder, the city may serve upon that person a written warning notice,
specifying the particular violation believed to have occurred and requesting
the discharger to immediately investigate the matter and to seek a resolution
whereby any offending discharge will cease. Investigation and/or resolution of
the matter in response to the warning notice in no way relieves the alleged
violator of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of
the warning notice. Nothing in this subsection shall limit the authority of the
city to take any action, including emergency action or any other enforcement
action, without first issuing a warning notice.
   (C)   Notice of violation.
      (1)   Whenever the city finds that a person has violated a prohibition or
failed to meet a requirement of this chapter the city may order compliance by
written notice of violation to the responsible person.
      (2)   The notice of violation shall contain:
         (a)   The name and address of the alleged violator;
         (b)   The address when available or a description of the building,
structure or land upon which the violation is occurring, or has occurred;
         (c)   A statement specifying the nature of the violation;
         (d)   A description of the remedial measures necessary to restore
compliance with this chapter and a time schedule for the completion of such
remedial action;
         (e)   A statement of the penalty or penalties that shall or may be
assessed against the person to whom the notice of violation is directed;
         (f)   A statement that the determination of violation may be appealed
to the city by filing a written notice of appeal within seven days of service
of notice of violation; and
         (g)   A statement specifying that, should the violator fail to restore
compliance within the established time schedule, the work will be done by a
designated governmental agency or a contractor and the expense thereof shall be
charged to the violator. Such notice may require without limitation:
            1.   The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;
            2.   The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;
            3.   That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall
cease and desist;
            4.   The abatement or remediation of storm water pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property;
            5.   Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation
costs; and
            6.   The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
   (D)   Compensatory action. In lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties,
and remedies authorized by this chapter, the city may impose upon a violator
alternative compensatory actions, such as storm drain stenciling, attendance at
compliance workshops, creek cleanup, etc.
   (E)   Suspension of MS4 access.
      (1)   Emergency cease and desist orders.
         (a)   When the city finds that any person has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this chapter, or any order issued hereunder, or
that the person's past violations are likely to recur, and that the person's
violation(s) has (have) caused or contributed to an actual or threatened
discharge to the MS4 or waters of the United States which reasonably appears to
present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons or to the environment, city may issue an order to the violator
directing it immediately to cease and desist all such violations and directing
the violator to:
            1.   Immediately comply with all ordinance requirements; and
            2.   Take such appropriate preventive action as may be needed to
properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including immediately
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
         (b)   Any person notified of an emergency order directed to it under
this subdivision shall immediately comply and stop or eliminate its endangering
discharge. In the event of a discharger's failure to immediately comply
voluntarily with the emergency order, the city may take such steps as deemed
necessary to prevent or minimize harm to the MS4 or waters of the United
States, and/or endangerment to persons or to the environment, including
immediate termination of a facility's water supply, sewer connection, or other
municipal utility services. The city may allow the person to recommence its
discharge when it has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city that the
period of endangerment has passed, unless further termination proceedings are
initiated against the discharger under this chapter. A person that is

citation may be issued. Upon reapplication for a tag license or a microchip
license for the dog or cat, the city, in addition to requiring the usual
license fee, may require a relicensing fee.

acquiring ownership of, or possession of, unlicensed dogs or cats, or who
establishes residence in the city subsequent to January 31, has ten days after
acquiring possession or ownership of or establishing residence within the city,

shall be so placed on the dog's or cat's collar or harness as to be seen
readily by law enforcement officers upon inspection. On issuing a microchip
license for a dog or cat, the City Administrator shall retain the name of the

training apparatus, paraphernalia or drugs used to prepare such dogs to fight
with other animals.
      (2)   Beginning six months after a dog is declared dangerous or
potentially dangerous, an owner may request annually that the city review the
designation. The owner must provide evidence that the dog’s behavior has
changed due to the dog’s age, neutering, environment, completion of obedience
training or other factors. If enough evidence is provided, the city may rescind
the designation.
      (3)   Exceptions.
         (a)   The provisions of this section do not apply to dogs used by law
enforcement.
         (b)   Dogs may not be declared dangerous or potentially dangerous if
the threat, injury or danger was sustained by a person who was:
            1.   Committing a willful trespass or other tort upon the premises
occupied by the owner of the dog;
            2.   Provoking, tormenting, abusing or assaulting the dog, or who
can be shown to have a history of repeatedly provoking, tormenting, abusing or
assaulting the dog; or
            3.   Committing or attempting to commit a crime.
   (D)   License required. The owner must annually license dangerous and
potentially dangerous dogs with the city and must license a newly declared
dangerous or potentially dangerous dog within 14 days after notice that a dog
has been declared dangerous or potentially dangerous. Regardless of any appeal
that may be requested, the owner must comply with the requirements of M.S. §
347.52(a) and (c), as it may be amended from time to time, regarding proper
enclosures and notification to the city upon transfer or death of the dog,
until and unless a hearing officer or court of law reverses the declaration.
      (1)   Process for dangerous dogs. The city will issue a license to the
owner of a dangerous dog if the owner presents sufficient evidence that:
         (a)   There is a proper enclosure;
         (b)   Written proof that there is a surety bond by a surety company
authorized to conduct business in the state in the sum of at least $300,000,
payable to any person injured by a dangerous dog, or receipt of a copy of a
policy of liability insurance issued by an insurance company authorized to do
business in the state in the amount of at least $300,000, insuring the owner
for any personal injuries inflicted by the dangerous dog. Such surety bond or
insurance policy shall provide that no cancellation of the bond or policy will
be made unless the city is notified in writing by the surety company or the
insurance company at least ten days prior to such cancellation;
         (c)   The owner has paid the annual license fee for dangerous dogs as
established in the fee schedule in §
34.01 of this code of ordinances;
         (d)   The owner has had a microchip identification implanted in the
dangerous dog. The name of the microchip manufacturer and identification number
of the microchip must be provided to the city. If the microchip is not
implanted by the owner, it may be implanted by the city at the owner’s expense;
and
         (e)   The owner provides proof that the dog has been sterilized. If
the owner does not sterilize the dog within 30 days, the city may seize the dog
and sterilize it at the owner’s expense.
      (2)   Process for potentially dangerous dogs. The city will issue a
license to the owner of a potentially dangerous dog if the owner presents
sufficient evidence that:
         (a)   There is a proper enclosure;
         (b)   The owner has paid the annual license fee; and
         (c)   The owner has had a microchip identification implanted in the
potentially dangerous dog. The name of the microchip manufacturer and
identification number of the microchip must be provided to the city. If the
microchip is not implanted by the owner, it may be implanted by the city at the
owner’s expense.
      (3)   Inspection. A pre-license inspection of the premises to insure
compliance with the city code is required. If the city issues a license to the
owner of a dangerous or potentially dangerous dog, the city shall be allowed at
any reasonable time to inspect the dog, the proper enclosure and all places
where the animal is kept.
      (4)   Warning symbol. The owner of a dangerous dog licensed under this
section must post a sign with the uniform dangerous dog warning symbol on the
property in order to inform children that there is a dangerous dog on the
property. The sign will be provided by the city upon issuance of the license.
      (5)   Tags. A dangerous dog licensed under this section must wear a
standardized, easily identifiable tag at all times that contains the uniform
dangerous dog symbol, identifying the dog as dangerous. The tag shall be
provided by the city upon issuance of the license.
      (6)   License fee. The city will charge the owner an annual license fee
for a dangerous or potentially dangerous dog as established in the fee schedule
as codified in §
34.01 of this code of ordinances, as it may be amended from time to time.
   (E)   Properly restrained in proper enclosure or outside of proper
enclosure. While on the owner’s property, an owner of a dangerous or
potentially dangerous dog must keep it in a proper enclosure. Inside a
residential home, there must be a secured area maintained where the dog will
stay when persons other than family members are present. If the dog is outside
the proper enclosure, the dog must be muzzled and restrained by a substantial
chain or leash no longer than four feet and under the physical restraint of an
adult. The muzzle must be made in a manner that will prevent the dog from
biting any person or animal, but that will not cause injury to the dog or
interfere with its vision or respiration.
   (F)   Notification requirements to city.
      (1)   Relocation or death. The owner of a dog that has been declared
dangerous or potentially dangerous must notify the City Administrator in
writing if the dog is to be relocated from its current address or if the dog
has died. The notification must be given in writing within 30 days of the
relocation or death. The notification must include the current owner’s name and
address, and the new owner’s name and the relocation address. If the relocation
address is outside of the city, the city may notify the local law enforcement
agency of the transfer of the dog into its jurisdiction.
      (2)   Renter’s obligations. A person who owns or possess as a dangerous
or potentially dangerous dog and who will rent property from another where the
dog will reside must disclose to the property owner prior to entering the lease
agreement and at the time of any lease renewal periods that the person owns or
possesses a dangerous or potentially dangerous dog that will reside at the
property. A dog owner, who is currently renting property, must notify the
property owner within 14 days of city notification if the owned dog is newly
declared as dangerous or potentially dangerous and the owner keeps the dog on
the property.
      (3)   Transfer of ownership into the city. No dog that has been
previously determined to be dangerous or potentially dangerous by another
jurisdiction shall be kept, owned or harbored in the city unless the dog’s
owner complies with the requirements of this section prior to bringing the dog
into the city. Dogs in violation of this division (F)(3) are subject to
impoundment and destruction.
   (G)   Seizure. Animal control may immediately seize any dangerous or
potentially dangerous dog if:
      (1)   After 14 days after the owner has notice that the dog is declared
dangerous or potentially dangerous, the dog is not validly licensed and no
appeal has been filed;
      (2)   After 14 days after the owner has notice that the dog is dangerous,
the owner does not secure the proper liability insurance or surety coverage as
required or such required insurance is cancelled;
      (3)   The dog is not maintained in a proper enclosure;
      (4)   The dog is outside the proper enclosure and not under proper
restraint, as required by division (E) above;
      (5)   After 30 days after the owner has notice that the dog is dangerous,
the dog is not sterilized, as required by division (D)(1)(e) above;
      (6)   The dog’s microchip has been removed.
   (H)   Reclamation. A dog seized under division (G) above may be reclaimed by
the owner of the dog upon payment of maintenance costs, and presenting proof to
animal control that the requirements of this section have been met. A dog not
reclaimed under this division (H) within seven days may be disposed of and the
owner will be liable to the city for maintenance costs. A person claiming an
interest in a seized dog may prevent disposition of the dog by posting a
security in an amount sufficient to provide for the dog’s maintenance costs.
The security must be posted with the city within seven days of the seizure
inclusive of the date seized.
   (I)   Subsequent offenses: seizure. If a person has been convicted of
violating a provision of this section, and the person is charged with a
subsequent violation relating to the same dog, the dog may be seized. If the
owner is convicted of the crime for which the dog was seized, the court may
order that the dog be destroyed in a proper and humane manner and the owner pay
the maintenance costs. If the owner is not convicted and the dog is not
reclaimed by the owner within seven days after the owner has been notified that
the dog may be reclaimed, the dog may be disposed of in manner permitted by
law.
   (J)   Notice, hearings.
      (1)   Notice. After a dog has been declared dangerous or potentially
dangerous or has been seized for destruction, the city shall give notice by
delivering or mailing it to the owner of the dog, or by posting a copy of it at
the place where the dog is kept, or by delivering it to a person residing on
the property, and telephoning, if possible. The notice shall include:
         (a)   A description of the seized dog; the authority for and purpose
of the declaration and seizure; the time, place, and circumstances under which
the dog was declared; and the telephone number and contact person where the dog
is kept;
         (b)   A statement that the owner of the dog may request a hearing
concerning the declaration and that failure to do so within 14 days of the date
of the notice will terminate the owner’s right to a hearing;
         (c)   A statement that if an appeal request is made within 14 days of
the notice, the owner must immediately comply with the requirements of M.S. §
347.52(a) and (c), as they may be amended from time to time, regarding proper
enclosures and notification to the city upon transfer or death of the dog,
until such time as the hearing officer issues an opinion;
         (d)   A statement that if the hearing officer affirms the dangerous
dog declaration, the owner will have 14 days from receipt of that decision to

is abated by the owner or occupant, it will be abated by the city at the
expense of the owner or occupant. The notice shall specify the control measures

§ 93.01 FINDINGS, PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   To provide for the health, safety and welfare of its citizens, and to
ensure the integrity of its streets and the appropriate use of the rights-of-
way, the city strives to keep its rights-of-way in a state of good repair and
free from unnecessary encumbrances.
   (B)   Accordingly, the city hereby enacts this new chapter of this code
relating to right-of-way permits and administration. This chapter imposes
reasonable regulation on the placement and maintenance of facilities and
equipment currently within its rights-of-way or to be placed therein at some
future time. It is intended to complement the regulatory roles of state and
federal agencies. Under this chapter, persons excavating and obstructing the
rights-of-way will bear financial responsibility for their work. Finally, this
chapter provides for recovery of out-of-pocket and projected costs from persons
using the public rights-of-way.
   (C)   This chapter shall be interpreted consistently with 1997 Session Laws,
Chapter 123, substantially codified in M.S. §§ 237.16, 237.162, 237.163,
237.79, 237.81 and 238.086 (the “Act”), as they may be amended from time to
time, and the other laws governing applicable rights of the city and users of
the right-of-way. This chapter shall also be interpreted consistent with Minn.
Rules parts 7819.0050 through 7819.9950 where possible. To the extent any
provision of this chapter cannot be interpreted consistently with the Minnesota
Rules, that interpretation most consistent with the Act and other applicable
statutory and case law is intended. This chapter shall not be interpreted to
limit the regulatory and police powers of the city to adopt and enforce general
ordinances necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public.

§ 93.15 OTHER OBLIGATIONS.
   (A)   Compliance with other laws. Obtaining a right-of-way permit does not
relieve permittee of its duty to obtain all other necessary permits, licenses
and authority and to pay all fees required by the city or other applicable
rule, law or regulation. A permittee shall comply with all requirements of
local, state and federal laws, including, but not limited to, M.S. §§ 216D.01
through 216D.09 (Gopher One-Call Excavation Notice System), as it may be
amended from time to time, and Minn. Rules Chapter 7560. A permittee shall

city, no right-of-way obstruction or excavation may be done when seasonally
prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable for such work.

area, unless parked in conformance with city parking regulations. The loading
or unloading of trucks must be done solely within the defined permit area

permittees employing trenchless excavation methods, including, but not limited
to, horizontal directional drilling, shall follow all requirements set forth in
M.S. Chapter 216D, as it may be amended from time to time, and Minn. Rules
Chapter 7560, and shall require potholing or open cutting over existing

(Ord. 12-03, passed 3-26-2012)
§ 93.17 INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS.

performed in the right-of-way shall be done in conformance with Minn. Rules
parts 7819.1100 and 7819.5000 and other applicable local requirements, in so

10.20 of this code of ordinances, the permittee shall make the work-site
available to the city and to all others as authorized by law for inspection at
all reasonable times during the execution of and upon completion of the work.
   (C)   Authority of Director.
      (1)   At the time of inspection, the Director may order the immediate
cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the life, health, safety
or well-being of the public.
      (2)   The Director may issue an order to the permittee for any work that
does not conform to the terms of the permit or other applicable standards,
conditions or codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the
violation will be cause for revocation of the permit. Within ten days after
issuance of the order, the permittee shall present proof to the Director that
the violation has been corrected. If such proof has not been presented within
the required time, the Director may revoke the permit pursuant to § 
93.21.

§ 93.19 WORK DONE WITHOUT A PERMIT.
   (A)   Emergency situations. Each registrant shall immediately notify the
Director of any event regarding its facilities that it considers to be an
emergency. The registrant may proceed to take whatever actions are necessary to
respond to the emergency. Excavators’ notification to Gopher State One-Call
regarding an emergency situation does not fulfill this requirement. Within two
business days after the occurrence of the emergency, the registrant shall apply
for the necessary permits, pay the fees associated therewith, and fulfill the
rest of the requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with this
chapter for the actions it took in response to the emergency. If the city
becomes aware of an emergency regarding a registrant’s facilities, the city
will attempt to contact the local representative of each registrant affected,
or potentially affected, by the emergency. In any event, the city may take
whatever action it deems necessary to respond to the emergency, the cost of
which shall be borne by the registrant whose facilities occasioned the
emergency.
   (B)   Non-emergency situations. Except in an emergency, any person who,
without first having obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or excavates a
right-of-way must subsequently obtain a permit and, as a penalty, pay double
the normal fee for said permit, pay double all the other fees required by the
city code, deposit with the city the fees necessary to correct any damage to
the right-of-way, and comply with all of the requirements of this chapter.
(Ord. 12-03, passed 3-26-2012)
§ 93.20 SUPPLEMENTARY NOTIFICATION.
   If the obstruction or excavation of the right-of-way begins later or ends
sooner than the date given on the permit, the permittee shall notify the city
of the accurate information as soon as this information is known.
(Ord. 12-03, passed 3-26-2012)
§ 93.21 REVOCATION OF PERMITS.
   (A)   Substantial breach.
      (1)   The city reserves its right, as provided herein, to revoke any
right-of-way permit without a fee refund, if there is a substantial breach of
the terms and conditions of any statute, ordinance, rule or regulation, or any
material condition of the permit.
      (2)   A substantial breach by permittee shall include, but shall not be
limited to, the following:
         (a)   The violation of any material provision of the right-of-way
permit;
         (b)   An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the
right-of-way permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or
deceit upon the city or its citizens;
         (c)   Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a
right-of-way permit;
         (d)   The failure to complete the work in a timely manner, unless a
permit extension is obtained or unless the failure to complete work is due to
reasons beyond the permittee’s control; or
         (e)   The failure to correct, in a timely manner, work that does not
conform to a condition indicated on an order issued pursuant to §
93.18.
   (B)   Written notice of breach. If the city determines that the permittee
has committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any statute,
ordinance, rule, regulation or any condition of the permit, the city shall make
a written demand upon the permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall
state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. A
substantial breach, as stated above, will allow the city, at its discretion, to
place additional or revised conditions on the permit to mitigate and remedy the
breach.
   (C)   Response to notice of breach. Within 24 hours of receiving
notification of the breach, the permittee shall provide the city with a plan,
acceptable to the city, that will cure the breach. A permittee’s failure to so
contact the city, or the permittee’s failure to timely submit an acceptable
plan, or the permittee’s failure to reasonably implement the approved plan,
shall be cause for immediate revocation of the permit. Further, the permittee’s
failure to so contact the city, or the permittee’s failure to submit an
acceptable plan, or the permittee’s failure to reasonably implement the
approved plan, shall automatically place the permittee on probation for one
full year.
   (D)   Cause for probation. From time to time, the city may establish a list
of conditions of the permit, which if breached will automatically place the
permittee on probation for one full year, such as, but not limited to, working
out of the allotted time period or working on right-of-way grossly outside of
the permit authorization.
   (E)   Automatic revocation. If a permittee, while on probation, commits a
breach as outlined above, the permittee’s permit will automatically be revoked
and the permittee will not be allowed further permits for one full year, except
for emergency repairs.
   (F)   Reimbursement of city costs. If a permit is revoked, the permittee
shall also reimburse the city for the city’s reasonable costs, including
restoration costs and the costs of collection and reasonable attorneys’ fees
incurred in connection with such revocation.
(Ord. 12-03, passed 3-26-2012)
§ 93.22 MAPPING DATA.
   (A)   Information required. Each registrant and permittee shall provide
mapping information required by the city in accordance with Minn. Rules parts
7819.4000 and 7819.4100. Within 90 days following completion of any work
pursuant to a permit, the permittee shall provide the Director accurate maps
and drawings certifying the “as-built” location of all equipment installed,
owed and maintained by the permittee. Such maps and drawings shall include the
horizontal and vertical location of all facilities and equipment and shall be
provided consistent with the city’s electronic mapping system, when practical
or as a condition imposed by the Director. Failure to provide maps and drawings
pursuant to this division (A) shall be grounds for revoking the permit holder’s
registration.
   (B)   Service laterals.
      (1)   All permits issued for the installation or repair of service
laterals, other than minor repairs as defined in Minn. Rules part 7560.0150,
subpart 2, shall require the permittee’s use of appropriate means of
establishing the horizontal locations of installed service laterals, and the
service lateral vertical locations in those cases where the Director reasonably

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 111.01 ADOPTION OF STATE LAW BY REFERENCE.
   The provisions of M.S. Chapter 340A, as it may be amended from time to time,
with reference to the definition of terms, conditions of operation,
restrictions on consumption, provisions relating to sales, hours of sale, and
all other matters pertaining to the retail sale, distribution, and consumption
of intoxicating liquor and 3.2% malt liquor are hereby adopted by reference and
are made a part of this chapter as if set out in full. It is the intention of
the City Council that all future amendments to M.S. Chapter 340A are hereby
adopted by reference or referenced as if they had been in existence at the time
this chapter is adopted.
(Ord. 17-02, passed 7-26-2017)
§ 111.02 CITY MAY BE MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN STATE LAW.
   The Council is authorized by the provisions of M.S. § 340A.509, as it may be
amended from time to time, to impose, and has imposed in this chapter,
additional restrictions on the sale and possession of alcoholic beverages
within its limits beyond those contained in M.S. Chapter 340A, as it may be
amended from time to time.
(Ord. 17-02, passed 7-26-2017)
§ 111.03 DEFINITIONS.
   In addition to the definitions contained in M.S. § 340A.101, as it may be
amended from time to time, the following terms are defined for purposes of this
chapter:
   LIQUOR. As used in this chapter, without modification by the words
“intoxicating” or “3.2% malt,” includes both intoxicating liquor and 3.2% malt
liquor.
   RESTAURANT. An eating facility, other than a hotel, under the control of a
single proprietor or manager, where meals are regularly prepared on the
premises, where full waitress/waiter table service is provided, where a
customer orders food from printed menus and where the main food course is
served and consumed while seated at a single location. To be a RESTAURANT as
defined by this section, an establishment shall have a license from the state
as required by M.S. § 157.16, as it may be amended from time to time, and meet
the definition of either a “small establishment,” “medium establishment” or
“large establishment” as defined in M.S. § 157.16, subd. 3(d), as it may be
amended from time to time. An establishment which serves prepackaged food that
receives heat treatment and is served in the package or frozen pizza that is
heated and served, shall not be considered to be a restaurant for purposes of
this chapter unless it meets the definitions of “small establishment”, “medium
establishment” or “large establishment.”
(Ord. 17-02, passed 7-26-2017)
§ 111.04 NUDITY ON THE PREMISES OF LICENSED ESTABLISHMENTS PROHIBITED.
   (A)   The City Council finds that it is in the best interests of the public
health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the city that nudity is
prohibited as provided in this section on the premises of any establishment
licensed under this chapter. This is to protect and assist the owners,
operators, and employees of the establishment, as well as patrons and the
public in general, from harm stemming from the physical immediacy and
combination of alcohol, nudity, and sex. The Council especially intends to
prevent any subliminal endorsement of sexual harassment or activities likely to
lead to the possibility of various criminal conduct, including prostitution,
sexual assault, and disorderly conduct. The Council also finds that the
prohibition of nudity on the premises of any establishment licensed under this
chapter, as set forth in this section, reflects the prevailing community
standards of the city.
   (B)   It is unlawful for any licensee to permit or allow any person or
persons on the licensed premises when the person does not have his or her
buttocks, anus, breasts, and genitals covered with a non-transparent material.
It is unlawful for any person to be on the licensed premises when the person
does not have his or her buttocks, anus, breasts, and genitals covered with a
non-transparent material.
   (C)   A violation of this section is a misdemeanor punishable as provided by
law, and is justification for revocation or suspension of any liquor, wine, or
3.2% malt liquor license or the imposition of a civil penalty under the
provisions of §
111.99(B).
(Ord. 17-02, passed 7-26-2017) Penalty, see §
111.99
§ 111.05 CONSUMPTION IN PUBLIC PLACES.
   No person shall consume intoxicating liquor or 3.2% malt liquor in a public
park, on any public street, sidewalk, parking lot or alley, or in any public
place other than on the premises of an establishment licensed under this
chapter, in a municipal liquor dispensary if one exists in the city, or where
the consumption and display of liquor is lawfully permitted.
(Ord. 17-02, passed 7-26-2017) Penalty, see §
111.99
LICENSING
§ 111.20 NUMBER OF LICENSES WHICH MAY BE ISSUED.
   State law establishes the number of liquor licenses that a city may issue.
However, the number of licenses which may be granted under this chapter is
limited to the number of licenses which were issued as of the effective date of
this chapter, even if a larger number of licenses are authorized by law or
election. The Council in its sound discretion may provide by ordinance that a
larger number of licenses may be issued up to the number of licenses authorized
by M.S. Chapter 340A, as it may be amended from time to time. If a larger
number of licenses in a particular category has been authorized by a referendum
held under the provisions of M.S. § 340A.413, subd. 3, as it may be amended
from time to time, but not all of them have been issued, the larger number of
licenses is no longer in effect until the Council by ordinance determines that
any or all of the licenses may be issued. The Council is not required to issue
the full number of licenses that it has available.
(Ord. 17-02, passed 7-26-2017)
§ 111.21 TERM AND EXPIRATION OF LICENSES.

of the Council. Any transfer of stock of a corporate licensee is deemed to be a
transfer of the license, and a transfer of stock without prior Council approval
is a ground for revocation of the license. An application to transfer a license
shall be treated the same as an application for a new license, and all of the

§ 111.29 INVESTIGATION.
   (A)   Preliminary background and financial investigation. On an initial
application for a license, on an application for transfer of a license and, in
the sound discretion of the Council that it is in the public interest to do so,
on an application for renewal of a license, the city shall conduct a
preliminary background and financial investigation of the applicant or it may
contract with the Commissioner of Public Safety for the investigation. The
applicant shall pay with the application an investigation fee of $500 which
shall be in addition to any license fee. If the cost of the preliminary
investigation is less than $500, the unused balance shall be returned to the
applicant. The results of the preliminary investigation shall be sent to the
Commissioner of Public Safety if the application is for an on-sale intoxicating
liquor license or an on-sale wine license.
   (B)   Comprehensive background and financial investigation. If the results
of a preliminary investigation warrant, in the sound discretion of the Council,
a comprehensive background and financial investigation, the Council may either
conduct the investigation itself or contract with the Commissioner of Public
Safety for the investigation. The investigation fee for this comprehensive
background and financial investigation to be paid by the applicant shall be
$500, less any amount paid for the initial investigation if the investigation
is to be conducted within the state, and $10,000, less any amount paid for the
initial investigation, if the investigation is required outside the state. The
unused balance of the fee shall be returned to the applicant whether or not the
application is denied. The fee shall be paid in advance of any investigation
and the amount actually expended on the investigation shall not be refundable
in the event the application is denied. The results of the comprehensive
investigation shall be sent to the Commissioner of Public Safety if the
application is for an on-sale intoxicating liquor license or an on-sale wine
license.

in its sound discretion on-sale licenses to those listed in M.S. § 340A.404,
subd. 1(4), as it may be amended from time to time. The number of on-sale
licenses issued under this section is governed by M.S. § 340A.413, as it may be
amended from time to time, as limited by the provisions of this chapter.
Pursuant to a ballot question in the November 5, 1996 general election, the
number of permitted on-sale licenses under this section may exceed that of what
is listed in M.S. § 340A.413, as it may be amended from time to time.

   (B)   The Council shall impose a civil penalty of up to $2,000 for each
violation of M.S. Chapter 340A, as it may be amended from time to time, and of

order for the Council to impose the civil penalty. A hearing under the
Administrative Procedures Act, M.S. §§ 14.57 to 14.69, as it may be amended
from time to time, is not required before the penalty is imposed, but the
Council shall hold a hearing on the proposed violation and the proposed penalty
and hear any person who wishes to speak. Non-payment of the penalty is grounds
for suspension or revocation of the license. The following is the minimum
schedule of presumptive civil penalties which must be imposed in addition to
any suspension unless the license is revoked:
      (1)   For the first violation within any three-year period, $500.

violations of the provisions of this chapter, or of M.S. Chapter 340A, as it
may be amended from time to time or any rules promulgated under that chapter as
they may be amended from time to time. The number of violations shall be
determined on the basis of the history of violations for the preceding three-
year period. Revocation shall occur within 60 days following a violation for
which revocation is imposed.

§ 113.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.

transient (i.e., temporary, mobile) merchants wishing to conduct business
within the city. This subchapter provides requirements that promote the health,
safety, morals and general welfare of the citizens of the city and establish
reasonable and uniform regulations for transient merchants.
(Ord. 14-02, passed 7-14-2014)

   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definition shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   TRANSIENT MERCHANT/BUSINESS. Includes any person, individual, co-
partnership, limited liability company and corporation, both as principal and
agent, who engage in, do or transact any temporary and transient business in
the city, either in one locality, or in traveling from place to place within
the city selling goods, wares and merchandise; and who, for the purpose of
carrying on such business, hire, lease, occupy or use a building, structure,
vacant lot or railroad car for the exhibition and sale of such goods, wares and
merchandise. The term TRANSIENT MERCHANT does not include a seller or exhibitor
in a firearms collector show involving two or more sellers or exhibitors.
(Ord. 14-02, passed 7-14-2014)
§ 113.03 PROCEDURE FOR OPERATING AS A TRANSIENT MERCHANT.
   (A)   Anyone wishing to operate a transient merchant must first obtain a
permit from City Hall. No person shall operate as a transient merchant in the
city without an issued permit.
   (B)   The permit will be reviewed by city staff to ensure zoning compliance.
   (C)   If during the time the permit is in effect the transient merchant
fails to maintain the required conditions, the city may revoke the permit and
the transient merchant activity shall be terminated.
(Ord. 14-02, passed 7-14-2014; Ord. 20-04, passed 3-9-2020)
§ 113.04 REQUIRED CONDITIONS.
   Approval of a transient business permit is subject to the following
conditions.
   (A)   Transient merchants are permitted in all commercial and industrial
zoning districts (C-1, C-2, C-3, I-1 and I-2).
   (B)   A copy of a lease agreement, deed or similar document from the
property owner is required.
   (C)   All signage must comply with the Chapter 26 of the Zoning Ordinance.
   (D)   Transient merchants may not be permitted at a location more than 90
days per calendar year. The owner/operator may reapply for a permit at the end
of their duration, but the transient merchant must be relocated at a minimum of
1,000 feet (measured in radial distance) from the prior location.
   (E)   A site plan must be submitted for review and approval. The site plan
shall include a mapped location of the proposed business, including existing
parking spaces, roadways, sidewalks and buildings; it should also entail
measurements of distance from proposed display/enclosure to nearby parking
spaces, roadways, sidewalks, setbacks and buildings. Aerial photography,
existing surveys or plat will suffice for this purpose. The site plan shall
include any photography of tents, trailers, stands and the like that will be
used. The city has the right to review and/or reject any site plan submitted.
Once approved by the city, all site plans must be maintained by the transient
merchant with the duration of the permit. Any deviation from the site plan by
the transient merchant may result in revocation of the permit and the business
activity shall be terminated.
   (F)   If a transient merchant distributes or prepares food products, a copy
of a permit issued by the County Environmental Health is required to be kept on
file. Revocation of the permit will constitute revocation of the transient
merchant license.
   (G)   The provisions of this subchapter shall not apply to any general sale,
fair, auction, Loco Daze or bazaar sponsored by any religious, education,
public service or charitable organization.

§ 116.01 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   GAMBLING DEVICES. A contrivance the purpose of which is that for a
consideration a player is afforded an opportunity to obtain something of value,
other than free plays, automatically from the machine or otherwise, the award
of which is determined principally by chance, whether or not the contrivance is
actually played (eg. paddlewheels, tipboards). GAMBLING DEVICE also includes a
video game of chance, as defined in M.S. § 609.75, subd. 8.
   MINNESOTA GAMBLING CONTROL BOARD. The Board is an entity which regulates the
lawful (charitable) gambling industry to ensure the integrity of operations and
provide for the lawful use of net profits. Charitable gambling is conducted
only by registered nonprofit organizations. The five forms of lawful gambling
are bingo, paddlewheels, pull-tabs, raffles, and tipboards.
   PROFIT. The gross receipts from the operation of gambling devices and the
conduct of raffles less reasonable sums expended for prizes, local licensing
fees, taxes and maintenance costs for the devices.
   TRADE AREA. As used in this chapter, means the City of Dilworth, City of
Moorhead, Moorhead Township, Oakport Township, and Glyndon Township.
   VIDEO GAME OF CHANCE. A video game of chance is a game or device that
simulates one or more games commonly referred to as poker, blackjack, craps,
hi-lo, roulette, or other common gambling forms, though not offering any type
of pecuniary award or gain to players. The term also includes any video game
having one or more of the following characteristics:
      (1)   It is primarily a game of chance, and has no substantial elements
of skill involved; and
      (2)   It awards game credits or replays and contains a meter or device
that records unplayed credits or replays. A video game that simulates horse
racing that does not involve a prize payout is not a video game of chance.

§ 130.03 LOITERING.
   (A)   A person commits a violation if he or she loiters or prowls in a
place, at a time, or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under
circumstances that warrant alarm for the safety of persons or property in the
vicinity. Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining
whether alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon
appearance of a police officer, refuses to identify himself or herself, or
manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or herself or any object. Unless flight
by the person or other circumstances makes it impractical, a police officer
shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the person
an opportunity to dispel any alarm which would otherwise be warranted, by
requesting the person to identify himself or herself and to explain his or her
presence or conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this
section if the police officer did not comply with the preceding sentence, or if
it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and, if
it had been believed by the police officer at the time, would have dispelled
the alarm. Any police officer may arrest any person suspected of being a
loiterer or prowler without a warrant if it reasonably appears that the delay
in arresting the suspect caused by obtaining a warrant would result in the
suspect's escape.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful for any person, after first being warned by a
police officer, or where a “no loitering” sign or signs have been posted, to
loiter, stand, sit, or lie in or upon any public or quasi-public sidewalk,
street, curb, cross-walk, walkway area, mall or that portion of private
property utilized for public use, so as to hinder or obstruct unreasonably the
free passage of pedestrians or vehicles thereon. It shall be unlawful for any
person to block, obstruct, or prevent free access to the entrance to any
building open to the public.
   (C)   For the purpose of this section, PUBLIC PLACE has the following
definition unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning: an area generally visible to public view, including streets,
sidewalks, bridges, alleys, plazas, parks, driveways, parking lots, automobiles
(whether moving or not), and buildings open to the general public, including
those which serve food or drink or provide entertainment, and the doorways and

harm or death; or
   (B)   Intentionally inflicts or attempts to inflict bodily harm upon

dangerous article or substance for the purpose of being used unlawfully as a
weapon against another. For the purposes of this section, possession of a
switchblade knife or machete or other substance of like nature which has no
recognized commercial or household value shall be prima facie evidence that
said possession is for the purpose of being used unlawfully as a weapon against
another;
   (D)   Sells or has in his or her possession any device designed to silence
or muffle the discharge of a firearm; or
   (E)   Without the parents’ or guardians’ consent, and the written consent of

STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE
§ 151.001 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The legislature of the state has, in M.S. Chapter 103F and M.S. Chapter 462,
as they may be amended from time to time, delegated the responsibility to local
government units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses.
Therefore, the City Council does ordain as follows.
(Ord. 12-02, passed 2-27-2012)
§ 151.002 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   Generally. The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic
inundation which results in potential loss of life, loss of property, health
and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety and general welfare.
   (B)   Methods used to analyze flood hazards. This chapter is based upon a
reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which is consistent with the
standards established by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.
   (C)   National Flood Insurance Program compliance. This chapter is adopted
to comply with the rules and regulations of the National Flood Insurance
Program codified as 44 C.F.R. parts 59 through 78, as amended, so as to
maintain the community’s eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program.
(Ord. 12-02, passed 2-27-2012)
§ 151.003 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize those losses described in §
151.002(A) by provisions contained herein.
(Ord. 12-02, passed 2-27-2012)
GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.015 LANDS TO WHICH THIS CHAPTER APPLIES.
   This chapter shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city
shown on the Official Zoning Map and/or the attachments thereto as being
located within the boundaries of the Floodway and Flood Fringe Districts.
(Ord. 12-02, passed 2-27-2012)
§ 151.016 ESTABLISHMENT OF OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.
   The Official Zoning Map together with all materials attached thereto is
hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. The
attached material shall include the Flood Insurance Study for Clay County,
Minnesota and Incorporated Areas and Flood Insurance Rate Map panels therein
numbered 27027C0338E, 27027C0339E, 27027C0340E, 27027C0342E, 27027C0343E,
27027CG480E, 27027C0481E, 27027C0482E and the Flood Insurance Rate Map Index
(Map Number 27027CIND2A), all dated April 17, 2012 and prepared by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency. The Official Zoning Map shall be on file in the
office of the City Administrator and Zoning Administrator.
(Ord. 12-02, passed 2-27-2012)
§ 151.017 REGULATORY FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION.
   The regulatory flood protection elevation shall be an elevation no lower
than one foot above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in
flood elevation caused by encroachments on the flood plain that result from
designation of a floodway.
(Ord. 12-02, passed 2-27-2012)
§ 151.018 INTERPRETATION.
   (A)   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this
chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation
or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes.
   (B)   The boundaries of the zoning districts shall be determined by scaling
distances on the Official Zoning Map. Where interpretation is needed as to the
exact location of the boundaries of the district as shown on the Official
Zoning Map, as for example where there appears to be a conflict between a
mapped boundary and actual field conditions and there is a formal appeal of the
decision of the Zoning Administrator, the Board of Adjustment shall make the
necessary interpretation. All decisions will be based on elevations on the
regional (100-year) flood profile, the ground elevations that existed on the
site at the time the community adopted its initial flood plain ordinance or on
the date of the first National Flood Insurance Program map showing the area
within the 100-year flood plain if earlier, and other available technical data.
Persons contesting the location of the district boundaries shall be given a

§ 151.022 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ACCESSORY USE OR STRUCTURE. A use or structure on the same lot with, and of
a nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal use or
structure.
   BASEMENT (RESIDENTIAL AND NON-RESIDENTIAL). Any area of a structure,
including crawl spaces, having its floor or base subgrade (below ground level)
on all four sides, regardless of the depth of excavation below ground level.
   CONDITIONAL USE. A specific type of structure or land use listed in the
official control that may be allowed but only after an in-depth review
procedure and with appropriate conditions or restrictions as provided in the
official zoning controls or Building Codes and upon a finding that:
      (1)   Certain conditions as detailed in the zoning ordinance exist; and
      (2)   The structure and/or land use conform to the comprehensive land use
plan if one exists and are compatible with the existing neighborhood.
   EQUAL DEGREE OF ENCROACHMENT. A method of determining the location of
floodway boundaries so that flood plain lands on both sides of a stream are
capable of conveying a proportionate share of flood flows.
   FLOOD. A temporary increase in the flow or stage of a stream or in the stage
of a wetland or lake that results in the inundation of normally dry areas.
   FLOOD FREQUENCY. The frequency for which it is expected that a specific
flood stage or discharge may be equaled or exceeded.
   FLOOD FRINGE. That portion of the flood plain outside of the floodway. FLOOD
FRINGE is synonymous with the term FLOODWAY FRINGE used in the Flood Insurance
Study for Clay County, Minnesota and Incorporated Areas.
   FLOOD PLAIN. The beds proper and the areas adjoining a wetland, lake or
watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regional flood.
   FLOOD PROOFING. A combination of structural provisions, changes or
adjustments to properties and structures subject to flooding, primarily for the
reduction or elimination of flood damages.
   FLOODWAY. The bed of a wetland or lake and the channel of a watercourse and
those portions of the adjoining flood plain which are reasonably required to
carry or store the regional flood discharge.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking
of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area,
is not considered a building’s LOWEST FLOOR.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include the term “recreational vehicle.”
   OBSTRUCTION. Any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment,
projection, excavation, channel modification, culvert, building, wire, fence,
stockpile, refuse, fill, structure or matter in, along, across or projecting
into any channel, watercourse or regulatory flood plain which may impede,
retard or change the direction of the flow of water, either in itself or by
catching or collecting debris earned by such water.
   PRINCIPAL USE OR STRUCTURE. All uses or structures that are not accessory
uses or structures.
   REACH. A hydraulic engineering term to describe a longitudinal segment of a
stream or river influenced by a natural or human-made obstruction. In an urban
area, the segment of a stream or river between two consecutive bridge crossings
would most typically constitute a REACH.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle that is built on a single chassis, is 400
square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, is
designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and
is designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary
living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use. For the
purposes of this chapter, the term RECREATIONAL VEHICLE shall be synonymous
with the term TRAVEL TRAILER/TRAVEL VEHICLE.
   REGIONAL FLOOD. A flood which is representative of large floods known to
have occurred generally in the state and reasonably characteristic of what can
be expected to occur on an average frequency in the magnitude of the 100-year
recurrence interval. REGIONAL FLOOD is synonymous with the term BASE FLOOD used
in a flood insurance study.
   REGULATORY FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION. An elevation no lower than one foot
above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation
caused by encroachments on the flood plain that result from designation of a
floodway.
   STRUCTURE. Anything constructed or erected on the ground or attached to the
ground or on-site utilities, including, but not limited to, buildings,
factories, sheds, detached garages, cabins, manufactured homes, recreational
vehicles not meeting the exemption criteria specified in §
151.112 of this chapter and other similar items.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure where the
cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or
exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Within any consecutive 365-day period, any
reconstruction, rehabilitation (including normal maintenance and repair),
repair after damage, addition or other improvement of a structure, the cost of
which equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the
“start of construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures that
have incurred “substantial damage,” regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include either:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of an “historic structure,” provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an
“historic structure.” For the purpose of this chapter, “historic structure”
shall be as defined in 44 C.F.R. §
   VARIANCE. A modification of a specific permitted development standard
required in an official control including this chapter to allow an alternative
development standard not stated as acceptable in the official control, but only
as applied to a particular property for the purpose of alleviating a hardship,
practical difficulty or unique circumstance as defined and elaborated upon in a
community’s respective planning and zoning enabling legislation.

(Ord. 12-02, passed 2-27-2012)
§ 151.053 STANDARDS FOR FLOODWAY CONDITIONAL USES.
   (A)   All uses. No structure (temporary or permanent), fill (including fill
for roads and levees), deposit, obstruction, storage of materials or equipment
or other uses may be allowed as a conditional use that will cause any increase
in the stage of the 100-year or regional flood or cause an increase in flood
damages in the reach or reaches affected.
   (B)   Procedures and standards. All floodway conditional uses shall be
subject to the procedures and standards contained in §
151.128.
   (C)   Permissible. The conditional use shall be permissible in the
underlying zoning district if one exists.
   (D)   Fill.
      (1)   Fill, dredge spoil and all other similar materials deposited or
stored in the flood plain shall be protected from erosion by vegetative cover,
mulching, riprap or other acceptable method.
      (2)   Dredge spoil sites and sand and gravel operations shall not be
allowed in the floodway unless a long-term site development plan is submitted
which includes an erosion/sedimentation prevention element to the plan.
      (3)   As an alternative, and consistent with division (D)(2) above,
dredge spoil disposal and sand and gravel operations may allow temporary, on-
site storage of fill or other materials which would have caused an increase to
the stage of the 100-year or regional flood but only after the governing body
has
received an appropriate plan which assures the removal of the materials from
the floodway based upon the flood warning time available. The conditional use
permit must be title registered with the property in the office of the County
Recorder.
   (E)   Accessory structures.
      (1)   Accessory structures shall not be designed for human habitation.
      (2)   Accessory structures, if permitted, shall be constructed and placed
on the building site so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of
flood waters:
         (a)   Whenever possible, structures shall be constructed with the
longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow; and
         (b)   So far as practicable, structures shall be placed approximately
on the same flood flow lines as those of adjoining structures.
      (3)   Accessory structures shall be elevated on fill or structurally dry
flood proofed in accordance with the FP-1 or FP-2 flood proofing
classifications in the State Building Code. As an alternative, an accessory
structure may be flood proofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 flood proofing
classification in the State Building Code provided the accessory structure
constitutes a minimal investment, does not exceed 500 square feet in size at
its largest projection, and for a detached garage, the detached garage must be
used solely for parking of vehicles and limited storage. All flood proofed
accessory structures must meet the following additional standards:
         (a)   The structure must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse or lateral movement of the structure and shall be designed to equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls;
         (b)   Any mechanical and utility equipment in a structure must be
elevated to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or properly
flood proofed; and
         (c)   To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there
must be a minimum of two “automatic” openings in the outside walls of the
structure having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every
square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. There must be openings on at
least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings must be no
higher than one foot above the lowest adjacent grade to the structure. Using
human intervention to open a garage door prior to flooding will not satisfy
this requirement for automatic openings.
   (F)   Storage of materials and equipment.
      (1)   The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of
flooding, flammable, explosive or potentially injurious to human, animal or
plant life is prohibited.
      (2)   Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if readily
removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning and in
accordance with a plan approved by the governing body.
   (G)   Structural works for flood control. Structural works for flood control
that will change the course, current or cross section of protected wetlands or
public waters shall be subject to the provisions of M.S. Chapter 103G, as it
may be amended from time to time. Community-wide structural works for flood
control intended to remove areas from the regulatory flood plain shall not be
allowed in the floodway.
   (H)   Levee, dike or floodwall. A levee, dike or floodwall constructed in
the floodway shall not cause an increase to the 100-year or regional flood and
the technical analysis must assume equal conveyance or storage loss on both
sides of a stream.

FLOOD FRINGE DISTRICT (FF)
§ 151.065 PERMITTED USES.
   Permitted uses shall be those uses of land or structures listed as permitted
uses in the underlying zoning use districts. If no pre-existing, underlying
zoning use districts exist, then any residential or non-residential structure
or use of a structure or land shall be a permitted use in the Flood Fringe
District provided such use does not constitute a public nuisance. All permitted
uses shall comply with the standards for Flood Fringe District permitted uses
listed in §
151.066 and the standards for all flood fringe uses listed in §
151.069.
(Ord. 12-02, passed 2-27-2012)
§ 151.066 STANDARDS FOR FLOOD FRINGE PERMITTED USES.
   (A)   All structures, including accessory structures, must be elevated on
fill so that the lowest floor including basement floor is at or above the
regulatory flood protection elevation. The finished fill elevation for
structures shall be no lower than one foot below the regulatory flood
protection elevation and the fill shall extend at such elevation at least 15
feet beyond the outside limits of the structure erected thereon.
   (B)   As an alternative to elevation on fill, accessory structures that
constitute a minimal investment and that do not exceed 500 square feet at its
largest projection may be internally flood proofed in accordance with §
151.053(E)(3).
   (C)   The storage of any materials or equipment shall be elevated on fill to
the regulatory flood protection elevation.
   (D)   The provisions of §
151.069 shall apply.
(Ord. 12-02, passed 2-27-2012)
§ 151.067 CONDITIONAL USES.

with §
151.066(A) and (B) and or any use of land that does not comply with the
standards in §
151.066(C) and (D) shall only be allowable as a conditional use. An application
for a conditional use shall be subject to the standards and criteria and
evaluation procedures specified in §§
151.068,
151.069 and
151.128.
(Ord. 12-02, passed 2-27-2012)
§ 151.068 STANDARDS FOR FLOOD FRINGE CONDITIONAL USES.
   (A)   Alternative elevation methods.
      (1)   Alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill may be
utilized to elevate a structure’s lowest floor above the regulatory flood
protection elevation. These alternative methods may include the use of stilts,
pilings, parallel walls and the like, or above-grade, enclosed areas such as
crawl spaces or tuck under garages. The base or floor of an enclosed area shall
be considered above-grade and not a structure’s basement or lowest floor if:
         (a)   The enclosed area is above-grade on at least one side of the
structure;
         (b)   It is designed to internally flood and is constructed with flood
resistant materials; and
         (c)   It is used solely for parking of vehicles, building access or
storage.
      (2)   The above-noted alternative elevation methods are subject to the
following additional standards.
         (a)   Design and certification. The structure’s design and as-built
condition must be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect
as being in compliance with the general design standards of the State Building
Code and, specifically, that all electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and
air-conditioning equipment and other service facilities must be at or above the
regulatory flood protection elevation or be designed to prevent flood water
from entering or accumulating within these components during times of flooding.
         (b)   Specific standards for above-grade, enclosed areas. Above-grade,
fully enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages must be
designed to internally flood and the design plans must stipulate:
            1.   A minimum area of openings in the walls where internal
flooding is to be used as a flood proofing technique. There shall be a minimum
of two openings on at least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all
openings shall be no higher than one-foot above grade. The automatic openings
shall have a minimum net area of not less than one square inch for every square
foot of enclosed area subject to flooding unless a registered professional
engineer or architect certifies that a smaller net area would suffice. The
automatic openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
flood waters without any form of human intervention; and
            2.   That the enclosed area will be designed of flood resistant
materials in accordance with the FP-3 or FP-4 classifications in the State
Building Code and shall be used solely for building access, parking of vehicles
or storage.
   (B)   Residential basement. Residential basements, as defined in §
151.022 may be constructed below the regulatory flood protection elevation if
in compliance with the FP-1 flood proofing classification (i.e., a W1 space) of
the State Building Code and in accordance with the following minimum
requirements, consistent with 44 C.F.R. § 60.6(c).
      (1)   Flood depth: flood depths shall not be more than five feet for
developable lots that are contiguous to land above the base flood elevation
(100-year flood) or three feet for other lots.
      (2)   Flood velocity shall be limited to five feet per second.
      (3)   Flood warning time shall be at least 12 hours. Flood warning time
of two hours or greater may be approved if the community demonstrates that it
has flood warning system and an emergency plan in operation that is adequate to
ensure safe evacuation of affected residents.
      (4)   Basement structural requirements:
         (a)   Basements shall be designed and constructed so that any basement
area, utilities and sanitary facilities below the flood proofed level would be
flood proofed in accordance with the FP-1 flood proofing classification (e.g.,
watertight with walls impermeable to the passage of water without human
intervention);
         (b)   Basement walls shall be built with the capacity to resist the
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads as well as the effects of buoyancy resulting
from flooding to the flood proofed design level, and shall be designed so that
minimal damage will occur from floods exceeding that level; and
         (c)   Flood proofing design level shall be an elevation no lower than
the regulatory flood protection elevation where the difference between the 100-
year flood and the 500-year flood levels is three feet or less and two feet
above the 100-year flood level where the difference between the 100-year flood
and 500-year flood levels is greater than three feet.
      (5)   The top of basement floor shall be no lower than five feet below
the 100-year flood level.
      (6)   Fill:
         (a)   The area surrounding the structure must be filled to the 100-
year flood level or higher on all four sides;
         (b)   Fill must be compacted; and
         (c)   Slopes must be protected by a vegetative cover.
      (7)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop or
review the building’s structural design, specifications and plans, including
consideration of depth, velocity and duration of flooding and type and
permeability of soils at the building site, and certify that the basement
design and methods of construction proposed are in accordance with accepted
standards of practice for meeting the provisions of this division (B)(7).
      (8)   The community Building Inspector or authorized representative shall
inspect the structure to verify that it meets the provisions of this section.
   (C)   Flood non-residential basements. Flood non-residential basements, as
defined by §
151.022, may be allowed below the regulatory flood protection elevation
provided the basement is flood proofed in accordance with the structurally dry
flood proofing classifications in the State Building Code. Structurally dry
flood proofing must meet the FP-1 or FP-2 flood proofing classification in the
State Building Code and this shall require making the structure watertight with
the walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and the effects of buoyancy. Structures flood proofed to the FP-3 or FP-
4 classification shall not be permitted.
   (D)   Fill. When at any one time more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill or
other similar material is located on a parcel for such activities as on-site
storage, landscaping, sand and gravel operations, landfills, roads, dredge
spoil disposal or construction of flood control works, an erosion/sedimentation
control plan must be submitted unless the community is enforcing a state
approved shoreland management ordinance. In the absence of a state approved
shoreland ordinance, the plan must clearly specify methods to be used to
stabilize the fill on site for a flood event at a minimum of the 100-year or
regional flood event. The plan must be prepared and certified by a registered
professional engineer or other qualified individual acceptable to the governing
body. The plan may incorporate alternative procedures for removal of the
material from the flood plain if adequate flood warning time exists.
   (E)   Storage of materials and equipment.
      (1)   The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of
flooding, flammable, explosive or potentially injurious to human, animal or
plant life is prohibited.
      (2)   Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if readily
removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning and in
accordance with a plan approved by the governing body.
   (F)   Applicable standards. The provisions of §
151.069 shall also apply.
(Ord. 12-02, passed 2-27-2012)
§ 151.069 STANDARDS FOR ALL FLOOD FRINGE USES.
   (A)   Generally. All new principal structures must have vehicular access at
or above an elevation not more than two feet below the regulatory flood
protection elevation. If a variance to this requirement is granted, the Board
of Adjustment must specify limitations on the period of use or occupancy of the
structure for times of flooding and only after determining that adequate flood
warning time and local flood emergency response procedures exist.
   (B)   Commercial uses. Accessory land uses, such as yards, railroad tracks
and parking lots may be at elevations lower than the regulatory flood
protection elevation. However, a permit for such facilities to be used by the
employees or the general public shall not be granted in the absence of a flood
warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area would be
inundated to a depth and velocity such that when multiplying the depth (in
feet) times velocity (in feet per second) the product number exceeds four upon
occurrence of the regional flood.
   (C)   Manufacturing and industrial uses. Measures shall be taken to minimize
interference with normal plant operations especially along streams having
protracted flood durations. Certain accessory land uses such as yards and
parking lots may be at lower elevations subject to requirements set out in
division (B) above. In considering permit applications, due consideration shall
be given to needs of an industry whose business requires that it be located in
flood plain areas.
   (D)   Fill. Fill shall be properly compacted and the slopes shall be
properly protected by the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable
method. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria
for removing the special flood hazard area designation for certain structures
properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation. FEMA’s
requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection
standards for multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should
be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of
special flood hazard area designation will be requested.
   (E)   Flood plain developments. Flood plain developments shall not adversely
affect the hydraulic capacity of the channel and adjoining flood plain of any
tributary watercourse or drainage system where a floodway or other encroachment
limit has not been specified on the Official Zoning Map.
   (F)   Recreational vehicles. Standards for recreational vehicles are
contained in §
151.112.
   (G)   Manufactured homes. All manufactured homes must be securely anchored
to an adequately anchored foundation system that resists flotation, collapse
and lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be
limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This
requirement is in addition to applicable state or local anchoring requirements
for resisting wind forces.

SUBDIVISIONS
§ 151.080 LAND SUITABILITY REVIEW CRITERIA.
   No land shall be subdivided which is unsuitable for the reason of flooding,
inadequate drainage, water supply or sewage treatment facilities. All lots
within the flood plain districts shall be able to contain a building site
outside of the Floodway District at or above the regulatory flood protection
elevation. All subdivisions shall have water and sewage treatment facilities
that comply with the provisions of this chapter and have road access both to
the subdivision and to the individual building sites no lower than two feet
below the regulatory flood protection elevation. For all subdivisions in the
flood plain, the Floodway and Flood Fringe District boundaries, the regulatory
flood protection elevation and the required elevation of all access roads shall
be clearly labeled on all required subdivision drawings and platting documents.
(Ord. 12-02, passed 2-27-2012)
§ 151.081 REMOVAL OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA DESIGNATION.
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for
removing the special flood hazard area designation for certain structures
properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation. FEMA’s
requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection

   (A)   Rules. The Board of Adjustment shall adopt rules for the conduct of
business and may exercise all of the powers conferred on such Boards by state
law.
   (B)   Administrative review. The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide
appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision
or determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement or
administration of this chapter.
   (C)   Variances. The Board of Adjustment may authorize upon appeal in
specific cases such relief or variance from the terms of this chapter as will
not be contrary to the public interest and only for those circumstances such as
hardship, practical difficulties or circumstances unique to the property under
consideration, as provided for in the respective enabling legislation for
planning and zoning for cities or counties as appropriate. In the granting of
such variance, the Board of Adjustment shall clearly identify in writing the
specific conditions that existed consistent with the criteria specified in this
chapter, any other zoning regulations in the community, and in the respective
enabling legislation that justified the granting of the variance. No variance
shall have the effect of allowing in any district uses prohibited in that
district, permit a lower degree of flood protection than the regulatory flood
protection elevation for the particular area or permit standards lower than
those required by state law. The following additional variance criteria of the
Federal Emergency Management Agency must be satisfied.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued by a community within any designated
regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood
discharge would result.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued by a community upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public
or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
   (D)   Hearings. Upon filing with the Board of Adjustment of an appeal from a
decision of the Zoning Administrator, or an application for a variance, the
Board of Adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for a hearing and give due
notice to the parties in interest as specified by law. The Board of Adjustment
shall submit by mail to the Commissioner of Natural Resources a copy of the
application for proposed variances sufficiently in advance so that the
Commissioner will receive at least ten days’ notice of the hearing.
   (E)   Decisions. The Board of Adjustment shall arrive at a decision on such
appeal or variance within 60 days. In passing upon an appeal, the Board of
Adjustment may, so long as such action is in conformity with the provisions of
this chapter, reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or modify the order,
requirement, decision or determination of the Zoning Administrator or other
public official. It shall make its decision in writing setting forth the
findings of fact and the reasons for its decisions. In granting a variance the
Board of Adjustment may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards such as
those specified in §
151.128(G), which are in conformity with the purposes of this chapter.
Violations of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms
under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this
chapter punishable under §
151.999. A copy of all decisions granting variances shall be forwarded by mail
to the Commissioner of Natural Resources within ten days of such action.
   (F)   Appeals. Appeals from any decision of the Board of Adjustment may be
made, and as specified in this community’s official controls and also by
Minnesota Statutes.
   (G)   Flood insurance notice and record keeping. The Zoning Administrator
shall notify the applicant for a variance that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to
amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and
      (2)   Such construction below the 100-year or regional flood level
increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained
with a record of all variance actions. A community shall maintain a record of
all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report
such variances issued in its annual or biennial report submitted to the
Administrator of the National Flood Insurance Program.

lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. Such actions
may include, but are not limited to:
      (1)   In responding to a suspected ordinance violation, the Zoning
Administrator and local government may utilize the full array of enforcement
actions available to it including, but not limited to, prosecution and fines,
injunctions, after-the-fact permits, orders for corrective measures or a
request to the National Flood Insurance Program for denial of flood insurance
availability to the guilty party. The community must act in good faith to
enforce these official controls and to correct ordinance violations to the
extent possible so as not to jeopardize its eligibility in the National Flood
Insurance Program;
      (2)   When an ordinance violation is either discovered by or brought to
the attention of the Zoning Administrator, the Zoning Administrator shall
immediately investigate the situation and document the nature and extent of the
violation of the official control. As soon as is reasonably possible, this

immediately halted until a proper permit or approval is granted by the
community. If the construction or development is already completed, then the
Zoning Administrator may either:
            1.   Issue an order identifying the collective actions that must be
made within a specified time period to bring the use or structure into
compliance with the official controls; or
            2.   Notify the responsible party to apply for an after-the-fact
permit/development approval within a specified period of time not to exceed 30
days.
      (4)   If the responsible party does not appropriately respond to the
Zoning Administrator within the specified period of time, each additional day
that lapses shall constitute an additional violation of this chapter and shall
be prosecuted accordingly. The Zoning Administrator shall also upon the lapse
of the specified response period notify the landowner to restore the land to
the condition which existed prior to the violation of this chapter.

prostitution or acts related to prostitution as defined in M.S. §§ 609.321
though 609.324, as they may be amended from time to time;
      (7)   Conduct which constitutes a violation of the city code relating to

state law or local ordinance which would be likely to threaten, annoy or harass
other tenants or other neighbors to the residential rental unit.
   (B)   The City Administrator shall be responsible for administration of this
section. The authority to take any action authorized under this section may be
delegated to the City Administrator authorized designee or designees.
   (C)   Upon determination by the City Administrator or his or her designee
that a rental unit registered premises was used in a disorderly manner, as
described in the city ordinance, the City Administrator or his or her designee,
shall give notice to the registration holder and the renters of the rental unit
affected, of the violation and direct the registration holder to take steps to
prevent further violations. This section does not apply to the property owner
who has taken action to prevent disorderly use of the premises as described in
division (H) below.
   (D)   If another instance of disorderly use of the rental unit registered
premises occurs within three months of an incident for which a notice in
division (C) above was given, the City Administrator, or his or her designee,
shall notify the registration holder and the renters of the affected unit of
the violation and shall request the registration holder to take action. This
action will be asked to be submitted to the City Administrator, or his or her
authorized designee, within five days of receipt of the notice of disorderly
use of the premises, and shall detail all actions taken by the registration
holder in response to all notices of disorderly use of the premises within the
preceding three months.
   (E)   (1)   If another instance of disorderly use of the rental unit
registered premises occurs within three months after any two previous instances

the renters of the affected unit, pursuant to this section, and the rental
property owner has not taken action to prevent disorderly use of the premises,
the rental dwelling license for the premises may be denied, revoked, suspended
or not renewed. An action to deny, revoke, suspend or not renew a license under
this section shall be initiated by the City Administrator who shall give to the
licensee written notice of a hearing before the City Council to consider such
denial, revocation, suspension or non-renewal. Such written notice shall
specify all violations of this section, and shall state the date, time, place
and purpose of the hearing. The hearing shall be held no less than 30 calendar
days after giving such notice.
      (2)   Following the hearing, the Council may deny, revoke, suspend or
decline to renew the license for all or any part or parts of the licensed
premises or may grant a license upon such terms and conditions as it deems
necessary to accomplish the purposes of this section.
      (3)   No adverse license action shall be imposed where the instance of
disorderly use of the licensed premises occurred during the pendency of
eviction proceedings (unlawful detainer) or within 30 calendar days of notice
given by the licensee to a tenant to vacate the premises where the disorderly
use was related to conduct by that tenant or by other occupants or guests of
the tenant’s unit. Eviction proceedings shall not be a bar to adverse license
action, however, unless they are diligently pursued by the licensee. Further,
an action to deny, revoke, suspend or not renew a license based upon violations
of this section may be postponed or discontinued at any time if it appears that
the licensee has taken appropriate action which will prevent further instances
of disorderly use.
   (F)   A determination that the registered premises have been used in a
disorderly manner as described in division (A) above shall be made upon a fair
preponderance of the evidence to support such a determination. It shall not be
necessary that criminal charges be brought in order to support a determination
of disorderly use, but the incident must have resulted in the police being
called to the rental unit registered premises and a police report being
prepared.
   (G)   For purposes of this chapter, DISORDERLY USE OF THE RENTAL UNIT
REGISTERED PREMISES shall mean disorderly use in the particular rental unit by
the renters, occupants or guests or conduct by the tenants which constitutes
disorderly use anywhere on the property of the apartment building, or home or
mobile home park in which the rental unit is situated.
   (H)   (1)   For the purpose of this chapter, participation and compliance by
the rental property owner to the provisions of the Minnesota Crime Free Housing
Program shall meet requirements for the rental owner “taking action to prevent
further disorderly use of the premises.”
      (2)   The City Administrator shall determine compliance of rental owners
to the Minnesota Crime Free Housing Program and thereby taking action to
prevent further disorderly use of the premises.
   (I)   Notwithstanding any other language of this section to the contrary,
conduct which otherwise constitutes disorderly use for purposes of this section
will not be deemed to be disorderly use for purposes of this section if the
police discovered the domestic abuse or other conduct as a result of a call by
a tenant of the rental unit in which the disorderly use is occurring, or if the
use is occurring outside the specific rental unit, by a tenant of the rental
unit which would have otherwise received notice of disorderly use pursuant to
the terms of this section.

unit or units for which registration is sought complies with the requirements

the state; provided, however, registration shall not be suspended, revoked or

order or orders in a timely manner.

his or her registration has been denied, or the registration holder that his or
her registration is being suspended, removed or non-renewed. The suspension,

order, or at such later date as set out in the order. The notice shall be
served by mailing a copy of the order to the property owner, and the designated
local property manager, if any, as indicated in the records on file in the City
Administrator’s office.

agent or an attorney representing the registration holder may present evidence.
After the hearing, the Council may uphold the decision of the City
Administrator, reverse the decision of the City Administrator or enter a
different order with different conditions if the City Council deems it
necessary to protect the public health, sanitation, safety or general welfare
of the community at large or the residents of rental units in the city. The
City Council shall issue written findings of fact and its order within 20
calendar days of the hearing.

representative, employee or lessee, or the condition of his or her rental
dwelling or rental unit is detrimental to the public health, sanitation, safety
and general welfare of the community at large, or residents of the rental units
so as to constitute a nuisance, fire hazard or other unsafe or dangerous

have the authority to summarily condemn or close off individual rental units or
such areas of the rental dwelling as necessary. Notice of summary condemnation
shall be posted at the units or areas affected and shall indicate the units or
areas affected. No person shall remove the posted notice, other than the Fire

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 153.001 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   Title. The official title of this chapter is the Zoning Ordinance of
the City of Dilworth, Minnesota. This Zoning Ordinance shall become effective
on December 13, 2010 and is referred to within this chapter as either the
"Zoning Ordinance" or "ordinance". The City Council hereby expresses that
neither this Zoning Ordinance, nor any decision under it, may be challenged on
the basis of any alleged nonconformity with any other planning documents,
including the Dilworth Comprehensive Plan dated February 1998 or Dilworth
Growth Area Plan dated January 2006.
   (B)   Purpose. This is a chapter for the purpose of promoting the public
health, safety, and general welfare, and to implement the Comprehensive Plan.
This is achieved by regulating the location and size of buildings and other
structures; the percentage of each lot which may be occupied; the size of yards
and other open spaces; the density and distribution of population; the uses of
buildings and structures for trade, industry, residence, recreation, public
activities, or other purposes; and the use of land for trade, industry,
residence, recreation, agriculture, forestry, soil conservation, water supply
conservation, conservation of shore lands, flood control or other purposes, and
establishing standards and procedures regulating such uses. As residential
development is considered the cornerstone of development in the city, this

decision shall not affect the validity of the chapter as a whole, or any part,
thereof, other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.

of any provision of this chapter, then such judgment shall not affect the
application of that provision to any other building, structure or use not
specifically included in that judgment.
      (3)   If any court of competent jurisdiction invalidates any condition
attached to the approval of a development application, then such judgment shall
not affect any other conditions or requirements attached to the same approval

own initiative or upon request of the City Administrator or applicant, may
conduct a study to determine if the use is acceptable and if so, what zoning
district would be most appropriate and also the determination of conditions and
standards relating to the development of the use. This review process may also

maintained, and shall include the performance of such activity as defined by
the performance standards of this chapter.
   VARIANCE. A variance is a relaxation of the terms of the Zoning Ordinance
where such variance will not be contrary to the public interest and where,
owing to conditions peculiar to the property and not the result of the actions
of the applicant, a literal enforcement of the Ordinance would result in
unnecessary and undue hardship. As used in this chapter, a variance is
authorized only for area, size of structure, size of yards, setback and side
yard requirements, and parking requirements; establishment or expansion of a
use otherwise prohibited shall not be allowed by variance, nor shall a variance
be granted because of the presence of nonconformities in the zoning district or
adjoining zoning districts.

a predominately aquatic form of vegetation, and which may have the following
characteristics:
         (a)   Vegetation belonging to the marsh (emergent aquatic), bog, fen,
sedge meadow, shrubland, southern lowland forest (lowland hardwood), and

months of the year.
      (2)   Swamps, bogs, marshes, potholes, wet meadows and sloughs are
wetlands, and such property may be shallow waterbodies, the waters of which are
stagnant or actuated by very feeble currents, and may at times be sufficiently
dry to permit tillage, but would require drainage to be made arable. The edge
of a wetland is commonly that point where the natural vegetation changes from
predominantly aquatic to predominantly terrestrial.
   WHOLESALING. The selling of goods, equipment and materials by bulk to
another business that in turn sell to the final customer.
   WIND ENERGY CONVERSION SYSTEM (WECS). Any device that is designed to convert

      (3)   SIDE YARD. A space between the building and the side line of the
lot and extending from the lot line to the rear yard. In the case of through
lots, side yards shall extend from the rear lines of the front yards required.
In the case of corner lots with normal frontage, there will be only one side
yard, adjacent to the interior lot. In the case of the corner lots with
reversed frontage, the yards remaining after the full and half-depth front
yards have been established shall be considered to be side yards. Width of
required side yards shall be measured at right angles to a straight line
joining the ends of front and rear lot lines on the same side of the lot. The
inner side yard line of a required side yard shall be parallel to the straight
line so established.

(Ord. passed - -)
§ 153.021 NONCONFORMING LOTS; USES AND STRUCTURES.
   (A)   Purpose and intent.
      (1)   It shall be deemed nonconforming when, within the districts
established by this chapter or amendments that may later be adopted, there
exists lots, structures and uses of land which were lawful before this chapter
was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted
under the terms of this chapter or future amendments. This chapter permits
these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, modified/altered
(other than repair, replacement, restoration, maintenance or improvement
activities) or otherwise terminated. Such uses are declared by this chapter to
be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. It is further
the intent of this chapter that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon,
expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or
uses not permitted in the district. Within any zoning district, one may request
the Board of Adjustment and Appeals for a permit to physically expand or
enlarge a structure, including the construction or reconstruction of garages
and other accessory buildings normally found in residential areas. The request
shall be filed as a variance with the city on an official application form.
Furthermore, the Board of Adjustment and Appeals shall not grant such a permit
unless it makes the findings required to grant a variance.
      (2)   Nothing herein contained shall require any change in plans,
construction or designated use of a building or structure for which a building
permit has been issued to prior to December 13, 2010, provided however, that
the entire building shall be completed according to such plans as filed within
24 months from the date of issuance of said permit.
   (B)   Nonconforming lots of record. In any district in which single-family
dwellings are permitted, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other
provisions of this chapter, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory
building(s) may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of
this chapter provided that it fronts on a public right-of-way and provided,
further, that the width and area measurements are at least 75% of the minimum
requirements of this chapter. This provision shall apply provided that side
yards and front yard setbacks shall conform to the regulations for the district
in which such lot is located.
   (C)   Nonconforming uses of land.
      (1)   Where, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
chapter, lawful use of land exists that is made no longer permissible under the
terms of this chapter as enacted or amended, such use may be continued, so long
as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
      (2)   General provisions.
         (a)   No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or extended to
occupy a greater area of land than was occupied as of December 13, 2010;
         (b)   No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to
any other portion of the lot or parcel;
         (c)   If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for
a period of more than 12 months, any subsequent use of such land shall conform
to the regulations specified by this chapter for the district in which such
land is located.
   (D)   Nonconforming structures. Where a lawful structure exists as of
December 13, 2010 that could not be built under the terms of this chapter by
reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, elevation or other
characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, such structure may
be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions:
      (1)   No such structure may be enlarged, expanded or otherwise altered in
a way that increases its nonconformity, non-inclusive of repair, replacement,
restoration, maintenance or improvement activities as allowed under M.S. §
462.357, subd. 1e;
      (2)   Should such structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of
more than 50% of its estimated market value at time of destruction, and no
building permit has been applied for within 180 days of when the property was
damaged, the municipality may impose reasonable conditions upon a zoning or
building permit in order to mitigate any newly created impact on adjacent
property or water body(ies);
      (3)   Should such structure be moved for any reason, for any distance, it
shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is
located after it is moved;
      (4)   When a nonconforming use is discontinued or abandoned for twelve
months, the nonconforming use shall not be resumed unless otherwise authorized
under this chapter; and
      (5)   Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the
strengthening or restoration of a structure to a safe condition. Any structure
or component thereof declared unsafe by any official charged with protecting
the public's safety, shall be addressed by the owner in a timely manner.
   (E)   Nonconforming use of land/structures combined.
      (1)   If a lawful use of structures or structures and land in combination
(hereinafter, use) exists at the effective date of this chapter that would not
be allowed in the district under the terms of this chapter, that use may be
continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions:
      (2)   General provisions.
         (a)   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this
chapter in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located; non-inclusive of repair, replacement, restoration, maintenance or
improvement activities as allowed under M.S. § 462.357, subd. 1e;
         (b)   A nonconforming use may be extended throughout any part of a
building which was established, arranged or designed to accommodate such
nonconforming use prior to the adoption of this chapter. No use shall be
extended to occupy any land outside such building;
         (c)   Any nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises,
may be changed to another nonconforming use provided that the Board of
Adjustment and Appeals, by making findings in the specific case, determine that
the proposed use is equally or more appropriate within the district than the
existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the Board of Adjustment
and Appeals may impose such conditions as deemed necessary to protect the
public's interest, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter;
         (d)   Any nonconforming use which is replaced by a permitted or
conditional use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district
in which such structure is located, and the nonconforming use may not
thereafter be resumed or re-established;
         (e)   When a nonconforming use is discontinued or abandoned for twelve
months, the nonconforming use shall not be resumed unless otherwise authorized
under this chapter; and
         (f)   Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and
premises in combination, continuing use of the land in a nonconforming manor
shall not be permitted if the structure is removed or destroyed.
   (F)   Applicability of variance or conditional use permits. If a conditional
use permit has been granted as provided in this chapter, it shall not be deemed
a nonconformity upon adoption of any future amendments or revisions, but shall
continue to only operate under the authority granted within the conditional use
permit. Upon expiration or termination of the conditional use permit, the
property, use or structure shall be subject to all provisions within the
chapter.
   (G)   District boundary changes. Wherever the boundaries of a district shall
be changed so as to transfer an area from one district to another district of a
different classification, the foregoing, therein, shall come into existence
upon the change of district boundaries.
(Ord. passed - -)
§ 153.022 CONDITIONAL USE AND INTERIM USE PERMIT.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. The purpose of a conditional use permit is to
provide a discretionary approval process, for proposed uses which have unique
or widely varying operating characteristics. The procedure is intended to
ensure that proposed conditional uses will not have a significant adverse
impact on surrounding uses or on the general welfare, public health and safety
of the community. An interim use permit shall follow the same guidelines and
process as a conditional use permit, but its intent is to have a termination
date for the approved use.
   (B)   Initiating a request.
      (1)   The Planning Commission or City Council may, upon their own motion,
initiate a conditional use permit request in accordance with the provisions of
this chapter.
      (2)   Any person owning property, or having documented interest therein,
may initiate a request for a conditional use permit for that property in
conformance with the provisions of this chapter. The property owner or
designated representative shall complete the required application for a
conditional use permit which may be obtained from the Zoning Administrator.
   (C)   Filing an application.
      (1)   The application shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator who
shall refer the application together with comments thereon to the Planning
Commission. Such application shall be accompanied by a fee as established by
the City Council. The city, after receipt and review of the application, may
request additional information from the applicant which it deems necessary for
a proper review by the Planning Commission. The request for a conditional use
permit shall be placed on the agenda of a regular or special meeting of the
Planning Commission in a timely manner, and in accordance with state statute.
      (2)   Whenever an application for a conditional use permit has been
considered and denied by the City Council, a similar application for the
conditional use permit affecting the same property shall not be considered
again by the Planning Commission for at least one year from the date of its
denial, except as follows:
         (a)   The Planning Commission determines that the circumstances
surrounding the previous application have changed substantially; or
         (b)   The City Council directs the Planning Commission to reconsider
the permit request by a vote of not less than a majority of all members of the
City Council.
   (D)   Public hearing. Upon receipt of an application for a conditional use
permit, the Zoning Administrator shall set the time and date for a public
hearing. The Planning Commission shall conduct the hearing and report its
findings and make recommendations to the City Council. Notice of said hearing
shall consist of a legal property description and a summary description of the
request, published in a newspaper of general circulation at least ten days
prior to the hearing. In the case of conditional use permits involving an area
of five acres or less, a written notice of said hearing shall be mailed at
least ten days prior to the hearing to all owners of land within 350 feet of
the property to which the amendment relates. A copy of the hearing notice and a
list of the property owners and addresses to which the notice was sent shall be
attested and made a part of the record of the proceeding. Failure of a property
owner to receive said notice, or failure to provide mailed notice to individual
property owners, or defects in the notice shall not invalidate any such
proceedings as set forth within this chapter provided a bona fide attempt has
been made to comply with the notice requirements of this chapter.
   (E)   Consideration of request by Planning Commission. Provided the
applicant has furnished all information, as requested by the Zoning
Administrator, and provided the prescribed notification requirements can be
met, the Planning Commission shall consider the application at its next
meeting. The Planning Commission shall formulate its recommendations and
forward a report and recommended findings of fact to the City Council who shall
consider the request at its next regular meeting. Should the Planning
Commission fail to provide a recommendation to the City Council, the applicant
may appeal directly to the City Council for a decision. Failure of the Planning
Commission to provide a recommendation to the City Council shall not invalidate
the proceedings or actions of the City Council.
   (F)   Consideration of request by City Council.
      (1)   If, upon receiving the report and recommendation of the Planning
Commission, the City Council finds inconsistencies in the review process, the
City Council may refer the matter back to the Planning Commission for further
consideration prior to making a final decision. The City Council shall have the
option to set and hold a public hearing, if deemed necessary, and shall make a
recorded finding of fact and may impose any condition it considers necessary to
protect the health, safety, and welfare.
      (2)   The City Council must take action on the application within 60 days
from the date an application is received and deemed complete by the city. An
application for a conditional use permit may be granted by a majority vote of
the Council.
      (3)   If the City Council grants the conditional use permit, they may
impose such conditions, as may be deemed necessary for, or appropriate to serve
the purposes, of the Comprehensive Plan, the Zoning Ordinance, and to protect
the public health, safety, and welfare.
   (G)   Issuance of a permit. In the issuance of a conditional use permit, the
Planning Commission, may for good reason, recommend approval and the City
Council may approve a use that does not meet all the minimum standards and
requirements of the zoned district. Any standards not met shall be so noted as
part of the conditional use permit.
   (H)   Amendments. An amended conditional use permit shall be applied for in
a manner similar to that required for a new conditional use permit. Amendments
to conditional use permits shall require the submittal of an application and
may include the following scenarios: (a) permit has expired; (b) permit has
been previously denied; or (c) request for substantial changes in conditions or
uses attached to the permit as previously approved. The Planning Commission
may, upon formal review and with approval by all members present, authorize
minor changes which may include, but not limited to the following: location,
siting, heights of buildings or structures and increase in overall coverage of
buildings and structures. However, no change authorized by this division shall
cause any of the following:
      (1)   A change in the use or character of the development;
      (2)   An increase in intensity of use (i.e. gross density, net density or
FAR);
      (3)   An increase in traffic generation (volumes, ADT's, and the like);
      (4)   A modification to off-street parking and loading spaces; or
      (5)   A reduction in required pavement widths.
   (I)   Cancellation, termination or expiration. Where applicable, unless
otherwise specified by the City Council at the time it is authorized, a
conditional use permit shall expire if the applicant fails to utilize such
conditional use permit within one year from the date of its issuance.
   (J)   Appeal. Any person, taxpayer, department, board, or bureau of the city
aggrieved by the decision of the City Council shall have the right to seek
review within 45 days of the decision with a court of record of such decision
in the manner provided by the laws of the State of Minnesota, and particularly
M.S. Ch. 462 as such statute may be from time to time amended, supplemented, or
replaced.

§ 153.023 REZONE REQUESTS AND ORDINANCE AMENDMENTS.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. The regulations, restrictions, and zoning
districts promulgated in this chapter may, from time to time, be amended,

      (1)   The Planning Commission or City Council may, upon their own motion,
initiate a zoning amendment request in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter.
      (2)   Any person owning property, or having documented interest therein,
may initiate a request for a zoning amendment for that property in conformance
with the provisions of this chapter. The property owner or designated
representative shall complete the required application for a zoning amendment
which may be obtained from the Zoning Administrator.
   (C)   Filing an application.
      (1)   The application shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator who
shall refer the application together with comments thereon to the Planning
Commission. Such application shall be accompanied by a fee as established by
the City Council. The Zoning Administrator, after receipt and review of the
application, may request additional information from the applicant which is
deemed necessary for a proper review by the Planning Commission. The request
for a zoning amendment shall be placed on the agenda of a regular or special
meeting of the Planning Commission in a timely manner, and in accordance with
state statute.
      (2)   Whenever an application for a zoning amendment has been considered
and denied by the City Council, a similar application for the zoning amendment
affecting the same property shall not be considered again by the Planning
Commission for at least one year from the date of its denial, except as
follows:
         (a)   The Planning Commission determines that the circumstances
surrounding the previous application have changed substantially; or
         (b)   The City Council, by a two-thirds vote, directs the Planning
Commission to reconsider the zoning amendment.
   (D)   Public hearing. Upon receipt of an application for a zoning amendment,
the Zoning Administrator shall set the time and date for a public hearing. The
Planning Commission shall conduct the hearing and report its findings and make
recommendations to the City Council. Notice of said hearing shall consist of a
legal property description and/or a summary description of the request, and be
published in a newspaper of general circulation at least ten days prior to the

boundaries affecting an area of five acres or less, a written notice of said
hearing shall be mailed at least ten days prior to the hearing to all owners of
land within 350 feet of the property to which the amendment relates. A copy of
the hearing notice and a list of the property owners and addresses to which the
notice was sent shall be attested and made a part of the record of the
proceeding. Failure of a property owner to receive said notice, or failure to
provide mailed notice to individual property owners, or defects in the notice
shall not invalidate any such proceedings as set forth within this chapter
provided a bona fide attempt has been made to comply with the notice
requirements of this chapter.
   (E)   Consideration of request by Planning Commission. Providing the
applicant has furnished all information, as requested by the Zoning
Administrator, and provided the prescribed notification requirements can be
met, the Planning Commission shall consider the application at its next
meeting. The Planning Commission shall formulate its recommendations and
forward a report and recommended findings of fact to the City Council who shall
consider the request at its next regular meeting. Should the Planning
Commission fail to provide a recommendation to the City Council, the applicant
may appeal directly to the City Council for a decision. Failure of the Planning
Commission to provide a recommendation to the City Council shall not invalidate
the proceedings or actions of the City Council.
   (F)   Consideration of request by City Council.
      (1)   If, upon receiving the report and recommendation of the Planning
Commission, the City Council finds inconsistencies in the review process, the
City Council may refer the matter back to the Planning Commission for further
consideration prior to making a final decision. The City Council shall have the

§ 153.024 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. The variance process is intended to provide
limited relief from the requirements of this chapter in those circumstances
where strict application of a particular requirement will create a practical
difficulty or unnecessary hardship prohibiting the use of land in a manner
otherwise allowed under this chapter. It is not intended that variances be
granted for the establishment or expansion of a use within a zone district
where it is not permitted.
   (B)   Initiating a request. Any person owning property, or having documented
interest therein, may initiate a request for a variance for that property in
conformance with the provisions of this chapter. The property owner or
designated representative shall complete the required application for a
variance which may be obtained from the Zoning Administrator.
   (C)   Filing an application.
      (1)   The property owner or designated representative shall complete the
required application for a variance which may be obtained from the Zoning
Administrator. Such application shall be accompanied by a fee as established by
the City Council. The application for a variance shall be filed with the Zoning
Administrator. The Zoning Administrator, after review of the application, shall
have the authority to request additional information from the applicant which
is deemed necessary for a proper review by the Board of Adjustment and Appeals.
The request for a variance shall be placed on the agenda of the Board of
Adjustment and Appeals to occur no later than 60 days from the date of
submission.
      (2)   Variance requests for the same property, of similar intent, shall
not be heard within six months of a previous request unless it can be
demonstrated to the Zoning Administrator that the conditions for the variance
have changed.
   (D)   Public hearing. Upon receipt of an application for a variance, the
Zoning Administrator shall set the time and date for the public hearing. Notice
of said hearing shall consist of a legal property description and a summary
description of the request, published in a newspaper of general circulation at
least ten days prior to the hearing. In the case of variances affecting an area
of five acres or less, a written notice of said hearing shall be mailed at
least ten days prior to the hearing to all owners of land within 350 feet of
the property to which the variance relates. A copy of the hearing notice and a
list of the property owners and addresses to which the notice was sent shall be
attested and made a part of the record of the proceeding. Failure of a property
owner to receive said notice, or failure to provide mailed notice to individual
property owners, or defects in the notice shall not invalidate any such
proceedings as set forth within this chapter provided a bona fide attempt has
been made to comply with the notice requirements of this chapter.
   (E)   Consideration of request by Board of Adjustment and Appeals.
      (1)   The Board of Adjustment and Appeals shall make findings of fact and
shall decide whether to approve, conditionally approve or deny the request for
variance within 60 days from the date an application is received and deemed
complete by the city. A variance to this chapter shall not be granted unless
approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Adjustment and Appeals.
      (2)   A variance from any provision(s) within this chapter shall not be
granted unless the Board of Adjustment makes findings, based upon competent
material and substantial evidence that the request complies with the following
factors that must be satisfied in constituting an undue hardship:
         (a)   The property cannot be put to a reasonable use if used under
conditions allowed by this chapter;
         (b)   The plight of the landowner is due to circumstances unique to
the property and not created by the landowner; and
         (c)   The variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character
of locality.
   (F)   Conditions of approval. In authorizing a variance, the Board may, in
addition to the specific conditions of approval called for in this chapter,
attach such other conditions regarding the location, character, landscaping, or
treatment reasonably necessary to further the intent and spirit of this chapter
and the protection of the public interest.
   (G)   Cancellation, termination or expiration. Unless otherwise specified by
the Board of Adjustment and Appeals at the time it is authorized, a variance
shall expire if the applicant fails to utilize such variance within one year
from the date of its issuance.
   (H)   Appeals.
      (1)   To appeal a decision of the Board of Adjustment and Appeals, a
written notice of appeal must be filed with the city within 45 days of the
decision of the Board of Adjustment and Appeals. Appeals to the City Council
and appeals from the City Council's decision shall be in accordance with the
procedures for appeals from the Board of Adjustment and Appeals set forth in §
153.025.
      (2)   Any person, taxpayer, department, board, or bureau of the city
aggrieved by the decision of the City Council shall have the right to seek
review within 45 days of the decision with a court of record of such decision
in the manner provided by the laws of the State of Minnesota, and particularly
M.S. Ch. 462 as such statute may be from time to time amended, supplemented, or
replaced.

residences.
      (5)   Multiple-Family Residential District (R-4). This district is

of manufactured home park(s) with certain restrictions to provide the residents
in that district a safe, healthy environment.

to provide an area for commercial development of a nature that is compatible
and complementary with adjacent residential areas.

      (3)   Building standards.
         (a)   Building materials. All buildings in the mixed-use district
shall use high-quality and durable exterior building materials that contribute
to the visual look and small-town character of the neighborhood including
lighting, textures, colors, and architectural features that are compatible with
adjacent structures and functions.

that incorporates and complements the primary materials such as decorative
metal, tile, wood, stucco, vinyl panels and other aesthetically pleasing
materials shall be included in the facade. EIFS may be used as an accent
material. At a minimum, accent materials shall comprise 20% of the building
facade.
            3.   Prohibited materials. Exterior materials that shall not be
included in the building design include untextured concrete and corrugated
metal unless allowed by the City Council because of the materials contribution
to the building design.

as quoins or corbels.
            4.   Awnings - specific standards.
               a.   Intent. Historically awnings have been a frequent feature
of buildings in the downtown. Awnings have been used to soften a hard and rigid
streetscape. Awnings enhance the historic feel of the district, while providing
sun protection for display windows, shelter for pedestrians, and provide
additional accent color and design to building facades.
               b.   Approval required. Color renderings meeting the conditions
identified below and showing the location, size, color and any proposed signage
for an awning shall be submitted for review by the Planning Commission:

distinguishable from the upper floors.
            4.   Awnings - specific standards.
               a.   Intent. Historically awnings have been a frequent feature
of buildings in the downtown. Awnings have been used to soften a hard and rigid
streetscape. Awnings enhance the historic feel of the district, while providing
sun protection for display windows, shelter for pedestrians, and provide
additional accent color and design to building facades.
               b.   Approval required. Color renderings meeting the conditions
identified below and showing the location, size, color and any proposed signage
for an awning shall be submitted for review by the Planning Commission:

SUPPLEMENTARY REGULATIONS
§ 153.060 OFF-STREET PARKING REQUIREMENTS AND STANDARDS.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. The regulation of off-street parking spaces in
this Zoning Ordinance is to alleviate and/or prevent congestion within the
public right-of-way. The regulations are intended to promote the safety and
general welfare of the public, by establishing minimum requirements for off-
street parking (motorized vehicles) in accordance with the utilization of
various parcels of land. The regulations and requirements set forth herein
shall apply to all off-street parking facilities in all of the zoning districts
within city limits.
   (B)   Site plan requirements. All applications for a building permit,
certificate of occupancy or other planning permits/approvals as required under
this section shall be accompanied by a site plan. Site plans shall be drawn to
scale (and accurately dimensioned) indicating the location of off-street
parking and loading spaces in compliance with the requirements set forth in
this section. All site plans for single-family homes must provide for the
location of at least a two stall garage, except for the R-1 District, where the
plan must provide for the location of at least a one stall garage.
   (C)   General provisions.
      (1)   Floor area. The term "floor area" for the purpose of calculating
the number of off-street parking spaces required shall be determined on the
basis of the exterior floor dimensions of the buildings, structures or use
times the number of floors, minus 10%, unless otherwise modified by this
chapter. Where mechanical spaces, storage areas, or other unoccupied areas
exceed 10% of the area of a building or structure, the area in excess of the
10% may be deducted from the gross floor area.
      (2)   Reduction of existing off-street parking space. Off-street parking
spaces existing upon the effective date of this chapter shall not be reduced in
number or size unless said number or size exceeds the requirements set forth
herein for a similar new use.
      (3)   Nonconforming structures. Should a nonconforming structure or use
be damaged or destroyed by fire, it may be re-established if elsewhere
permitted in these zoning regulations, except that in doing so, any off-street
parking or loading space which existed before shall be retained, if deemed
appropriate by the city (for more on nonconforming structures, see §
153.021).
      (4)   Change of use or occupancy of land. No change of use or occupancy
of land already dedicated to a parking area, parking spaces, or loading spaces
shall be made, nor shall any sale of land, division or subdivision of land be
made which reduces area necessary for parking, parking stalls or parking
requirements below the minimum prescribed by these zoning regulations.
      (5)   Change of use or occupancy of buildings. Any change of use or
occupancy of any building or buildings including additions thereto requiring
more parking area shall not be permitted until there is furnished such
additional parking spaces as required by these zoning regulations.
      (6)   Calculating space.
         (a)   When determining the number of off-street parking spaces results
in a fraction, each fraction over one-half shall constitute another space.
         (b)   In stadiums, sports arenas, churches and other places of public
assembly in which patrons or spectators occupy benches, pews or other similar
seating facilities, each 22 inches of such seating facilities shall be counted
as one seat for the purpose of determining requirements.
         (c)   Except as provided for under joint parking and shopping centers,
should a structure contain two or more types of use, the sum of each shall be
calculated separately and shall be used for determining the total off-street
parking required.
   (D)   Stall, aisle and driveway design.
      (1)   Parking space size. Each parking space shall not be less than nine
feet wide and 18 feet in length, and each space shall be served by adequate
access aisles. Accessible stalls shall meet the requirements of the Building
Code.
      (2)   Off-street parking facilities. All off-street parking facilities
shall be designed and constructed with appropriated means of vehicular access
to a public street.
      (3)   Within structures. Off-street parking requirements may be met by
providing space(s) within the principal building or within an attached
structure; however, unless provisions are made, no building permit shall be
issued to convert said parking structure into a dwelling unit, living area or
other activity until verification is provided that all off-street parking
provisions within this section have been satisfactory met.
      (4)   Circulation. Except in the case of single-family, two-family and
townhouse dwellings, parking areas shall be designed so that circulation
between parking bays or aisles occurs within the designated parking lot and
does not depend upon a public street or alley. Except in the case of single-
family, two-family and townhouse dwellings, parking design which requires
backing into the public street is prohibited.
      (5)   R-1 District. The required parking spaces serving existing
dwellings in the R-1 District may be designed for parking not more than two
vehicles in a tandem arrangement for each dwelling unit in order to comply with
the requirements of this section.
      (6)   Compliance. Except in the case of single-family, two-family and
townhouse dwellings, parking areas and their aisles shall be developed in
compliance with the standards on the Parking Lot Dimension Table.
      (7)   Grade. The grade of any parking area shall not exceed 5%.
      (8)   Surfacing. Except in the case of farm dwellings and operations,
seasonal recreational uses, and residential uses in the TZ District, driveways
and parking stalls shall be surfaced with asphalt or concrete. In industrial
zones, driveways and parking stalls may be surfaced with gravel, crushed
concrete, or other materials equivalent in controlling dust and drainage, as
approved by the City Engineer. Gravel (or other similar materials) shall only
be used when fewer than five parking stalls are required. Any approval for
surfaces other than asphalt or concrete shall be contingent upon submittal of a
grading plan and City Engineer approval. Site or construction plans to improve
a driveway (surface improvements/drainage) or parking lots for five or more
vehicles shall be submitted to the City Engineer for review. All grading and
drainage plans are subject to the approval of the City Engineer. At any time an
improvement is made which increases the demand for parking spaces, as a
condition of the building permit or any other permit as authorized under this
chapter, all nonconforming parking lot surfaces or driveways existing on the
lot in question must be brought to full compliance.
      (9)   Striping. Except for single-family, two-family, and townhouse
dwellings, all parking stalls shall be marked with white or yellow painted
lines not less than four inches wide or blue lines as required for disabled
parking.
      (10)   Lighting. Any lighting used to illuminate an off-street parking
area shall be hooded and located to reflect the light away from adjoining
property, abutting residential uses and public rights-of-way.
      (11)   Required screening. All open off-street parking areas of five or
more spaces shall be screened and landscaped from abutting residential
districts.
      (12)   Driveway turn-arounds. In the case of single-family, two-family
and townhouse dwellings, which abut streets designated as collector, minor
arterial or principal arterial (see the city's Comprehensive Plan), the
installation of a vehicle turn-around space, immediately adjacent to the access
driveway shall be considered. Said space shall be no larger than ten feet wide
and 15 feet in length. Where possible, said space shall be located away from
the principal structure and shall be no closer than 20 feet from the street
surface. Said space is not to be utilized for parking purposes.
   (E)   Maintenance responsibilities. It shall be the responsibility of the
owner of the principal use, uses or buildings to maintain the parking space,
access ways, striping and required screening.
   (F)   Placement. All off-street parking spaces will be regulated as follows:
      (1)   Location. Off-street parking spaces required by division (I) below
must be on the same lot under the same ownership as the principal use being
served, except off-street parking spaces regulated by divisions (J) and (K).
      (2)   Head-in parking prohibited. Except for single-family, two-family
and townhouse dwellings, head-in parking, directly off of and adjacent to a
public street, with each stall having its own direct access to the public
street, shall be prohibited.
      (3)   No parking area. The boulevard portion of the street right-of-way
may not be used for parking unless approved by the city.
      (4)   Setback area. Required off-street parking shall not be provided in
required front yards or in required side yards in the case of corner lots, in
residentially zoned districts.
      (5)   Location of spaces for one- and two-family dwellings. Required off-
street parking spaces for one- and two-family dwellings must be in the rear
yard, side yards, garage, or car port. Parking spaces, including their access
drives, provided in addition to required spaces must be paved with asphalt or
concrete when such spaces are located in a front or side yard. Spaces in a rear
yard may be surfaced with gravel.
      (6)   Recreational equipment, recreational vehicles, utility trailers or
equipment, and off-road vehicles. Recreational equipment, recreational
vehicles, utility trailers or equipment, and off-road vehicles kept in a front
or side yard must be parked on a paved surface. Recreational equipment,
recreational vehicles, utility trailers or equipment, and off-road vehicles
kept in a rear yard may be parked on an unpaved surface.
      (7)   Enforcement. Violations may be enforced through tagging.
   (G)   Use of required area. Required off-street parking spaces in any
district shall not be utilized for open storage, sale or rental of goods,
repair work, storage of inoperable vehicles and/or storage of snow.
   (H)   Accessible parking spaces. Accessible parking spaces shall be provided
in accordance with the state Building Code.

§ 153.062 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD) OVERLAY.
   (A)   Purpose and intent.
      (1)   A Planned Unit Development may be established in any residential or
commercial district under the conditional-use process described under §
153.022. A PUD is a designated parcel of land that encourages a creative
approach to the use of land by allowing considerable flexibility in the design
of the site and buildings. Specific aspects of flexibility (including permitted
uses, dimensional requirements, densities, dedication requirements, and the
like) shall be contingent upon review and approval by the Planning Commission
and the City Council, pursuant to the conditional use permit process, and upon
such approval, shall prevail over conflicting requirements listed elsewhere
within this chapter or within the Dilworth Subdivision Ordinance.
      (2)   The intent of the PUD regulations is to permit greater flexibility
and, consequently, more creative and imaginative design for the development of
residential areas than under conventional zoning regulations. It is further
intended to promote more economical and efficient use of the land while
providing a harmonious variety of housing choices, a higher level of urban
amenities, and preservation of natural scenic qualities of open spaces.
   (B)   Coordinating regulatory documents.
      (1)   It is the intent of this section that subdivision review, under the
Subdivision Ordinance, be carried out simultaneously with the review of a
Planned Unit Development under this section.
      (2)   The development plans submitted under this section must be
submitted in a form which will satisfy the requirements of the Subdivision
Ordinance for preliminary and final plats.
      (3)   The requirements for both this section and those of the Subdivision
Ordinance shall apply to all Planned Unit Developments, and all actions of the
City Council pertaining to Planned Unit Developments shall be based upon a
recommendation by the Planning Commission.
   (C)   Lot requirements.
      (1)   Harmony. The Planned Unit Development shall be planned, designed
and landscaped in such a manner as to blend and harmonize with the surrounding
adjacent areas.
      (2)   Yard requirements. Minimal specifications for yard requirements are
imposed to allow design flexibility. However, side yard and backyard
requirements shall conform along the developments outermost lot line to the
side yard and backyard requirements of the adjacent district. Except in the
case of higher density, multi-family, or non-residential development where
there must be a minimum 30 foot buffer zone along adjacent, low-density
residential districts. The buffer zone must be kept free of buildings or
structures and must be landscaped, screened or protected by natural features,
so that adverse effects on surrounding areas are minimized.
      (3)   Front yard. Minimum front yard setback requirements are intended to
provide privacy and usable yard area for residents. Front yard setbacks may be
reduced at the discretion of the city through the PUD process if the applicant
can implement/accommodate appropriate screening, plantings, traffic reduction,
building orientation or other acceptable mitigation methods.
      (4)   Lot width. Minimum lot widths are intended to prevent the
construction of long, narrow buildings with inadequate privacy, light, and air.
Within the constraints of the PUD process, lot width standards may be reduced
if the project design implements/accommodates provisions that allow light, air
and privacy for all living spaces in an appropriate manner;
      (5)   Building spacing. Requirements for side yard setbacks are based on
several related factors:
         (a)   Privacy. Minimum building space requirements are intended to
provide privacy for dwelling units. Where applicants seek reduced side yard
setbacks it shall be necessary that site plans and building elevations locate
windows and any necessary screening to ensure adequate privacy between units.
         (b)   Light and air. Building spacing shall provide adequate access to
light and air to all dwelling units.
         (c)   Building configuration. Where building configuration is
irregular so that the needs expressed in the above items are met by the
building configuration, reduced building space is permissible, as appropriate.
         (d)   Open space.
            1.   Common open space shall comprise at least 25% of the gross
area of the Planned Unit Development to be used for recreational, park or
environmental amenities for the collective enjoyment by occupants of the
development. Open space dedications are non-inclusive of public or private
streets, driveways, or utility easements, provided, however, that up to 75% of
the required open space may be composed of open space on privately owned
properties dedicated by easement to assure that the open space will be
permanent.
            2.   Recreation facilities, recreational structures and any
accessory uses located in common recreation areas shall be considered open
space under the provision that total impervious surfaces (paving, roofs, and
the like) constitute no more than 5% of the total open space.
      (6)   All land shown on the final development plan as common open space
must be conveyed under one of the following options:
         (a)   It may be conveyed to a public agency which will agree to
maintain the common open space and any buildings, structures, or improvements
which have been placed on it; or
         (b)   It may be conveyed to trustees provided in an indenture
establishing an association or similar organization for the maintenance of the
Planned Unit Development. The common open space must be conveyed to the
trustees subject to covenants to be approved by the Planning Commission which
shall restrict the common open space to the uses specified on the final
development plan, and which provide for the maintenance of the common open
space in a manner which assures its continued use for its intended purpose.
      (7)   Existing trees shall be preserved, where possible. The location of
trees must be considered when planning the common open space, location of
buildings, underground services, walks, paved area, playgrounds, parking areas,
and finished grade levels.
   (D)   Administration.
      (1)   An application for approval of a PUD shall be filed with the Zoning
Administrator. The PUD applications shall be filed in the name or names of the
recorded owner or owners of property included in the development and/or the
applications may be filed by holder(s) of an equitable interest in such
property.
      (2)   Application process.
         (a)   Fee. An application for approval shall be accompanied by a fee
to be established by the City Council and available at City Hall.
         (b)   Review process. The review process shall follow the conditional
use application procedure as described in §
153.022 and the subdivision review process as outlined in the Dilworth
Subdivision Ordinance. Applications shall be processed concurrently.
   (E)   Enforcement.
      (1)   If construction has not been initiated within 12 months from the
approval date of the PUD, said approval shall lapse and be of no further
effect. The Planning Commission, upon showing of good cause by the applicant,
may extend for period(s) of six months, the time for beginning construction.
      (2)   After general construction commences, the Zoning Administrator
shall review, at least once every year, all building permits issued and compare
them to the overall development phasing program. If the Zoning Administrator
determines that the rate of construction (residential units or nonresidential
structures) substantially differs from the phasing program, city staff shall
notify the applicant and Building Official, in writing; thereafter, the
Building Official may issue such orders to the applicant which may include the
suspension of further construction or other sanctions as deemed appropriate by
the city.
   (F)   Intra-development circulation.
      (1)   PUD districts shall be located with respect to major streets and
highways or other transportation facilities. Consideration should be given to
the means in which the local transportation network is connected with streets,
alleys or roadways within the PUD. Standards of design and construction for
roadways, both public and private, within planned residential development
districts may be modified as is deemed appropriate by the City Council, after
receipt of recommendations from the Fire Chief, Chief of Police, Street
Department and City Engineer. Right-of-way width and street roadway widths may
be reduced as deemed appropriate by the City Council, specifically where the
following is identified: the PUD plan provides for the separation of vehicular
and pedestrian circulation patterns and establishes adequate off-street parking
facilities.
      (2)   If the owners in the future should request that the private streets

§ 153.063 MOVING/RE-LOCATION OF BUILDINGS.
   (A)   State licensure requirement. No person, except a state licensed house
mover, shall remove, raise or support a building or structure free of its
foundation within the limits of the city. The above shall not be construed as a
measure to prevent the owners of a building or structure from personally
raising, moving or supporting such building or structure upon their own
premises.
   (B)   Permit requirements and application process.
      (1)   Permit required. Every licensed house mover or building owner
shall, before raising, moving or supporting free of its foundation any building
or structure, obtain a permit therefore from the city.
      (2)   A person seeking a permit shall contact the Building Official to
receive an application for inspecting the property and must file the completed
application form with the Zoning Administrator. The applicant shall present
plans to the Building Official which at minimum, shall indicate lot size,
orientation of the structure on the property respective to setback requirements
and lot coverage requirements. The plan review shall be charged at 65% of the
building permit fee (§ 107.3 Uniform Building Code) and a mileage charge
(consistent with federal mileage rate) will apply if buildings are located
outside the established metropolitan urban area. The Building Official shall
physically inspect all buildings to be moved within/into the city (unless the
building/structure is new construction and an inspection report from a Building
Official is provided declaring the building/structure consistent with
applicable codes).
      (3)   Upon receipt of a completed moving permit application, which shall
include an inspection report from the Building Official(including filing fee),
the Zoning Administrator shall schedule a hearing before the Planning
Commission to consider the permit application, and mail notices to neighboring
landowners within 350 feet of the boundary of the property to which the
structure is proposed to be located. Such written notice shall be mailed at
least 10 days prior to the hearing and a copy of the hearing notice and list of
the property owners and addresses to which the notice was sent shall be
attested and made a part of the record of the proceeding. Failure of a property
owner to receive said notice shall not invalidate any such proceedings as set
forth within this section, provided a bona fide attempt has been made to comply
with the notice requirements in this section.
      (4)   Any application for a permit shall be accompanied by a permit fee,
which shall be in an amount equal to the fee charged for a conditional use
permit. Such fee shall not be refundable if the permit is denied.
      (5)   Notice of the hearing and a copy of the application shall be
provided to the Dilworth Public Works Department, Dilworth Police Department,
Northern States Power Company, and Red River Valley Co-op (city staff
requirement).
      (6)   The Planning Commission, in determining whether or not to recommend
approval of the moving permit, shall consider the same criteria that apply to
the issuance of conditional use permits. In addition, they shall consider the
following factors:
         (a)   Whether the building/structure is potentially structurally
unsafe and could endanger persons or property within the city if moved;
         (b)   Whether the structure is structurally sound and capable of
meeting Building Code requirements subsequent to the move; and
         (c)   To note, the Building Official may require code compliance work
to be completed before the structure is allowed to be re-located.
      (7)   Any permit granted must be in compliance with the rules of the
Northern State Power Company, and/or Red River Valley Co-op relative to the
interruption of electrical service to its customers.
      (8)   The Planning Commission, in recommending approval of a permit, may
institute conditions upon the permit which may include, but not limited to the
following.
         (a)   The route to be followed in moving the structure;
         (b)   The date and time limits in which the building may be moved;
         (c)   The amount of time in which Northern State Power Company, and/or
Red River Valley Co-op or other association or corporation owning, operating or
controlling wires or cable that must be moved or displaced to accommodate the
move has to remove or displace wires or cables after receipt of notice of the
time of the move and the amount of cash deposit, performance bond or completion
bond that should be required by the City Council, if any;
         (d)   The amount of a cash deposit or letter of credit for estimated
costs that may be incurred on behalf of the city, as required by the City
Council; and
         (e)   Alterations or repairs that must be made to the structure to
comply with Building Code requirements and/or to upgrade the building to
maintain neighborhood integrity and appearance.
      (9)   After recommendation by the Planning Commission, the matter shall
be placed on the agenda of the next City Council meeting. A favorable vote of a
majority of the Council members present shall be required to approve the
permit.
      (10)   If a permit is approved, a cash deposit, performance bond or
completion bond in an amount set in the permit (if any) shall be filed with the
City Administrator prior to the issuance of the permit, and be signed by a good
and sufficient surety, setting forth the completion date therein. Such bond, if
required, is for the purpose of ensuring that alterations and repairs to the
structure as required within the Building Code or as required as a condition of
the permit, are accomplished. The date of completion shall be set by the City
Council and the Building Official.
      (11)   In cases where a building is being moved outside the city limits
of Dilworth, or in the case where an accessory building or single story garage
are to be moved, the application and application fee shall be filed with the
Zoning Administrator, but no hearing or approval of the Planning Commission or
City Council is required unless otherwise deemed necessary by the Zoning
Administrator. In this circumstance, the Zoning Administrator may approve the
permit and attach any conditions permitted within division (C)(8) above after
providing notice and having consultation with the Dilworth Public Works
Department, the Dilworth Police Department and Northern States Power Company,
and/or Red River Valley Co-op. Any applicant whose moving permit is denied by
the Zoning Administrator under this section may appeal such decision to the
City Council within 14 days of the denial of the permit.

for any purpose are attached, shall notify the persons, associations or
corporations owning or controlling such electric wiring, cables or piping. The
person, association or corporation following notification, shall, within the
time established on the permit, or if no time is established in the permit,
within a reasonable time thereafter, disconnect and make safe the electric
wires, cables or piping.
      (2)   In every case in which a permit is issued as herein provided, it
shall be the duty of the person, association or corporation with ownership or
controlling interests in the wire, cable or pipe to remove or displace the
utility. The cost shall be the burden of the person whom receives the permit,
or as otherwise negotiated between the person and the utility provider.
      (3)   The person to whom a permit has been issued shall notify the
Dilworth Police Department, Dilworth Public Works Department, Northern States
Power Company, and/or Red River Valley Co-op, and the person, association or
corporation owning, operating or controlling such wire, cable or pipe, to
remove or displace the utility concurrently with the removal of said house,
building or structure. Such time shall conform with the conditions of the
permit on time of move, if any, and the period of time in which Northern States
Power Company, Red River Valley Co-op or other association or corporation has
to move or displace overhead wires or cables shall be as set out in the permit,

must not be approved unless the applicant proves that the telecommunications
equipment planned for the proposed tower cannot be accommodated on an existing
or approved tower or building within a reasonable search radius of the proposed
tower due to one or more of the following reasons:
         (a)   The planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity of
the existing or approved tower or building, as documented by a qualified
professional engineer, and the existing or approved tower cannot be reinforced
or modified to accommodate planned or equivalent equipment at a reasonable
cost;
         (b)   The planned equipment would cause interference materially
impacting the usability of other existing or planned equipment at the tower or
building as documented by a qualified professional engineer and the
interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost;
         (c)   Existing or approved towers and building within the search
radius cannot accommodate the planned equipment at a height necessary to
function reasonably as documented by a qualified professional engineer; or
         (d)   Other unforeseen reasons that make it infeasible to locate the
planned telecommunications equipment upon an existing or approved tower or
building.
      (2)   Any proposed commercial telecommunications tower must be designed,
structurally, electrically, and in all respects, to accommodate both the
applicant's antennas and comparable antennas for at least one additional user.

public street within a front or side yard, with the following exceptions:
         (a)   In industrial zoning districts, towers may be placed within a
side yard abutting an internal industrially zoned street; and
         (b)   On sites adjacent to public streets (enclosed by public right-
of-way), towers may be placed within a side yard abutting a local street.
      (4)   A tower's setback may be reduced or its location in relation to a
public street adjusted, at the sole discretion of the City Council, to allow
the integration of a tower into an existing or proposed structure such as a
church steeple, light standard, power line support device, or similar structure
or if the applicant provides evidence that a setback reduction is necessary to
successfully engage in commercial telecommunication services.
   (G)   Tower height. All proposed towers must meet the following height
limitations:
      (1)   The height of towers will be determined by measuring the vertical
distance from the tower's center point of contact with the ground or rooftop to
the highest point of the tower, including all antennas or other attachments.
When towers are mounted upon other structures, the combined height of the
structure and tower must meet the height restrictions; and
      (2)   Towers must conform to the following height restrictions:
         (a)   In all residential zoning districts, the maximum height of any
tower, including antennas and other attachments, will be the maximum height
restriction for primary structures within that zoning district;
         (b)   In all non-residential zoning districts, the maximum height of
any tower, including all antennas and other attachments, must not exceed one
foot for each two feet the tower is setback from a residential zoning district
or a maximum height of 150 feet, whichever is less, unless the applicant
provides evidence to the city that the proposed tower height is technically
necessary to successfully engage in commercial communication services; and
         (c)   All towers shall conform to these maximum height restrictions,
unless located upon public buildings and utility structures, church
sanctuaries, steeples and bell towers.

   (A)   Purpose and intent. The purpose of this section is to establish
minimum guidelines for transient (i.e. temporary, mobile) merchants wishing to
conduct business within the City of Dilworth. This section provides
requirements that promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of
the citizens of Dilworth, Minnesota and establish reasonable and uniform
regulations for transient merchants.
   (B)   Definitions.
      TRANSIENT MERCHANT/BUSINESS. Includes any person, individual, co-
partnership, limited liability company, and corporation, both as principal and
agent, who engage in, do, or transact any temporary and transient business in
Dilworth, MN, either in one locality, or in traveling from place to a place
within Dilworth, selling goods, wares, and merchandise; and who, for the
purpose of carrying on such business, hire, lease, occupy, or use a building,
structure, vacant lot, or railroad car for the exhibition and sale of such
goods, wares, and merchandise. The term TRANSIENT MERCHANT does not include a
seller or exhibitor in a firearms collector show involving two or more sellers
or exhibitors.
   (C)   Procedure for operating as a transient merchant. The following will
apply to transient merchants within any of Dilworth's commercial or industrial
zoning districts (zones C-1, C-2, C-3, I-1, and I-2). Transient merchants are
prohibited in all other zoning districts:
      (1)   Anyone wishing to operate a transient merchant must first obtain a
permit from Dilworth City Hall. No person shall operate as a transient merchant
in the city without an issued permit. Said permit will cost $200 (non-
refundable) and go into the City of Dilworth's general fund revenue.
      (2)   The permit will be reviewed by Dilworth staff to ensure zoning
compliance.
      (3)   If during the time the permit is in effect the transient merchant
fails to maintain the required conditions pursuant to this section, the City of
Dilworth may revoke the permit and the transient merchant activity shall be
terminated.
      (4)   Transient merchants may appeal a City of Dilworth zoning action in
accordance with §
153.025.
   (D)   Required conditions. Approval of a transient business permit is

of their duration, but the transient merchant must be relocated at a minimum of
1000 feet (measured in radial distance) from the prior location.
      (5)   A site plan must be submitted for review and approval. The site
plan shall include a mapped location of the proposed business, including
existing parking spaces, roadways, sidewalks, and buildings; it should also
entail measurements of distance from proposed display/enclosure to nearby
parking spaces, roadways, sidewalks, setbacks, and buildings. Aerial
photography, existing surveys, or plat will suffice for this purpose. The site
plan shall include any photography of tents, trailers, stands, and the like
that will be used. The City of Dilworth has the right to review and/or reject
any site plan submitted. Once approved by the city, all site plans must be
maintained by the transient merchant with the duration of the permit. Any
deviation from the site plan by the transient merchant may result in revocation
of the permit and the business activity shall be terminated.
      (6)   If a transient merchant distributes or prepares food products, a
copy of a permit issued by Clay County Environmental Health is required to be
kept on file. Revocation of the permit will constitute revocation of the
transient merchant license.

Subdivision Ordinance of the City of Dilworth, Minnesota. This Subdivision
Ordinance shall become effective on May 26, 2015 and is referred to within this
chapter as either the "Subdivision Ordinance," "chapter," or "Ordinance".
   (B)   Purpose. All divisions of land thereafter submitted to the city must
fully comply with the regulations to:
      (1)   Provide for and guide the orderly, economic, and safe development
of land, urban services, and facilities;
      (2)   Encourage well-planned, efficient, and attractive subdivisions by
establishing adequate and impartial standards for design and construction;

      (6)   Set the minimum requirements necessary to protect the public
health, safety, and general welfare.
   (C)   Scope of legal authority.
      (1)   The rules and regulations governing plats and subdivision of land
contained herein will apply within the boundaries of the city and within all
unincorporated areas from the city's boundary for a distance of two miles as
permitted by M.S. § 462.358. In the event of overlapping jurisdiction within
the prescribed area, the extent of overlapping jurisdiction will be determined
and agreed upon between the city and the other municipality or municipalities
concerned. This title is not intended to repeal, annul, or in any way impair or
interfere with existing provisions of other laws, ordinances, or with
restrictive covenants running with the land except those specifically repealed
by or in conflict with this chapter.
      (2)   The city has the power and authority to review, amend, and approve
subdivisions of land already recorded in the office of the County Recorder if
such plats are entirely or partially undeveloped.
      (3)   The plat will be considered to be entirely or partially undeveloped
if it meets one or both of the following criteria:
         (a)   The plat has been recorded with the County Recorder without
prior approval by the city where approval was required. This applies to all
plats within the corporate limits and all plats filed after February 21, 1973,
that fall within Dilworth's two mile subdivision jurisdiction.
         (b)   The plat has been approved by the city and the approval has been
granted more than three years prior to granting a building permit on the
partially or entirely undeveloped land and the subdivision or zoning
regulations for the district in which the subdivision is located have been
changed subsequent to the original final subdivision approval.
   (D)   Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the
provisions of this chapter shall be held to be the minimum requirements adopted
for the promotion of the public health, safety, and welfare and to implement
the Comprehensive Plan. The City Council and/or Planning Commission has the
option, however, to deviate from the standards set forth herein as part of a
preplanned, coordinated development project processed as a Planned Unit
Development or land subdivision as governed by the Subdivision Ordinance.
Moreover, as specified herein, developer's agreements approved by the city and
the applicant may be utilized to accommodate special situations.
   (E)   Existing law.
      (1)   General. This Subdivision Ordinance is intended to compliment other
local, state, and federal regulations that affect zoning and land use. This
chapter is not intended to revoke or repeal any other public law, ordinance,
regulation, or permit. However, where conditions, standards, or requirements
imposed by any provision of this chapter are either more or less restrictive
than comparable standards imposed by other public law, ordinance, or
regulation, the provisions that are more restrictive or that impose higher
standards or requirements, as determined by the city, shall govern.
      (2)   Private agreements. This Subdivision Ordinance is not intended to
revoke or repeal any easement, covenant, or other private agreement. However,
where the regulations of this chapter are more restrictive or impose higher
standards or requirements than such easement, covenant, or other private
agreement, then the requirements of this chapter shall govern. Regulations
within this chapter shall not be construed to modify or repeal any private
covenant, deed restriction, or agreement; however, such private covenant,
restriction, or agreement shall not provide a means to avoid compliance with
this chapter. The city is not obligated in any manner to enforce or administer
provisions established within private covenants, agreements, or restrictions.
   (F)   Severability. If any section or provision of this chapter is declared
by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unconstitutional or invalid, such
decision shall not affect the validity of the chapter as a whole, or any part,
thereof, other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
   (G)   Relation to the adopted Comprehensive Plan. Enforcement, amendment,
and administration of this chapter will be accomplished with due consideration
of the recommendations contained in the Comprehensive Plan for the City of
Dilworth, Minnesota, as adopted and periodically amended by the Planning
Commission and City Council. The City Council recognizes the Comprehensive Plan
as the principle guidance for regulating land use and development in accordance
with the policies and purpose set forth in this chapter.
   (H)   Authority. This chapter is enacted pursuant to authority granted by
the Municipal Planning Act, M.S. §§ 462.351 to 462.363.
   (I)   Public purpose. Regulation of subdivision of land and the attachment
of reasonable conditions to land subdivision is an exercise of valid police
power delegated by the state to this municipality. The developer has the duty
of compliance with reasonable conditions laid down by the Planning Commission
for design, dedication, improvement, and restrictive use of the land to conform
to the physical and economic development of the city and to the health, safety,
and general welfare of the future lot owners in the subdivision and of the
community at large.

undue hardship. As used in this chapter, a variance is authorized only for
area, size of structure, size of yards, setback and side yard requirements, and
parking requirements; establishment or expansion of a use otherwise prohibited
shall not be allowed by variance, nor shall a variance be granted because of
the presence of nonconformities in the zoning district or adjoining zoning
districts.

      (1)   Application requirements. Prior to the filing of an application of
a preliminary plat, the applicant shall meet with the City of Dilworth Planner
and City Administrator for informal discussion of the proposed plat. A sketch
plan may be used to facilitate discussion between the applicant and city staff
regarding a proposed subdivision. After the pre-application meeting(s), the
applicant must prepare and file with the city an electronic version and two
large copies 22 inches by 34 inches, two 11 inch by 17 inch copies, and one
reduced scale eight and one-half inch by 11 inch copy of a preliminary plat and
supportive information which is in conformity with the requirements of §
154.05(A) and pay the appropriate review fee as established by the City
Council, at least 15 working days prior to the regularly scheduled or special
Planning Commission meeting at which it is proposed to be heard.

days following the close of public hearing on such and in compliance with this
chapter, the Council may act on the preliminary plat without the Planning
Commission's recommendation.
      (7)   Preliminary plat approval. The Planning Commission's approval of
the preliminary plat will not constitute approval of the final plat. Rather, it
will be deemed an expression of approval of the layout submitted on the
preliminary plat as a guide to the preparation of the final plat, which will be
submitted to the Planning Commission, at a future date, and subsequent
recommendation forwarded to the City Council for final plat approval and
recording with the County Recorder, upon fulfillment of the requirements of
these regulations and the conditions of conditional approval, if any.
      (8)   City Council action.
         (a)   The Council will approve or disapprove the preliminary plat
within 60 days following the recommendation and report from the Planning
Commission.
         (b)   If the preliminary plat is not approved by the City Council, the
reasons for such action must be recorded in the proceedings of the Council and
must be transmitted to the applicant. If the preliminary plat is approved, such
approval will not constitute final acceptance of the design and layout.
Subsequent approval will be required of the engineering proposals and other
features and requirements as specified by this chapter to be indicated on the
final plat. The City Council may impose such conditions and restrictions as it
deems appropriate or require such revisions or modifications in the preliminary
play or final plat as it deems necessary to protect the health, safety,
comfort, general welfare, and convenience of the city.
         (c)   The City Council reserves the right to decline approval of a
preliminary plat if due regard is not shown for the preservation of all natural
features, such as topography, trees, and watercourses.

applicant must submit a final plat to the City Planner, to be reviewed and a
recommendation made by the Planning Commission to the City Council, within 60
days of preliminary plat approval by the City Council unless a request for time
extension is submitted in writing and approved by the City Council. If an
extension is not made and the 60 day timeline passes, then approval of the
preliminary plat will be considered void.
      (10)   If substantial modifications are necessary on an approved
preliminary plat, the plat must be resubmitted for preliminary plat approval.
However, if only minor modifications are necessary, the plat may be submitted
as a final plat.
   (C)   Final plat.
      (1)   Submittal. After the preliminary plat has been approved, a final
plat must be submitted for review as set forth in the divisions which follow.
The final plat, which must be prepared by a certified land surveyor, will
incorporate all minor corrections, modifications, and revisions required by the
city and associated utility agencies, and conform to the approved preliminary
plat. The applicant must complete a city action request form for final plat
approval attaching the appropriate review fee.

inch copy of a final plat and supportive information which is in conformity
with the requirements of §
154.05(B), complete a city action request form, and pay the appropriate review
fee as established by City Council, at least 15 working days prior to the
regularly scheduled or special Planning Commission meeting at which it is
proposed to be heard.
      (4)   Upon receipt of the completed application as outlined in division
(C)(3) of this section, the City Planner must set a public hearing for public
review of the final plat by the Planning Commission. The hearing will be held
within 60 days of the completed filing of the application. The applicant and/or
their representative(s) must appear at the public hearing. Notice of the
hearing may be a legal or display advertisement and will consist of a legal
property description, description of request, and will be published in the
official newspaper at least ten days prior to the hearing.
      (5)   The applicant will refer copies of the final plat to county, state,
or municipal jurisdictions, as well as utility companies, for their review and
comment, where appropriate and when required.
      (6)   Prior to recording of a final plat, the city must have approved the
developer's agreement with the property owner, which controls the installation
of all municipal improvements, utility systems, sidewalks and boulevard trees,
and other development issues. Said agreement will require all improvements to
comply with approved engineering standards and applicable regulations.
      (7)   The Planning Commission will report its findings and make its
recommendation to the City Council not later than 60 days after the close of
public hearing described in division (C)(4) of this section. If the Planning
Commission has not acted upon the final plat within 60 days following the close

transmitted to the applicant.
      (9)   Upon receiving final plat approval by the City Council the
applicant or his/her agent must, within 60 days, provide the City Planner with
all necessary mylars and hard boards for city designated representative
signatures. After all city signatures have been applied to the mylars and hard
boards the applicant will record said plat with the County Recorder within 60
days, or the approved final plat will be considered void unless the applicant
receives an extension from the City Planner. Upon delivery of the final plat to
the County Recorder, the applicant will be required to ensure that all
applicable fees and taxes are paid.
      (10)   Upon recording of the final plat, the City Planner will notify the
applicant or his/her agent of the recording and make available a signed copy of
the plat.

must submit a copy of the plat in electronic format compatible with software in
use by the city at the time of submittal and with the Fargo-Moorhead
Metropolitan Council of Governments layering scheme. The computerized plat must
be referenced as county coordinates and provide a seamless edge match to the
existing city database. Coordinates of existing plats will be provided by city
staff.
   (D)   Denial of plat. The Planning Commission may recommend denial and the
Council may deny a subdivision if it makes any of the following findings:
      (1)   Conflicts: that the proposed subdivision is in direct conflict with
adopted applicable general and specific Comprehensive Plans of the city,
county, or township;
      (2)   Physical characteristics: that the physical characteristics of this
site, including, but not limited to, topography, percolation rate, soil
conditions, susceptibility to erosion and siltation, susceptibility to
flooding, water storage, drainage, and retention, are such that the site is not
suitable for the type of development, design, or use contemplated;

floodway fringe or within other areas of the city;
      (9)   MEQB policies: the proposed subdivision is inconsistent with the
policies of the Minnesota Environmental Quality Board (MEQB), as may be
amended, and could adversely impact critical environmental areas or potentially
disrupt or destroy historic areas which are designated or officially recognized
by the City Council in violation of federal and state historical preservation
laws;
      (10)   The county, township, or developer has not certified in writing
that they will assume all responsibility for repair and maintenance of
dedicated streets until annexed to the city; and/or

   (D)   Metes and bounds.
      (1)   Except in unique situations as may be allowed by the City Council
or in cases of minor subdivisions, conveyances by metes and bounds will be
prohibited where any lot or lots involved are less than five acres in area or
have a width of less than 300 feet at the building setback line.
      (2)   When a conveyance by metes and bounds is made and the parcels
involved are between five acres and 20 acres in size, a survey of the parcels
involved must be submitted to the City Planner before any building permits will
be issued for those parcels, and a copy of the survey must be attached to the
deed when it is submitted to the Clay County Recorder's Office for recording.
(Ord. passed - -)
§ 154.06 SUBDIVISION DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (A)   Conformity with Dilworth's Comprehensive Plan and Zoning Ordinance. A
proposed subdivision must conform to the city's Comprehensive Plan, or similar
document, growth area plans, neighborhood plans, related policies adopted by
the City Council, and to the Zoning Ordinance.
   (B)   Land requirements.
      (1)   Land should be suited to the purpose for which it is to be
subdivided. No plan will be approved if the site is not suitable for the
purposes proposed by reason of potential flooding, topography, or adverse soil.
      (2)   Land subject to hazards to life, health, or property will not be
subdivided until all such hazards have been eliminated or unless adequate
safeguards against such hazards are provided by the subdivision plan.
      (3)   Proposed subdivisions will be coordinated with surrounding
jurisdictions and/or neighborhoods, so that the city as a whole may develop
efficiently and harmoniously.
   (C)   Blocks.
      (1)   Accommodation. Block length and width or acreage within bounding
streets must accommodate the size of residential lots required in the area by
the Zoning Ordinance and to provide for convenient access, circulation control,
and safety of street traffic.
      (2)   Block length. In general, intersecting streets should be provided
at such intervals so as to serve cross traffic adequately and to meet existing
streets. Where no existing plats control, the blocks in residential
subdivisions should not exceed 1,200 feet nor be less than 300 feet in length,
except where topography or other conditions justify a departure from this
minimum.
      (3)   Block width. The width of the block should normally be sufficient
to allow two tiers of lots of minimum depth as required by the Zoning Ordinance
except adjoining a lake, stream, river, railroad or arterial, or where one tier
or lot is necessary because of topographic conditions. Blocks intended for
business or industrial uses should be of such width as to be considered most
suitable for their respective use, including adequate space for off-street
parking, deliveries, and loading. Such facilities should be provided with safe
and convenient limited access to the street system.
   (D)   Lots.
      (1)   Area. The minimum lot area, width, and depth should not be less
than that established by the city Zoning Ordinance in effect at the time of
adoption of the final plat.
      (2)   Side lot lines. Side lines of lots should be at perpendicular to
street lines, radial to curved street lines, or radial to accommodate site
specific topographic conditions.
      (3)   Frontage on two streets. Double frontage, or lots with frontage on
two parallel or nonintersecting streets should not be permitted, except where
lots back on arterial streets or highways, or where topographic or other
conditions render subdividing otherwise unreasonable.
      (4)   Driveway restrictions. In the case where a proposed plat is
adjacent to a limited access highway, other major highway, principal or minor
arterial streets, no direct vehicular access from individual lots to such
streets and roads will be permitted.
   (E)   Streets.
      (1)   Conformance. Proposed streets must conform to state, metropolitan,
and county highway plans which have been prepared, adopted and/or filed as
prescribed by law.
      (2)   Topography. Streets should be logically related to the topography,
so as to produce usable lots and reasonable grades.
      (3)   Access. Access must be given to all lots and portions of the tract
in a subdivision and to adjacent unsubdivided parcels, unless the topography
clearly indicates that such connection is not feasible. Reserved strips and
landlocked areas must not be created.
      (4)   Continuation. The arrangement of streets in new subdivisions should
make provision for the appropriate continuation of existing streets in
adjoining areas.
      (5)   Projection. Where adjoining areas are not subdivided, but in the
future may be subdivided, the arrangement of streets in a new subdivision
should make provision for the proper projection of streets into adjoining areas
by carrying the new streets to the boundaries of the new subdivision at
appropriate locations. A temporary turnaround facility may be required at the
closed end, in conformance with cul-de-sac size requirements. Temporary
facilities will not require curb and gutter and the construction standards will
be established by the City Engineer.
      (6)   Arrangement. The arrangement of arterial and collector streets
should be considered in their relation to the reasonable circulation of
traffic, to topographic conditions, to runoff of stormwater, to public
convenience and safety and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses
of the area to be served.
      (7)   Provisions for resubdivision of large lots and parcels. When a
tract is subdivided into larger than normal building lots or parcels which have
the potential for further subdivision, such lots or parcels should be so
arranged as to permit the logical location and openings of future streets and
appropriate resubdivision, with provision for adequate utility connections for
such resubdivision.
      (8)   Dead ends. Dead end streets will be prohibited, except as stated in
this section.
      (9)   Private streets. Private streets are prohibited, except in the case
of a Planned Unit Development and/or approval of the City Council. No public
street improvement will be approved for any private street.
      (10)   Service streets. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing
or planned major arterial or a railroad right-of-way, a street approximately
parallel to and on each side of such arterial and right-of-way may be required
for adequate protection of residential properties and separation of through and
local traffic. Such service streets must be located at a distance from the
major arterial or railroad right-of-way suitable for appropriate use of the
intervening land, as for park purposes in residential districts, or for
commercial and industrial purposes in appropriate districts. Such distances
should be determined with due regard for the requirements of approach grades
and future grade separations.
      (11)   Design. The street design should not be such as to cause hardship
to owners of adjoining property in platting their own land and providing
convenient access to it.
      (12)   Cul-de-sac streets. Cul-de-sac streets permanently designed as
such, must not exceed 600 feet in length, including a terminal turnaround which
must be provided at the closed end, with a right-of-way radius of not less than
60 feet. The length will be measured along the centerline from the nearest
intersection to the center point of the cul-de-sac.
   (F)   Street design.
      (1)   Widths. Street right-of-way widths will be as determined in the
Comprehensive Plan and on the official street map, and where applicable, must
conform to county and state standards for trunk highways. In cases where no
standard is provided, the following standards will apply:
 Paved curb to curb width (minimum) in Right-of-way width (minimum) in feet
 feet
                            Paved curb to curb width  Right-of-way width

Single-family local, no on- 26                        50
street parking
 
      (2)   Street intersections. Insofar as practical, streets should
intersect at right angles. In no case will the angle formed by the intersection
of two streets be less than 75 degrees or more than 105 degrees. Intersections
having more than four corners will be prohibited.
      (3)   Tangents. A tangent of at least 100 feet must be introduced between
reverse curves on arterial and collector streets.
      (4)   Deflections. When connecting street lines deflect from each other
at one point by more than ten degrees, they should normally be connected by a
curve with a radius adequate to ensure a sight distance of not less than 500
feet for arterials, 300 feet for collectors, and 200 feet for all other
streets. The Planning Commission may allow greater or lesser sight distances.
      (5)   Street intersection jogs. Street intersection jogs with centerline
offsets of less than 150 feet are prohibited.
      (6)   Access to principal arterials. Full access to such principal
arterials should normally be at intervals of not less than one-half mile and
through existing and established crossroads where possible. Conditional access
may be allowed at intervals of not less than one-fourth mile.
      (7)   Access to minor arterials. Full access to such minor arterials
should normally be at intervals of not less than one-fourth mile and through
existing and established crossroads where possible. Conditional access may be
allowed at intervals of not less than one-eighth mile.
      (8)   Access to collectors. Full access to such collectors should
normally be at intervals of not less than one-eighth mile and through existing
and established crossroads where possible.
      (9)   Access to local collectors. Full access to such local collectors
should normally be at intervals of not less than 330 feet.
      (10)   General access. Access to principal arterials in the urban core.
Access to such roadways may be granted at the discretion of the City Engineer
at intervals of not less than 300 feet to 660 feet.
      (11)   Platting of small tracts. In the platting of small tracts of land
fronting on a principal arterial, minor arterial, or collector where there is
no convenient access to existing entrances and where access from such plat
would be closer than one-fourth mile from an existing access point, a temporary
entrance permit may be granted. Provision will be made in such plats for the
connection of roads to neighboring land. As the neighboring land is platted and
developed and access becomes possible at a preferred location, such temporary
entrance permits will become void at the discretion of the city.
      (12)   Half streets. Half streets are prohibited except where it will be
practical to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining
property is subdivided, in which case the dedication of a half street may be
permitted. The probable length of time elapsing before dedication of the
remainder must be considered in this decision.
      (13)   Inadequate street width. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an
existing street of inadequate width, sufficient additional width will be
provided to meet the above standards.
      (14)   Additional width. Additional right-of-way and roadway widths may
be required to promote public safety and convenience when special conditions
require it.
      (15)   Corner radii. Roadways of street intersections will be rounded by
a radius of not less than 20 feet. Corners at entrances to the turnaround
portions of cul-de-sacs must be rounded by a radius of not less than 20 feet.
      (16)   Curb and gutter. Concrete curb and gutter will be included as part
of the required street surface improvement and will be designed for
installation along both sides of all roadways. With the exception of multiple-
family development, mountable curbing may be allowed with residential
subdivisions. Barrier curb and gutter will be required in multiple-family,
commercial, and industrial subdivisions.
      (17)   Street designation. Whenever practical, streets and avenues will
be designated numerically. The following policies may be generally applied when
designating awkward street and avenue configurations:
         (a)   Cul-de-sacs less than 300 feet will assume the designation of
the street or avenue they abut; and
         (b)   Loops must be designated avenues, streets, or a combination of
both, depending on the depth of the configuration. Generally, the longer the
length or depth, the greater the applicability for a separate street and avenue
designation. For short loops, the word "circle" must be used to indicate the
configuration. Upon approval of the City Council, streets may be named when
such streets are not through streets; and
         (c)   No street names will be used that duplicate or may be confused
with the names of existing streets, unless a new street is a continuation of or
in alignment with the existing or platted street. In that event, it must bear
the same name of the existing or platted street. Street names must conform to
the city's street naming and property numbering system as applicable.
      (18)   Minimum standards. Private streets, at a minimum, must be designed
to provide 24 feet of access lanes and be constructed in accordance to design
specifications by the City Engineer for required strength and durability.
   (G)   Alleys.
      (1)   Alleys shall be constructed in accordance to the grade, width, and
slope established by the City Engineer.
      (2)   Location permitted. Alleys or service drives may be provided in
commercial and industrial districts.
      (3)   Surfacing. All alleys must be hard surfaced with concrete or
asphalt, with concrete valley gutter.
   (H)   Sidewalks.
      (1)   All new subdivisions within the city shall provide sidewalks on
both sides of all arterial, collector, local and cul-de-sac streets. A
developer, in connection with the platting of a new subdivision or replatting a
subdivision, shall submit a sidewalk plan for approval by the Planning
Commission and City Council, which shall be incorporated into a developer's
agreement for that plat.
      (2)   A sidewalk plan may be submitted by the developer which illustrates
the placement of sidewalks on one side of a street or areas with no sidewalks.
Factors that the Planning Commission and City Council shall consider include,
but are not limited to:
         (a)   The expected population density of the area;
         (b)   The location of pedestrian traffic generators within walking
distance;
         (c)   The relationship of the subdivision to adjacent existing and
projected land uses;
         (d)   Design of the subdivision for which sidewalks are required; and
         (e)   Existing and/or planned sidewalk connections adjacent to the
subdivision.
      (3)   All sidewalks proposed for a subdivision must conform to the
standards outlined in §
154.08(C).
   (I)   Bike paths. Bike paths will be required for those subdivisions within
the city where such need has been identified within the Metropolitan Bicycle
and Pedestrian Plan or within an applicable growth area plan.
   (J)   Boulevard trees. All subdivisions within the city will be required to
provide boulevard trees in conformance with the city's Tree Ordinance and
Sidewalk Plan.
   (K)   Wastewater disposal and storm drainage for areas without central or
public services.
      (1)   On-site sewer system. In areas being platted without central or
public sewers, the on-site sewer system, including the size and relative
location of same, must be in conformance with county, township, state, and
federal requirements including any FEMA rules and regulations pertinent to site
sewer and water. When such requirements conflict, the most restrictive will
apply. Subdivisions and/or developments utilizing on-site wastewater systems
are required to connect to public facilities in accordance with this code, and
pay any proportionate costs or applicable fees, when such facilities become
available.
      (2)   Stormwater drainage facilities. Stormwater drainage facilities,
where required, must be designed to convey the flow of surface waters without
damage to persons or property. The system must ensure drainage at all points
along streets, and provide positive drainage away from buildings to accommodate
frequent floods. Drainage plans must be consistent with local and regional
drainage plans. The facilities must be designed to protect against surface
erosion and siltation of surface water and to prevent the discharge of excess
runoff onto adjacent properties.
   (L)   Drainage. A complete and adequate drainage system design approved by
the City Engineer will be required for all subdivisions and may include a storm
sewer system or system of open ditches, culverts, pipes, catch basins and
ponding areas, or a combination thereof.
   (M)   Easements.
      (1)   All easements must be dedicated by appropriate language on the
final plat as required by law and provisions of this title.
      (2)   Utility easements. Easements of a minimum of ten feet wide centered
on rear and other lot lines, must be provided for public and private utilities
where necessary. When it is not practical to center easements, the fully
required easement width may be required along one property line. Aid easements
must have continuity of alignment from block to block. The easements, when
approved, must not thereafter be changed without the approval of the City
Council pursuant to the city charter, as may be amended.
      (3)   Drainage. Easements must be provided along each side of the
centerline of any natural watercourse or drainage channel to a width sufficient
to provide proper maintenance and protection and to provide for stormwater
runoff. Where necessary, drainage easements corresponding with lot lines must
be provided. Such easements for drainage purposes will not be less than 20 feet
in width or a width equal to the required side yard setback established by the
respective zoning district in which the property is located, whichever is
least.
      (4)   Sight. Sight easements beyond required zoning setback regulations
may be required by the city and state Department of Transportation to protect
major intersections on the state trunk highway system, on arterial and
collector streets, and at the intersection of railroad crossings.
   (N)   Protected areas. Where land proposed for subdivision is deemed
environmentally sensitive by the city due to the existence of wetlands,
drainageways, watercourses, and/or floodable areas, the design of said
subdivision must clearly reflect all necessary measures of protection to ensure
against adverse environmental impact. Based upon the necessity to control and
maintain certain sensitive areas, the city will determine whether said
protection will be accomplished through lot enlargement and redesign or
dedication of those sensitive areas in the form of outlots. In general,
measures of protection must include design solutions which allow for
construction and grading involving a minimum of alteration to sensitive areas.
Where these areas are to be incorporated into lots within the proposed
subdivision, the applicant will be required to demonstrate that the proposed
design will not require construction on slopes over 18%, or result in
significant alteration to the natural drainage system such that adverse impacts
cannot be contained within the plat boundary.
   (O)   Park land dedication requirements.
      (1)   General requirements.
         (a)   Because new residential development increases the population of
the community and demand on the parks system, as a prerequisite to residential
plat approval and at the sole determination by the city, applicants must
dedicate land for parks, playgrounds, public open spaces, trails or bikeways,
and/or must make a cash in lieu of dedication to the city.
         (b)   City staff will confer with the Park Board, at the time the
preliminary plat is under consideration, to secure their recommendation as to
the location of any property that should be dedicated to the public, such as
parks, playgrounds, or other public property. Such contribution requirement
recommendation(s) will be sent to the Planning Commission for review and
comment and subsequently to the City Council for their approval.
         (c)   Park land and open space dedication shall be considered in
relation to the city Comprehensive Plan, growth area plans, and parks master
plan, should such planning documents exist at the time of plat, or is as
determined to be in the best interest of the city.
         (d)   Where private open space for park and recreation purposes is
provided in a proposed subdivision, such areas may be used for credit, at the
discretion of the city, against the requirement of dedication for park and
recreation purposes provided, the city finds it is in the public interest to do
so.
         (e)   The city may elect at its sole discretion to receive a
combination of cash and land dedication.
         (f)   During preliminary plat submission the applicant must provide
the city with the number and type of residential units which will occupy the
platted area. If during development the number or type of units are altered,
the applicant will be required to make a cash dedication to account for the
increased density of the project. However, if the number of units are
decreased, the applicant will not be refunded that amount of cash or land
dedicated during original plat approval.
         (g)   Property being replatted with the same number of units will be
exempt from all park land dedication requirements. If the number of units is
increased or if land outside the previously recorded plat is added, then the
park land dedication and/or park cash contributions will be based on the
additional units added to the plat.
      (2)   Park land dedication.
         (a)   In all new residential subdivisions, land must be dedicated for
public recreation use or open space as established by the City Council. The
dedicated land must be in addition to property dedicated for streets, alleys,
easements, water detention, or other public ways unless otherwise provided
herein. The amount of land dedicated will be based on the type of development
according to the following:
 
Type of Dwelling Unit Minimum Area Dedicated per Dwelling Unit
Single or two-family  930
Multiple-family       670
 
         (b)   Land to be dedicated must be reasonably suitable for its
intended use as determined by the city and must be at a location convenient to
the public to be served. Factors used in evaluating the adequacy of proposed
park and recreation areas must include size, shape, topography, geology,
hydrology, tree cover, access, and location.
         (c)   When land is dedicated and deeded to the city for park purposes,
it will be the responsibility of the city to maintain such dedicated property.
         (d)   Land dedication to the city must be in the form of outlots.
         (e)   The preliminary plan must show the location and dimensions of
all areas to be dedicated in this manner.
         (f)   When a proposed park, playground, recreational area, or other
public ground has been indicated on the city's official Map, within the
Comprehensive Plan, Growth Area Plan, or Park Master Plan and is located in
whole or in part within a proposed plat, it must be dedicated to the
appropriate governmental unit, at the sole discretion of the city.
         (g)   Land area conveyed or dedicated to the city will be used in
calculating allowable density per the city Zoning Ordinance.
         (h)   Wetlands, ponding areas, and drainageways accepted by the city
may not be considered in the park land and/or cash contribution to the city,
where such areas have been determined to have a park function, as approved by
the City Council.
      (3)   Payment in lieu of dedication.
         (a)   When, in the opinion of the city and at its sole discretion, it
is impractical, inappropriate, and/or in the best interest of the city for a
subdivision to not make a dedication of land for public use or make only a
partial dedication of land, the applicant will be required to pay a cash fee
based on the type and number of dwelling units. Cash payments in lieu of
parkland dedication will be made in accordance with the following:
 
Type of Dwelling Unit Minimum Amount of Cash Dedicated per Dwelling Unit
Single or two-family  $650
Multiple-family       $450
 
         (b)   Park cash contributions are to be calculated and paid in full at
the time of final plat approval.
         (c)   Cash contributions for parks and trails will be deposited in
either the city's Park Fund or similar fund and will only be used for
acquisition and development of future parks and trails or development of
existing sites as determined by the city. Additionally, to the extent possible,
said funds should be utilized in a timely manner within a benefitting area to
the development.
         (d)   Purchase and assessment of park land. The requirement for park
land dedication or payment in lieu of dedication may be waived by the city when
an agreement incorporated into a developer's agreement has been executed
between the city and developer. Such agreement must require the developer to
petition for park improvements to be assessed against the property owned by the
developer, which may include property outside the current plat. The agreement
must set forth the land to be purchased by the city for park purposes and the
purchase price for the land. In addition, the agreement must set forth the
general type of improvements to be included in the petition for park
improvements, as well as the maximum amount of money that may be assessed. Such
maximum amount may be based on a sliding scale based on the density of the
development. The city may enter into such an agreement only if the City Council
determines that such an agreement results in a more favorable result to the
city than the imposition of the standard park land dedication or payment in
lieu of dedication requirements.
   (P)   Dedication of stormwater retention areas. Upon approval by the
Council, the applicant may be required to dedicate to the public up to 6% of
the land proposed to be subdivided for stormwater retention areas. The 6%
dedication may be considered in addition to the park land dedication required
by division (O) of this section. Additional land may be required for stormwater
facilities as identified in an approved growth area plan, storm water master
plan, or to satisfy the requirements of the Stormwater Ordinance.
   (Q)   Other requirements. The design features set forth in this chapter are
minimum requirements. The city may impose additional or more stringent
requirements concerning lot sizes, streets, and overall design as deemed
appropriate considering the property being subdivided based upon site
considerations and the Dilworth Comprehensive Plan.

§ 154.08 SUBDIVIDING IN FLOOD AREAS.
   (A)   Warning and disclaimer of liability for flooding.
      (1)   This chapter does not imply that areas outside the floodplain
districts or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from
flooding or flood damages. This chapter will not create liability on the part
of the City of Dilworth or any officer or employee thereof for any flood
damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decisions lawfully made thereunder.
      (2)   No responsibility or liability will arise from the design or
operation of subdivision drainage facilities dedicated to the city until the
city has accepted such dedication.
   (B)   Land requirements. As stated in §
154.06(B), land use must be suited to the purpose for which it is to be
subdivided. No plat will be approved if the site is not suitable for the
purposes proposed by reason of potential flooding.
   (C)   Subdividing flooding and flood control.
      (1)   No land will be subdivided if the Council finds the land unsuitable
for subdividing due to flooding, inadequate drainage, water supply, or
wastewater treatment facilities in accordance with this chapter and the Zoning
Ordinance. Any building sites on lots within the flood fringe district must be
constructed in accordance with this chapter and the Zoning Ordinance. All
subdivisions must have water and sewer disposal facilities that comply with the
provisions of this chapter, and any applicable building, health or safety
codes, including the Minnesota State Building Code. Each of the above
requirements must take into consideration the 100-year flood profile and other
supporting technical data in the Flood Insurance Study and the Flood Insurance
Rate Map.
      (2)   In reviewing proposed subdivisions in the floodway or flood fringe
overlay districts, all criteria of the Zoning Ordinance shall be considered.
   (D)   Building site improvements for flood prone areas.
      (1)   Should the City Council determine that only a part of a proposed
plat can be safely developed, it will limit development to that part and
require that the specifications for development be consistent with its
determination.
      (2)   When someone other than the applicant intends to develop the plat,
and the City Council determines that additional use controls are required to
ensure safe development, it may require the applicant to impose appropriate
deed restrictions on the land. Such deed restrictions must be inserted in every
deed and noted on the face of the final recorded plat.
   (E)   Plat and data requirements. The applicant must prepare and submit a
preliminary plat which includes the following flood related data; as stated in
§
154.05(A), a preliminary plat must include:
      (1)   One hundred-year flood elevations, the regulatory flood protection
elevation, and boundaries of floodway and flood fringe areas, if known, taking
into consideration the Flood Insurance Study and Flood Insurance Rate Map; and
      (2)   Proposed fill, levees, structural flood works, channel
modifications, and other methods to address flood or erosion hazard areas in
accordance with the Zoning Ordinance and by use of the 100-year flood profile
and other supporting technical data in the Flood Insurance Study. This
information must be submitted when requested by the city staff, consultants,
advisory bodies, the Planning Commission, and/or City Council to address site
specific questions.
   (F)   Denial of plat. As stated in §
154.05(D), the Planning Commission may recommend denial and the Council may
deny a subdivision if it makes any of the following findings related to
subdivision in flood prone areas:
      (1)   That the physical characteristics of this site, including, but not
limited to, topography, percolation rate, soil conditions, susceptibility to
erosion and siltation, susceptibility to flooding, water storage, drainage, and
retention, are such that the site is not suitable for the type of development,
design, or use; and
      (2)   That the proposed subdivision, its site, or its design adversely
affects the flood carrying capacity of the floodway, increases flood stages or
velocities, or increases flood hazards within the floodway or flood fringe or
within other areas of the city.
