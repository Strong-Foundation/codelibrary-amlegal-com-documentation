voter's choice for any office to be filled, the ballot shall not be counted as
to that office or issue. A failure to properly mark a ballot as to one or more
candidates or issues shall not invalidate the entire ballot. No ballot shall be
rejected if the election board can determine the person for whom the voter
intended to vote and the office intended to be chosen by the voter. Ballots not
counted shall be marked "Defective" on the back, and ballots to which objection
has been made shall be marked "Objected To" on the back. An explanation of the

however, that this shall not limit the liability of the person liable for the
tax.

5.20.220   Registration of sellers as tax collectors-- Certification of
registration.
   A.   All collectors shall file with the city an application for a
certificate of registration on a form prescribed by the city, not more than 10
days after the date of commencing business or the opening of an additional
place of business. The application must contain or be accompanied by:
      1.   the name and mailing address of the applicant;
      2.   the location at which the applicant will conduct its business or
transactions subject to the tax under this chapter will occur; if the
applicant's business is to be conducted from one or more vessels, the name of
the vessels and the general location or areas in which each vessel will
operate;
      3.   if the applicant is a buyer of raw seafood products:
         a.   the applicant's Alaska Fisheries Business License number;
         b.   a copy of the applicant's most recent Alaska Fisheries Business
License Tax filing; and
         c.   a copy of the most recent statement provided the state of the
amount of fisheries' products the person expects to produce during the
applicant's license year;
      4.   A description and the location of real and personal property owned
by the applicant in the city and other information with respect to the
description, location and values of the property which the city may require.
   B.   Upon the receipt of a properly executed application, the mayor will
issue without charge to the seller or, in the case of raw fish products, the
buyer, a certificate of registration, stating the address of the place of
business to which it is applicable and authorizing the seller to collect the
tax. The certificate must be prominently displayed at the place of business
named therein. A seller or buyer who has no regular place of business shall
attach such certificate to his stand, truck or other merchandising devise.
   C.   The certificate of registration is non-assignable and non-transferable
and must be surrendered to the mayor by the seller or buyer to whom it was
issued upon his ceasing to do business at the location named therein. If the
business is continued at the same location but there is a change in its form of
organization such as from a single proprietorship to a partnership or
corporation, the admission or withdrawal of a partner or any other change, the
seller or buyer making such change shall surrender his old certificate to the
mayor for cancellation. The successor seller or buyer is required to file a new
application for a certificate of registration. Upon receipt of such
application, properly executed, a new certificate will be issued to such
successor seller or buyer.
   D.   When there is a change of location for the seller's or buyer's place of
business, a new certificate of registration is required showing a new address.
   E.   Before issuing a certificate of registration, the mayor may require the
applicant to post a bond, furnish a statement of net worth, or furnish
additional security to insure the full and prompt payment of taxes to be
collected under such certificate when in his or her judgment it is in the best
interest of the city to do so.
   F.   A seller or buyer who obtains or should obtain a certificate of
registration in accordance with this chapter hereby consents to the inspection
of his or her Alaska Fisheries Business Tax returns and other information, such
as amended tax returns for prior or current years or other records filed by the
registrant with the State of Alaska for the purpose of enforcement and
administration of the provisions of this section.

5.20.225 Registration of buyers and sellers entitled to exemption.
   A.   The city may require by regulation that the seller, other than a seller
of raw seafood products, collect the tax on sales from any class of buyer
allegedly exempt under §
5.20.130 3., unless the buyer is registered under paragraph B. of this section.
An unregistered buyer may file a certificate of protest under §
5.20.310. The provisions above also apply to buyers of raw seafood products.
   B.   The city may by regulation require that any class of buyer exempt under
§
5.20.130 3. register with the city as an exempted buyer to avoid payment of
tax. Registration shall be upon forms provided by the city and shall include a
brief statement of the reason for exemption and such other information as the
city may require. Upon registration, the buyer shall be issued a certificate or
certificates of exemption which the buyer must show seller to avoid initial
payment of the sales tax, or in the case of buyers of raw seafood products,
which the buyer must show to avoid payment of the sales tax.
(Ord. 77-01 (part), 1977; Ord. 81-04 § 1 (part), 1981)
5.20.230 Custody, reporting, and remittance.
   A.   All tax monies collected or segregated or required to be collected or
segregated by a buyer or seller are funds of the city and shall be held in
trust by the collector until paid over to the city. Interest earned on such
funds while held by the collector may be retained by the collector.
   B.   Taxes required to be collected under this chapter during a calendar
month are due and payable to the city on the 15th day of the month following
the month in which they were collected, except for taxes collected by a buyer
or seller who had less than $2.5 million in gross sales in the previous
calendar year, which shall be due and payable on the last day of each calendar
quarter. Every buyer and seller liable for the collection of the tax shall file
with the city on forms furnished by the city a return containing the following
information:
      1.   gross sales;
      2.   non-taxable sales separately stating the amount of sales revenue
attributable to each class of exemption;
      3.   taxable sales during each month;
      4.   taxes collected on taxable sales;
      5.   interest, penalties and deductions;
      6.   with regard to raw seafood products purchased, the number of pounds
of shellfish and finfish purchased, broken down by species;
      7.   such other information as may be required on the form.
   C.   The return shall be signed and its completeness and accuracy sworn to
by the buyer or seller under penalty of perjury.
   D.   The complete return, together with the remittance of the tax required
to be collected during the month, must be received by the city at the address
designated on the return form on or before the 15th calendar day of the month
following the end of the month for which the return is required. In the case of
a buyer or seller who is required to remit taxes quarterly, the return and
remittance of the tax must be received by the city on or before the last
business day of the month following the end of the calendar quarter for which
the return is required.
   E.   Any buyer or seller who was required to collect a tax during a month or
calendar quarter shall file a return for the next following month or calendar
quarter even though no tax may be due during the following month or quarter. A
return filed for a month or quarter in which no tax was required to be
collected must show why no tax was collected or is due.
   F.   If a complete return accompanied by the entire tax due is received by
the city within the time allowed, the person collecting the tax may deduct and
retain up to two percent of the tax due as compensation for its costs of
administration of the tax; however, the amount deducted and retained may not
exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00) for any calendar quarter.
   G.   Amounts received with the return shall be applied in the following
order:
      1.   penalties due, beginning with the oldest penalty;
      2.   interest due, beginning with the interest due on the oldest month;
and
      3.   taxes due, beginning with the taxes due from the oldest month.

5.20.235 Seller not to assume tax.
   A seller may not advertise or hold out or state to the public or to any
buyer, directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof imposed by this
chapter will be assumed or absorbed by the seller or that it will not be added
to the sales price or that it will be refunded or assumed, in whole or in part.
The collector shall, whenever feasible, separately state the tax to the
taxpayer on each taxable transaction. When not feasible to state separately,
the collector shall prominently display a sign provided by the city indicating
the imposition of the tax.

5.20.240 Installment sales.
When a sale is made on an installment basis, the sales tax shall be collected
from the down payment, or if none, from the first installment, or, if the
installment or down payment is less than the tax, then from as many
installments as is necessary to pay the tax.
(Ord. 77-01 (part), 1977; Ord. 81-04 § 1 (part), 1981)
5.20.245 Sale or transfer of business--Final return.
If any buyer of raw seafood products, any seller or other person required to
collect a tax under this chapter leases or in any other manner disposes of the
business or if the business is transferred voluntarily or involuntarily, the
person selling, leasing or otherwise transferring the business shall make or
deliver to the city within 15 days of the date of the sale, lease or other
transfer a final sales tax return. The purchaser, lessee or other successor or
assign shall withhold a sufficient portion of the purchase or lease money to
cover the amount of the tax required to be collected under this chapter,
penalties and interest as may be due on unpaid taxes to the city until such
time as the former owner has produced a receipt from the city showing that all
tax obligations imposed by this chapter have been paid through the date of
sale, lease or other transfer. The purchaser, lessee or other transferee or
successor-in-interest of a business required to collect the tax under this
chapter shall be liable for all taxes required to have been collected by the
former owner but not paid over to the city and shall be liable for all
penalties and interest on such unpaid taxes and on late or unfiled returns.
(Ord. 89-02 § 4, 1989)
5.20.250 Refund of excess payment.
   A.   A taxpayer or collector who, though a clerical or similar error, pays a
tax under this chapter that exceeds the amount actually due may receive a
refund of the excess payment upon meeting the conditions set out in this
section.
   B.   A taxpayer who has made an excess sales or use tax payment as set out
in subsection A. shall be given a refund of the excess by the collector if the
taxpayer:
      1.   notifies the collector of the excess payment;
      2.   proves to the collector that an excess payment was made; and,
      3.   provides such notification and proof to the collector prior to the
date the collector pays over to the city the taxes collected during the
reporting period in which the claimed excess payment was made.
   C.   A taxpayer who has made an excess tax payment as set out in subsection
A. who has been denied a refund by the collector or who did not meet the
requirement of subsection B.3. may file with the city for a refund of the
excess payment. The taxpayer must file the request for the refund and
satisfactory proof of entitlement with the city not later than the last
business day of the sixth month following the month during which the claimed
excess payment was made. The manager may establish a reasonable fee for
processing refund requests under this subsection.
   D.   A collector who has made an excess tax payment as set out in subsection
A. shall be given a refund of the excess if the city receives written notice
from the collector of the amount claimed as an excess payment. The city must
receive the notice and satisfactory proof of the excess payment, in the form
required by the manager, not later than the last day of the sixth month
following the month for which the claimed excess payment was made.
   E.   Upon approval of a refund to a collector, the city may pay the refund
to the collector or authorize the collector to take the refund as a credit
against future monthly or quarterly tax payments; provided, the amount taken as
a credit in any one calendar quarter may not exceed 30 percent of the taxes
otherwise due for the quarter. No interest may be paid on the excess payment.
   F.   A claim for a refund of an excess payment to which this section applies
is forever barred if notice and proof of the excess payment are not given
within the time required.
(Ord. 90-02 § 2, 1990; Ord. 98-07, § 2, 4-7-98)
5.20.255 Duty to keep records.
   A.   Every seller, or in the case of raw fish products, every buyer, engaged
in activity subject to this chapter shall keep and preserve suitable records of
all sales made by him and such other books or accounts as may be necessary to
determine the amount of tax which he is obliged to collect. Every seller or in
the case of raw seafood products, every buyer, shall preserve suitable records
of sales for a period of three years from the date of the return reporting such
sales, and shall preserve for a period of three years all invoices of goods,
and merchandise purchased for resale, and all such other books, invoices, and
records as may be necessary to accurately determine the amount of taxes which
the seller was obliged to collect under this chapter or, in the case of buyers
of raw seafood products, which the buyer was obliged to pay under this chapter.
   B.    For the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of a return, or for
the purpose of determining the amount of tax collected or which should have
been collected by any seller, or paid by a buyer of raw fish products, the
mayor may hold investigations and hearings concerning any matters covered by
this chapter and may examine any relevant books, papers, records, or memoranda
of any seller and may require the attendance of any seller or buyer, or any
officer or employee of a seller or buyer at the hearing.
(Ord. 77-01 (part), 1977; Ord. 81-04 § 1 (part), 1981)
5.20.260 Tax records confidential; exceptions.
Information in the possession of the city which was obtained by the city in the
administration or enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and which
discloses the particulars of the business or affairs of a collector, taxpayer
or other person is not a matter of public record except for purposes of city,
borough, state or United States investigation and law enforcement. The
information shall be kept confidential except when its production is required
in an official investigation or court proceeding. These restrictions do not
prohibit the publication of statistics presented in a manner that prevents the
identification of particular reports and items or prohibit the publication of
tax lists showing the names of collectors or taxpayers who are delinquent and
relevant information which may assist in the collection of delinquent taxes.
Information otherwise protected by this section may be furnished on a
reciprocal basis to other agencies of the city, borough, state or the United
States concerned with the enforcement of tax laws. (Ord. 77-01 (part), 1977;
Ord. 81-04 § 1 (part), 1981: Ord. 89-02 § 12, 1989)
Article 3. Protest; Enforcement
5.20.310 Protest of tax by taxpayer.
   A.   A collector shall determine whether a sale is taxable under this
chapter. If the collector fails to collect the tax due on a transaction because
of an incorrect determination of taxability by the collector or for any other
reason, the collector becomes liable to the city for the tax in the same manner
as if the tax had been collected.
   B.   If a taxpayer believes that a transaction is exempt or otherwise not
subject to the tax imposed under this chapter, but the collector has determined
the transaction to be subject to the tax, the taxpayer shall pay the tax under
protest to the collector. A tax is paid under protest by filing with the
collector a statement of protest on a form provided to collectors by the city.
The taxpayer shall clearly set out on the form the terms and conditions of the
sale, the amount of the sale, the quantity and type of items, services, or
rentals involved, the location of all parts of the sale or other transaction
and all other information necessary to support the taxpayer's claim that the
tax does not apply. The form shall include the names and mailing addresses of
both the collector and the taxpayer and any other party involved in the
transaction. If the taxpayer desires to have an oral hearing or to present
supplemental statements or briefs, the taxpayer must set out such request on
the protest form.
   C.   Upon receipt of a written protest, the collector shall forward the
protest to the city along with any additional statements the collector believes
may assist the city in determining the protest. The written protest must be
forwarded to the city as promptly as possible, and in any case not later than
30 days after delivery of the protest to the collector.
   D.   If the written protest contains a request for a hearing or for the
opportunity to submit additional statements or briefs, the mayor shall
determine the date for any hearing requested and for the submission of
supplemental statements or briefs and shall inform the taxpayer of such dates.
The taxpayer has the burden of proof. The mayor may seek legal advice on any
protest. The ruling must be in writing and must set forth the reason for the
grant or denial of the protest. The ruling will be sent to the collector and
the taxpayer at the addresses given on the protest. The ruling on a protest for
which no hearing or supplemental statements or briefs were requested will be
rendered within 30 days of receipt of the protest by the mayor unless the mayor
determines that a longer period of time is required. If there is a hearing or a
submission of supplemental statements or briefs, the mayor shall render a
decision within a reasonable time as determined by the mayor.
   E.   If a protest is granted, the mayor shall determine whether the tax
protested has been received by the city from the collector. If the tax has been
received, the mayor shall refund directly to the taxpayer the amount of tax to
be refunded with interest from the date received by the city at a rate equal to
the average interest earned on investments of the city on its invested funds as
last determined by the city. If the tax has not been received by the city, the
collector shall be instructed to refund to the taxpayer the appropriate amount
if the collector has actually collected the tax from the taxpayer. In the case
of a collector who is a buyer of raw seafood products, if the collector has not
yet paid for the raw seafood products, the collector shall make such
adjustments as necessary to the accounts of the taxpayer to reflect the correct
amount of the tax due. The collector and the taxpayer may make other
arrangements for crediting to the taxpayer the amount of the refund if the
collector and the taxpayer reach a mutual agreement as to such alternate
procedure.
   F.   In the event a protest is denied, the taxpayer may, within 15 days of
the date of mailing of the notice of denial, request reconsideration of the
matter and shall submit with the request such additional statements or briefs
as are necessary to explain why the denial should be reversed in whole or in
part. The decision of the mayor on a protest or on a request for
reconsideration is final and is subject to appeal to the superior court under
applicable rules of court.
(Ord. 77-01 (part), 1977; Ord. 81-04 § 1 (part), 1981; Ord. 89-02 § 10, 1989)
5.20.315 Protest of tax by collector.
   A.      If a collector believes that a transaction is exempt or otherwise
not subject to the tax imposed under this chapter or believes that a penalty,
interest or other charge is not owing but has been informed by the city that
such transaction is subject to the tax imposed under this chapter or such
charge is owing, the collector may protest the tax or charge by paying to the
city the tax or charge claimed to be owing by the city and filing with the city
at the time of payment a statement of protest setting out all relevant facts
and clearly explaining why the transaction taxed or charge made is exempt, not
otherwise subject to the tax levied under this chapter or not owing. The
payment and statement of protest must be received by the city not later than 30
days following the date of the collection by the collector; or, if no tax was
collected, the later of the occurrence of the challenged transaction or the
date of the notice from the city that the transaction is taxable; or, if the
protest is of a charge, disallowance or similar action by the city, the date of
the notice to the collector of the city determination. Failure to file a
statement of protest and to pay the amount claimed by the city as owing within
the time permitted under this section constitutes a waiver of the right to
protest the tax or the charge or other city determination under this chapter
and is a waiver of the right to appeal the protest to the mayor or to appeal or
otherwise challenge the tax, charge or determination in any judicial or other
proceeding.
   B.   The mayor shall issue a written ruling on each collector protest within
30 days of receipt of the protest unless the mayor determines a longer period
is required. The collector has the burden of proof. The mayor may permit or
require the collector to provide additional information relevant to the
protest. The mayor may seek legal advice on any protest. The ruling will be in
writing and must set forth the reason for the grant or denial of the protest.
The ruling will be sent to the collector at the address given on the protest.
   C.   If a protest is granted, the mayor shall refund to the collector the
charge levied or the tax collected and paid over to the city that was not
exempt or otherwise subject to the tax levied under this chapter. The mayor
shall also pay to the collector interest on the amount refunded at the rate
equal to the average interest earned by the city on its invested funds as last
determined by the city. The collector shall immediately refund to each taxpayer
from whom the tax was collected the amount of the tax improperly collected with
interest apportioned among the taxpayers; provided, if the collector has failed
to directly or indirectly collect the tax but has paid the tax to the city from
its own account, the collector may retain the tax and interest refunded.
   D.   In the event a protest is denied, the collector may, within 15 days of
the date of the mailing of the notice of denial, request reconsideration of the
matter and shall submit with the request such additional statements or briefs
as are necessary to explain why the denial should be reversed in whole or in
part. The decision of the mayor on a protest or on a request for
reconsideration is final and is subject to appeal to the superior court under
applicable rules of court.
(Ord. 89-02 § 11, 1989)
5.20.320 Accelerated returns.
   A.    A collector who is required to file a return and pay taxes to the city
on a quarterly basis, who fails for more than 30 days to file a return or pay
the taxes due or who has, within a 12-month period, filed or paid taxes late on
two or more occasions, may be required by the mayor to file and pay on a
monthly basis; provided, the mayor shall provide to the collector a hearing
after reasonable notice of the mayor's intention to require more frequent
filing and payment.
   B.   A collector who is required to file a return and pay taxes to the city
and pay on a monthly basis who fails to file a return and pay the full amount
due within 10 days of the date required for such filing and payment or such a
collector who files late two or more times during a four month period may be
required by the mayor to file on a weekly or more frequent basis; provided, the
mayor shall provide the collector a hearing after written notice of the mayor's
intent to require more frequent filing and payment.
(Ord. 77-01 (part), 1977; Ord. 81-04 § 1 (part), 1981; Ord. 89-02 § 16, 1989;
Ord. 98-07, § 3, 4-7-98)
5.20.325 Omissions and civil penalties.
   A.   Failure to obtain certificate. A seller or, in the case of raw fish
products, a buyer, who is obliged to obtain a certificate of registration but
fails to do so after written notice within the time prescribed herein is
subject to civil penalty of five times the amount of any tax due. A seller, or,
in the case of raw fish products, a buyer, who, after notice, continues to
conduct business without obtaining a certificate is subject to a penalty of 10
times the amount of any tax due.
   B.   Penalty and interest. A collector who fails to file a return as
required under this chapter or who fails to remit all the taxes due the city by
the collector shall pay a penalty of five percent of the taxes due if no return
is filed and five percent of the delinquency if a return is filed. The penalty
shall be imposed for each month or part of a month during which the delinquency
or failure to file exists up to a maximum of 25 percent. The filing of an
incomplete return shall be treated as the filing of no return. Interest at the
rate of 12 percent per annum shall be paid on all amounts due the city that are
not received by the city as required under this chapter except, interest does
not accrue on penalties.
   C.   Falsification. Falsification or knowing misrepresentation of any record
required hereunder is a misdemeanor and subjects the person making such
falsification or misrepresentation to a penalty of 100 times any tax due or
lost because of such falsification or misrepresentation to a maximum of one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00).
   D.   Failure to separately state the tax. A seller who fails to separately
state the tax due in any sales transaction shall be subject to a penalty equal
to the amount collected as a tax.
   E.   Inspection. The failure of a seller, or, in the case of a buyer of raw
fish products, a buyer, to allow the inspection at reasonable times of records
required by this chapter to be kept subjects the seller, or in the case of raw
fish products, the buyer, to a penalty of three times any deficiency found or
estimated to have occurred by the city in the tax accounting of the seller, or
in the case of raw fish products, the buyer.
   F.   Forced filing. If a collector under this chapter fails to file a
complete and accurate return or to pay over all the taxes due as required by
this chapter, the mayor may make an estimate of the taxes due based upon any
information available. The mayor shall file a return for such collector and
shall provide a copy of the return to the collector with a request that the
collector file a correct return along with payment of the taxes due. The mayor
may require the collector filing the return to provide sufficient information
to support the corrected return. If the collector has not filed a corrected
return satisfactory to the mayor, along with the taxes due, within 30 days of
the date of mailing of the forced filing, the amount shown on the forced filing
is presumed correct and becomes delinquent; provided, if upon a subsequent
audit or inspection of the records of the collector it is determined that a
greater amount was due, the collector shall be liable for payment of such
additional amount. A forced filing may be made if the city is unable to
ascertain the tax due to be remitted by a collector by reason of the failure of
the collector to keep accurate records or allow inspections or the
falsification of records.
   G.   Loss of records. A seller or, in the case of raw fish products, the
buyer, shall immediately notify the city of any fire, theft, or other casualty
which would prevent his complying with this chapter. Such casualty constitutes
a defense to any penalty provided in this chapter, but does not excuse the
seller from liability for taxes due. Accidental loss of funds or records is not
a defense hereunder.
   H.   Maintenance of suits. Nothing in this section shall prevent the city
from filing and maintaining an action to collect any taxes collected or which
should have been collected in addition to any penalty assessed.
   I.   Severability clause. If any provision or provisions of this ordinance
are declared invalid including, but not limited to, any provisions imposing a
tax on a particular transaction or transactions, or exempting a particular
transaction or transactions from a tax, the remainder of the ordinance shall
continue in effect.

1989)
5.20.330   Lien.
The tax, penalty and interest imposed by this chapter shall constitute a lien
in favor of the city upon all the collector's property within the city. The
lien arises upon delinquency and continues until the liability for the amount
is satisfied or the property is sold at foreclosure sale. When recorded, the
sales tax lien has priority over all other liens except as provided in AS
29.45.650(e).

   A.   A person who violates any of the provisions of this chapter commits a
misdemeanor and, upon conviction, is punishable by a fine of up to five hundred
dollars ($500.00) in addition to any civil penalties assessed.
   B.   Each violation of a provision of this chapter constitutes a separate
offense and each day upon which a violation continues constitutes a separate
offense.

(Ord. 77-01 (part), 1977)
5.25.020   Assessment--Method; Time; Listing; Returns; Investigation.
   A.   All taxable property must be assessed at its true and full value and
all assessments shall be uniform and equal and based upon the actual value of
the property assessed.
   B.   The city assessor shall annually assess and list on a tax roll all real
and personal property in the name of the person by whom it is owned on the
first day of January. If no owner or claimant to the property can be
discovered, the property shall be assessed to the unknown owner.
   C.   The assessor shall complete the listing for the annual assessment roll
of all real and personal property within the limits of the city before July 1
of each year. Provided, however, the assessor may list undiscovered omitted
personal property to be included on a supplemental tax roll. The listing of all
taxable property may be made upon permanent separate ledger cards which will be
the combined assessment roll and tax ledger. Real property shall be assessed to
the owner of record as shown in the records of the deputy magistrate for the
State of Alaska; provided, however, that any other person having an interest in
the property may be listed on the assessment records with the owner. The person
in whose name any property is listed as owner thereof shall be conclusively
presumed to be the legal owner of record. If the owner of the land is unknown,
such land may be assessed to an "unknown owner" or "unknown owners". No
assessment shall be invalidated by a mistake, omission or error in the name of
the owner of the real property assessed, if the property is correctly
described.
   D.   The assessor may list real property located in any subdivision by lot
and block or tract description, and unsubdivided property according to the land
office section and township survey description, or by giving the boundaries
thereof, or by reference to the book and page of the records of the deputy
magistrate where the description of tax lot number referring to a public record
kept by the assessor of descriptions of real property, or in such other manner
as to cause the description to be capable of being made certain. Initial
letters, abbreviations, fractions and exponents to designate the township,
range, section or part of a section or the number of any lot or block or part
thereof, or any distance, course, bearing or direction, may be employed in any
such description of real property.
   E.   Every person shall submit to the assessor a personal property return of
any property owned by him, or in which he has an interest, and of the property
held or controlled by him in a representative capacity, in the manner
prescribed in this chapter, which return shall be based on property values
existing as of January 1 of the year in which the return is made. The person
making the return in every case shall state address to which all notices
required to be given to him under this chapter may be mailed or delivered. The
return shall show the nature, quantity, description, and amount and value of
all personal property, the place where the property is located, and said return
shall be in such form and include such additional information as the council
may prescribe, and shall be signed and verified under oath by the person liable
or his or its authorized agent or representative. Said return shall be billed
on or before January 15 of each year. The assessor may, by notice in writing to
any person by whom a return has been made, require from him further return
containing additional details and more explicit particulars, and upon receipt
of the notice, that person shall comply fully with its requirements within 30
days.
   F.   The assessor personally, or by any designated assistant, shall, after
identifying themselves, have the right to enter upon and inspect the premises
of any person at reasonable times for the purpose of making an examination,
valuation or assessment of either or both real and personal property. He shall
have access to and may examine all property records involved, and any person
shall, upon request, furnish to the assessor or his assistant every facility
and assistance for the purpose of such examination, valuation or assessment.
The assessor shall not be bound to accept as correct the return made by any
person, but if he thinks it necessary or expedient, or if he suspects that a
person who has not made a return has property subject to taxation, he shall
make an independent investigation as to the property of that person, and may
make his own valuation and assessment of the taxable amount thereof, which
shall be prima facie evidence for all legal purposes and proceedings.
   G.   The assessor may examine a person on oath or otherwise, and upon
request of the assessor, the person shall present himself for examination by
the assessor.
(Ord. 77-01 (part), 1977)
5.25.025   Content of assessment roll.
The assessor shall prepare an annual assessment roll in duplicate upon which he
shall enter the following particulars:
      1.   the name and last known addresses of all persons with property
liable to assessment taxation;
      2.   a description of all taxable property;
      3.   the assessed value, quantity, or amount of said property; and
      4.   the arrears of taxes, if any, owing by any persons.
(Ord. 77-01 (part), 1977)
5.25.030   Notice, publication, correction of assessment roll.
   A.   The assessor shall give to every person named in the assessment roll a
notice of assessment, showing the assessed value of his property. On the back
of each assessment notice shall be printed a brief summary for the information
of the taxpayer, of the dates when the taxes are payable, delinquent, and
subject to interest and penalty, dates when the board will sit for equalization
purposes and any other particulars specified by the board. The assessment
notice shall be directed to the person to whom it is to be given, and shall be
sufficiently given if it is mailed by first-class mail addressed to, or is
delivered at, his address as last known to the assessor; or, if the address is
not known to the assessor, the notice may be addressed to the person at the
post office nearest to the place where the property is situated. The date on
which the notice is mailed or is delivered shall be deemed to be the date on
which the notice is given for purposes of this chapter.
   B.   When valuation notices have been mailed, the assessor shall cause
notice that the assessment rolls have been completed to be posted at two public
places for a period of two weeks. Such notice shall also state when and where
the equalization hearings shall be held and that an appeal may be taken to the
board of equalization upon the filing of notice in writing with the board
specifying the grounds of the appeal.
   C.   The assessor may correct any error or supply any omission made or
arising in the preparation of the assessment roll at any time before the
sitting of the board of equalization. It shall be the duty of every person
receiving a notice of assessment to advise the assessor of any error or
omission he may have observed in the assessment of his property, in order that
the assessor may correct the same. (Ord. 77-01 (part), 1977)
5.25.035   Appeal to board of equalization; Notice of appeal; Hearing.
   A.   Any person who receives notice or whose name appears on the assessment
roll may appeal to the board with respect to any alleged error in the
valuation, overcharge, omission or neglect of the assessor not adjusted to the
taxpayer's satisfaction. Whenever it appears to the board that there are
overcharges or errors or invalidities in the assessment roll, or in any of the
proceedings leading up to or subsequent to the preparation of the roll, and
there is no appeal before the board by which the same may be dealt with, or
where the name of any person is ordered by the board to be entered on the
assessment roll, by way of addition or substitution, for the purpose of
assessment, the board shall cause notice of assessment to be mailed to that
person or his agent giving him at least 30 days from the date of such mailing
within which to appeal to the board against the assessment.
   B.   Notice of appeal, in writing, specifying the grounds for the appeal,
shall be filed with the board within 30 days after the date on which the
assessor's notice of assessment was given to the person appealing. Such notice
must contain a certification that a true copy thereof was mailed or delivered
to the assessor. If notice of appeal is not given within that period, the right
of appeal shall cease as to any matter within the jurisdiction of the council,
unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the council that the taxpayer was
unable to appeal within the time so limited. A copy of the notice of appeal
must be sent to the assessor as above indicated.
   C.   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the assessor shall make a record
of the same in such form as the board may direct, which record shall contain
all the information shown on the assessment roll in respect of the subject
matter of the appeal, and the assessor shall place the same before the council
from time to time as may be required by the council. The council shall cause a
notice of the sitting at which the appeal is to be heard to be mailed by the
assessor to the person by whom the notice of appeal was given, and to every
other person in respect of whom the appeal is taken, to their respective
addresses as last known to the assessor.
   D.   At the time appointed for the hearing of the appeal or as soon
thereafter as the appeal may be heard, the council shall hear the appellant,
the assessor, other parties to the appeal and their witnesses, and consider the
testimony and evidence adduced, and shall determine the matters in question on
the merits and render its decision accordingly. If any party to whom notice was
mailed, as above set forth, fails to appear, the council may proceed with the
hearing in his absence. The burden of proof in all cases shall be upon the
party appealing. The council shall from time to time enter in the appeal record
its decision upon appeals brought before it, and shall certify to the same.
(Ord. 77-01 (part), 1977)
5.25.040   Entry of changes by assessor; Certification by clerk; Completion of
assessment roll.
   A.   The assessor shall enter the changes, so certified, upon his records,
and no assessed valuations shall thereafter be changed. After the hearings held
by the board of equalization are concluded, the assessor shall complete the
annual assessment roll, at a time to be determined by the council, which shall
be based on values as of January 1 immediately preceding, and he shall certify
the same. Such supplementary assessment rolls shall be prepared and certified
as may be necessary or expedient.
   B.   The clerk shall be ex-officio clerk of the board of equalization and
shall record in the minutes of the meeting all proceedings before the board,
the names of all persons protesting assessments. All changes, revisions,
corrections, and orders relating to claims or adjustments and final decisions
shall be recorded in a record to be kept by the clerk and to be known as the
appeal record. Within three days following the final hearings of the board, the
clerk shall transmit to the assessor all corrections, revisions, or changes
authorized and approved by the board and shall certify that the changes so
reported are as approved by the board of equalization.
   C.   All taxes to be levied or collected, except as otherwise provided,
shall be calculated, levied and collected upon the assessed values entered in
the assessment roll and certified by the assessor as correct, subject to the
taxpayer's right of appeal and to the corrections and amendments made in the
rolls pursuant to this chapter.
(Ord. 77-01 (part), 1977)
5.25.045   Appeal to superior court.
Any person feeling aggrieved by any order of the board shall have the right to
appeal on a de novo basis to the superior court for the third judicial
district, State of Alaska; provided, however, that the person has first taken
his appeal to the board of equalization.
(Ord. 77-01 (part), 1977)
5.25.050   Supplementary assessment rolls.
All the duties imposed upon the assessor and the clerk with respect to the
annual assessment roll and all the provisions of this chapter relating to
assessment rolls shall, as far as applicable, apply to supplementary assessment
rolls. Provided further, however, that the delinquent date when taxes shall
become delinquent, as determined by the council, shall also apply to property
listed on the supplementary assessment rolls.
(Ord. 77-01 (part), 1977)
5.25.055   Delivery of assessment roll to council; Validity.   
   A.   When the final assessment records have been completed by the assessor
as herein provided, the assessor shall deliver to the council a statement of
the total assessed valuation of all real and personal property within the city.
   B.   Every assessment roll as completed and certified by the assessor, and
as corrected and amended by him from time to time in conformity with this
chapter and the decisions of the council, shall, except insofar as the same may
be further amended as a result of an appeal to the court, as provided by this
chapter, be valid and binding on all persons, notwithstanding any defect,
error, omission or invalidity existing in the assessment roll or any part
thereof, and notwithstanding any proceedings pertaining thereto.
(Ord. 77-01 (part), 1977)
5.25.060   Tax rate.
The council shall thereupon by resolution fix the rate of tax levy and
designate the number of mills upon each dollar of assessed real and personal
property that shall be levied and shall levy the tax in accordance therewith.
The assessor shall then prepare and mail tax statements to the person or
persons listed as the owner on the tax rolls. After the due date for the
payment of taxes, a penalty of 10 percent shall be added to all delinquent
taxes, and interest at the rate of eight percent per annum shall accrue, as
herein provided, upon all unpaid taxes (not including penalty) from due date
until paid in full. (Ord. 77-01 (part), 1977)
5.25.065   Dates when taxes are due and payable.
   A.   The first payment of property taxes is due September 30. Should the
first one-ha1f (1/2) of the total amount due not be paid on or before September
30, the entire amount of taxes owed shall immediately become due and payable. A
penalty of 10 percent per annum and interest of eight percent per annum shall
accrue.
   B.   The second payment and final payment of property taxes is due and
payable on or before December 1. Failure to make the final payment shall cause
penalty and interest to accrue from the due date of the second payment.
(Ord. 77-01 (part), 1977)
5.25.070   Delinquent tax roll--Notice and publication of foreclosure list;
Payments prior to sale; Requested notice. 
   A.   The clerk shall within such time as the council may direct, after such
taxes have become delinquent and due, make up a roll in duplicate of all real
property then subject to foreclosure. Such roll shall show therein the names of
the persons appearing in the latest tax roll as the respective owners of the
tax delinquent properties, a description of each such property as it appears on
the latest tax roll, the year or years for which taxes are delinquent, the
amount of delinquent taxes for each year and penalty and interest thereon, and
thereon shall be enforced under the hand of the clerk and corporate seal, a
certificate to the effect that said roll is a true and correct roll of the
delinquent taxes of the city for the years there shown. The roll so made up
shall be known as the foreclosure list of the City of King Cove for the year in
which the same is made up, the original of which shall be filed with the clerk
and remain open to inspection of the public. After the completion of the
foreclosure list, the clerk shall cause to be posted in three public places a
notice, together with the foreclosure list, stating that on a certain date not
less than 30 days after posting the said list will be presented to the superior
court for the State of Alaska together with a petition for judgment and sale.
The clerk shall within 10 days after such posting, mail to each person to whom
a tract is assessed at his last known address, a notice describing the tract,
the amount due as stated on the foreclosure list. The foreclosure list as
presented to the court shall remain posted for four weeks before the sale.
   B.   During the time of posting of the foreclosure list and up to the time
of sale, owner or authorized person may make payment on any piece or tract set
forth therein, together with the penalty and interest, and proportionate share
of the costs of foreclosure; the clerk shall make proper notation of such
payment on both the original delinquent tax roll and foreclosure list. On
receipt of the delinquent tax payments as to a particular property any time one
week prior to the filing of the foreclosure list and petition, the clerk shall
remove the property from both the list and the petition.
   C.   A mortgagee or other holder of a recorded lien on real property may
file with the clerk a written request that notice of any foreclosure list
including such real property be given to such mortgagee or lienholder. The
request shall contain the name and address of the person filing it, the
description of the property and the name of the owner or reputed owner thereof,
and the date of expiration of the mortgage or lien. Notice need not be given
after the expiration of the mortgage or lien unless a further request therefor
is filed. If the mortgagee or lienholder furnished a duplicate form of request
for the notice, the clerk shall certify thereon to the filing and return the
duplicate described in the request for notice and shall include notice of lien
in the foreclosure list. The clerk shall then send by registered mail written
notice thereof to the mortgagee or other lienholder. At the time of mailing the
notice, the clerk shall note that fact in ink in the latest tax roll. The
notation in the tax roll is prima facie evidence that the notice was mailed.
Where the same mortgagee or lienholder has filed requests for notices on two or
more properties included in a foreclosure list, one notice may be issued
covering all such properties.
(Ord. 77-01 (part), 1977)
5.25.075   Real property--Foreclosure; Redemption.
   A.   One general proceeding shall be brought on the part of the city to
foreclose the tax liens against each of the properties included in the
foreclosure list. Foreclosure proceedings shall be in accordance with law. A
certified copy of the judgment of the superior court shall constitute a
certificate of sale to the city of the several properties described in the
judgment and decree.
   B.   Period during which property held by the city; redemption; assessment
during redemption period; redemption of part of property. All real properties
sold to the city pursuant to law shall be held by the city for the period of
one year from and after the date of the judgment and decree of foreclosure,
unless sooner redeemed. During the one-year period, any person having an
interest in the property at the date of the judgment and decree of foreclosure,
or any heir or designee of such person, or any person holding a lien of record
on the property under the judgment and decree, may redeem the property, with
interest thereon as provided by law, and any costs charged against such
property. Property so redeemed shall be subject to assessment for taxation
during the period of redemption as though it had continued in private
ownership. Any person holding a mortgage or other lien of record covering a
part only of a particular parcel of real property included in the judgment and
decree of foreclosure may redeem such part by payment of the proportionate
amount applicable thereto under the judgment and decree.
   C.   Notice of expiration of redemption period. Not less than 30 days prior
to the expiration of the period of redemption of any real property ordered sold
to the city under a judgment and decree as provided herein, the clerk shall
post a general notice relative to the expiration of the period of redemption.
The notice shall contain the date of the judgment and decree, the date of
expiration of the period of redemption, and warning to the effect that all
properties ordered sold under the judgment and decree, unless sooner redeemed,
will be deeded to the city immediately on expiration of the period of
redemption and that every right or interest of any person in the properties
will be forfeited forever to the city. The notice shall be posted in three
public places for four weeks.
   D.   Deed to city. Upon filing proof of posting of notice of expiration of
redemption period as a part of the foreclosure proceedings, the properties not
redeemed with the one-year period prescribed herein shall be deeded to the city
by the clerk of the court. All right of redemption, with respect to the real
properties therein described, shall terminate on the execution of the deed to
the district as required.
   E.   Title to the city; title of purchaser on resale. When the city acquires
real property under foreclosure procedures, the conveyance vests in the city
title to the property, free from all liens and encumbrances except unpaid taxes
and assessments duly levied for local improvements to the property, and liens
of the United States and the State of Alaska. (Ord. 77-01 (part), 1977)
5.25.080   Personal property--Delinquency; Remedies.
Owners of personal property assessed shall be personally liable for the amount
of taxes assessed against their personal property and such tax, together with
penalty and interest, may be collected after the same becomes due by a personal
action brought in the name of the city against such owner in the courts of the
state.
(Ord. 77-01 (part), 1977)
5.25.085   Collection of personal property taxes.
The city clerk shall make demand of the person owning the property assessed for
the amount of the tax, penalty and interest. If not paid within 60 days, the
clerk shall issue a warrant directing the chief of police or other police
officer of the city to forthwith seize, levy upon, distrain, and sell such
personal property of the person assessed as the tax may have been levied upon;
and if the same is not sufficient to satisfy the tax penalty and interest and
the costs and expenses of such a sale, the warrant may authorize the seizure,
levy, distraint and sale of such other property of the person against whom the
tax was assessed as may be sufficient to satisfy the tax, penalty, interest and
costs of sale. The sale shall be a public auction and shall be held after at
least 15 days notice given by posting notice of the sale in three public places
within the city, one of such places being the city bulletin board. If the
proceeds of the sale are insufficient to satisfy the tax, penalty, interest and
costs of the sale, a supplemental warrant may be issued and executed as above
set forth. The costs and expenses of the proceeding that may be satisfied from
the proceeds of the property sold shall in no event exceed 20 percent of the
proceeds received from the sale.

5.30.010 General intent.  
It is the intent of this chapter to define the procedures for a local
improvement district from its inception to conclusion, step-by-step, for public
information as well as administrative guidance, and to supersede and replace to
the fullest extent permitted under AS 29.46.020 all the procedures set out in
AS 29.46.030 - AS 29.46.100. An improvement district that is established
pursuant to this chapter shall constitute a legal and valid local improvement
district.
(Ord. 94-7 (part), 1994)
5.30.020 Definitions.
In this chapter, unless otherwise provided or the context otherwise requires,
the following words and phrases shall have the meanings set forth in this
section:
   A.   "Assessable cost" means the cost or portion of the cost that will be
assessed against the property within a local improvement district.
   B.   "Cost" means all expenses incurred by the city for making an
improvement and includes, but is not limited to, advertising and mailing
expenses; planning, engineering, surveying and architect fees and expenses;
acquisition, installation and construction expenses; legal fees; expenses
incurred in planning and forming a special assessment district; costs of
interim financing and permanent financing of the improvement, including the
issuance of bonds; and administrative overhead as established by the council of
the city.
   C.   "Improvement" includes, but is not limited to, planning, acquiring,
designing, constructing, erecting, building, establishing, installing, making,
laying out, altering, opening, improving and repairing of sewer and water
supply and distribution systems, electrical supply and distribution systems,
street lighting, streets, avenues, sidewalks, alleys, bridges, squares, and
other public ways and places within the city, including associated and other
utilities or improvements of a similar or different nature, or both.
   D.   "Local improvement district", "improvement district" and "district"
mean a local improvement district established pursuant to this chapter and
includes all parcels and rights-of-way included within the boundaries being
benefited by a specific improvement, whether the boundaries are described by
metes and bounds, lot and block, township and range, or otherwise. The term
"special assessment district" may be used interchangeably with "local
improvement district".
   E.   "Record owner" means the person in whose name property is listed on the
property roll and is conclusively presumed to be the legal owner of record. If
the owner is unknown, the assessment may be made against "unknown owner". For
purposes of this chapter, the city shall use the Aleutians East Borough
property tax roll, if available, but if the Aleutians East Borough does not
maintain a property tax roll, the property tax roll of the City of King Cove
shall be used. If neither the Aleutians East Borough nor the city maintain a
property tax roll, then the city shall use a roll of real property affected by
the local improvement district that is prepared in compliance with subsections
5.25.020 C. and D. of this code.
(Ord. 94-7 (part), 1994)
5.30.030 Improvement districts; assessment of costs.
The city may create local improvement districts and assess the property of a
state or federal governmental unit and private real property to be benefited by
capital improvements for all or a portion of the cost of such improvements. The
state shall pay an assessment levied, except as otherwise provided by law and
subject to its right of protest under AS 29.46.020(b) and this chapter. If a
governmental unit other than the state benefited by an improvement refuses to
pay an assessment, it shall be denied the benefit of the improvement.
(Ord. 94-7 (part), 1994)
5.30.040 Initiation.
   A.      The establishment of an improvement district may be initiated by:
      1.   submission to the clerk of a petition meeting the requirements of
subsection B of this section,
      2.   action of the mayor to prepare and present a report and
recommendation under this chapter, or
      3.   a request of the council by motion, resolution or ordinance that the
mayor prepare and present a report and recommendation under this chapter.
   B.   A petition to establish a local improvement district shall include a
description of the improvement sought by the petition and a map showing the
area proposed for the local improvement district. Petition forms may be
obtained from the city clerk. The original or copies of the petition must be
signed by the owners of property equal to 50 percent or more of the assessed
value of the property within the proposed district. In the event two or more
persons are shown as record owners of a parcel, the signature of any one of the
owners shall be sufficient to count the entire parcel. The petition shall be
filed with the city clerk. No property owner may withdraw a signature for three
months after the petition has been filed with the city clerk unless authorized
by the council. Withdrawal of a signature after the date of the mayor's report
and recommendation shall not affect the validity of subsequent council action
in the establishment of a district.
(Ord. 94-7 (part), 1994)
5.30.050 Initiation by petition.
   A.   Upon receipt of a petition for the formation of an improvement district
the city clerk shall forward the petition to the council. The council shall by
resolution:
      1.   determine whether the petition has sufficient and proper petitioners
and signatures; and
      2.   make a preliminary determination whether the requested improvement
appears to be necessary and should be made.
The findings made by the council under this section are conclusive.
   B.   A resolution of the council containing affirmative determinations
pursuant to subsection A shall constitute direction to the mayor to prepare a
report and recommendation pursuant to §
5.30.070.
(Ord. 94-7 (part), 1994)
5.30.060 Initiation by council or mayor.
Upon direction by the council, or upon a determination by the mayor that a
report and recommendation should be made on the establishment of a particular
local improvement district, the mayor shall prepare a report and recommendation
pursuant to §
5.30.070.
(Ord. 94-7 (part), 1994)
5.30.070 Report and recommendation--Resolution.  
   A.   When required or authorized by §§
5.30.050 or
5.30.060, the mayor shall prepare a report and recommendation on the
establishment of a proposed local improvement district. If, during the
investigation of the feasibility of the improvement, the mayor determines the
boundaries of a district proposed by a petition or by the council should be
modified, or that the type or scope of improvements should be changed, the
report and recommendation prepared by the mayor shall be on the district and
improvements determined by the mayor to be more appropriate; provided, the
report shall contain the mayor's reasons for the deviation. The deletion by the
mayor of property from a district proposed by petition does not affect the
authority of the council to establish the district, even if the remaining
properties on the petition do not represent 50 percent of the value of the
property in the district proposed by the mayor.
   B.   As soon as is reasonably practicable, the mayor shall prepare and
submit to the council the report and recommendation, which shall contain
substantially the following:
      1.   A map of the district recommended by the mayor, noting any
deviations from the boundaries requested in a petition or by the council.
      2.   A narrative description of the district, including where
appropriate:
         a.   number of parcels,
         b.   assessed value of the real property, by each parcel and for the
entire district,
         c.   type and degree of existing development,
         d.   existing improvements, and
         e.   other relevant factors such as the zoning and comprehensive plan
designations within the district, city and borough capital improvement plans
affecting the district, and private development plans, if known.
      3.      A description of the type and location of improvements
recommended by the mayor, noting any deviations from those requested by the
petition or the council.
      4.      The estimated amount or proportion of the costs that will be
borne by the city.
      5.      Estimated costs of the improvements.
      6.      Estimated date for the beginning and completion of the
improvements.
      7.      The recommended method or formula for spreading the assessable
costs among the properties within the district.
      8.      The source of funds to be used to pay the city's share of the
improvements, including assessments against city property.
      9.      The ratio of the assessed value of all property in the district
to the estimated costs that will be assessed against the property.
      10.      The recommended method and term of interim and permanent
financing of the costs of the improvements.
      11.      The recommended number of years over which assessments may be
paid.
      12.      A preliminary assessment roll showing all parcels within the
improvement district identified by their property tax roll identification
number, if any, and by such other description as may be convenient, the names
and mailing addresses of the record owners of each parcel, and the estimated
assessment against each parcel.
      13.      The mayor's recommendation on whether the council should proceed
with the establishment of the proposed district
   C.   If the mayor determines a district that was initiated by petition or by
council request should not be established because it is not necessary or
feasible, or for other reasons, the mayor may provide to the council a
narrative report containing a recommendation that no further action be taken to
establish the district. The report must set out the reasons for the
recommendation and need contain only so much information as may be necessary to
support the reasons for the recommendation. If the council approves the
recommendation, no further action shall be taken. If the council, by majority
vote, rejects the recommendation, it shall require the mayor to prepare a
report and recommendations pursuant to subsection B of this §
5.30.070.
   D.   If the mayor's recommendation under this section is to establish a
district, the mayor shall include with the report and recommendation a proposed
resolution to establish the district. The resolution must contain the
following:
      1.      A section establishing the local improvement district.
      2.      The boundaries of the district described by metes and bounds, lot
and block, township and range, or other means by which the property included
within the district can be made certain. District boundaries may, but need not,
follow existing property lines.
      3.      A summary description of the improvements to be made, approval of
the improvements, and authorization to proceed with the improvements.
      4.      A finding that the improvements are necessary and will benefit
the property within the district and that the benefit will exceed the
assessment.
      5.      The amount or the method of computing the amount of city or other
funds to be used to pay the costs not assessed against the parcels in the
district.
      6.      The method of spreading assessable costs among the property in
the district.
(Ord. 94-7 (part), 1994)
5.30.080 Method of assessment.
In determining the method of spreading assessable costs, the mayor and council
shall be guided by the policy that assessments should be substantially in
proportion to the benefit received. Methods of spreading assessments include,
but are not limited to:
      1.   per lot,
      2.   per front foot,
      3.   per square foot, including per square foot of developable area,
      4.   per assessment unit based on any reasonable measure,
      5.   value of property,
      6.   zone and termini,
      7.   extent of use or potential use, and
      8.   other methods or a combination of methods.
(Ord. 94-7 (part), 1994)
5.30.090 Council action on proposed district.  
Upon receipt of the report and recommendation of the mayor and a resolution
proposing the establishment of a local improvement district, the council may
introduce the resolution and set a time for a public hearing on the resolution.
The hearing shall be for the purpose of hearing objections to the improvement
and formation of the district.
(Ord. 94-7 (part), 1994)
5.30.100 Notice of hearing.

      7.   A statement that the council may proceed with the formation of the
district unless the owners of the property that would bear 50 percent or more
of the costs of the improvement object in writing or unless the council makes
changes that produce a net increase of more than 15 percent to the estimated
assessment on any parcel; except, that the council may proceed over the
objections of property owners upon the approval of not fewer than three-fourths
of the council. (Ord. 94-7 (part), 1994)
5.30.110 Improvement plan--Objections and revisions.
   A.   The record owner of property to be assessed may file a written
objection to the plan no later than the close of business on the day before the
public hearing required in Section
5.30.090. If the record owners of property that will bear 50 percent or more of
the estimated total cost of the improvement file timely written objections, the
council may not proceed with the establishment of the district or the
improvement until the plan is revised and the objections are reduced to less
than 50 percent; except, the council may proceed with the establishment of the
district and the improvement over such objections upon approval of not fewer
than three-fourths of the council.
   B.   A plan revised to meet property owner objections shall be treated as a
plan provided by the mayor and shall be subject to the notice, hearing and
objection procedures of §§
5.30.100 through
5.30.120.
(Ord. 94-7 (part), 1994)
5.30.120 Hearing.
   A.   At the hearing required by §
5.30.100, the council shall consider the written objections and comments
received, any staff analysis or comment on the written objections, oral
testimony provided at the hearing and such other information as may be
available. The council may adopt the formation resolution with or without
amendment.
   B.   The council may make such changes as it finds appropriate to the
boundaries of the district, the type, cost and location of improvements
proposed, the amount of city participation in the cost of the project, the
formula for spreading the assessment, or other aspects of the proposal;
provided, if parcels not previously included are added to the district or if
the changes, in the aggregate, result in an increase of over 15 percent to the
estimated assessment to a parcel, the record owner of each such parcel shall be
entitled to mailed notice in substantially the form set out in subsection
5.30.100 B. The council shall hold a second hearing on the establishment of the
district. Only those persons entitled to notice under subsection
5.30.120 B may file objections; provided, any person who previously filed an
objection may withdraw the objection.
   C.   The council may proceed with consideration of the resolution before the
expiration of the notice period if each record owner entitled to notice gives
written waiver of the right to object.
(Ord. 94-7 (part), 1994)
5.30.130 Recording resolution and proposed assessment roll.
After adoption by the council of the resolution establishing the improvement
district, the resolution and a proposed assessment roll based on the estimated
costs approved by the council shall be recorded in the district recorder's
office. Neither the failure to record the resolution and roll as required by
this section nor any errors or defects in the proposed assessment roll shall in
any manner affect the validity of the formation of the district, the inclusion
of any property in the district, the assessment against any property, or any
other matter or proceeding under this chapter.
(Ord. 94-7 (part), 1994)
5.30.140 Award of contract--Review of costs.
   A.   After adoption of the resolution establishing the district, the city
may proceed with the construction of the improvement unless, at the time the
contract for the improvement or the first portion thereof, is to be awarded,
the mayor determines the most current estimated costs of the improvement will
cause assessable costs within the district to be increased by more than 25
percent.
   B.   If the estimated assessable costs are increased by more than 25 percent
as determined under subsection A and the estimated assessable costs are more
than 50 percent of the total estimated cost of the improvement, the record
owners of property within the district shall be provided mailed notice of the
increase in assessable costs and shall be given an opportunity to file written
objections against proceeding with the improvement. Notice shall be mailed by
certified mail, return receipt requested. Written objections must be received
by the clerk not later than the close of business on the twenty-first day
following the date the notice is mailed. If the timely filed objections
represent property that would bear 50 percent or more of the total costs of the
improvement, the improvement may not be made; except, the council may proceed
with the improvement over such objections upon approval of not fewer than
three-fourths of the council. If the timely filed protests do not represent
parcels that would bear 50 percent or more of the estimated costs of the
improvement, or if the estimated assessable costs are 50 percent or less of the
estimated costs of the improvement, the city may proceed with the improvement.
   C.   At any time, the council may increase the city's contribution to the
project and such increase shall be taken into account when computing the
percentage of the estimated assessable costs.
   D.   After the award of the contract for the improvement, or the first
portion thereof, all increases in the costs of the improvement shall be borne
by the property owners and the city in accordance with the formula for
spreading the assessment approved by the council.
(Ord. 94-7 (part), 1994)
5.30.150 Assessment.
   A.   At any time after the actual costs of the improvement are known,
including reasonable estimates of the costs to be incurred in connection with
the issuance of bonds or other financing, the mayor shall prepare an assessment
roll spreading the assessable costs of the improvement in accordance with the
method approved by the council. The assessment roll shall contain for each
parcel in the district the name and address of the record owner, a legal
description of the parcel, and the amount of the assessment. If the owner is
unknown, the assessment roll may show such owner to be "unknown owner".
   B.   The clerk shall fix a time to hear objections to the assessment roll. A
notice of the hearing shall be posted in three public places and published in a
newspaper of general circulation, if distributed within the city, at least 10
days before the hearing. Notice of the assessment and assessment roll hearing
shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to each record owner
of an assessed property not less than 15 days prior to the hearing. The mailed
notice shall contain:
      1.   The name of the record owner or owners.
      2.   A description of the parcel by property roll identification number,
by a legal description, or by other means by which the parcel's identity can be
made reasonably certain.
      3.   The amount of the assessment against the parcel.
      4.   The date, time and place of the hearing on the assessment roll.
      5.   A statement that a written objection to an assessment must be
received by the clerk by the close of business on the day prior to the hearing
on the assessment roll.
      6.   Notice that if the council finds corrections to the assessment roll
are necessary, it may increase the assessment against the parcel by up to five
percent without further notice or hearing.
(Ord. 94-7 (part), 1994)
5.30.160 Hearing and certification of assessment roll.
   A.   At the hearing on the assessment roll, the council shall hear oral
objections to assessments and shall consider all written objections that were
timely filed with the clerk. The property owner has the burden of proving an
error in the assessment. An error may be shown by proving an error in
computation or measurement or that the property cannot receive any benefit,
gain or advantage from the improvement.
   B.   After consideration of objections, the council shall correct any errors
in the roll and adjust all assessments to account for any deficiency or overage
that accrues because of corrections. If an assessment is increased by more than
five percent, a new hearing shall be set and notice published, except that a
new hearing and notice is not required if all record owners of property subject
to the increased assessment consent in writing to the increase. Objection to
the increased assessment shall be limited to record owners of property on which
the assessment was increased by more than five percent.
   C.   When the roll is corrected, the council shall pass a resolution
confirming the assessment roll.
(Ord. 94-7 (part), 1994)
5.30.170 Payment, interest and penalty.  
   A.   In the resolution confirming the assessment roll the council shall fix
the time of payment, penalties for delinquency, and the rate of interest or the
method of computing the rate of interest on the unpaid balance of the
assessment. The council may require payment to be in one sum or it may
authorize payment in installments. If payment is to be in one sum, payment may
not be required sooner than 60 days after mailing of the assessment statement.
Prepayment of all or a part of the balance of an assessment may be made with
interest to the payment date or under such other terms and conditions as may be
set out in the resolution confirming the assessment roll.
   B.   Within 30 days after the adoption of the resolution confirming the
assessment roll, a statement shall be mailed to the record owner of each parcel
assessed. The statement shall identify the property, the final assessment
amount, the method of payment, the rate or method of calculating interest, the
time of delinquency, penalties on delinquencies, and conditions, if any, of
prepayment.
   C.   Notice that the statements have been mailed need not be published. The
failure to provide notice of the final assessment, penalties and interest to
any record owner does not in any manner affect the validity of the assessment,
the interest owing on the balance of the assessment or the lien of the
assessment. (Ord. 94- 7 (part), 1994)
5.30.180 Assessments to be liens; enforcement.
Assessments are liens upon the property assessed and are prior and paramount to
all other liens except municipal property tax liens. They may be enforced as
provided in AS 29.45.320 through 29.45.470 for the enforcement of property tax
liens, except foreclosure actions may be commenced more or less often than
annually.
(Ord. 94-7 (part), 1994)
5.30.190 Reassessment.
   A.   The council shall within one year correct any deficiency in a special
assessment found by a court. Notice and hearing must conform to the initial
assessment procedures.
   B.   Payments on the initial assessment are credited to the property upon
reassessment. The reassessment becomes a charge upon the property
notwithstanding failure to comply with any provision of the assessment
procedure.
(Ord. 94-7 (part), 1994)
5.30.200 Objection and appeal.
   A.   The regularity or validity of an assessment may not be contested by a
person who did not file with the city clerk a written objection to the
assessment roll before its confirmation.
   B.   The decision of the council upon an objection may be appealed to the
superior court within 30 days of the date of confirmation of the assessment
roll. If no objection is filed or an appeal taken within that time, the
assessment procedure shall be considered regular and valid in all respects.
(Ord. 94-7 (part), 1994)
5.30.210 Sufficiency of notice.
Notice required to be given under this chapter is sufficient if the time the
notice is posted, published, or mailed and the content of the notice are in
substantial compliance with the requirements of this chapter. Notice that is
not sufficient as to an individual or parcel does not affect the validity of
any proceeding, assessment, or lien under this chapter as to any other
individual, parcel, or the remainder of the district.
(Ord. 94-7 (part), 1994)
5.30.220 District by agreement.
When all of the record owners of real property within an area enter into a
written agreement approved by the city attorney, the council may establish a
local improvement district consisting of such property by resolution. Upon the
execution of the agreement and adoption of the resolution, the property owners
who are parties to the agreement waive all rights to notice, hearing and
objection under this chapter except those specifically reserved in the
agreement or resolution. The lien of assessments on property within a district
formed under this section have the same force, effect, and priority and may be
foreclosed in the same manner as the lien of other assessments under this
chapter.
(Ord. 94-7 (part), 1994)
5.30.230 Termination of district by request.
The improvement project of a local improvement district that is established
according to the procedures outlined in this chapter may subsequently be
terminated upon the written request of the record owners of property that will
bear more than 50 percent of the total cost of the improvement if the request
is approved by not fewer than three-fourths of the council. Costs incurred
prior to, and costs incurred as a result of termination of such an improvement
project will become an assessment on the property in the district if the then
current estimate of total cost of the improvement does not exceed 125 percent
of the estimated total cost last presented to the property owners in a
proceeding where property owners were given a right to object under this
chapter.
(Ord. 94-7 (part), 1994)
5.30.240 Financing.
   A.   The city may finance all or a part of the costs of a local improvement
under this chapter as provided in Title 29 of Alaska Statutes.
   B.   The council may, by ordinance or resolution, as appropriate, establish
or authorize such terms and conditions as it finds appropriate for financing
the costs of improvements under this chapter.

For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.

indirectly.
   Fisheries resources: Has the same meaning as in 15 AAC 75.300.

liable for and shall pay the tax hereby levied on all fisheries resources
processed in the city. The rate of levy shall be determined under §

of fisheries resources will be the weight reported on the fish ticket or, if no
fish ticket is given, other evidence of receipt by the fish processing business
when it acquires the fisheries resource.
   C.   The taxes levied in this chapter shall be additional to any other tax
or license fee imposed or levied under any law or any other ordinance of the
city except as herein otherwise expressly provided.

that entire calendar year. If the ordinance fixing the annual rate of levy is
enacted on or after March 1, the new rate of levy will be effective commencing
on the first day of the month following the month in which the ordinance is
enacted, and the preceding year’s annual rate of levy will continue in effect

5.40.116.
   B.   The amount of the annual credit allowed to a person by this section
shall not exceed the amount of tax imposed on the person by this chapter in
that calendar year.
   C.   In no event shall the credit be applied to any other amount owed to the
city, including, but not limited to, fees, penalties, fines, interest, or any
other amounts owed to the city, whether under this chapter or otherwise.
(Ord. 2002-12 § 3, 2002)
5.40.120   Exclusion from fish processing business tax.

5.40.215   Monthly return; Tax payments.
   A.      Each person liable for payment of the tax must file a monthly return
with the city on forms provided by the city. The return must contain an account
by weight of all fisheries resources acquired for processing during the month,
the amount of tax due, and such other information as the mayor prescribes by
regulation. The return is due on or before the last day of the following
calendar month.
   B.   The mayor is authorized, but not required to mail to taxpayers forms
for returns, but failure of the taxpayer to receive any such forms shall not
excuse the taxpayer from filing returns and making payment of the taxes or
other amounts, when and as due under this chapter.
   C.   The tax imposed by this chapter must be paid monthly on or before the
due date for filing the monthly return. Tax not paid when due will bear
interest from the due date until paid at the interest rate specified in A.S.
45.45.010(a).
   D.   Taxes and other amounts payable under this chapter must be paid to the
city by bank draft, certified check, cashier's check, personal check or money
order, or in cash. If payment is made by draft or check, the tax or other
amounts will not be deemed paid unless the check or draft is honored in the
usual course of business; nor will the acceptance of any sum by the city be an
acquittance or discharge of the tax or amount due unless the amount of the
payment is in the full and actual amount due.
   E.   Whenever payment of any tax or other amount imposed by this chapter is
made by check which is returned for lack of sufficient funds or for any other
reason, any tax or other amount paid by that check is not deemed paid until
payment with good funds is made to the city of the original amount due, plus
interest and an additional returned check fee of twenty dollars ($20.00), by
certified check, money order, or in cash. Additional penalties as provided in
this chapter will apply.
(Ord. 2002-09, 2002; Ord. 2002-12 § 4, 2002)
5.40.220   Under- or over payment of tax.
   A.      Assessments or demands for any additional tax, fee, penalty, or
interest shall be made by the mayor within three years after the close of the
month in which the same accrued, with the following exceptions:
      1.   assessments or demands for any additional tax, fee, penalty or
interest due as a result of failure to file a tax return as required by this
chapter may be made by the mayor against the taxpayer within six years after
the close of the month in which the same accrued;
      2.   against a taxpayer who has committed fraud an assessment may be made
by the mayor within six years after the fraud is discovered;
      3.   against a taxpayer who misrepresented a material fact an assessment
may be made by the mayor within six years after the misrepresentation is
discovered;
      4.   if, within such three-year period, the mayor has given written
notice to a taxpayer that the mayor has begun an audit, examination, or other
investigation of the taxpayer or its records, then the time for making an
assessment or demand shall be extended by six months; or
      5.   where a taxpayer has executed a written waiver of such limitations.
   B.   If, after receipt of a written application for a refund within the time
period specified within this subsection, the mayor determines upon an audit of
a taxpayer's records or an examination of a taxpayer's returns or records that
the taxpayer has paid any amount of tax, penalty, or interest in excess of the
amount due for the period identified in the refund application, that amount
shall, at the taxpayer's option, be either credited to the taxpayer's account
or refunded to the taxpayer. No refund or credit may be allowed for taxes,
penalties, or interest accrued more than three years prior to the beginning of
the calendar month in which the written refund application is made.
   C.   The denial of a refund may be appealed as set forth in § 5.40.330.
   D.   No interest shall be allowed on any refund granted under this chapter.
   E.   The mayor may enter into a written agreement, subject to city council
approval, with any person relating to the liability of such person in respect
of any tax, penalty, interest, fee, or assessment imposed by this chapter in
settlement of a genuine and substantial dispute as to the taxpayer's liability
for any taxable period or periods for which the time for filing a written
application for refund has not expired under subsection (B) of this section.
Such an agreement will not bind the city unless approved by the city council.
   F.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no application for
refund may be filed for taxes, penalties, or other amounts paid in relation to
an estimated return made by the mayor under §
5.40.310, and any attempted application for a refund of such amounts must be
denied. A taxpayer's sole remedy with respect to such payments is an appeal to
the superior court from the mayor's ruling on a petition for reconsideration as
provided in §
5.40.310. (Ord. 2002-09, 2002)
5.40.225   Returns confidential; Exceptions.
   A.   A tax return made pursuant to this chapter and the facts and
information disclosed in any examination of books and records of a taxpayer are
not matters of public record and must be kept confidential, except:
      1.   as necessary in connection with official investigations or
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, involving taxes, penalties, or
other amounts due under this chapter; or
      2.   pursuant to subpoena or court order; or
      3.   with the consent of the taxpayer; or
      4.   as otherwise provided in this section.
   B.   The mayor may permit the proper officer of the United States or of a
state, territory, or possession of the United States, or of a municipality of
the State of Alaska, or such officer's authorized representative, to inspect
the tax returns, reports, or other information, if the other jurisdiction
grants substantially similar privileges to the city or its representative or to
counsel for the city, and if the mayor determines that the other jurisdiction
provides adequate safeguards for the confidentiality of the returns and
information, and the returns and information will be used for tax or law
enforcement purposes only.
   C.   Nothing in this section shall prohibit the city or any officer or
employee of the city from:
      1.   giving such facts or information in evidence in any court action
involving the taxes or other amounts imposed by this chapter or a violation of
the provisions hereof or involving another municipality or a department of the
state and the taxpayer; or
      2.   giving such facts and information to the taxpayer or his or her duly
authorized agent; or
      3.   publishing the amount of taxes collected from each taxpayer under
this chapter; or
      4.   publishing other statistics presented in a manner that prevents the
identification of individual returns or reports of items thereon; or
      5.   publishing delinquent lists showing the names of taxpayers who have
failed to pay their taxes at the time and in the manner provided by law,
together with other relevant information that in the opinion of the mayor may
assist in the collection of delinquent taxes.
(Ord. 2002-09, 2002)
5.40.230   Preservation and examination of books and records; Investigations.  
   A.   A person liable for payment of taxes under this chapter must preserve
for not less than five years all books and records pertaining to acquisition
and processing of fisheries resources in the city from which can be determined
the amount of tax due under this chapter, including, but not limited to,
records of fish tickets and receipts given upon acquisition of fisheries
resources. Such books and records must be made available for examination by the
mayor at all reasonable times.
   B.   If any such person does not keep the necessary books and records within
the city for examination, it will be sufficient if such person produces within
the city such books and records as may be required by the mayor, or bears the
cost of examination by the mayor at the place where such books and records are
kept; provided that the person electing to bear such cost shall pay in advance
to the city the estimated amount thereof including round-trip transportation
fares, lodging, meals and incidental expenses, subject to adjustment upon
completion of the examination.
   C.   In addition, or as an alternative, to examining the books and records
of a taxpayer, the mayor may hold hearings and conduct investigations to
determine the accuracy of a person's returns and payments of the tax. The mayor
may subpoena witnesses to attend and require that testimony be given under oath
or affirmation.
(Ord. 2002-09, 2002)
Article 3. Enforcement; Appeals; Violations; Penalties
5.40.310   Estimated taxes upon non-filing of return or refusal to allow
examination.
   A.      If any taxpayer neglects or refuses to file a complete and accurate
return as and when required by this chapter, or refuses to provide or make
available books and records for examination as directed by the mayor, then the
mayor may, based upon such information as may be available or obtained as the
result of an investigation, determine and assess an estimated amount of taxes
due for the applicable period or periods. Such assessment shall be deemed prima
facie correct and shall be the amount of tax owing the city by the taxpayer.
   B.   The mayor will promptly notify the taxpayer of the amount of tax so
determined and assessed, together with any penalty and interest due. The total
of such amounts shall be immediately due and payable. Interest will be computed
from the original due date of the taxes assessed. The notice must be served
personally or by registered or certified mail at the address of the taxpayer as
shown on the current or most recent license.
   C.   The mayor's determination and assessment will become binding, final and
unappealable 30 days from the date of personal service or the date of mailing
of the notice; provided, however, that within such 30-day period the taxpayer
may petition the mayor for a reconsideration of the assessment. Such petition
must be in writing, must include the facts, supporting documentation, and
accurate figures showing the correct amount of tax, and must be submitted under
oath or affirmation. The mayor may conduct hearings, require the person to
provide additional information, examine books and records, and otherwise
conduct an investigation as necessary for the mayor's consideration of the
petition. Failure to timely file the petition for reconsideration authorized by
this subsection will be a waiver of the right of appeal to superior court from
the mayor's determination and assessment.
   D.   The taxpayer bears the burdens of proof and persuasion. In ruling upon
a petition for reconsideration, the mayor may modify the estimated return in
accordance with findings based upon the evidence. The mayor's final ruling on
the petition and estimated return, as may be modified by the mayor, will be
considered the final and binding return and an order of the city, which may be
appealed to superior court within 30 days after the mayor's final ruling is
mailed or delivered to the taxpayer.
(Ord. 2002-09, 2002)

relief, including, without limitation, injunctive relief under §

Cove boat harbor facilities. The harbormaster shall be appointed, paid,
removed, and succeeded in office as other appointive positions of the city and
shall take the oath of a city police officer.
      B.   The harbormaster shall enforce all of the provisions of this title
and any rules and regulations duly adopted hereunder. In the performance of
such duties the harbormaster shall have all of the powers of a police officer
of the city.
      C.   In connection with official duties, the harbormaster shall have the
authority to board any boat within the boat harbor facilities.
      D.   The harbormaster may, under the direction of the mayor, post signs
and notices that will inform the public at large and all boat owners of
authorized and prohibited uses of the boat harbor facilities.
(Ord. 77-01 (part), 1977)
11.10.215   Registration.
   A.   Every boat owner using the boat harbor facilities is required to
register his name, telephone number, post office, street address, the name and

with the harbormaster on forms to be provided by him for that purpose within 24
hours after such boat enters or utilizes the boat harbor facilities.
   B.   Any boat not required to be numbered under the U. S. Coast Guard

(Ord. 77-01 (part), 1977)
11.10.225   Use of open mooring facilities.
   A.   Areas designated for open mooring shall be open to all members of the
public. Such areas shall be used primarily for temporary mooring. Open mooring
spaces shall be utilized on a "first-come, first- served" basis. No boats from
other communities will be provided free open moorage per any kind of formal or
informal reciprocal arrangement that may have been previously in effect.
   B.   No boat or boat owner shall have any exclusive right to open mooring
space. Should any boat mooring at open mooring leave such space for any
purpose, it shall have no exclusive right to return to the same space if, upon
return, it is found that the space is occupied by another boat.
(Ord. 77-01 (part), 1977; Ord. 80-4 § 4 (part), 1980; Ord. 91-6 § 4 (part),

assigned and the appropriate fee therefor is paid in advance.
   B.   Possession of a reservation for a specific mooring space does not imply
nor guarantee to the holder any right to the exclusive use of such space for
the duration of reservation agreement. Possession of a reservation is a
guarantee that the reserved space shall be available for the use of the holder
of the reservation during those periods when the subject boat is within the
boat harbor facilities. The harbormaster may temporarily assign another boat to
a reserved mooring space as he determines it expedient and only when the boat
assigned to a reserved mooring space is away from the harbor area.
   C.   In an event that a holder of a mooring space reservation returns to the

holder shall contact the harbormaster. The harbormaster shall cause the boat
temporarily assigned to the reserved mooring space to be moved to another
location.

contacted.

sublease or in any other manner permit the use of such mooring space to any
other boat owner except as provided in this section.

not use the utilities which may have been provided to that space for the
exclusive use of the boat owner holding a reservation on that space.
   G.   Nothing in this section limits the harbormaster's authority to use the
holder's reserved space during the absence of the holder's boat and to move
moored boats to other locations in the event of fire or other emergency
requiring such action.
   H.   No property rights are created by this section. The holder shall have
only a license to use the space reserved to him as provided in this chapter.

utility service incurred because of that move shall be the responsibility of
the city.
(Ord. 77-01 (part), 1977)

fire hazard or otherwise become a menace or nuisance to the safety and welfare
of other boats and their occupants.

are prohibited from using harbor facilities unless another vessel capable of
tending to the stricken vessel is chartered to stand by and render assistance
if necessary.
(Ord. 77-01 (part), 1977; Ord. 80-4 § 4 (part), 1980)
11.10.245 Loading areas.
No boat shall remain moored in such designated areas for any period longer than
is posted. No boat shall remain moored at the dock (i.e., which provides access
to the floats) for longer than four hours unless permission is granted by the
harbormaster.
(Ord. 77-01 (part), 1977; Ord. 93-12 (part) 1993)
11.10.250 Gridirons.
Gridirons shall be available at all times to boat owners for the purpose of

commonly known as the King Cove Warehouse and located at the harbor, King Cove,
Alaska, said use being specifically limited to approximately 10,000 square feet

discretion of the harbormaster, fifty dollars ($50.00) per day for every day
thereafter.

make an application with the city harbormaster. The harbormaster has the
discretion to issue permits or deny the same and to schedule use of the
facility as he or she deems necessary for orderly utilization of said facility.
   C.   All use permits issued by the harbormaster will be revocable for any
reasonable or just cause.
   D.   All applicants for a use permit must sign an indemnification clause
identifying the city of all claims against the city as a result of the
permittees use of the facility which will be kept on file by the harbormaster.
   E.   All commercial vendors/services using the ground floor shall pay
$15.00/day without electricity. If electricity is used, a flat $3.50/day will
be added to the user's bill.
   F.   All general/individual use or commercial vendors/services using the
ground floor warehouse space must have a current city business registration on
file with the city office.

accountability for commercial vendors/services using the warehouse. The
harbormaster shall verify the commercial vendor/services has a current business
registration on file prior to approving use of warehouse space.

come basis.
   B.   When utilizing the boat haul-out area for temporary repairs, a grace
period of one week (seven days) after haul-out will be allowed. The grace
period will be extended if a vessel is kept in the boat haul-out area for
circumstances beyond the vessel owner's control. The harbormaster shall decide
when such circumstances occur and whether to allow for the extension of the
grace period.
(Ord. 90-04 § 4 (part), 1990)
11.10.265 Cleanup of boat haul-out area.

chafing and other damages.
(Ord. 77-01 (part), 1977)
11.10.275   Reckless operations.
It is unlawful for any boat owner using the boat harbor to operate or cause to
be operated a boat in a reckless manner. For the purpose of this section "to
operate in a reckless manner" means to operate a boat in willful or wanton
disregard of the rights or safety of others, or without due caution and
circumspection, or at a speed or in a manner as to endanger or to be likely to
endanger a person or property, or that which creates a substantial and
unjustifiable risk of harm to person or property. A substantial and
unjustifiable risk is a risk of such a nature and degree that the conscious
disregard of it or a failure to perceive it constitutes a gross deviation from
the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in a situation.
(Ord. 77-01 (part), 1977)
11.10.280   Negligent operations.
It is unlawful for any boat owner to operate or cause to operate a boat in a
negligent manner. For the purpose of this section "to operate in a negligent
manner" means the operation of a boat in such a manner as to create an
unjustifiable risk of harm to a person or to property and who, as a result of
the creation of the risk, actually endangers a person or property. An
unjustifiable risk is a risk of such a nature and degree that a failure to
avoid it constitutes a deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable
person would observe in the situation. Proof that a defendant actually
endangered a person or property is established by showing that, as a result of
the defendant's operation:
      1.   an accident occurred;
      2.   a person, including the defendant, took evasive action to avoid an
accident;
      3.   a person, including the defendant, stopped or slowed down suddenly
to avoid an accident;
      4.   a person or property, including the defendant or his property, was
otherwise endangered; or
      5.   the offense of negligent driving is a lesser offense than, and
included in, the offense of reckless driving, and a person charged with
reckless driving may be convicted of the lesser charge of negligent driving.
(Ord. 77-01 (part), 1977)
11.10.285   Unlawful acts.

facilities that causes a wake or wave action which will damage, endanger or be
likely to endanger any other boat or any of the boat harbor facilities

thereof;
      3.   throw or otherwise cause to be deposited gasoline, oil, litter,

facilities without approval thereof first being obtained from the harbormaster.
All unauthorized advertising and signs shall be removed by the harbormaster;
      7.   write or post any written or printed matter or sign upon any
bulletin board constructed or maintained by the city in the boat harbor
facilities without first having obtained the permission of the harbormaster;
      8.   deposit, place, or leave any cargo, merchandise, supplies, freight,
articles, or thing upon any float, ramp, decline, walk, or other public place

designated as loading areas by the harbormaster;
      9.   fail to register with the harbormaster any boat occupying any of the
boat harbor facilities;
      10.   tap, connect, disconnect, interfere with, or tamper with any
electrical wiring, electrical outlet, or electrical device of any kind

section shall be disposed of as provided in this part.
(Ord. 77-01 (part), 1977)
11.10.415   Abatement of nuisances.    
   A.   Vessels may be impounded if:
      1.   The vessel is within the harbor including its dry storage areas, and
is a derelict or a nuisance as defined in this title;
      2.   The fees for the vessel (on which the city has a lien) are sixty
(60) days delinquent;
      3.   The vessel is located in the harbor including its dry storage areas,
and is in violation of this title, or a state or federal law; or
      4.   The owner, operators, master or managing agent is not aboard the
vessel and the vessel is not properly identified by a name and/or number.
   B.   Notice to owner:
      1.   Contents. Prior to impounding any vessel, the harbormaster shall
prepare a written notice of intent to impound the vessel. This notice shall
contain:
         a.   The name and/or official number or state registration number of
the vessel;
         b.   The name and address, if known, of the owner, operator, master or
managing agent, and the location of the vessel;
         c.   The basis or reason for impoundment; and
         d.   The reserved moorage space, if any, which will be forfeited if
the vessel is impounded.
      2.   Distribution. The notice of intent to impound shall be at least
twenty-one (21) days before impoundment. The notice shall be:
         a.   Mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the last
known owner, master or managing agent of the vessel at his or her last known
address; and
         b.   Posted on the vessel, in the harbormaster's office, and in the
United States Post Office in King Cove.
   C.   Hearing.
      1.   Demand for hearing. The owner, master or managing agent or any other

to impound the vessel. Any such person desiring a hearing shall file a written
demand with the city clerk within ten (10) days after the mailing and posting
of the notice of intent to impound.
      2.   Hearing procedure. The hearing shall be conducted within seventy-two
(72) hours of receipt of a written demand therefore from the person seeking the
hearing unless such person waives the right to a speedy hearing. Saturdays,
Sundays and city holidays are to be excluded from the calculation of the
seventy-two (72) hour period. The hearing officer shall be designated by the
city manager and shall be someone other than the harbormaster. The sole issue
before the hearing officer shall be whether there is cause to impound the
vessel in question. "Cause to Impound" shall mean such a state of facts as
would lead a reasonable person exercising ordinary prudence to believe there
are grounds for impounding the vessel. The hearing officer shall conduct the
hearing in an informal manner and shall not be bound by technical rules of
evidence. The person demanding the hearing shall have the burden of
establishing that he or she has the right to possession of the vessel. The
harbormaster shall have the burden of establishing that there is cause to
impound the vessel. Failure of the owner, operator, master or managing agent to
request or attend a scheduled impoundment hearing shall be deemed a waiver of
the right to such a hearing and consent to the impoundment action.
   D.   Decision. At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall
prepare a written decision. The hearing officer shall only determine that as to
the vessel in question, either that there is cause to impound the vessel or
that there is no such cause. A copy of the decision shall be provided to the
person demanding the hearing, and the owner of the vessel, if the owner is not
the person requesting the hearing. The hearing officer's decision shall in no
way affect any criminal proceeding in connection with the impoundment in
question, and any criminal charges involved in such proceeding may only be
challenged in the appropriate court. The decision of the hearing officer is
final.
   E.   Impoundment. In the event the hearing officer determines there is cause
to impound the vessel, the harbormaster may proceed immediately with the
impoundment of the vessel. The harbormaster may impound the vessel by
immobilizing it, removing it or having it removed from the water and placing it
in public or commercial storage, with all expenses of haul out and storage and
an impound fee to be borne by the owner of such vessel. At any time prior to
the sale of the vessel, the owner, operator, master or managing agent, or
person in lawful possession of the vessel may redeem the vessel by a cash
payment of all fees against the vessel, including interest and costs.
   F.   Notice of sale.
      1.   Contents. Prior to the sale of any impounded vessel, the

United State Post Office in King Cove; and
         c.   Published in a newspaper of general circulation in Anchorage at
least once.
   G.   Sale.
      1.   Bids. The minimum acceptable bid shall be a sum equal to the fees
against the vessel, including interest and costs to be paid in cash at the time
of sale or within twenty-four (24) hours thereafter. The proceeds of such sale
shall be first applied to the cost of the sale, then to interest, then to fees
accrued and the balance, if any, shall be held in trust by the city for the
owner of the vessel to claim. If such balance is not claimed within two (2)
years, the balance shall be forfeited to the city. Upon sale being made, the
city shall make and deliver its bill of sale without warranty, convoying the

subdivider if he has not submitted to a final plat for such subdivision within
18 months from the date he submitted the preliminary plat. The subdivider may

frontage and side lot lines. The lines indicating easements must be shown with
dashed line markings.
      8.   Providing for drainage.
         a.   The platting board shall not approve any plat of subdivision
which does not make adequate provision for storm or flood water runoff channels
or basins. The storm water drainage system shall be separate and independent of
any sanitary sewer system.
         b.   Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway,
channel, or stream there shall be provided a storm easement or drainage right-
of-way conforming substantially to the lines of such watercourse. Whenever
possible it is desirable that the drainage be maintained by an open channel
with adequate width for maximum potential volume of flow. Such area shall not
be filled or built upon and a note to this effect shall be placed on the plat.
         c.   The subdivider may be required by the platting board to carry

drainage facility, the platting board may withhold approval of the subdivision
until provision has been made for the improvement of said potential condition.
         g.   Whenever a plat is submitted for an area which has been
designated as a flood-hazard area, the platting board may approve such
subdivision only when it has determined that all provisions of the city
regulation requiring compliance with requirements of this chapter and
Chapter 13.06, § 13.06.130 have been met.
         h.   When a proposed drainage system will divert water across private

system shall be provided in the subdivision by the subdivider to the standards
of the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation and the City of King
Cove.
         b.   Where a community water supply system is not available within 200
feet of the perimeter boundaries of the proposed subdivision, the platting

common use of the lots within the subdivision, such system to be provided to
standards established by the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation
and the City of King Cove.
         c.   Where a community water supply is not available within 200 feet
of the perimeter boundaries of the proposed subdivision, individual wells may
be permitted if the subdivider can demonstrate that every lot within the
proposed subdivision can be provided an adequate supply of potable water. The
subdivider shall not be required to install individual wells.
      10.   Waste disposal:
         a.   Where a community sewage disposal system is available within 200

shall be connected to and serviced by that community sewage disposal system.
Such system shall be provided in the subdivision by the subdivider to standards
of the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation and the City of King
Cove.
         b.   Where a community sewage disposal system is not available within
200 feet of the perimeter boundaries of the proposed subdivision, certification
from the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation that the ares of all
lots within the proposed subdivision are adequate to accommodate individual
waste disposal devices shall be required, or the subdivider shall be required
to install a package treatment system approved by the Alaska Department of
Environmental Conservation, prior to final plat approval. The subdivider shall
not be required to install individual water disposal devices.
         c.   All facilities for the supply of water and the disposal of waste,
whether individual on-lot or serving more than one lot, including hook-ups to
existing community systems, are subject to city ordinances and state standards.
All such facilities must receive approval of the city prior to construction,
installation, and/or operation. Additionally, plans for a system serving more
than one connection must be submitted to, reviewed and approved by the Alaska
Department of Environmental Conservation prior to construction and note to that
effect shall be placed on the final plat.

         e.   Lots at right angles to each other should be avoided.
         f.   Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or radial
to street lines.
         g.   Lots shall follow municipal boundary lines rather than cross
them.
         h.   Lots shall be laid out so as to provide drainage away from all
buildings and individual lot drainage shall be coordinated with the general
storm drainage pattern for the area.
         i.   No cut trees, timber, debris, junk, rubbish or other waste
materials of any kind shall be buried in any land or left or deposited on any
lot or street and removal of the same shall be required prior to the time of
expiration of the public improvements guarantee (see §
13.05.025) or dedication of public improvements, whichever is sooner.

platted addition attaches to the lots of the platted addition bordering on the
area. If a public square is vacated, the title to it vests in the city. If the
property vacated is a lot or tract, title vests in the rightful owner.
   F.   If the city acquired the street or other public area vacated for legal
consideration or by express dedication and acceptance by the city other than
required subdivision platting, before the final act of vacation the fair market

(Ord. 81-09 (part), 1981)
13.05.080   Variances.
   A.   The platting board may authorize a variance from these regulations
when, in its opinion, undue hardship may result from strict compliance. For the
purposes of this chapter the term "hardship" shall refer to conditions where
reasonable development of a tract is rendered impossible because of a physical
limitation but shall not include financial hardship.
   B.   In granting any variance the platting board shall prescribe only
conditions that it deems necessary to or desirable for the public interest. In
making its findings, the platting board shall take into account the nature of
the proposed use of land, the existing use of land in the vicinity, the number
of persons to reside or work in the proposed subdivision and the probable
effect of the proposed subdivision upon traffic conditions in the vicinity. No
variance shall be granted unless the platting board finds that there are
special physical conditions affecting said property such that the strict
application of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of
the reasonable use of his land.
   C.   In approving variances, the platting board may require such conditions
as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the standards
or requirements of this chapter.
   D.   The applicant procedure for filing a variance request and proof of need
shall adhere to the following:
      1.   Application for exception. Application for a variance may be made
with respect to a proposed subdivision, proposed major or minor partitions, by
filing a request for same with the city clerk. Such application shall be
supported by a full disclosure of all material facts upon which petitioner
proposes to rely in seeking such variance, including a copy of the map or
preliminary plat of the proposed partitioning or subdivision.
      2.   Findings required. A variance from the standards of this title shall
not be granted by the planning commission unless the commission finds from the
facts presented at the hearing that:
         a.   There are special circumstances or conditions affecting the
property which are unusual and peculiar to the lands or development of the
project involved as compared to other lands similarly situated.
         b.   The variance sought is necessary and the minimum required for the
preservation and protection of a substantial property interest of the
petitioner to the degree that extraordinary hardship would result from strict
compliance to the particular subdivision, major or minor partitioning involved.
         c.   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the
public health, safety or welfare, but will be consistent therewith and shall
not be injurious to the rights to other property owners in the near vicinity
nor constitute a departure from or be in violation of the comprehensive plan of
the City of King Cove.
         d.   That the applicant's proposal for variance in a subdivision or
major or minor land partitioning conforms to and is consistent with all other
regulatory requirements of this chapter and
Chapter 13.06 of this code, that adequate provision is made for traffic
circulation, recreation, open spaces and similar factors, and that variance
sought has been considered by other public agencies concerned with fire
protection, sewer, water and other utilities, as well as environmental factors,
and the written comments of such regulatory bodies as applicable is submitted
as part of the record.

   K.   Increased or altered street uses. 1. When the city council, the
planning commission, or the design review board has before it any application
for a land use decision, the decision- making body shall, before granting any
change or permit, consider whether the application asks for a change or permit
for the alteration or development of property in such a way as to create any
likelihood of increased or altered use of any street adjacent to the property.
For the purposes of this section, it shall be presumed that any new development
of land upon which no structure had previously been built, any alteration of an
existing structure adding 20 percent or more to the floor space of the
structure and any change in the commercial use of land to a use the decision-
making body finds to generate more traffic presents such a likelihood.
      2.   Upon making the finding of a likelihood of increased or altered
street use, the decision-making body shall consider whether the dedicated
street width at the location is adequate at the time to accommodate both the
existing traffic and such traffic as the street may be expected to be required
to carry in the foreseeable future, and in making this determination the
decision- making body shall consider the planned street width as set forth in
the Comprehensive Plan, and this code, and shall not regard as satisfactory any
width less than that planned width, except upon a showing of extraordinary
circumstances making it clear that the planned street width is inappropriate.
      3.   The decision-making body shall then require that the owner of the
land which is subject of the pending application do whichever of the following
seems to the decision making body to best meet the needs of the community:
         a.   dedicate as much land as is required to make up the necessary
road width; or
         b.   improve the amount of road to standard, as the decision making
body may deem necessary; or
         c.   improve to standard one-half the width of the road for as great a
distances the decision-making body may deem necessary.
   Except in cases in which immediate whole-street improvement is required, the
decision-making body shall also require that the applicant enter into an
agreement with the city by which the applicant shall agree that he will not
remonstrate against a local improvement district street improvement project
upon the affected street, and the city shall agree that the applicant shall be
given credit against his portion of the costs of the street improvement project
for the land dedicated and for the cost of improving any portion of the street
actually improved to standard by the applicant.
      4.   Permits for the construction of single-family dwellings shall be
issued only after the city has examined the application for building permit to
determine whether the proposed dwelling is to be built upon a street improved
to the city standards. The permit shall be given the endorsement of the city,
indicating that the street upon which the dwelling is to be built has been so
improved. In the event the street upon which the dwelling is to be built has
not been improved to city standards, then the endorsement of the city shall be
given only upon the applicant's dedicating the land necessary to make up the
planned width of the street as set forth in subsection 2. of this section and
signing the agreement not to remonstrate, as described in subsection 3. of this
section, or if the applicant chooses and the city staff acquiesces, upon the
applicant making the appropriate whole-street or half-street improvement.
   L.   Building height limit exceptions. 1. The following types of structures
or structural parts are not subject to the building height limitations of this
title: chimneys, tanks, church spires, domes, monuments, fire and hose towers,
observation towers, masts, aerials, cooling towers, transmission towers,
smokestacks, flagpoles, radio and television towers, and other similar
projections.
      2.   Building heights in any zone may be increased as a conditional use
to a maximum permitted height of 75 feet provided that the total floor area of
the buildings does not exceed the area requirement of the zone (if any) and
provided that in residential zones all yards shall have a minimum depth of not
less than three- quarters the height of the principal structure.
(Ord. 81-09 (part), 1981)

(zone change) effecting the zoning map but not effecting the zoning text, may
be modified by the applicant or by the planning commission, provided that the

by a property owner or his authorized agent the Council may require the
dedication of additional street utility right-of-way where an officially
adopted street plan indicates need for increased width or where the nature of

13.06.130 Sensitive lands.
   A.   Intent and purpose. The sensitive lands within the city are
superimposed as an overlay with respect to lands classified for various uses
and purposes and is intended to give recognition to the need to protect the
public health, safety and welfare of the community through regulation and
control of the lands within the sensitive lands areas to thereby mitigate
potential financial burdens arising from flood damage loss, to preserve natural
drainage ways, or on steep slopes from encroaching uses which threaten to
adversely affect the property rights of citizens of the community, personal
safety and the public health by unnatural conditions arising from upstream or
downstream flood levels.
   The sensitive lands areas has for its purpose the preservation of natural
water storage areas, steep slopes or eroding soils by discouraging or
prohibiting incompatible uses except in those instances where a finding may
properly be made by the planning commission pursuant to this section.
   B.   Definitions. In this section the following words and phrases shall be
construed to have the specific meanings assigned to them as follows:
      Drainageways: means those areas which convey significant seasonal
concentrations of water over the surface of the land;
      Excavation: means mechanical removal of earth material;
      Fill: means any act by which earth, sand gravel, rock or any other
similar material is deposited, placed, pulled or transported, and includes the
conditions resulting therefrom;
      Flood: means a temporary rise in stream flow or stage that results in
water overtopping stream banks and inundating land adjacent to the normal flow
of water through the stream channel;
      Flood hazard: means a danger to property or health as a result of
inundation of the floodplain;
      Floodplain: means the relatively flat area or lowlands adjoining the
channel of a river, stream, water course or other body of water which has been
or may be covered by flood waters within the area of applicability defined by
the floodplain district;
      Grading: means any excavation or filling or combination thereof;
      Obstruction: means any dam, wall, embankment, levee, dike, pile,
abutment, projection, excavation, channel modification, bridge, conduit,
culvert, building, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, matter or things of a
similar nature in, along, or across or projecting into any channel,
watercourse, or floodplain drainageway areas which may impede, retard or change
the direction of the flow of water, either by itself or that is placed where
the flow of water might carry the same downstream to the damage of health or
property;
      Regulatory flood: means the flood used to define the outer boundary lines
of the floodplain area. The maximum flood predicted to occur within 100 years;
      Steeply sloping lands: means portions of the ground surface which have a
slope of 13 percent or greater;
      Structure: means constructed edifice, barrier or building of any kind, or
any artificial build-up or composition of physical parts adjoined together.

substantial obstruction of water flow in the floodplain and do not impair the
water storage capacity of the floodplain and shall be permitted within the
sensitive lands areas subject to the limitations in this section stated:
      1.   Off-street parking and maneuvering areas, access ways and service
drives located on the ground surface. Excavation, grading and paving may occur
to construct said facilities; however, no fill shall be allowed for
construction of said facilities other than gravel for a paving base and only an
amount of gravel commensurate with city construction standards for said
facilities shall be allowed;
      2.   Accessory residential uses such as lawns, gardens or planting areas
not causing substantial obstructions to flood waters and including fences
designed to minimize the obstruction of flood waters and flood-carried debris;
      3.   Roadways, bridges or utility structures designed to not
significantly impede the flow of flood waters;
      4.   Agricultural uses conducted without locating a structure in the
sensitive lands including a boundary fence designed to minimize the obstruction

      1.   filling;
      2.   permanent structures permitted in other zoned areas of the city;
      3.   any temporary structure which by its nature cannot be readily
removed from the floodplain area during periods of flooding and which would
significantly impede or interfere with the flow of flood waters within the
district;
      4.   Any change in the topography or terrain which would have a
substantial tendency to change the flow of waters during flooding period or
which would increase flood hazard or alter the direction or velocity of the
flood water flow or would be subject to destruction due to seismic activity or
land slides;
      5.   Subsurface sewerage disposal septic tanks and drain fields.
   E.   Nonconforming uses. Any pre-existing condition or structure within the

requirements set forth in §
13.06.180 of this code, an application for a special use permit filed as by
said section stated may be considered or denied by the planning commission
based on written findings in conformity with the requirements of this zone
ordinance.
   An application for special permit in form prescribed by the planning
department of the city shall be supported by the following additional data or
information to enable the planning commission to adequately determine whether
the proposed use is located in the sensitive lands area and if so, whether the
proposal, if granted, will conform to the purposes and guidelines as set forth
in this section.
      1.   Plans drawn to scale, submitted in triplicate as prepared by a
registered professional engineer with experience in hydraulic and hydrologic
principles and processes showing the nature, location, dimensions, elevations
and topography of the site; the location of existing and proposed structures
located upon the site, existing and proposed fill areas, and the relationship
of these to the location of the stream channel;
      2.   Any documentation, photographs, water marks, and similar evidence
offered in support of the claim that the site or area in question lies above
high water as defined by the regulatory flood;
      3.   If it is determined by the planning commission that the proposed use
is within the sensitive lands area as herein defined, the applicant shall
furnish such further information, data and evidence as may be reasonably
available to support the granting of the petition in accordance with the
following guidelines, in the absence of which said petition shall be denied by
the planning commission:
         a.   Proposed improvements will not have a serious tendency to change
the terrain during future use such as to cause a compounding of flood hazards
or destruction of property to thereby seriously interfere with the intent and
purposes of the regulations.
         b.   No structure, fill, storage or other uses shall be permitted
which alone or in combination with existing or future uses would materially
reduce the capacity of the flood-plain area or sensitive land areas to create a
present or foreseeable hazard to the public health, safety and general welfare.
   The city shall reserve the right to retain a registered professional
engineer with experience in hydraulic principles and processes for the purpose
of reviewing evidence submitted in support of any application for special use
permits pursuant to this section.

existing structures permitted within the sensitive lands area pursuant to this
section shall comply with the following standards:
      1.   Permitted structures, such as electrical and service equipment,
etc., shall be constructed at or above the regulatory flood protection
elevation. Utility openings shall be sealed and locked.
      2.   The lowest floor elevation of a structure designed for human
occupancy shall be at least one and one-half feet above the flood surface
elevation.
      3.   The lower portions of any structure shall be flood- proofed or
otherwise protected from significant damage by inundation to a minimum flood
surface elevation one and one-half feet above the surface elevation of the
regulatory flood.
      4.   The design of substructures and structural members of all buildings
shall be designed to withstand expected water pressures and velocities as well
as minimize flood risk conditions.
   H.   Appeal to city council. An appeal from any decision of the planning
commission may be filed with the city clerk for hearing by the city council as
provided by §
13.06.030.
   I.   Construction time period, extension. If substantial construction or
development has not taken place within one year from the date of approval of
the general development plan and program, the planning commission shall review
the district at a public hearing to determine whether or not its continuation
in whole or in part is in the public interest, and if found not to be, shall
recommend to the city council that the permit of approval on the property be
removed. The city council, at the request of the applicant, may grant an
extension of time if justifiable.
(Ord. 81-09 (part), 1981)
13.06.140   Stormwater detention.
   A.   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to reduce the harmful effects
of stormwater runoff on stream beds, banks, park lands, private properties and
other areas in the city by requiring the installation of on-site stormwater
detention facilities as properties are developed within the city.
   B.   Applicability. The provisions of this section shall apply to any work
for which a subdivision plat, a site development plan and/or building permit is
required and shall apply to any work requiring a permit for which other changes
in the land use are made which change the runoff characteristics. The
provisions of this section shall apply in all uses under the zoning and
subdivision ordinances of the city.
   C.   Manual of operation. The planning commission shall prepare and set
forth, in the form of a manual, guidelines for compliance with the standards of
this section. The manual will assist those persons who are required to comply
with the provisions of the stormwater detention ordinance and may be secured
from the city and shall be followed unless otherwise specified. The planning
commission shall act as the agent for control and final approval of submitted
plats and site development plans, subject to appeal to the city council.
   D.   Plan submittal and modification of requirements. Site, subdivision, and
building plans submitted to the planning commission will include plans and
design calculations for each detention facility proposed. Detention facilities
shall be designed so that they do not become health or safety hazards. In the
case that exact compliance with the ordinance would result in the inability to
use the land as it is permitted to be used by zoning and subdivision
classifications, changes may be allowed to justify the interpretation and
administration of the ordinance as long as that interpretation and
administration remains within the parameters of the intent of the ordinance and
the adverse effect of the stormwater storage is insubstantial. In the event the
applicant disagrees with planning commission interpretation, he (she) may
appeal to the city council for a determination. Upon determination, the city
council may modify or vary the requirements of the ordinance to the extent
necessary to allow some degree of permitted land use to exist in such a way as
to maintain the maximum stormwater detention system.
   E.   Improvements on developed or undeveloped areas.
      1.   Whenever any work for which a subdivision plat, site development
plan or a building permit is required is undertaken on a developed site or
previously undeveloped site, then the person or persons undertaking the work
shall provide stormwater storage sufficient to store the difference between the
runoff from a 25 year storm on the site as fully developed and the runoff
produced by a five- year storm from the site in its undeveloped state until
such time as the required storage has been fully utilized. "Work" as used
herein shall not include remodeling which has no impact on stormwater runoff.
      2.   Whenever any work is undertaken on a site which is located within
the 100-year floodplain, the person or persons undertaking the work shall
comply with the requirements of the city's sensitive lands ordinance; and in no
case shall anything in this stormwater detention section be so construed or
permitted as to allow a negative impact upon or impairment of the intended
effectiveness of the city's sensitive lands ordinance. The city council is
vested with the authority to interpret and rule therein.
   F.   Maintenance of system required. All plans submitted for stormwater
detention systems shall describe adequate procedures of normal maintenance for
the detention system. Any failure of the stormwater system, due to inadequate
maintenance, shall be the responsibility of the owner of the property on which
the detention system is located. Where a stormwater system is part of a
subdivision, normal procedures shall be utilized for city council acceptance
for operation and maintenance of the system. It shall also be the property
owner's responsibility to remedy any inadequate maintenance that results in the
failure of the system. Periodic inspection by the administrative official will
be made to determine conformity with the ordinance. The submittal of plans for
such a system or the purchase of property on which such a system is located
shall be deemed an acceptance of responsibility for maintenance of the system.
   G.   Violation, penalty. 1. If an applicant is required to build and
maintain a stormwater detention system and fails to do so or does so improperly
or in violation of this section, the development shall be considered an
unlawful use of land and the applicant shall be deemed in violation of this
section;
      2.   If any person is guilty of a violation of the provisions of this
section, the city will proceed to remedy the violation and assess a lien
against this person and against any property within jurisdiction owned by this
person in the amount sufficient to cover the costs of the repair.

proposals as set forth herein, based on the following criteria, shall assure
that a development or physical improvement is designed and located in a manner
which will best satisfy the purpose and intent of this section.
         a.   Relationship to neighborhood and areas.
               1)   It will not impair or interfere with either the development
use, or enjoyment of other property in the vicinity, or the orderly and
pleasing development of the neighborhood or area as a whole, or the design
functions of public lands and rights-of-way.
               2)   It will not directly, or in a cumulative fashion, impair,
inhibit, or limit further investment or improvements in the vicinity, on the
same or other properties, including public lands and rights-of-way.
         b.   Project development.
               1)   It will properly and adequately perform or satisfy its
functional requirements without being unsightly or creating substantial
disharmony with regard to its locale and surroundings.
               2)   It will provide a safe, pleasing and livable environment
for those people utilizing the development, and immediate neighbors or
community as a whole.
               3)   It shall reasonably conform to the natural contours of the
site, incorporating special designs, where appropriate, to accommodate unique
topographic features.
   E.   Design criteria. It will minimize or eliminate adverse visual effects
which might otherwise result from unplanned or inappropriate development
design. Such adverse effects may include, but are not limited to those produced
by the design and location characteristics of:
      1.   the scale, mass, height, area and materials of buildings and
structures;
      2.   surface and subsurface drainage and appurtenant structures;
      3.   cut and fill or the reforming of the natural terrain and structures
appurtenant thereto such as retaining walls;
      4.   areas, paths, and rights-of-way for the containment, movement or
general circulation of persons, animals, vehicles, conveyances and watercraft;
      5.   Other developments or improvements such as, but not limited to,
utility lines, storage or service areas and advertising features, which may
result in a diminution or elimination of sun and light exposure, views, vistas,
privacy, and general aesthetic value of the neighborhood or area.
   F.   Bonding and assurances. The planning commission shall require a bond or
other adequate assurance as a condition of the design plan that conformance to
the approved design plan is completed. The planning commission may approve and
release bonds up to fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00). The bond or other
assurance shall be released when conformance to the design plans is certified
by the administrative official.
   G.   Validity period. Design plans approved by the administrative official
shall remain valid for a period of one year following the date of its approval.
If at the end of that time construction has not begun, then the site plan
approval shall lapse and shall be in effect only if resubmitted to the planning
commission and again approved. All construction and development under any
construction permit shall be in accordance with the approved design plans. Any
departure from such plan other than provided for in this section shall be a
cause for revocation of a construction permit. Any proposed changes in an
approved plan shall be submitted to the planning commission in accordance with
this section for review and approval.
   H.   Offsite improvement and right-of-way. Right-of-way necessary to conform
to the comprehensive development plan and offsite improvements including but
not limited to street improvements, pedestrian ways, lighting and signalization
may be required upon the planning commission finding that a likelihood of an

feet wide. No area may be considered as an aisle way unless accessible and
usable for that purpose.
      2.   Except as otherwise defined in this code, "one space" means a
minimum area available for parking nine feet six inches wide and 19 feet long.
No area may be considered as a parking space unless accessible and usable for
that purpose.
      3.   "Employees" means all persons (including proprietor, executives,
professional people, production, sales and distribution employees) working on
the premises during the largest shift.
   B.   Obligation of property owner. The provision and maintenance of off-
street parking and loading spaces are continuing obligations of the property
owner. No approval for adding buildings to the site shall be issued until plans
are presented that show property has adequate off-street parking and loading
space. The subsequent use of property for which the construction permit is
issued shall be conditional upon the unqualified continuance and availability
of the amount of parking and loading space required by this title. Should the
owner or occupant of a lot or building change the use to which the lot or
building is put, thereby increasing off-street parking or loading requirements,
it is unlawful and a violation of this title to begin or maintain such altered
use until the required increase in off-street parking or loading is provided.
   C.   Joint use. Owners of two or more uses, structures, or parcels of land
may agree to utilize jointly the same parking and loading spaces, provided that
satisfactory legal evidence is presented to the building official in the form
of deeds, leases, or contracts to establish the joint use and that adequate
spaces do exist during peak hours of operation.
   D.   Plan, building permit prerequisite. A plan drawn to scale, indicating
how the off-street parking and loading requirement is to be fulfilled, shall
accompany the request for a design review. The plan shall show all those
elements necessary to indicate that these requirements are being fulfilled and
shall include but not be limited to:
      1.   delineation of individual parking spaces;
      2.   circulation area necessary to serve spaces;
      3.   access to streets, alleys and properties to be served;
      4.   curb cuts;
      5.   dimensions, continuity and substance of screening;
      6.   grading, drainage, surfacing and subgrading details;
      7.   delineations of all structures or other obstacles to parking and
circulation on the site;
      8.   specifications as to signs and bumper guards.
   E.   Restrictions. Required parking spaces shall be available for the
parking of operable passenger automobiles of residents, customers, patrons and
employees only, and shall not be used for storage of vehicles or materials or
for the parking of trucks used in conducting the business or use, and shall not
be rented, leased or assigned to any other person or organization.
   F.   Public street, alley parking spaces. Parking spaces in public streets
or alleys shall not be eligible as fulfilling any part of the parking
requirements.
   G.   Minimum space requirements. Off-street parking shall be provided
according to the following standards, regardless of the zone in which the use,
building, establishment or development is located. Any building, establishment
or development may elect to define separate use areas which together total the
gross floor area as defined in this code and apply these standards separately
to those uses.

13.06.170   Access and egress.
   A.   General provisions. The following requirements and standards shall not
apply in any instance where subdivision rules or standards of the city are
applicable. The following provisions and standards are intended to apply where
no present or discernible purpose exists to partition one or more parcels of
land in contravention or violation of the subdivision laws of the State of
Alaska and city ordinances:
      1.   The provisions and maintenance of access and egress stipulated in
this title are continuing requirements for the use of any structure or parcel
of real property in the city. No development approval shall be issued until
scale plans are presented that show how access and egress requirement is to be
fulfilled. Should the owner or occupant of a lot or building change the use to
which the lot or building is put, thereby increasing access and egress
requirements, it is unlawful and a violation of this title to begin or maintain
such altered use until the required increase in access and egress is provided;
      2.   Unless the required access and egress is dedicated to public use by
permanent easement or deed, the planning commission shall not issue a permit
approval until the city has been presented with satisfactory legal evidence in
the form of deeds, easements, leases, or contracts to establish access and
egress for the duration of the occupancy or use for which access and egress are
required. Copies of the deeds, easements, leases or contracts shall be placed
on permanent file with the city clerk;
      3.   The standards set forth in this title are minimum standards for
access and egress, and may be increased by the planning commission in any
particular instance where the standards provided herein are deemed
insufficient.
   B.   Minimum requirements--residential uses.
      1.   Vehicular access and egress for single family, duplex and mobile
home residential uses shall not be less than the following:

13.06.180   Nonconforming uses.
   A.   Continuation. Subject to the provisions of this section, a
nonconforming structure or use may be continued but shall not be altered or
extended, except as provided herein.
   B.   Reinstatement. Following the procedure set forth in this section, the
planning commission may authorize the reinstatement or resumption of a
discontinued nonconforming use subject to the following limitations:
      1.   If a nonconforming use is discontinued from active use for six
months, it shall not be reinstated or resumed unless specifically approved by
the planning commission;
      2.   If a nonconforming use is changed, it shall be changed only to a use
conforming with the zoning regulations and once changed it shall not be changed
back again to the original nonconforming use;
      3.   If a nonconforming structure or a structure containing a
nonconforming use is destroyed or damaged by any cause to the extent requiring
the discontinuance of the use while effecting repairs, a future structure or
use on the property shall conform to the provisions of this title unless
reinstatement or resumption of the original structure is specifically approved
by the planning commission.
   C.   Alteration. Following the procedure set forth in this section, the
planning commission may authorize the alteration of a nonconforming use or
structure subject to the following limitations:
      1.   A nonconforming use may be permitted to decrease or enlarge up to 20
percent in gross floor area or, in those cases not involving structures, up to
10 percent of land area as existing on July 1, 1981;
      2.   A structure conforming as to use but nonconforming as to setback or
yard may be altered or extended providing the alteration or extension does not
result in a violation of this title.
   E.   Completion of building. Nothing contained in this title shall require
any change in the plans, alteration, construction or designated use of a
building for which a building (land use) permit has been issued and
construction work has commenced prior to July 1, 1981, except that if the
designated use will be nonconforming it shall, for the purpose of this section,
be a discontinued use if not operation within one year of the date of issuance
of the building (land use) permit.
   E.   Unoccupied building. If a building is nonconforming by the standards of
this title and is unoccupied on July 1, 1981, it shall be classified as a
discontinued use and a nonconforming use and can be reinstated or resumed under
the requirements of this section.
   F.   Application for reinstatement or alteration. A request for
reinstatement or enlargement of a nonconforming use may be initiated by a
property owner or his authorized agent by filing an application with the city
clerk.
(Ord. 81-09 (part), 1981)
13.06.190   Conditional uses.
   A.   Approval; procedure; conditions. Following the procedures set forth in
§
13.06.040 of this code, uses designated in this chapter as "conditional uses
permitted" may be permitted or enlarged or altered upon authorization of, after
hearing by the planning commission as provided in §
13.06.020. In granting approval of a conditional use the planning commission
may require, in addition to the regulations and standards expressly specified
in this title, other conditions found necessary to protect the best interests
of the surrounding property or neighborhood or the city as a whole. The
conditions may include requirements increasing the required lot size or yard
dimensions, controlling the location and number of vehicular access points to
the property, increasing street width, increasing the number of off-street
parking or loading spaces required, limiting the number of signs, limiting the
coverage or height of buildings because of obstruction to view or reduction of
light or air to adjacent property, requiring sight-obscuring fencing and
landscaping where necessary to reduce noise or glare or maintain the property
in a character in keeping with the surrounding area, and requirements under
which any future enlargement or alteration of the use shall be reviewed by the
planning commission and new conditions imposed. Change in use, expansion or
contraction of site area, or alteration of structures or uses classified as
conditional existing prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified
herein, shall conform to the regulations pertaining to conditional uses. If the
site is inappropriate for the use requested, the planning commission may deny
approval of the conditional use.
   B.   Application. A request for a conditional use or modification of an
existing conditional use may be initiated by the property owner or his
authorized agent by filing an application with the city clerk. The applicant
shall submit a site plan, drawn to scale, showing the dimensions and
arrangement of the proposed development.
   C.   Expiration when unexercised. If a conditional use is approved by the
planning commission and then is not exercised, it shall expire in one year from
the date of approval if the use has not begun and continual progress toward its
full operation is not in evidence.
   D.   Change in use; effect. When a use is once established in such a way as
to be a permitted use, and not a conditional use and not a nonconforming use,
and thereafter a change in the zoning classification of the land, or a change
in the city's zoning ordinance of 1981, renders the formerly permitted use a
conditional use, the owner of such land shall have all of the rights he would
have had, had the use remained a permitted use, including, but not limited to
the right to expand or contract the use of the property, or alter and
structures.
(Ord. 81-09 (part), 1981)
13.06.200   Variances.
   A.   Granting; planning commission action.  Following the procedures set
forth in §
13.06.040 of this code, the planning commission may authorize variances from
the requirements of this title where it can be shown that, owing to special and
unusual circumstances related to a specific piece of property, the literal
interpretation of this title would cause an undue or unnecessary hardship,
except that no variance shall be granted to allow the use of the property for
purposes not authorized within the zone in which the proposed use would be
located. In granting a variance, the planning commission may attach conditions
which it finds necessary to protect the best interests of the surrounding
property or neighborhood and to otherwise achieve the purposes of this chapter.
   B.   Granting; conditions. No variance shall be granted by the planning
commission unless it can be shown that all of the following conditions exist:
      1.   Exceptional or extraordinary conditions applying to the property
that do not apply generally to other properties in the same zone or vicinity,
which conditions are a result of lot size or shape, topography, or other
circumstances over which the applicant has no control;
      2.   The variance is necessary for the preservation of a property right
of the applicant substantially the same as is possessed by owners of other
property in the same zone or vicinity;
      3.   The authorization of the variance shall not be materially
detrimental to the purposes of this chapter, be injurious to property in the
zone or vicinity in which the property is located, or be otherwise detrimental
to the objectives of any city development plan or policy;
      4.   The variance requested is the minimum variance from the provisions
and standards of this title which will alleviate the hardship.
   C.   Application. A request for a variance may be initiated by a property
owner or his authorized agent by filing an application with the city clerk upon
forms prescribed for the purpose. The application shall be accompanied by a
site plan, drawn to scale, showing the dimensions and arrangement of the
proposed development.
   D.   Expiration when unexercised. When the planning commission (or in the
case of an appeal, the city council) approves a variance the rights thereby
given to the applicant shall continue to exist and to belong to the applicant
or any other owner of the land for a period of one year from the date of final
approval. If, at the expiration of one year from the date of approval,
construction of the structure or initiation of the use giving rise to the need
for the variance has not begun, the rights given by the variance approval shall
terminate without further action by the city, the planning commission, or the
city council. Such rights shall also terminate at or after the expiration of
one year from approval if, though commenced within one year, construction
ceases and is not resumed within 60 days.
(Ord. 81-09 (part), 1981)
13.06.210   Temporary uses.  
   A.   Authorization. Following the procedure for variances as set forth in §
13.06.200, the planning commission, either directly or by delegation to the
mayor, may authorize temporary uses of property or the use of temporary
structures on a property.
   The planning commission shall attach such conditions to the temporary or
emergency use of the property as is necessary to assure discontinuance thereof
in accordance with the terms of the authorization, to protect the interests of
the surrounding property and neighborhood, and to assure substantial compliance
with the purposes of this title.
   B.   Issuance authorities. The levels of authority for issuance of temporary
use permits shall be as follows:
      1.   Planning commission and/or mayor.  The planning commission, either
directly or by delegation of authority to the city administrator, may issue
temporary permits which shall terminate within 60 days from the date of
issuance;
      2.   Planning commission. The planning commission may issue temporary
permits to terminate within six months from the date of issuance. The planning
commission is empowered, either directly or by delegation of authority to the
city administrator, in circumstances of emergency and where consistent with the
public interest, to grant a permit for immediate temporary occupancy or use of
the premises, if consistent with the conditions hereinafter set forth, to
continue during the time a petition may be pending before the planning
commission as herein provided;
      3.   City council. Applications for temporary use permits to continue in
effect for a longer period than six months from date of issuance may be granted
only by the city council, following the procedure for conditional uses as set
forth in §
13.06.190.
   C.   Required conditions. Applicants for temporary use permits shall submit
such evidence as may be required to enable the planning commission or the city
administrator to make a finding that one or more of the following conditions
exists:
      1.   That the need for the temporary use or occupancy permit is the
direct result of a casualty loss, such as fire, windstorm, flood or other
severe damage by the elements to a preexisting structure or facility previously
occupied by the applicant on the premises for which the permit is sought;
      2.   That the applicant has been evicted within 60 days of the date of
his application from a pre-existing occupancy of the premises for which the
permit is sought as a result of condemnation proceedings by a public authority,
or eviction by abatement of nuisance proceedings, or by determination of a
public body or court having jurisdiction that the continued occupancy of the
facilities previously occupied constitutes a nuisance or is unsafe for
continued use;
      3.   Loss of leasehold occupancy rights by the applicant due to
unforeseeable circumstances or other hardship beyond the foresight and control
of the applicant;
      4.   That the purpose for which the temporary use or occupancy permit is
sought is compatible with or incident to the completion of the basic purpose
for which the land is being developed, and the duration of such use is limited
by the period of development, such as temporary construction trailer on site.
