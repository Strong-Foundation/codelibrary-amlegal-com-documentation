checks, or plus signs that are clearly spaced in the square opposite the name
of the candidate the voter desires to designate.
   (b)   A failure to properly mark a ballot as to one or more candidates does
not itself invalidate the entire ballot.
   (c)   If a voter marks fewer names than there are persons to be elected to

   (d)   If a voter marks more names than there are persons to be elected to
the office, the votes for candidates for that office shall not be counted.
   (e)   The mark shall be counted only if it is mostly inside the square
provided, or touching the square so as to indicate clearly that the voter
intended the particular square to be designated.
   (f)   Improper marks on the ballot shall not be counted and shall not
invalidate marks for candidates made properly.
   (g)   An erasure or correction invalidates only that section of the ballot
in which it appears.
   (h)   Write-in votes are not invalidated by writing in the name of a
candidate whose name is printed on the ballot unless the election board
determines, on the basis of other evidence, that the ballot was marked for the
purpose of identifying the ballot.
   (i)   Write-in votes are not invalidated if the voter fails to mark the
square provided if in the opinion of the judges the voter intended to vote for
the person whose name was written in as a write-in vote.
§ 4.60.060. CHALLENGING VOTERS.
   An election judge and election clerk shall challenge, or other qualified
voter in the city may challenge a person attempting to vote if the challenger
has good reason to believe that the challenged person is not qualified to vote.
All challenges shall be made in writing explaining the reason for the
challenge. Before voting, a challenged person shall take an oath and sign an
affidavit provided by the City Clerk attesting to the fact he meets all the
qualifications of a voter; that he is not disqualified, and that he has not
already voted at the same election. He shall also state the place from which he
came immediately before living in the city and the length of time of his
residence in the former place. After the challenged person has taken the oath
and signed the affidavit, the person may vote. If the challenged person refuses
to take the oath or sign the affidavit, the person may not vote.
§ 4.60.070. QUESTIONING A VOTER'S BALLOT.
   If his registration is in question, a voter shall be allowed to vote and any
election official shall consider the ballot a questioned ballot.
§ 4.60.080. CHALLENGED BALLOTS DISPOSITION.

voter will insert the ballot into a small blank envelope and seal it. This
envelope shall be placed in the signed oath and affidavit envelope. The oath

counted to determine whether the total number of ballots is equal to the total
number of persons who voted as indicated in the original registry. If the
number of ballots drawn from the ballot box does not match the number of
ballots indicated by the registration book, the ballots shall be recounted
until the election board finds that there is an unexplained error or that the
number of ballots cast matches the number of ballots indicated by the
registration tally. If a discrepancy is determined to exist between the number
of votes cast and the registration tally, it shall be explained in detail on
the tally paper or papers, and the explanation shall be signed by the election
judges.
   (b)   The counting of the ballots shall be public. The opening of the ballot
box at the close of the polls shall be in full view of any persons present. The
public may not be excluded from the area in which the ballots are counted.
However, the chairman of the election board shall not permit anyone present to
interfere in any way or to distract the appointed officials from their duties,
and no one other than appointed election officials may handle the ballots. The
judges shall remove the ballots from the ballot box one by one, and tally the
number of votes for each candidate and for or against each issue. The ballots
shall be inspected for disqualifying marks or defects. The election judges
shall cause the vote tally to be continued without adjournment until the count
is complete.
§ 4.60.100. DEFECTIVE AND UNUSED BALLOTS.
   If a voter shall mark more names than there are persons to be elected to any
office, or if for any reason it is impossible to determine from his ballot any
voter's choice for any office to be filled, the ballot shall not be counted as
to that office or issue. A failure to properly mark a ballot as to one or more
candidates or issues shall not invalidate the entire ballot. No ballot shall be
rejected if the election board can determine the person for whom the voter
intended to vote and the office intended to be chosen by the voter. Ballots not
counted shall be marked "Defective" on the back, and ballots to which objection
has been made shall be marked "Objected To" on the back. An explanation of the
defect or objection shall be written on the back of the ballot and signed by
the chairman. All such ballots shall be enclosed in an envelope marked on the
outside with the label: "defective and objected ballots." All ballots not voted
on and all ballots spoiled by voters shall be returned by the judges to the
City Clerk, who shall give a receipt for them and keep a record of the number
and condition of ballots returned to him, indicating when and by which judge
each was returned.
§ 4.60.110. ELECTION CERTIFICATE.
   After the votes are announced and counted a certificate will be drawn
stating the number of votes each person has received, and designating the
office for which he has run. The poll lists and tallies will be attached to the
certificate. The certificate will be signed by the election judges. The
registration index, original register, tallies or tally papers, oath of judges,
oaths of voters, other papers, and the certificate will be placed in an
envelope. The envelope will be marked "election returns" and delivered to the
City Clerk.

election board shall take regarding any question which arises during the course
of the election.

§ 6.10.120. PLACE OF SALE, RENTAL OR SERVICE.
   (a)   Unless otherwise provided in this chapter, a taxable sale of tangible
or intangible property occurs if any significant element of the making or
performance of the sale agreement occurs within the city during the tax year,
including, but not limited to, the offer to sell or buy and its receipt, the
acceptance of the offer or the agreement to buy or sell, the delivery of any
part of the property to either the buyer or to any person transporting the
property to the buyer, transfer of title and possession to the buyer or to any
person transporting the property to the buyer and the payment or partial
payment for the property.
   (b)   Unless otherwise provided in this chapter, a taxable rental occurs if
any significant element of the making or performance of the rental agreement
occurs within the city during the tax year, including, but not limited to, the
completion of the execution of the rental agreement, the making of an oral
rental agreement, the delivery of the fully executed rental agreement, the
transfer or relinquishment of possession of the rented space or property to the

regardless of when the rental agreement was made or the use or possession of
the space or property began and shall be taxable for the portion of the rental

§ 6.10.125. AGREEMENTS FOR PAYMENTS IN LIEU OF TAX.

payments in lieu of sales and use taxes from persons who otherwise would be
required either to pay or to collect and remit sales and use taxes in
connection with the construction of an improvement to real property for a tax
exempt entity provided:
   (a)   The person contracting with the tax exempt entity agrees in writing to
a specific reduction in the contract price for construction of the improvement
to real property; and
   (b)   The price reduction is reflected in a signed modification of the
construction contract made after bids have been opened; and
   (c)   The tax exempt entity agrees to recognize the city as contributing to
the project an amount of money equal to the agreed price reduction.

§ 6.10.260. DISCONTINUATION SALE OR TRANSFER OF BUSINESS - FINAL RETURN.
   If any seller, or buyer or other person collecting sales taxes discontinues,
sells, leases or otherwise disposes of his or her business, a final sales tax
return must be filed within 15 days after the date of the close of business or
disposition. Any purchaser, lessee, or other successor-in-interest shall
withhold, and hold in trust for the benefit of the city, a sufficient portion
of the purchase price or compensation to cover the amount of the tax required
to be collected under this chapter, plus any penalties and interest as may be
due on unpaid taxes to the city until such time as the former owner has
produced a receipt from the city showing that all tax obligations imposed by
this chapter have been paid through the date of transfer. The purchaser, lessee
or other transferee or successor-in-interest of a business required to collect
the tax under this chapter who fails to withhold the amount required by this
section shall be liable for all taxes required to have been collected by the
former owner but not remitted to the city and shall be liable for all penalties
and interest on such unpaid taxes and on late or unfiled returns.

§ 6.10.265. SELLER NOT TO ASSUME TAX. 
   A seller shall not advertise or hold out or state to the public or to any
buyer, directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof imposed by this
chapter will be assumed or absorbed by the seller or that it will not be added
to the sales price or that it will be refunded or assumed, in whole or in part,
except that a seafood processor may if it sees fit elect to absorb such tax, in
which case it may so advise the seller. The seller, or in the case of the buyer
of raw seafood products, the buyer, shall, whenever feasible separately state
the tax to the buyer or a seller on each taxable transaction. When not feasible
to state separately, the seller or buyer shall prominently display a sign
provided by the city indicating the imposition of the tax. Nothing in this
section shall prevent the buyer of raw seafood products from assuming the tax;
however, if the buyer of raw seafood products assumes the tax, the buyer shall
separately state the tax on a receipt the amount of tax assumed on each taxable
transaction.
(Ord. 93-4, passed 12-8-92; Am. Ord. 00-02, passed 6-15-00)
§ 6.10.270. TAXATION OF INSTALLMENT SALES. 
   When a sale is made on an installment basis, the sales tax shall be
collected from the down payment, or if none, from the first installment, or, if
the installment or down payment is less than the tax, then from as many
installments as are necessary to pay the tax. Nothing in this section extends
the due date for remittance to the city of the full amount of tax due to the
city as a result of the sale.
(Ord. 93-4, passed 12-8-92; Am. Ord. 00-02, passed 6-15-00)
§ 6.10.275. REFUNDS FOR OVERPAYMENT OF TAXES. 
   If, in payment of taxes legally imposed, a remittance by a taxpayer through
error or otherwise exceeds the amount due, and the city, on audit of the
account in question, is satisfied that this is the case, the city shall refund
the excess to the taxpayer. The city shall not pay interest on any refunds made
under this section. A claim for refund under this section must be made within
one year after the due date of the tax or be forever barred. In the case of a
buyer of raw seafood products who has assumed the tax, the city shall not
refund the overpayment but shall apply the overpayment to credit on account,
unless the payment was the final remittance of the buyer. In no event shall a
refund be made to the person collecting the tax unless the person provides a
method for paying the refund to the taxpayer. In the event the taxpayer's claim
for an overpayment refund is denied, the taxpayer may appeal the decision in
the manner set forth in §
6.10.310.
(Ord. 93-4, passed 12-8-92; Am. Ord. 00-02, passed 6-15-00)
§ 6.10.280. DUTY TO KEEP BOOKS; INVESTIGATION.
   (a)   Every seller, or in the case of raw fish products, every buyer,
engaged in activity subject to this chapter shall keep and preserve suitable
records of all sales or taxable purchases made by him and such other books or
accounts as may be necessary to determine the amount of tax which he is obliged
to collect. Every seller or in the case of raw seafood products, every buyer,
shall preserve suitable records of sales and taxable purchases for a period of
three years from the date of the return reporting such sales, and shall
preserve for a period of three years all invoices of goods, and merchandise
purchased for resale, and all such other books, invoices, and records as may be
necessary to accurately determine the amount of taxes which the seller was
obliged to collect under this chapter or, in the case of buyers of raw seafood
products, which the buyer was obliged to pay under this chapter.
   (b)   For the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of a return, or for
the purpose of determining the amount of tax collected or which should have
been collected by any seller, or paid by a buyer of raw fish products, the
Mayor may conduct investigations and hold hearings concerning any matters
covered by this chapter and may examine any relevant books, papers, records, or
memoranda of any tax collector and may require the attendance of any seller or
buyer, or any officer or employee of a seller or buyer at a hearing. Upon
request of the Mayor, subpoenas may be issued by the City Council or a court to
compel the production of any such documents or the attendance of any such
person required in the course of such an investigation or hearing.

   (b)   Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to prohibit the
delivery to a person, or his duly authorized representative, of a copy of any
return or report filed by him, nor to prohibit the furnishing of information on
a reciprocal basis or otherwise, to other agencies of the state, the Aleutians
East Borough or the United States concerned with the enforcement of any tax

PROTEST; ENFORCEMENT
§ 6.10.310. PROTEST OF TAX.
   (a)   A seller, or in the case of a buyer of raw seafood products, the
buyer, shall determine in the first instance whether the sale is exempt under
this chapter. In the event a determination of exemption is made without the
presentation of a certificate of exemption as provided for in §
6.10.240, a statement setting forth the nature of the transaction and the
reason for exemption must be filed with the city. It shall not be necessary for
the tax to be collected if the statement is filed. However, if a seller, or, in
the case of the buyer of raw seafood products, the buyer, incorrectly
determines that a sale is exempt, then the person responsible for the
collecting of this tax is, together with the taxpayer, jointly, liable to the
city for the tax and any applicable penalties and interest.
   (b)   In the event that the seller, or, in the case of raw seafood products,
the buyer, determines that a transaction is not exempt, but the buyer or in the
case of raw seafood products, the seller, believes the transaction to be
exempt, then the person collecting the tax will furnish to the buyer, or in the
case of raw seafood products, the seller, a form of certificate of protest
supplied by the city which shall be filled out by the person protesting the tax
and delivered to the person collecting the tax with payment of the disputed
tax. The certificate shall show the respective names and addresses of the
seller and the buyer, the nature of the claim for exemption and such other
information as may be prescribed by the city. In the event certificate of
protest forms are not available then a statement setting forth the names and
addresses of the seller and the buyer and the nature of the claim for exemption
shall be sufficient if filed with payment of the disputed tax.
   (c)   The seller, or, in the case of raw seafood products, the buyer, shall
file certificates of protest with the city no later than 30 days after receipt,
together with any additional information which the seller or buyer believes to
be pertinent to the determination of the issue.
   (d)   The City Clerk will rule in each protest and send to the buyer, or in
the case of a buyer of raw seafood products, the seller and the buyer, a notice
that the protest has been allowed or disallowed within 30 days of receipt of
the certificate by the city. If the claim has been allowed, a refund will be
remitted with the notice. In no event will a refund be remitted for a claim of
exemption unless a certificate of protest has been filed with the payment of
the tax. Refunds shall only be made to the person paying the tax and the city
shall not pay interest on refunds.
   (e)   In the event that a claim is disallowed, the buyer or in the case of
raw seafood products, the seller or the buyer, may petition the Mayor for
review. A petition for review must be filed within 15 days of receipt of notice
of the disallowed protest. The decision of the Mayor on review shall be
rendered in writing and shall be final, subject to judicial review where
applicable.
(Ord. 93-4, passed 12-8-92; Am. Ord. 00-02, passed 6-15-00)
§ 6.10.320. OMISSIONS AND CIVIL PENALTIES.
   (a)   Failure to file a return; delinquent payment. A person who fails to
file a return as required under this chapter or who fails to remit all the
taxes due the city by that person shall pay a penalty. The penalty shall be an
amount equal to 5% of the taxes due if no return is filed and 5% of the
delinquency if a return is filed without remitting all the taxes due. The
penalty shall be imposed for each month or part of a month during which the
delinquency or failure to file exists up to a maximum of 25% of the taxes due
or 25% of the delinquency, whichever is applicable, or both if both are
applicable; provided, the total penalty for a single calendar month shall not
exceed $1,000. The filing of an incomplete return shall be treated as the
filing of no return. The penalties are in addition to penalties that may result
from violations of other provisions of this chapter.
   (b)   Interest. Interest at the rate of 12% per annum shall be paid on all
amounts due the city that are not received by the city as required under this
chapter, except interest does not accrue on penalties.
   (c)   Statement of tax. A person required to collect the tax under this
chapter, who fails to separately state the tax due on the transaction, shall be
subject to a penalty equal to the amount of the tax due on the sale or $25.00,
whichever is greater.
   (d)   Failure to produce records for inspection. A failure of or refusal of
a person required to collect the tax under this chapter, to produce records or
to allow the inspection at reasonable times of records required by this chapter
to be kept subjects the person to a penalty of $300 or three times the amount
of any deficiency found or estimated to have occurred by the city, whichever is
greater.
   (e)   Forced filing. In the event that the city is unable to ascertain the
amount of tax due to be remitted by a collector by reason of the failure of the
collector to keep accurate books, failure to allow inspection, failure to file
a return, filing an incomplete return, or falsification of records, the city
may make an estimate of the tax due based on the information available to it,
and file a return for such person. Notice of the forced filing and a copy of
the estimated return filed by the city shall be furnished to the collector
together with a notice that the collector is required to file a correct return
and pay all taxes, penalties, and interest due. The city will require the
collector filing a corrected return to provide sufficient proof to support the
corrected return. If the collector has not filed a corrected return with
sufficient proof, together with all taxes due with the return, within 30 days
of the date of mailing the notice of the forced filing to the collector, then
the amount of tax shown on the forced filing is presumed correct and is
delinquent. If upon a subsequent audit or investigation or for any other reason
it is determined that a greater amount was due, the collector is liable for
payment fo the additional amount, plus applicable penalties and interest.
   (f)   Loss of records. A seller, or in the case of raw fish products, the
buyer, shall immediately notify the city of any fire, theft, or other casualty
which would prevent complying with this chapter. Such casualty constitutes a
defense to any penalty provided in this chapter, but does not excuse the seller
from liability for taxes due. Accidental loss of funds or records is not a
defense hereunder.
   (g)   Maintenance of suits. Nothing in this section shall prevent the city
from filing and maintaining an action to collect any taxes collected or which
should have been collected in addition to any penalty assessed.
   (h)   Determination of civil penalties. The amount of any civil penalty
imposed under this chapter shall be determined and stated in writing by the
City Clerk after providing the tax payer or tax collector reasonable notice and
an opportunity to be heard concerning the imposition of the penalty. If a
penalty is imposed, a person obligated to pay the penalty may petition the
Mayor for review. A petition for review must be filed within 15 days of receipt
of notice of the penalty. The decision fo the Mayor on review shall be rendered
in writing and shall be final, subject to judicial review where applicable.

administration costs, there is hereby created a lien on the real property and

provide notice of the lien to the tax payer or tax collector, or both, and
record notice of the lien in the office of the Recorder for the district in
which the property is located. When recorded, the lien has priority over all

§ 11.20.010. HARBORMASTER APPROVAL REQUIRED.
   (a)   Approval from the Harbormaster shall be obtained before using any boat
harbor facilities.
   (b)   Boats unable to get underway on their own power or that are derelict
are not allowed to use boat harbor facilities unless it is shown to the
harbormaster’s satisfaction that another vessel capable of tending to the
stricken vessel is chartered to standby and render assistance if necessary or,
if when on land, that such boat will not be abandoned in the boat flarbor
facility or on property situated elsewhere that is owned by the city.
   (c)   Aircraft, boathouses, floats, scows, rafts, pile drivers, and other
cumbersome equipment or structures whether on land, floating, or otherwise, and
any boat, vessel or structure which is or may become or create a fire hazard or
otherwise become a menace or nuisance to safety or the public welfare may be
denied use of boat harbor facilities.
(Ord. 2011-05, passed 6-14-11)
§ 11.20.020. OPEN MOORING SPACES.
   (a)   Open mooring spaces are made available for use on a "first-come-first-
served" basis by transient vessels upon the Harbormaster’s approval. No Boat or
boat owner shall have any exclusive right to open mooring space. Use of the
open mooring spaces on a "first-come-first-served" basis shall be subject to
priorities given by the Harbormaster to boats arriving to load or unload.
   (b)   All boats mooring in open mooring spaces shall always and
continuously, without fail, maintain on board such crew members as are
necessary to care for the boat and to move the boat immediately on order of the
Harbormaster, provided however that exceptions from this requirement may be
made by the Harbormaster upon the approval of an alternative method of ensuring
capability to relocate the boat without delay.
(Ord. 2011-05, passed 6-14-11)
§ 11.20.030. RESERVED MOORING SPACES.
   (a)   A limited number of mooring spaces shall be available for reservation
on an annual basis beginning July 1 of each year and ending on June 30 of the
following year. Any boat owner desiring to guarantee the availability of a
mooring space may apply to the Harbormaster for assignment of a reserved
mooring space.
   (b)   Should there be more boat owners requesting annual reserved mooring
spaces than there are reserved mooring spaces then boat owners applying to
renew mooring reservations shall be given priority over boat owners who did not
have reserved mooring the previous year. Remaining unassigned mooring spaces
will be assigned by lottery.
   (c)   Before any reserved mooring space may be assigned, the annual fee
therefore as set forth in
Chapter 4 of this Title shall be paid. Failure to make the required payment in
the time required forfeits assignment of the reserved mooring space.
   (d)   The assignment of a reserved mooring space does not imply nor
guarantee the exclusive right to use such space or any other property right
therein. Assignment of a reserved mooring space to a boat is a guarantee that
the reserved space will be made available for the use of the Boat assigned
thereto during those periods when the boat is within the boat harbor
facilities. Assigned mooring spaces may not be sublet or transferred except in
the event that the Boat owner disposes of the boat assigned to the reserved
mooring space and replaces the boat with another boat of similar size. The
Harbormaster may reassign a boat to a different reserved mooring space.
   (e)   Assignment to a reserved mooring space may be canceled by the boat
owner of the boat assigned to the mooring space by giving written notice the
Harbormaster at least 30 days before the intended cancellation date. Upon
effective cancellation any prepaid mooring will be refunded based on the number
of full months for which the mooring space was reserved.
(Ord. 2011-05, passed 6-14-11)
§ 11.20.040. TEMORARY USE OF RESERVED MOORING SPACES.
   (a)   The Harbormaster may temporarily assign any boat to a reserved mooring
space when the boat assigned to the reserved mooring space is away from the
harbor area. All boats temporarily mooring in reserved mooring spaces shall
always and continuously, without fail, maintain on board such crew members as
are necessary to care for the boat and to move the boat immediately on order of
the Harbormaster, provided however that exceptions from this requirement may be
made by the Harbormaster upon the approval of an alternative method of ensuring
capability to relocate the temporarily assigned boat without delay. In the
event that a boat temporarily moored in a reserved mooring space cannot be
moved by its crew in time to open the space for the boat assigned thereto the
Harbormaster is authorized to do so at the risk and expense of the owner of the
temporarily assigned boat.
   (b)   In order to facilitate the maximum use of boat harbor facilities,
notice shall be radioed into the Harbormaster by the owner of a boat assigned
to a reserved mooring space after the boat leaves the space. This notice shall
specify when the Harbormaster should expect the boat to return to the boat
harbor facilities. At least 30 minutes before a boat assigned to a reserved
mooring space returns to the boat harbor facilities notice shall be radioed
into the Harbormaster giving an estimated time of arrival.
   (c)   In the event that a boat assigned a reserved mooring space returns to
an occupied reserved mooring space, the Harbormaster shall be contacted and the
Harbormaster shall promptly cause the boat occupying the reserved mooring space
to be moved.
(Ord. 2011-05, passed 6-14-11)
§ 11.20.050. BOAT HARBOR LOADING AREAS.
   (a)   All of the approaches and posted areas of any float in the boat harbor
areas are to be used by the general public, without charge, for the purpose of
loading and unloading of supplies, equipment and stores. For the purposes of
this subsection, the general public shall not include any shipper, common
carrier, barge operator, or any other person operating commercially in the boat
harbor facilities except for commercial fishermen loading or unloading
supplies.
   (b)   Designated loading areas are intended for the active loading and
unloading of boats. No boat shall remain moored in such designated areas for
any period longer than is necessary for loading or unloading or for longer than
the maximum period posted, unless authorized by the Harbormaster. The owner of
any boat tying up to the City Dock or either wall as a place of temporary
moorage shall pay four times the transient moorage fee calculated on a daily
basis until the boat is moved from this space.

§ 11.40.075. BOAT HARBOR ELECTRICITY SERVICE.
   (a)   Availability. Electrical service is available to users of the Sand
Point Harbor subject to the provisions of this chapter and such regulations or
requirements as the Harbormaster or City Council may implement, as well as any
conditions imposed or required by the local power supplier. Electrical service
is also available for dry storage users subject to the same provisions as are
applicable to harbor users.
   (b)   User's responsibility. City-owned electrical connections are provided
as a service to harbor users only. Users are responsible for installing and
maintaining his or her electrical wiring and equipment in accordance with
applicable local, state, and national electric and building codes. The city is
not responsible for any damages caused by any user's use of the electrical
connections. The city retains full authority to interpret and enforce the
provisions of this chapter to facilitate the best interests of the harbor and
other users.
   (c)   Application required. Any person or entity wishing to utilize
electrical service at the harbor or upland dry storage area must first complete
an electrical service application and pay the appropriate service fee and
deposit as set forth in the Schedule of Fees.
   (d)   Deposit requirements. All non-transient users utilizing harbor
electrical facilities must submit a deposit for electrical service prior to
commencing service, subject to the requirements of this section. The amount of
the deposit is shown in the Schedule of Fees.
      (1)   A separate deposit is required for every point of delivery or
meter.
      (2)   The harbor will issue the applicant a written receipt for the
deposit and provide the applicant with a copy of this section (§
11.40.075) of the City Code. Failure to receive a receipt or copy of this
section shall not relieve users from the requirements of the Code or other
applicable laws.
      (3)   The harbor will refund a deposit for electric service within 90
days of the date an applicant meets either of the following requirements:
         a.   The applicant has previously established a good payment record
with the harbor; or
         b.   The applicant provides a letter or other written verification
from the electric utility that last provided comparable service to the
applicant stating that the applicant was not delinquent in payment for the last
12 consecutive months of service at the prior location.
      (4)   General provision for refund of deposits.
         a.   The harbor will not require a user to produce a deposit receipt
in order to receive a refund of the deposit that is reflected on the harbor's
books.
         b.   For deposits not returned earlier under the provisions of §
11.40.075(d)(3), the harbor will refund deposits within 30 days after the
earlier of the date.
            1.   The user completes 12 months of continuous service during
which the user was not past due in payment, has not been delinquent in the last
six months, and is not past due at the end of the 12 months; or
            2.   The user terminates service. In this case the deposit amount
refunded will be the amount which exceeds any balance due the harbor.
      (5)   Adjustment of deposit amounts. The harbor may institute or adjust a
deposit for an established user who becomes delinquent in payment. The amount
of any new deposit required will be consistent with the above provisions.
   (e)   Costs of electrical service to transient and long-term users.
      (1)   Transient users. Transient harbor users are any users who:
         a.   Have not established long-term electricity service accounts;
         b.   Do not maintain a reserved slip in the Sand Point Harbor; or
         c.   Accesses electrical service in the upland dry storage area.
         Transient users are required to pay the daily electrical service fee
in advance of each day in which such users intend to receive electrical
service. The rate for electricity supplied to transient users is equal to the
rate established by the local power supplier, including any cost adjustments.
Transient users shall be charged for the actual amount of electrical power
consumed, with a minimum fee as set forth in the Schedule of Fees. Any user
whose actual power usage exceeds the amount of the service fee shall be charged
the actual cost of electrical usage. All transient users must report to the
harbor office immediately upon arrival at the harbor and prior to accessing
electrical service in order to apply for service. Transient users must check
out prior to departure. Any transient user with an outstanding or past due fee
shall not be allowed to access electrical service until the unpaid amount is
paid along with any required penalty.
      (2)   Long-term users. Long-term users are required to pay for all
electricity used, plus the monthly electrical service fee set forth in the
Schedule of Fees. The rate for electricity supplied to long-term users is equal
to the rate established by the local power supplier, including any cost
adjustments. Usage charges for users will be based on the readings of meters
installed by the harbor and read monthly by harbor staff. The harbor will
separately bill for each meter at a user's location. Readings from two or more
meters will not be combined. The monthly electrical service fee is charged on a
per slip basis for every month the slip is reserved by the user regardless of
whether any power is used in a given month.
   (f)   Billing and collection practices for long-term users.
      (1)   Harbor staff shall attempt to read every meter monthly. If for any
reason staff is unable to read a meter during the scheduled meter reading
cycle, or if the meter is determined not to have accurately recorded the amount
of electricity used, consumption may be estimated based upon the user's usage
during the same month of the previous year or the amount of usage during the
preceding month or months. Every estimated billing will contain a statement
that the billing is based on an estimated meter reading.
      (2)   The harbor will bill monthly for services rendered. Charges for
service shall commence when the service is installed and energized.
      (3)   Bills are due and payable on the billing date.
      (4)   A bill will be considered past due if not paid within 25 days after
the billing date. Failure to pay a bill within 40 days of the billing date may
lead to loss of service until the bill is paid.
      (5)   Unless otherwise agreed to by both the user and the harbor,
payments will be applied to amounts owed in the same order as the amounts
became due.
      (6)   The harbor will impose a late charge of 1% of the past due amount
until the amount is paid in full.
      (7)   Users may pay their bills for electric service in person at the
harbor office or by mail.
      (8)   Failure to receive a bill that has been properly addressed and
mailed to the user does not prevent the bill from becoming past due or
delinquent or excuse the user's responsibility for payment. If a user does not
receive a monthly bill at the time of the month the user normally receives a
bill, the user should immediately notify the harbor.
      (9)   A user who tenders a non-sufficient funds check is still obligated
to pay the harbor under the original terms of the bill. A fee as set forth in
the Schedule of Fees will be charged for all dishonored checks. Any person who
has tendered two dishonored checks to the harbor within a twelve-month period
may be denied the privilege of paying by personal check.
      (10)   If a single application for service is made by two or more
individuals together, the harbor may collect the full amount owed from any one
of the applicants.
      (11)   If a user requests the harbor to disconnect service, the user is
still responsible for all services up to the later of the requested
disconnection date or three working days after the user places the request.
      (12)   Users with delinquent accounts may arrange for deferred payment
agreements with harbor staff in special circumstances.
   (g)   Meter testing. At the request of the user the harbor will test any
meter if the user agrees to pay the meter testing charge shown in the Schedule
of Fees under the conditions described below.
      (1)   If the meter is found to over- or under-register by more than 2%
and there is no evidence of meter or electric service tampering by the user,
the harbor will not charge the user for the meter test.
      (2)   Otherwise, the harbor will charge the user for any meter test
performed at the request of the user.
   (h)   Meter errors. Any billing errors caused by a failed or malfunctioning
meter shall be corrected according to this section.
      (1)   Meter errors involving over-registration. If a meter in service is
tested and found to have over-registered the amount of power delivered by more
than 2%, the harbor will recalculate the bills for service from the known date
of error and will make a refund or credit for the entire over-registered amount
if it exceeds $5. If the beginning date of error is unknown, the harbor will
refund or credit the most recent user of record for the billed error for the
period since the meter was last tested, not to exceed six months, or the period
during which the most recent user of record received service through the meter,
whichever period is less.
      (2)   Meter errors involving under-registration. If the meter is tested
and found to have under-registered the amount of energy or power delivered, the
harbor may calculate the amount owed as provided in §
11.40.075(f)(1).
   (i)   Make-up bills. Any make-up bill provided to a user to require payment
for service inadvertently not billed or service that was not billed as a result
of an estimated billing is subject to the following restrictions:
      (1)   The initial make-up bill must be issued within six months after
provision of the previously unbilled service.
      (2)   The period for payment of the make-up bill may, at the option of
the user, extend at least as long as the period during which the excess amount
accrued.
   (j)   Disconnection of service.
      (1)   The harbor may disconnect service to a user without advance written
notice for any of the following reasons:
         a.   An immediate hazard exists which threatens the safety or health
of the user or the general population or the harbor's personnel or facilities.
         b.   The harbor has evidence of meter tampering or fraud by the users.
         c.   A user has failed to comply with curtailment procedures imposed
by the harbor during emergency supply shortages.
         d.   A user resells electric service.
      (2)   The harbor may terminate electrical service for any of the
following reasons after providing written notice by personal service or
certified mail at least ten days prior to termination:
         a.   A user has failed to pay for harbor service within 40 days after
initial billing date and the user has not entered into a deferred payment
agreement with the harbor.
         b.   A user has failed to meet or maintain the harbor's deposit
requirements.
         c.   A user has breached a deferred payment agreement.
         d.   A user has knowingly and continually failed to provide the harbor
with reasonable access to its meter, equipment, or property.
         e.   Disconnection is required in order for the harbor to comply with
an order or regulation of a governmental agency with proper jurisdiction.
      (3)   Any user whose service is terminated for any of the reasons listed
in this subsection shall be required to pay the disconnect and connection fee
set forth in the Schedule of Fees unless the termination did not occur as a
result of any fault, action, or inaction, of the user.
   (k)   Disconnect fee. Any long-term user wishing to terminate service or
transfer service to a different responsible user must file a written notice of
termination with the harbor office. The user is still responsible for all
services up to the later of the requested disconnection date or three working
days after the customer places the request. Long-term users terminating service
shall be required to pay a disconnection fee as set forth in the Schedule of
Fees.

(Ord. 2011-05, passed 6-14-11)
§ 11.50.030. NOTICE.
   (a)   Contents. Prior to impounding any boat or other property, the
Harbormaster shall prepare a written notice of intent to impound. The notice
shall contain:
      (1)   A description of the boat or property. In the case of a boat, this
shall include the name and any official registration number of the boat;
      (2)   The name and address, if known, of the owner, operator, master or
managing agent;
      (3)   The location of the boat or property at the time the notice is
sent;
      (4)   The basis or reason for impoundment; and
      (5)   The reserved moorage space, if any, which will be forfeited if a
boat is impounded.
   (b)   Distribution. At least 20 days before impoundment the notice of intent
to impound shall be:
      (1)   Mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the last
known address of the last known owner, master, and/or managing agent of the
boat or property;
      (2)   Mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, to any creditor
with a recorded security interest or lien in the boat or property; and
      (3)   Posted on the boat or on the property, in the harbormaster’s
office, and in the United States Post Office.
(Ord. 2011-05, passed 6-14-11)
§ 11.50.040. HEARING.
   (a)   Demand for hearing. The owner, master or managing agent or any other
person in lawful possession of a boat or property proposed for impoundment has
the right to a pre-impoundment administrative hearing to determine whether
there is cause to impound. Any such person desiring a hearing shall file a
written demand with the City Clerk within ten days after mailing and posting of
the notice of intent to impound.
   (b)   Hearing procedure. The hearing shall be conducted within 72 hours of
receipt of a written demand therefore from the person seeking the hearing,
unless such person waives the right to a speedy hearing. Saturdays, Sundays and
city holidays are to be excluded from the calculation of the 72 hour period.
The hearing officer shall be the City Administrator or his or her designee
except that the Harbormaster is disqualified from serving as the hearing
officer. The sole issue before the hearing officer shall be whether there is
cause to impound the boat or property in question. CAUSE TO IMPOUND shall mean
such a state of facts as would lead a reasonable person exercising ordinary
prudence to believe there are grounds for impounding the boat or property. The
hearing officer shall conduct the hearing in an informal manner and shall not
be bound by technical rules of evidence. The person demanding the hearing shall
have the burden of establishing that cause to impound the boat or property does
not exist. The Harbormaster may rebut the boat owner’s case by presenting
evidence to establish there is cause to impound the boat or property. Failure
of the owner, operator, master or managing agent to request or attend a
scheduled pre-impoundment hearing shall be deemed a waiver of the right to such
a hearing.
(Ord. 2011-05, passed 6-14-11)
§ 11.50.050. DECISION.
   At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall prepare a short
written decision. The hearing officer shall only determine that as to the boat
or property in question, either that there is cause to impound or that there is
no such cause. A copy of the decision shall be provided to all persons to which
notice of impoundment was sent to. The hearing officer’s decision shall in no
way affect any criminal proceedings in connection with the impoundment in
question, and any criminal charges involved in such proceedings may only be
challenged in the appropriate court. The decision of the hearing officer is
final.
(Ord. 2011-05, passed 6-14-11)
§ 11.50.060. IMPOUNDMENT.
   In the event the hearing officer determines there is cause to impound, the
Harbormaster may proceed immediately with impoundment. The Harbormaster may
impound a boat by chaining it to a work float or other suitable object or
otherwise immobilizing it, removing it or having it removed from the water and
placing it in public or commercial storage, with all expenses of haul out and
storage and an impound fee to be borne by the boat owner. Property may be
impounded in a similar manner as may be appropriate for the type of property
involved. At any time prior to the sale of an impounded boat or properly, the
owner, operator, master or managing agent, creditor, secured party may redeem
the boat or property by a cash payment of all fees against the boat or property
including interest and costs.
(Ord. 2011-05, passed 6-14-11)
§ 11.50.070. NOTICE OF SALE.
   (a)   Contents. Prior to the sale of any impounded boat or property, the
Harbormaster shall prepare a written notice of sale of the boat or property.
The notice shall contain:

shall include the name and any official registration number of the boat;
      (2)   The name and address, if known, of the owner, operator, master or
managing agent;
      (3)   The location of the boat or property at the time the notice is
sent; and
      (4)   The basis or reason for impoundment.
   (b)   Distribution. At least 20 days before the sale the notice of intent to
sell shall be:

known address of the last known owner, master, and/or managing agent of the
boat or property;

with a recorded security interest or lien in the Boat or property; and
      (3)   Posted on the boat or on the property, in the harbormaster’s
office, and in a United States Post Office.
(Ord. 2011-05, passed 6-14-11)
§ 11.50.080. SALE.
   (a)   Bids. The minimum acceptable bid shall be a sum equal to the fees
against the boat or property, including interest and costs to be paid in cash
at the time of sale or within 24 hours thereafter. The proceeds of such sale
shall be first applied to the cost of sale, then to interest, then to fees
accrued, and the balance, if any, shall be held in trust by the city for the
former owner of the boat or property to claim. If such balance is not claimed
within two years, the balance shall be paid to the State of Alaska if required
by Alaska Statute; otherwise the balance shall be forfeited to the city. Upon
sale being made, the city shall make and deliver its bill of sale, without
warranty or any kind, conveying the boat or property to the buyer.
   (b)   No bids. If at the public sale there are no acceptable bids, the city
may destroy, sell at a private sale, or otherwise dispose of the boat or
property. Such disposition shall be without liability to the owner, master or
managing agent, person In possession of the boat or property, or lien holder or
creditor.

   (a)   Overview. The application for a subdivision or major partition has two
main steps: the preliminary plat and the final plat. The preliminary plat must
be approved before the final plat application can be considered. Approval of
the preliminary plat shall not constitute final acceptance of the plat or the
map of the proposed major partition for recording. (Once the preliminary plat
is approved, the city may require changes on the plat that are necessary to
show compliance with the conditions of approval.)
   (b)   Preliminary consultation. The subdivider may and is encouraged to at
any time prior to submitting a preliminary plat, request a meeting with the
platting board for the purposes of a preliminary consultation.
   (c)   Application procedures.
      (1)   Prior to submitting a final plat of a subdivision a subdivider
shall submit a preliminary plat in order that general agreement may be reached
on layout arrangement of roads, public or private utilities and lots before a
final plat is prepared.

all necessary information is provided. Deficient documents shall be returned to
the subdivider with a request to correct the deficiency. No preliminary plat
shall be considered to be filed and accepted by the city if it does not meet
the submittal requirements of this section, as determined by the administrative
officer. The applicant may appeal any decision of the administrative officer to
the platting board.
      (4)   The City Clerk shall, within three days after the submittal of the
preliminary plat, transmit a copy of the plat and all accompanying materials
to: (1) the Public Works Director, (2) the City Fire Department, and (3) the

board chairman shall attach to the plat a statement of the reasons for such
action and return it to the subdivider. In any case, a notation of the action
taken, and requisite reasons therefor, shall be entered in the records of the
platting board.
      (7)   Approval of the preliminary plat by the platting board shall not
constitute final acceptance of the subdivision by the platting board.
      (8)   A preliminary plat shall be considered to have been abandoned by
the subdivider if he has not submitted a final plat for such subdivision within
18 months from the date he submitted the preliminary plat. The subdivider may
be granted an extension of this time by the platting board for reasons deemed
adequate by the platting board. Any plat not submitted for final approval
within the period of time set forth herein shall be null and void, and the
subdivider shall be required to submit a new preliminary plat.

§ 13.05.080. VARIANCES.
   (a)   The platting board may authorize a variance from these regulations
when, in its opinion, undue hardship may result from strict compliance. For the
purposes of this section, the term "hardship" shall refer to conditions where
reasonable development of a tract is rendered impossible because of a physical
limitation but shall not include financial hardship.
   (b)   In granting any variance the platting board shall prescribe only
conditions that it deems necessary to or desirable for the public interest. In
making its findings, the platting board shall take into account the nature of
the proposed use of land, the existing use of land in the vicinity, the number
of persons to reside or work in the proposed subdivision and the probable
effect of the proposed subdivision upon traffic conditions in the vicinity. No
variance shall be granted unless the platting board finds that there are
special physical conditions affecting the property such that the strict
application of the provisions of this section would deprive the applicant of
the reasonable use of his land.
   (c)   In approving variances, the platting board may require such conditions
as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the standards
or requirements of this section.
   (d)   The application procedure for filing a variance request and proof of
need shall adhere to the following:
      (1)   Application for exception. Application for a variance may be made
with respect to a proposed subdivision, proposed major or minor partitions, by
filing a request for same with the City Clerk. Such application shall be
supported by a full disclosure of all material facts upon which petitioner
proposes to rely in seeking such variance, including a copy of map or
preliminary plat of the proposed partitioning or subdivision;
      (2)   Findings required. A variance from the standards of this title
shall not be granted by the Planning Commission unless the Commission finds
from the facts presented at the hearing all of the following:
         a.   that there are special circumstances or conditions affecting the
property which are unusual and peculiar to the lands or development of the
project involved as compared to other lands similarly situated;
         b.   that the variance sought is necessary and the minimum required
for the preservation and protection of a substantial property interest of the
petitioner to the degree that extraordinary hardship would result from strict
compliance to the particular subdivision, major or minor partitioning involved;
         c.   that the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the
public health, safety or welfare, but will be consistent therewith and shall
not be injurious to the rights of other property owners in the near vicinity
nor constitute a departure from or be in violation of the Comprehensive Plan of
the City of Sand Point;
         d.   That the applicant's proposal for variance in a subdivision or
major or minor land partitioning conforms to and is consistent with all other
regulatory requirements of this title and
Chapter 6 of this code, that adequate provision is made for traffic
circulation, recreation, open spaces and similar factors, and that variance
sought has been considered by other public agencies concerned with fire
protection, sewer, water and other utilities, as well as environmental factors,
and the written comments of such regulatory bodies as applicable is submitted
as part of the record.

in accordance with the provisions of this section. A person who knowingly
violates this requirement is guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punishable by
a fine of not more than $500 for each lot or parcel transferred, sold, or
leased.
   (c)   No person may record a plat or seek to have a plat recorded unless it
bears the approval of the platting board. A person who knowingly violates this
requirement is punishable upon conviction by a fine of not more than $500.

to the provisions of this title. Failure to obtain a required permit or a
violation of any condition of a permit required by this title is unlawful and a
minor offense punishable by a fine as provided in §
1.10.085 of this code, or if no fine is there established, a fine not to exceed
$500.
   (b)   Annexations. Regulations applicable to an area prior to annexation to
the city shall continue to apply and shall be enforced by the city until a zone
change for the area has been adopted by the City Council. The city may, in an
ordinance annexing property to the city or ratifying annexation action of the
Local Boundary Commission, direct the Planning Commission to conduct such
proceedings as may be necessary to conform the zoning and land use of the
property to the requirements of the city's zoning code and Comprehensive Plan.
   (c)   Authorization of similar uses. The Planning Commission may rule that a
use, not specifically named in the allowed uses of a zone, shall be included
among the allowed uses if the use is of the same general type and is similar to
the allowed uses. However, this section does not authorize the inclusion of a
use specifically listed in another zone.
   (d)   Accessory uses. Accessory uses shall comply with all requirements for
the principal use except where specifically modified by this title and shall
comply with the following limitations:

parking or loading area which is required by this title for one use be used as
the lot area, yard, or other open space or off-street parking or loading area
requirement for any other use except as provided in §§
13.06.200(a) and
13.06.170.
   (g)   Public nuisances prohibited. No building, structure, or land shall be

height and density as may be prescribed by the Planning Commission.
   (i)   Lot size exceptions. If on July 1, 1981, a lot, or the aggregate of
contiguous lots held in a single ownership, has an area or dimension which does

on a side. Except for occasional tree trunks and poles, these areas shall be
maintained without sight obstruction of any kind for a vertical distance of
between three and eight feet aboveground.
      (2)   To permit or afford better light, air and vision on more heavily
traveled streets and on streets of substandard width, to protect the streets,.
and to have,the location of structures compatible with the need for the
eventual widening of streets, a yard shall be provided abutting streets and
portions of streets hereinafter named which shall be the number of feet set
forth below in the right- hand column, measured at right angles to the
centerline of the street and, unless otherwise described, measured from the fee

   (k)   Increased or altered street uses.
      (1)   When the City Council, the Planning Commission, or the design
review board has before it any application for a Band use decision, the
decision making body shall, before granting any chance or permit, consider
whether the application asks for a change or permit for the alteration or
development of property in such a way as to create any likelihood of increased
or altered use of any street adjacent to the property. For the purposes of this
section, it shall be presumed that any new development of land upon which no
structure had previously been built, any alteration of an existing structure
adding 25% or more to the floor space of the structure and any change in the
commercial use of land to a use the decision making body finds to generate more
traffic presents such a likelihood.
      (2)   Upon making the finding of a likelihood of increased or altered
street use, the decision making body shall consider whether the dedicated
street width at the location is adequate at the time to accommodate both the
existing traffic and such traffic as the street may be expected to be required
to carry in the foreseeable future, and in making the determination the
decision making body shall consider the planned street width as set forth in
the Comprehensive Plan, and this code, and shall not regard as satisfactory any
width less that planned width, except upon a showing of extraordinary
circumstances making it clear that the planned street width is inappropriate.
      (3)   The decision making body shall then require that the owner of the
land which is subject which is subject of the pending application do whichever
of the following seems to the decision making body to best meet the need of the
community.
         a.   dedicate as much land as to required to make up the necessary
road width; or
         b.   improve the amount of road to standard, as the decision making
body may deem necessary; or
         c.   improve to standard one-half the width of the road for as great a
distance as the decision making body may deem necessary.
      (4)   Except in cases in which immediate whole-street improvement is
required, the decision making body shall also require that the applicant enter
into an agreement with the city by which the applicant shall agree that he will
not remonstrate against a local improvement district street improvement project
upon the affected street, and the city shall agree that the applicant shall be
given credit against his portion of the costs of the street improvement project
for the land dedicated and for the cost of improving any portion of the street
actually improved to standard by the applicant.
      (5)   Permits for the construction of single-family dwellings shall be
issued only after the city has examined the application for building permit to
determine whether the proposed dwelling is to be built upon a street improved
to the city standards. The permit shall be given the endorsement of the city,
indicating that the street upon which the dwelling is to be built has been so
improved. In the event the street upon which the dwelling is to be built has
not been improved to city standards, then the endorsement of the city shall be
given only upon the applicant's dedicating the land necessary to make up the
planned width of the street as set forth in division (2) of this section and
signing the agreement not to remonstrate, as described in division (3) of this
section, or if the applicant chooses and the city's staff acquiesces, upon the
applicant's making the appropriate whole-street or half-street improvement.
   (l)   Building height limit exceptions.
      (1)   The following types of structures or structural parts are not
subject to the building height limitations of this title: chimneys, tanks,
church spires, domes, monuments, fire and hose towers, observation towers,
masts, aerials, cooling towers, transmission towers, smokestacks, flagpoles,
radio and television towers, and other similar projections.
      (2)   Building heights in any zone may be increased as a conditional use
to a maximum permitted height of 75 feet provided that the total floor area of
the buildings does not exceed the area requirement of the zone (if any) and
provided that in residential zones all yards shall have a minimum depth of not
less than three quarters the height of the principal structure.
   (m)   Underground Placement of Utility Distribution Lines.
      (1)   Except as provided in division (1) and (2) of this section, all
newly installed or relocated utility distribution lines shall be placed
underground.
      (2)   A new utility distribution line may be placed overhead when
necessary immediately to restore service interrupted by accident or damage by
flood, fire, earthquake, or weather; provided that the utility distribution
line shall be placed underground within 12 months thereafter.
      (3)   A utility distribution line or service connection may be placed on
the surface of frozen ground, provided that it is placed underground within 12
months thereafter.
   (n)   Variances.
      (1)   The City Council may grant a variance from §
13.05.020(m) when the council finds any of the following:
         a.   Placing a utility distribution line underground would cause an
excessive adverse environmental impact;
         b.   Placing a utility distribution line underground would threaten
public health and safety, because the placement cannot be shown to comply with
acceptable technical standards for safety; or
         c.   Placing a utility distribution line underground in an
environmentally sound and safe manner would cost more than three times the cost
of placing the line overhead, where the applicant demonstrates the relative
cost to the satisfaction of the Council. Notwithstanding the cost of placing a
utility distribution line underground, the City Council may deny a variance
request of public policy considerations outweigh the cost of placing the line
underground.
         d.   The City Council may grant a variance when the Council finds that
the utility distribution line is being placed overhead temporarily for one of
the following reasons:
            1.   To provide service when weather conditions do not allow
excavation for underground placement;
            2.   A permanent location for underground placement is not
available because of construction in progress; or
            3.   To provide service to a temporary use or structure.
      A variance issued under this division shall expire within two years of
its issuance.
   (o)    Definitions.

potential financial burdens arising from flood damage loss, to preserve natural
drainage ways, or on steep slopes from encroaching uses which threaten to
adversely affect the property rights of citizens of the community, personal
safety and the public health by unnatural conditions arising from upstream or
downstream flood levels. The sensitive lands areas has for its purpose the

in, along, or across or projecting into any channel, watercourse, or floodplain
drainageway areas which may impede, retard or change the direction of the flow
of water, either by itself or that is placed where the flow of water might
carry the same downstream to the damage of health or property;
      REGULATORY FLOOD. The flood used to define the outer boundary lines of
the floodplain area. The maximum flood predicted to occur within 100 years;

application for special permit in form prescribed by the Planning Department of
the city shall be supported by the following additional data or information to
enable the Planning Commission to adequately determine whether the proposed use
is located in the sensitive lands area and if so, whether the proposal, if
granted, will conform to the purposes and guidelines as set forth in this
section.
      (1)   Plans drawn to scale, submitted in triplicate as prepared by a
registered professional engineer with experience in hydraulic and hydrologic
principles and processes showing the nature, location, dimensions, elevations
and topography of the site; the location of existing and proposed structures
located upon the site, existing and proposed fill areas, and the relationship
of these to the location of the stream channel;
      (2)   Any documentation, photographs, water marks, and similar evidence
offered in support of the claim that the site or area in question lies above
high water as defined by the regulatory flood;
      (3)   If it is determined by the Planning Commission that the proposed
use is within the sensitive lands area as herein defined, the applicant shall
furnish such further information, data and evidence as may be reasonably
available to support the granting of the petition in accordance with the
following guidelines, in the absence of which the petition shall be denied by
the Planning Commission:
         a.   Proposed improvements will not have a serious tendency to change
the terrain during future use such as to cause a compounding of flood hazards
or destruction of property to thereby seriously interfere with the intent and
purposes of the regulations;
         b.   No structure, fill; storage or other uses shall be permitted
which alone or in combination with existing or future uses would materially
reduce the capacity of the flood-plain area or sensitive land areas to create a
present or foreseeable hazard to the public health, safety and general welfare.
      The city shall reserve the right to retain a registered professional
engineer with experience in hydraulic principles and processes for the purpose
of reviewing evidence submitted in support of any application for special use
permits pursuant to this section.

occupancy shall be at least one and one-half feet above the flood surface
elevation;
      (3)   The lower portions of any structure shall be flood-proofed or
otherwise protected from significant damage by inundation to a minimum flood
surface elevation one and one-half feet above the surface elevation of the
regulatory flood;
      (4)   The design of substructures and structural members of all buildings
shall be designed to withstand expected water pressures and velocities as well
as minimize flood risk conditions.
   (h)   Appeal to City Council. An appeal from any decision of the Planning
Commission may be filed with the City Clerk for hearing by the City Council as
provided by §
13.06.030.
   (i)   Construction time period; Extension. If substantial construction or
development has not taken place within one year from the date of approval of
the general development plan and program, the Planning Commission shall review
the district at a public hearing to determine whether or not its continuation
in whole or in part is in the public interest, and if found not to be, shall
recommend to the City Council that the permit of approval on the property be
removed. The City Council, at the request of the applicant, may grant an
extension of time if justifiable.
(Ord. 81-12, passed 6-3-81)
§ 13.06.160. STORMWATER DETENTION.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to reduce the harmful effects
of stormwater runoff on streambeds, banks, parklands, private properties and
other areas in the city by requiring the installation of on-site stormwater
detention facilities as properties are developed within the city.
   (b)   Applicability. The provisions of this section shall apply to any work
for which a subdivision plat, a site development plan and/or building permit is
required and shall apply to any work requiring a permit for which other changes
in the land use are made which change the runoff characteristics. The
provisions of this section shall apply in all uses under the zoning and
subdivision ordinances of the city.
   (c)   Manual of operation. The Planning Commission shall prepare and set
forth, in the form of a manual, guidelines for compliance with the standards of
this section. The manual will assist those persons who are required to comply
with the provisions of the stormwater detention ordinance and may be secured
from the city and shall be followed unless otherwise specified. The Planning
Commission shall act as the agent for control and final approval of submitted
plats and site development plans, subject to appeal to the City Council.
   (d)   Plan submittal and modification of requirements. Site, subdivision,
and building plans submitted to the Planning Commission will include plans and
design calculations for each detention facility proposed. Detention facilities
shall be designed so that they do not become health or safety hazards. In the
case that exact compliance with the ordinance would result in the inability to
use the land as it is permitted to be used by zoning and subdivision
classifications, changes may be allowed to justify the interpretation and
administration of the ordinance as long as that interpretation and
administration remains within the parameters of the intent of the ordinance and
the adverse effect of the stormwater storage is insubstantial. In the event the
applicant disagrees with Planning Commission interpretation, he (she) may
appeal to the City Council for a determination. Upon determination, the City
Council may modify or vary the requirements of the ordinance to the extent
necessary to allow some degree of permitted land use to exist in such a way as
to maintain the maximum stormwater detention system.
   (e)   Improvements on developed or undeveloped areas.
      (1)   Whenever any work for which a subdivision plat, site development
plan or a building permit is required is undertaken on a developed site or
previously undeveloped site then the person or persons undertaking the work
shall provide stormwater storage sufficient to store the difference between the
runoff from a 25 year storm on the site as fully developed and the runoff
produced by a five-year storm from the site in its undeveloped state until such
time as the required storage has been fully utilized. "Work" as used herein
shall not include remodeling which has no impact on stormwater runoff.
      (2)   Whenever any work is undertaken on a site which is located within
the 100-year floodplain, the person or persons undertakings the work shall
comply with the requirements of the city's sensitive lands ordinance; and in no
case shall anything in this stormwater detention section be so construed or
permitted as to allow a negative impact upon or impairment of the intended
effectiveness of the city's sensitive lands ordinance. The City Council is
vested with the authority to interpret and rule therein.
   (f)   Maintenance of system required. All plans submitted for stormwater
detention systems shall describe adequate procedures of normal maintenance for
the detention system. Any failure of the stormwater system, due to inadequate
maintenance, shall be the responsibility of the owner of the property on which
the detention system is located. Where a stormwater system is part of a
subdivision, normal procedures shall be utilized for City Council acceptance
for operation and maintenance of the system. It shall also be the property
owner's responsibility to remedy any inadequate maintenance that results in the
failure of the system. Periodic inspection by the Administrative Official will
be made to determine conformity with the ordinance. The submittal of plans for
such a system or the purchase of property on which such a system is located
shall be deemed an acceptance of responsibility for maintenance of the system.

use on the property shall conform to the provisions of this title unless
reinstatement or resumption of the original structure is specifically approved
by the Planning Commission.
   (c)   Alteration. Following the procedure set forth in this section, the
Planning Commission may authorize the alteration of a nonconforming use or
structure subject to the following limitations:
      (1)   A nonconforming use may be permitted to decrease or enlarge up to
20% in gross floor area or, in those cases not involving structures, up to 10%
of land area as existing on July 1, 1981;
      (2)   A structure conforming as to use but nonconforming as to setback or
yard may be altered or extended providing the alteration or extension does not

any change in the plans, alteration, construction or designated use of a
building for which a building permit has been issued and construction work has
commenced prior to July 1, 1981, except that if the designated use will be
nonconforming it shall, for the purpose of this section, be a discontinued use
if not in operation within one year of the date of issuance of the building
permit.
   (e)   Unoccupied building. If a building is nonconforming by the standards

discontinued use and a nonconforming use and can be reinstated or resumed under
the requirements of this section.
   (f)   Application for reinstatement or alteration. A request for
reinstatement or enlargement of a nonconforming use may be initiated by a
property owner or his authorized agent by filing an application with the City
Clerk.

§ 13.06.210. CONDITIONAL USES.
   (a)   Approval; Procedure; Conditions. Following the procedures set forth in
§
13.06.040 of this code, uses designated in this title as "conditional uses
permitted" may be permitted or enlarged or altered upon authorization of, after
hearing by the Planning Commission as provided in §
13.06.040. In granting approval of a conditional use the Planning Commission
may require, in addition to the regulations and standards expressly specified
in this title, other conditions found necessary to protect the best interests
of the surrounding property or neighborhood or the city as a whole. The
conditions may include requirements increasing the required lot size or yard
dimensions, controlling the location and number of vehicular access points to
the property, increasing street width, increasing the number of off-street
parking or loading spaces required, limiting the number of signs, limiting the
coverage or height of buildings because of obstruction to view or reduction of
light or air to adjacent property, requiring sight-obscuring fencing and
landscaping where necessary to reduce noise or glare or maintain the property
in a character in keeping with the surrounding area, and requirements under
which any future enlargement or alteration of the use shall be reviewed by the
Planning Commission and new conditions imposed. Change in use, expansion or
contraction of site area, or alteration of structures or uses classified as
conditional existing prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified
herein, shall conform to the regulations pertaining to conditional uses. If the
site is inappropriate for the use requested, the Planning Commission may deny
approval of the conditional use.
   (b)   Application. A request for a conditional use or modification of an
existing conditional use may be initiated by the property owner or his
authorized agent by filing an application with the City Clerk. The applicant
shall submit a site plan, drawn to scale, showing the dimensions and
arrangement of the proposed development.
   (c)   Expiration when unexercised. If a conditional use is approved by the
Planning Commission and then is not exercised, it shall expire in one year from
the date of approval if the use has not begun and continual progress toward its
full operation is not in evidence.
   (d)   Change in use; effect. When a use is once established in such a way as
to be a permitted use, and not a conditional use and not a nonconforming use,
and thereafter a change in the zoning classification of the land, or a change
in the city's zoning ordinance of 1981, renders the formerly permitted use a
conditional use, the owner of such land shall have all of the rights he would
have had, had the use remained a permitted use, including, but not limited to
the right to expand or contract the use of the property, or alter any
structures.
(Ord. 81-12, passed 6-3-81)
§ 13.06.220. VARIANCES.
   (a)   Granting; Planning Commission action. Following the procedures set
forth in §
13.06.040 of this code, the Planning Commission may authorize variances from
the requirements of this title where it can be shown that, owing to special and
unusual circumstances related to a specific piece of property, the literal
interpretation of this title would cause an undue or unnecessary hardship,
except that no variance shall be granted to allow the use of the property for
purposes not authorized within the zone in which the proposed use would be
located. In granting a variance, the Planning Commission may attach conditions
which it finds necessary to protect the best interests of the surrounding
property or neighborhood and to otherwise achieve the purposes of this title.
   (b)   Granting; conditions. No variance shall be granted by the Planning
Commission unless it can be shown that all of the following conditions exist:
      (1)   Exceptional or extraordinary conditions applying to the property
that do not apply generally to other properties in the same zone or vicinity,
which conditions are a result of lot size or shape, topography, or other
circumstances over which the applicant has no control;
      (2)   The variance is necessary for the preservation of a property right
of the applicant substantially the same as is possessed by owners of other
property in the same zone or vicinity;
      (3)   The authorization of the variance shall not be materially
detrimental to the purposes of this title, be injurious to property in the zone
or vicinity in which the property is located, or be otherwise detrimental to
the objectives of any city development plan or policy;
      (4)   The variance requested is the minimum variance from the provisions
and standards of this title which will alleviate the hardship.
   (c)   Application. A request for a variance may be initiated by a property
owner or his authorized agent by filing an application with the City Clerk upon
forms prescribed for the purpose. The application shall be accompanied by a
site plan, drawn to scale, showing the dimensions and arrangement of the
proposed development.
   (d)   Expiration when unexercised. When the Planning Commission (or in the
case of an appeal, the City Council) approves a variance the rights thereby
given to the applicant shall continue to exist and to belong to the applicant
or any other owner of the land for a period of one year from the date of final
approval. If, at the expiration of one year from the date of approval,
construction of the structure or initiation of the use giving rise to the need
for the variance has not begun, the rights given by the variance approval shall
terminate without further action by the city, the Planning Commission, or the
City Council. Such rights shall also terminate at or after the expiration of
one year from approval if, though commenced within one year, construction
ceases and is not resumed within 60 days.

temporary structures on a property.
      The Planning Commission shall attach such conditions to the temporary or
emergency use of the property as is necessary to assure discontinuance thereof
in accordance with the terms of the authorization, to protect the interests of
the surrounding property and neighborhood, and to assure substantial compliance
with the purposes of this title.
   (b)   Issuance authorities. The levels of authority for issuance of
temporary use permits shall be as follows:
      (1)   Planning Commission and/or City Manager. The Planning Commission,

issue temporary permits which shall terminate within 60 days from the date of
issuance;
      (2)   Planning Commission. The Planning Commission may issue temporary
permits to terminate within six months from the date of issuance;
      The Planning Commission is empowered, either directly or by delegation of
authority to the city administrator, in circumstances of emergency and where
consistent with the public interest, to grant a permit for immediate temporary
occupancy or use of the premises, if consistent with the conditions hereinafter
set forth, to continue during the time a petition may be pending before the
Planning Commission as herein provided;
      (3)   City Council. Applications for temporary use permits to continue in
effect for a longer period than six months from date of issuance may be granted
only by the City Council, following the procedure for conditional uses as set
forth in §
13.06.040.
   (c)   Required conditions. Applicants for temporary use permits shall submit
such evidence as may be required to enable the Planning Commission or the city
administrator to make a finding that one-or more of the following conditions
exists:
      (1)   That the need for the temporary use or occupancy permit is the
direct result of a casualty loss, such as fire, windstorm, flood or other
severe damage by the elements to a preexisting structure or facility previously
occupied by the applicant on the premises for which the permit is sought;
      (2)   That the applicant has been evicted within six days of the date of
his application from a preexisting occupancy of the premises for which the
permit is sought as a result of condemnation proceedings by a public authority,
or eviction by abatement of nuisance proceedings, or by determination of a
public body or court having jurisdiction that the continued occupancy of the
facilities previously occupied constitutes a nuisance or is unsafe for
continued use;
      (3)   Loss of leasehold occupancy rights by the applicant due to
unforeseeable circumstances or other hardship beyond the foresight and control
of the applicant;
      (4)   That the purpose for which the temporary use or occupancy permit is
sought is compatible with or incident to the completion of the basic purpose
for which the land is being developed, and the duration of such use is limited
by the period of development, such as temporary construction trailer on site.

or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination
appealed from. To reverse any order, requirements, decision or determination,
