2011)
2.06.102: BASIC PRINCIPLES:
   (1)   State Law Controls: If anything herein is in conflict with state law,
state law shall govern and control.

accordance with these rules, each member has the same rights, privileges and
duties as any other member.
   (6)   Freedom Of Discussion: Members have the right to be heard and to hear
what others have to say about a motion before voting.

PART 2. DUTIES OF CHAIR AND VICE CHAIR
2.06.201: DUTIES OF CHAIR:
The chair, or in the chair's absence the vice chair, shall be in charge of all
proceedings before the public body, and shall take such actions as necessary to
preserve order and the integrity of all proceedings before the public body. The
chair's duties are as follows:
   (1)   Call the public body to order on the day and the hour scheduled and
proceed with the order of business.
   (2)   Announce the business before the public body in the order in which it
is to be acted upon.
   (3)   Receive and submit, all motions and propositions presented by the
members of the public body.
   (4)   Put to vote all questions which are properly moved, or which
necessarily arise in the course of proceedings, and to announce the results of
motions.
   (5)   Inform the public body, when necessary, on any point of order or
practice. In the course of discharge of this duty, the chair shall have the
right to call upon legal counsel for advice.
   (6)   Authenticate by signature, when necessary, or when directed by the
public body, all of the acts, findings and orders, and proceedings of the
public body.
   (7)   Maintain order at the meetings of the public body.

for comments if necessary, set guidelines for public input, and reference
handouts and procedures during meetings.

presentations.
   (10)   Because the chair conducts the meeting, it is common courtesy for the
chair to take a less active role than other members in debates and discussions.

should strive to be the last to speak at the discussion and debate stage.
   (11)   Should not make or second a motion unless he/she is convinced that no
other member will do so. In no event may the mayor make or second a motion.

diligence, have been discovered and produced at the meeting when the matter was
previously voted on by the public body.

decision. The request to reconsider the matter must be made by a member who
voted with the majority.

item entitled "items to be placed on future agendas", the public body will

agenda of the public body. Failure to receive a majority vote will halt the
reconsideration process.

scheduled meeting agenda of the public body unless the public body specifically
votes to set a different schedule for reconsidering the matter. All affected
parties who appeared at and/or participated in the meeting at which the matter

3.12.305: ADVERTISEMENT, REJECTION AND EXTENSION OF BIDS:
   (1)   Advertisement Of Bid:
      (a)   The department head shall provide the purchasing agent with an
appropriate advertisement or description of the item to be advertised so that
the purchasing agent may formulate a bid advertisement. The purchasing agent
shall then, with the concurrence of the city manager, place the advertisement
in a newspaper of general circulation within the city. The request for bid
shall include:
         (i)   A description of the material, supplies, services, personal
property or construction in sufficient detail that prospective bidders should
know what their obligations will be, which description may be made either in
the advertisement itself or by reference to detailed plans and specifications
on file with the purchasing agent;
         (ii)   Deadline for bids to be received;
         (iii)   Time and place for the opening of the bids;
         (iv)   Notification of the city's requirements for a bidder's good
faith deposit, bid bond, or performance bond, as well as proof of liability
insurance and workers' compensation insurance;
         (v)   An announcement that the city may reject all bids, or any part
thereof;
         (vi)   Any other information upon which the bidder must rely in order
to be a responsible bidder.
      (b)   Contracts shall be awarded based on competitive sealed bidding,
except as otherwise provided herein.
      (c)   An invitation for bids shall be issued when a contract is to be
awarded by competitive sealed bidding. The invitation shall include a purchase
description and all contractual terms and conditions applicable to the
procurement.
      (d)   Public notice of the invitation for bids shall be given within a
reasonable time prior to the date set forth therein for the opening of bids.
The notice may include publication in a newspaper of general circulation within
the city within a reasonable time prior to bid opening.
"Reasonable time" for purposes of this chapter, means that a notice of an
invitation for bids shall, prior to the acceptance of a bid, be published at
least once a week for three (3) consecutive weeks in one or more newspapers of
general circulation within the city.
      (e)   Bids shall be opened publicly at the time designated in the
invitation in the presence of one or more witnesses (including the purchasing
agent and the concerned department head when practical) at city hall, or other
place designated in the invitation for bids if use of the city hall is not
available or impracticable.
      (f)   The amount of each bid and any other relevant information specified
in the bid notice, together with the name of each bidder, shall be recorded by
the city recorder at the time the bids are opened. The record and each bid
shall be open to public inspection.
      (g)   Bids shall be unconditionally accepted without alteration or
correction, except as authorized in this chapter.
      (h)   Bids shall be evaluated based on the requirements set forth in the
invitation for bids, which may include criteria to determine acceptability such
as inspection, testing, quality, workmanship, delivery, and suitability for a
particular purpose. Those criteria that will affect the bid price and will be
considered in evaluation for award shall be objectively measurable. The
criteria may include discounts, transportation costs, and total or life cycle
cost. No criteria may be used in bid evaluations that are not set forth in the
invitation for bids.
      (i)   Correction or withdrawal of inadvertently erroneous bids before or
after award, or cancellation of awards or contracts based on such bid mistakes,
shall be permitted in accordance with rules and regulations set out in the bid
notice.
      (j)   After bid opening, no changes in bid prices or other provisions of
bids prejudicial to the interest of the city or fair competition shall be
permitted. Except as otherwise provided by this chapter or rules and
regulations set out in the bid notice, all decisions to permit the correction
or withdrawal of bids or to cancel awards or contracts based on bid mistakes
shall be supported by a written determination made by the city manager or city
council, depending on the value of the bid received, and in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter.
      (k)   The contract shall be awarded with reasonable promptness by written
notice to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder whose bid meets the
requirements and criteria set forth in the invitation for bids. In the event
all bids for a construction project exceed available budgeted funds as
certified by the city recorder and the lowest responsive and responsible bid
does not exceed such funds by more than five percent (5%), the city manager is
authorized, in situations where time or economic considerations preclude
resolicitation of bids of a reduced scope, to negotiate an adjustment of the
bid price, including changes in the bid requirements, with the lowest
responsive and responsible bidder, in order to bring the bid within the amount
of available funds.
      (l)   When it is considered impractical to initially prepare a purchase
description to support an award based on price, an invitation for bids may be
issued requesting the submission of unpriced offers to be followed by an
invitation for bids limited to those bidders whose offers have been qualified
under the criteria set forth in the first solicitation.
   (2)   Rejection Of Bids:
      (a)   An invitation for bids, a request for proposals, or other
solicitation may be canceled, or any or all bids or proposals may be rejected,
in whole or in part, specified in the solicitation, when it is in the best
interests of the city in accordance with rules and regulations set out in the
bid notice or invitation. The reasons for such rejections shall be made part of
the contract or bid file. (Ord. 2006-27, 2006)
      (b)   The city council shall have the authority to reject all bids, parts
of all bids or all bids for any one or more supplies or contractual services
included in the proposed contract, when the lowest responsible bid exceeds
available budgeted funds as certified by the city recorder, or when the public
interest will be served thereby and when permitted by law to do so. When all
bids exceed available budgeted funds and time or economic considerations
preclude resolicitation of work or purchase of a reduced scope or quantity, the
purchasing agent may negotiate an adjustment of the bid price, including
changes in the bid requirements, with the lowest responsible bidder, in order
to bring the low bid within the amount of available funds. (Ord. 2007-20, 2007)
   (3)   Extension Of Bids: The city manager may extend the time for opening of
bids, if in his/her opinion it is in the public interest to do so. Notice of
the extension shall be given to all prospective bidders by the purchasing agent
in such manner as is most practical under the circumstances. Such extension
shall not exceed ten (10) working days. No extension may be granted for the
purpose of qualifying a bid that was delivered after the time advertised for
the original opening.
   (4)   Late Bids: No bids shall be received or accepted at any time
subsequent to the time indicated in the announcement. Any bids delivered by
mail, or any other means, subsequent to the appointed time shall not be opened.
   (5)   Responsible Bidder: The city shall award contracts, which are required
to be let by competitive bidding under this chapter to the lowest responsible
bidder. The city may reject the lowest bid and accept the next lowest bid if
the city determines that the lowest bid was made by a bidder who is not
responsible.
      (a)   The city may consider any or all of the following when determining
whether a bidder is responsible:
         (i)   Whether the bid fully complies with the invitation for bids;
         (ii)   The bidder's financial responsibility;
         (iii)   The bidder's honesty and integrity;
         (iv)   Whether the bidder has the skill and business judgment to
complete the contract;
         (v)   The bidder's experience;
         (vi)   Whether the bidder has the facilities and equipment to complete
the contract;
         (vii)   The bidder's conduct under other contracts, regardless of
whether the contracts were with the city or with other parties;
         (viii)   The quality of the bidder's other work, regardless of whether
the work was performed for the city or for other parties; and
         (ix)   Any other matter bearing on the likelihood that the bidder will
promptly and efficiently perform the contract.
      (b)   If the city determines that the lowest bidder is not responsible,
the city shall notify the bidder in writing that it is rejecting the bidder's
bid. The notice shall also contain a short description of the reasons for the
rejection. (Ord. 2006-27, 2006)
3.12.306: BONDS OF BIDDERS MAY BE REQUIRED:
   (1)   Bidders may be required to supply deposits of good faith, or bonds
with sufficient sureties, in such amounts as shall be deemed adequate and

4.01.102: DECLARATION OF PURPOSE:
The city council finds that the enforcement of the city code and applicable
state codes throughout the city is an important public service. Code
enforcement is vital to the protection of the public health, safety and quality
of life. The city council recognizes that enforcement starts with the drafting
of precise regulations that can be effectively applied in administrative code
enforcement hearings and judicial proceedings. The city council further finds
that a comprehensive code enforcement system that uses a combination of
judicial and administrative remedies is critical to gain compliance with these
regulations. Failure to comply with an administrative code enforcement action

   (3)   The administrative law judge, at the request of any party to the
hearing, may sign subpoenas for witnesses, documents and other evidence where
the attendance of the witness for the admission of evidence is deemed necessary
to decide the issues at the hearing. All costs related to the subpoena,
including witness and mileage fees, shall be borne by the party requesting the
subpoena. Said costs may be recovered by the city from the responsible party
where the administrative law judge finds that a violation existed. The
administrative law judge shall develop policies and procedures relating to the
issuance of subpoenas in administrative code enforcement hearings, including
the form of the subpoena and related costs.
   (4)   The administrative law judge has continuing jurisdiction over the
subject matter of an administrative code enforcement hearing for the purposes
of: granting a continuance; ordering compliance by issuing an administrative
code enforcement order using any remedies available under the law; ensuring
compliance of that order, which includes the right to authorize the city to
enter and abate a violation; modifying an administrative code enforcement
order; or, where extraordinary circumstances exist, granting a new hearing.
   (5)   The administrative law judge may require a responsible person to post
a code enforcement performance bond to ensure compliance with an administrative
code enforcement order. (Ord. 2005-10, 2005)
4.02.508: PROCEDURES AT ADMINISTRATIVE CODE ENFORCEMENT HEARING:
   (1)   Administrative code enforcement hearings are intended to be informal
in nature. Formal rules of evidence and discovery do not apply; however, an
informal exchange of discovery may be required. Any such request shall be in
writing. Failure to request discovery shall not be a basis for a continuance.
Complainant information is protected and shall not be released unless the
complainant is a witness at the hearing. The procedure and format of the
administrative hearing shall follow the procedures promulgated by the
administrative law judge.
   (2)   The city bears the burden of proof at an administrative code
enforcement hearing to establish the existence of a violation of the city code
or applicable state codes. The burden to prove any raised defenses shall be
upon the party raising any such defenses.
   (3)   The standard of proof to be used by the administrative law judge in
deciding the issues at an administrative hearing is whether the preponderance
of the evidence shows that the violations exist.

present evidence in support of his or her case. A written declaration signed
under penalty of perjury may be accepted in lieu of a personal appearance.
   (5)   All administrative enforcement hearings shall be open to the public
and shall be recorded as determined by the city. At the discretion of the
administrative law judge, administrative enforcement hearings may be held at
the location of the violation.

If an attorney will be representing the responsible person at the hearing,
notice of the attorney's name, address and telephone number must be given to
the city at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing. If notice is not given,
the hearing may be continued at the city's request, and all costs of the
continuance assessed to the responsible person.
   (7)   No new hearing shall be granted, unless the administrative law judge
determines that extraordinary circumstances exist which justify a new hearing.
(Ord. 2005-10, 2005)
4.02.509: FAILURE TO ATTEND ADMINISTRATIVE CODE ENFORCEMENT HEARING:
Any party whose property or actions are the subject of any administrative code
enforcement hearing and who fails to appear at the hearing is deemed to have
waived the right to a hearing and will result in a default judgment for the
city; provided, that proper notice of the hearing has been provided. (Ord.
2005-10, 2005)
4.02.510: ADMINISTRATIVE CODE ENFORCEMENT ORDER:
   (1)   A responsible person and the city may enter into a stipulated
agreement, which shall be signed by both parties. Such agreement shall be
entered as the administrative code enforcement order. Entry of such agreement
shall constitute a waiver of the right to an administrative code enforcement
hearing and the right to appeal.
   (2)   After all evidence and testimony are presented, the administrative law
judge shall issue an administrative code enforcement order that affirms,
modifies or rejects the notice or citation. The administrative law judge may
increase or decrease the total amount of civil penalties and costs that are due
pursuant to this title.
   (3)   The administrative law judge may issue an administrative code
enforcement order that requires a responsible person to cease and desist from
violating the city code or applicable state codes and to take any necessary
corrective action.
   (4)   The administrative law judge may order the city to enter the property
and abate all violations, which may include removing animals kept in violation
of the city code.
   (5)   The administrative law judge may revoke a kennel permit, an animal
license, or the right to possess animals as provided in the city code.
   (6)   As part of the administrative code enforcement order, the
administrative law judge may establish specific deadlines for the payment of
civil penalties and costs, and condition the total or partial assessment of
civil penalties on the responsible person's ability to complete compliance by
specified deadlines.
   (7)   The administrative law judge may schedule subsequent review hearings
as may be necessary or as requested by a party to the hearing to ensure
compliance with the administrative code enforcement order.
   (8)   The administrative law judge may order the responsible person to post
a performance bond to ensure compliance with the administrative code
enforcement order.
   (9)   The administrative code enforcement order shall become final on the
date of the signing of the order.
   (10)   The administrative code enforcement order shall be served on all
parties by any one of the methods listed in section
4.01.201 of this title. (Ord. 2005-10, 2005)
4.02.511: FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ADMINISTRATIVE CODE ENFORCEMENT ORDER:
   (1)   It shall be unlawful for any responsible person to fail to comply with
the terms and deadlines set forth in an administrative code enforcement order.
A violation of this section shall be a class B misdemeanor.
   (2)   Upon the failure of the responsible person to comply with the terms
and deadlines set forth in the administrative code enforcement order, the city
may use all appropriate legal means to recover the civil penalties and costs to
obtain compliance. (Ord. 2005-10, 2005)
PART 6. ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT APPEALS
4.02.601: APPEAL OF ADMINISTRATIVE CODE ENFORCEMENT ORDER:
   (1)   Any person adversely affected by an administrative code enforcement
order made in the exercise of the provisions of this title may file a petition
for review to the district court. A petition for review shall be barred unless
it is filed within thirty (30) days from the date of the administrative code
enforcement order.
   (2)   No person may challenge in district court an administrative law
judge's decision until that person has exhausted his or her administrative
remedies.
   (3)   Within one hundred twenty (120) days after filing a petition for
review, the party petitioning for appeal shall request a copy of the record of
the proceedings, including transcripts of hearings when necessary. The
administrative law judge shall not submit copies of files or transcripts to the
reviewing court until the party petitioning for appeal has paid all required
costs. The petitioning party's failure to properly arrange for copies of the
record, or to pay the full costs for the record, within one hundred twenty
(120) days after the petition for review was filed, shall be grounds for
dismissal of the petition.
   (4)   If a transcript of a hearing cannot be prepared because the tape
recording is incomplete or unintelligible, the district court may, in its
discretion, remand the matter to the administrative law judge for a
supplemental proceeding to complete the record. The district court may limit
the scope of the supplemental proceeding to issues that, in the court's
opinion, need to be clarified.
   (5)   The district court's review is limited to the record of the
administrative code enforcement decision that is being appealed. The court
shall not accept nor consider any evidence that is not part of the record of
that decision.
   (6)   The district court shall:
      (a)   Presume that the administrative law judge's decision and orders are
valid;
      (b)   Review the record to determine whether or not the decision or order
was arbitrary, capricious or illegal; and
      (c)   Affirm the administrative code enforcement order if it is supported
by substantial evidence. (Ord. 2005-10, 2005)

   AND ADMINISTRATIVE CODE ENFORCEMENT ORDERS
4.03.101: DECLARATION OF PURPOSE:
The city council finds that there is a need for alternative methods of
enforcement for violations of the city code and applicable state codes that are
found to exist on real property. The city council further finds that an
appropriate method of enforcement for these types of violations is the issuance
and recordation of notices of violation and administrative code enforcement
orders. The procedures established herein shall be in addition to any criminal,

property. (Ord. 2005-10, 2005)
4.03.104: SERVICE OF NOTICE OF RECORDATION:
A notice of the recordation shall be served on the responsible person and the

4.03.105: FAILURE TO REQUEST HEARING:
The failure of any person to file a request for an administrative code
enforcement hearing when served with a notice of violation shall constitute a
waiver of the right to an administrative hearing and shall not affect the
validity of the recorded notice of violation. (Ord. 2005-10, 2005)
4.03.106: NOTICE OF SATISFACTION; PROCEDURES:

      (a)   The city's verification of the claim; or
      (b)   The responsible person's filing of an application for the
conditional use before expiration of the date to correct and said conditional
use is approved by the city. (Ord. 2005-10, 2005)
4.03.205: FAILURE TO PAY PENALTIES:

(including a private contractor) may enter upon private property in a
reasonable manner to abate the ordinance violation as specified in the notice

abating violations, reinspecting properties, title searches, preparing and
serving notices, preparing for hearings, attending hearings, administrative law
judge fees, recording documents, collecting civil penalties and costs, and

otherwise exempt from registration.

5.08.101: PURPOSE:
It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually oriented businesses in
order to promote the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the citizens
of the city, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the
deleterious secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses within the city.
The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing
a limitation or restriction on the content of or reasonable access to any
communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it
is not the intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by
adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the first amendment, or to
deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented
entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of
this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material.

Michigan house committee on ethics and constitutional law, January 12, 2000,

April 28, 2004; and Proponent Testimony - Sexually Oriented Businesses: An
Insider's View, by Carolyn McKenzie, presented to the Ohio house civil and
commercial law committee, April 28, 2004, the city council finds:
   (1)   Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and
unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by unlicensed operators of
the establishments. Further, there is presently no effective mechanism in this
city to make the owners and operators of these establishments responsible for
the activities that occur on their premises.
   (2)   Certain employees of unregulated "sexually oriented businesses"
defined in this chapter as adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher
incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other
establishments.
   (3)   Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at
sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or
semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos or live sex shows.
   (4)   Offering and providing such unregulated space encourages such
activities, which creates unhealthy conditions.
   (5)   Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades and other
sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the
premises of such sexually oriented businesses (or for the purpose of purchasing
or selling illicit drugs).
   (6)   Numerous communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring
in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to, syphilis,
gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes,
hepatitis, salmonella, campylobacter and shigella infections, chlamydia,
mycoplasmal and ureoplasmal infections, trichomoniasis and chancroid.
   (7)   According to research from the Kaiser family foundation, an estimated
six hundred fifty thousand (650,000) to nine hundred thousand (900,000)
Americans are infected with HIV. The number of new HIV infections occurring
each year is now about forty one thousand (41,000). Men and women of all races
are most likely to be infected by sexual contact.
   (8)   Relevant statistics revealed that one thousand six hundred seventy two
(1,672) AIDS cases had been reported in Utah as of January 1, 1999. Utah has
required HIV case reporting since 1989, and shows one thousand five hundred
fifty (1,550) people living with HIV (762) or AIDS (788) in the state.
   (9)   The center for disease control and prevention estimates that as many
as one in three (3) people with HIV do not know they are infected.
   (10)   The number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the
United States reported annually has risen, with thirty three thousand six
hundred thirteen (33,613) cases reported in 1982 and forty five thousand two
hundred (45,200) through November of 1990.
   (11)   The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported
annually remains at a high level, with over five hundred thousand (500,000)
cases being reported in 1990.
   (12)   The surgeon general of the United States in his report of October 22,
1986, has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be
transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to
infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her
newborn.
   (13)   According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection, as
well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts.
See, e.g., findings of U.S. department of health and human services.
   (14)   Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and,
in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of
the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those
activities and maintain those facilities.
   (15)   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in
the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view "adult" oriented
films.
   (16)   The findings noted herein raise substantial governmental concerns.
   (17)   Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics that
should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns.
   (18)   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place
the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the
sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a
heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually
oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety and
welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the city. It
is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual
operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of
the premises and activities occurring therein.
   (19)   Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on
premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in
curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in sexually
oriented businesses.
   (20)   Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep
information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help
reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the
identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from
working in such establishments.
   (21)   The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day to day operation and maintenance of the sexually
oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the
significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in
preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and will prevent the
further secondary effects of dissemination of illegal obscenity, child
pornography, and to minors, materials harmful to them.
   (22)   It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable
diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees
who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who
are likely to be witnesses to such activity.
   (23)   The fact that an applicant for an adult use has been convicted of a
sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may
engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter.
   (24)   The barring of such individuals from employment in sexually oriented
businesses for a specified period of years serves to prevent distribution of
illegal material, to prevent conduct which leads to the transmission of
sexually transmitted diseases, and to preclude the establishment of criminal
enterprises within the city.
   (25)   The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of the
city will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter. (Ord. 2006-36, 2006)

PART 1. GENERAL PROVISIONS
7.11.101: PURPOSE:
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (1)   Protect human life and health;
   (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
floodplains;
   (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
   (7)   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood
area. (Ord. 2008-22, 2009)
7.11.102: METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES:
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following methods:
   (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities;
   (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (3)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
   (4)   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands. (Ord. 2008-22, 2009)
7.11.103: DEFINITIONS:
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used herein shall be
interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this
chapter its most reasonable application.
ALLUVIAL FAN FLOODING: Flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or
similar landform which originates at the apex and is characterized by high
velocity flows; active processes of erosion, sediment transport, and
deposition; and unpredictable flow paths.
APEX: A point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path
of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan
flooding can occur.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING: A designated AO, AH, or VO zone on a community's
flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with a one percent (1%) chance or greater
annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet (3') where a
clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is
characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD: The land in the floodplain within a community
subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
The area may be designated as zone A on the flood hazard boundary map (FHBM).
After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of
the FIRM, zone A usually is refined into zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-99, VO, V1-30,
VE or V.
BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
BASEMENT: Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
CRITICAL FEATURE: An integral and readily identifiable part of a flood
protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire
system would be compromised.
DEVELOPMENT: Any manmade change in improved and unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
ELEVATED BUILDING: A nonbasement building: 1) built, in the case of a building
in zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, and D, to have the top of the
elevated floor, or in the case of a building in zones V1-30, VE, or V, to have
the bottom of the lowest horizontal structure member of the elevated floor
elevated above the ground level by means of pilings, columns (posts and piers),
or shear walls parallel to the floor of the water, and 2) adequately anchored
so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood of
up to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case of zones A1-30, AE, A, A99,
AO, AH, B, C, X, and D, "elevated building" also includes a building elevated
by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient
to facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters. In the case of zones V1-
30, VE, or V, "elevated building" also includes a building otherwise meeting
the definition of "elevated building", even though the lower area is enclosed
by means of breakaway walls if the breakaway walls meet the standards of
section 60.3(e)(5) of the national flood insurance program regulations.
EXISTING CONSTRUCTION: For the purposes of determining rates, structures for
which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the
FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing
construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures".
EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.
EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: The preparation
of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of
utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the
pouring of concrete pads).
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM): An official map of a community, on which the
federal emergency management agency has delineated both the areas of special
flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.
FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY: The official report provided by the federal emergency
management agency. The report contains flood profiles, water surface elevation
of the base flood, as well as the flood boundary-floodway map.
FLOOD OR FLOODING: A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
   (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters.
   (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
FLOOD PROTECTION SYSTEM: Those physical structural works for which funds have
been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed
specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas
within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the
depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal
barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying
works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards.
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT: The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including, but not limited to,
emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management
regulations.
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS: Zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations,
building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a
floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance), and
other applications of police power. The term describes such state or local
regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the
purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction.
FLOODPLAIN OR FLOOD PRONE AREA: Any land area susceptible to being inundated by
water from any source (see definition of Flood Or Flooding).
FLOODPROOFING: Any combination of structural and nonstructural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities,
structures and their contents.
FLOODWAY (REGULATORY FLOODWAY): The channel of a river or other watercourse and
the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base
flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a
designated height.
FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE: A use which cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term
includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the
loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and shipbuilding and ship repair
facilities, but does not include long term storage or related manufacturing
facilities.
HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE: The highest natural elevation of the ground surface
prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.
HISTORIC STRUCTURE: Any structure that is:
   (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the department of interior) or preliminarily determined
by the secretary of the interior as meeting the requirements for individual
listing on the national register;
   (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the secretary of the interior
as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic
district or a district preliminarily determined by the secretary to qualify as
a registered historic district;
   (3)   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states
with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the secretary
of interior; or
   (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified
either:
      (a)   By an approved state program as determined by the secretary of the
interior; or
      (b)   Directly by the secretary of the interior in states without
approved programs.
LEVEE: A manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control,
or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
LEVEE SYSTEM: A flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees,
and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are
constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking or vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable nonelevation design requirement of section 60.3 of the national
flood insurance program regulations.
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure transportable in one or more sections, which is
built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".
MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land
divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
MEAN SEA LEVEL: For purposes of the national flood insurance program, the
national geodetic vertical datum (NGVD) of 1929, or other datum, to which base
flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are
referenced.
NEW CONSTRUCTION: For the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures
for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date
of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes
any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management
purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain
management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE: A vehicle which is:
   (1)   Built on a single chassis;
   (2)   Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projections;
   (3)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty
truck; and
   (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
START OF CONSTRUCTION: For other than new construction or substantial
improvements under the coastal barrier resources act (Pub. L. 97-348), includes
substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one
hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the
first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the
pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of
columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land
preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the
installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for
basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms;
nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings,
such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main
structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction
means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural
part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank
that is principally aboveground, as well as a manufactured home.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent
(50%) of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of
the improvement. This includes structures which have incurred "substantial
damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either:
   (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary conditions, or
   (2)   Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic
structure".
VARIANCE: A grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this chapter
when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance,
therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited
by this chapter. (For full requirements see section 60.6 of the national flood
insurance program regulations.)
VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications,
or other evidence of compliance required in section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)
(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) of the national flood insurance program
regulations, is presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.
WATER SURFACE ELEVATION: The height, in relation to the national geodetic
vertical datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of
various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine
areas. (Ord. 2008-22, 2009)
7.11.104: LANDS TO WHICH THIS CHAPTER APPLIES:
This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the
jurisdiction of Ivins City. (Ord. 2008-22, 2009)
7.11.105: BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD:
The areas of special flood hazard identified by the federal emergency
management agency in recent scientific and engineering flood insurance studies
resulting in issuance of flood insurance rate maps (FIRM) for Washington
County, Utah, and incorporated areas with the effective date of April 2, 2009,
and any revisions thereto are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a
part of this chapter. (Ord. 2008-22, 2009)
7.11.106: ESTABLISHMENT OF DEVELOPMENT PERMIT:
A development permit shall be required to ensure conformance with the
provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 2008-22, 2009)
7.11.107: COMPLIANCE:
No structure or land shall hereafter be located, altered, or have its use
changed without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other
applicable regulations. (Ord. 2008-22, 2009)
7.11.108: ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS:
This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing
easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and
another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 2008-22,
2009)
7.11.109: INTERPRETATION:
In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be:
   (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
   (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. (Ord. 2008-22, 2009)
7.11.110: WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. On rare occasions greater floods can and will occur and flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the community or any official or
employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this
chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. (Ord. 2008-22,
2009)
PART 2. ADMINISTRATION

permits have been obtained from those federal, state or local governmental
agencies (including section 404 of the federal water pollution control act
amendments of 1972, 33 USC 1334) from which prior approval is required.
   (5)   Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the
boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions)
the floodplain administrator shall make the necessary interpretation.
   (6)   Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the state
coordinating agency which is the Utah division of water rights, prior to any
alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such
notification to the federal emergency management agency.
   (7)   Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion of any watercourse is maintained.
   (8)   When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance
with section
 7.11.105 of this chapter, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review
and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation data and floodway data
available from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer the
provisions of part 3 of this chapter.
   (9)   When a regulatory floodway has not been designated, the floodplain
administrator must require that no new construction, substantial improvements,
or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within zones A1-30 and
AE on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative
effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and
anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the
base flood more than one foot (1') at any point within the community.
   (10)   Under the provisions of 44 CFR chapter 1, section 65.12, of the
national flood insurance program regulations, a community may approve certain
development in zones A1-30, AE, AH, on the community's FIRM which increases the
water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one foot (1'), provided
that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM revision through FEMA
(conditional letter of map revision). (Ord. 2008-22, 2009)

applicable;
      (i)   The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding
or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
      (j)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan for
that area. (Ord. 2008-22, 2009)
7.11.204: VARIANCE PROCEDURES:
   (1)   Requests For Variances: The city's land use appeal authority shall
hear and render judgment on requests for variances from the requirements of
this chapter.
   (2)   Appeal Decision Of Floodplain Administrator: The appeal authority
shall hear and render judgment on an appeal only when it is alleged there is an
error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the floodplain
administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
   (3)   Appeal To Courts: Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of
the appeal authority may appeal such decision in the courts of competent
jurisdiction.
   (4)   Record Of Actions; Report Variances: The floodplain administrator
shall maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report
variances to the federal emergency management agency upon request.
   (5)   Historic Structures: Variances may be issued for the reconstruction,
rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of
Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to
the procedures set forth in the remainder of this chapter.
   (6)   Lot Size: Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size
contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below
the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in section
7.11.203 of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond the one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
   (7)   Conditions Of Variance: Upon consideration of the factors noted above
and the intent of this chapter, the appeal authority may attach such conditions
to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and
objectives of this chapter.
   (8)   Increase In Flood Levels: Variances shall not be issued within any
designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood
discharge would result.
   (9)   Preservation Of Historic Character And Design: Variances may be issued
for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination
that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's
continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
   (10)   Prerequisites For Granting Variances:
      (a)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (b)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (i)   Showing a good and sufficient cause;
         (ii)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         (iii)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      (c)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (11)   Functionally Dependent Uses: Variances may be issued by a community
for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development
necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that:
      (a)   The criteria outlined in this section are met, and
      (b)   The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats
to public safety. (Ord. 2008-22, 2009)
PART 3. STANDARDS
7.11.301: GENERAL STANDARDS:
In all areas of special flood hazards the following provisions are required for
all new construction and substantial improvements:
   (1)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy;
   (2)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed
by methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
   (3)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed
with materials resistant to flood damage;
   (4)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed
with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment

   (7)   On site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to
them or contamination from them during flooding. (Ord. 2008-22, 2009)
7.11.302: SPECIFIC STANDARDS:
In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been
provided, including sections
7.11.105 and
7.11.303 of this chapter, the following provisions are required:
   (1)   Residential Construction: New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement),
elevated to or above the base flood elevation. A registered professional
engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the
floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection, as proposed in
section
7.11.203 of this chapter, is satisfied.
   (2)   Nonresidential Construction: New construction and substantial
improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure
shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above
the base flood level or together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and
with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer
or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and
plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of
construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined
in this subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific
elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are
floodproofed shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator.
   (3)   Enclosures: New construction and substantial improvements, with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of
vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which
are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic
flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of
floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a
registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
      (a)   A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
      (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot (1')
above grade.

floodwaters.
   (4)   Manufactured Homes:
      (a)   Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within zone A on a
community's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which
minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes
must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over
the top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to
applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
      (b)   Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially
improved within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites: 1)
outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, 2) in a new manufactured
home park or subdivision, 3) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home
park or subdivision, or 4) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision
on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a
flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the
manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be
securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
      (c)   Require that manufactured homes placed or substantially improved on
sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within zones A1-30,
AH and AE on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of
this subsection (4) be elevated so that either:
         (i)   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the
base flood elevation, or
         (ii)   The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers
or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less
than thirty six inches (36") in height above grade and be securely anchored to
an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and
lateral movement.
   (5)   Recreational Vehicles: Require that recreational vehicles placed on
sites within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM either:
      (a)   Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive
days,
      (b)   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or
      (c)   Meet the permit requirements of section
7.11.203 of this chapter and the elevation and anchoring requirements for
"manufactured homes" in this section. A recreational vehicle is ready for
highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site
only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no
permanently attached additions. (Ord. 2008-22, 2009)
7.11.303: STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS:
   (1)   All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions shall be consistent with this chapter.
   (2)   All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the
placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet development
permit requirements of sections
7.11.106 and
7.11.203 of this chapter; and the provisions of this part.
   (3)   Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals
and other proposed development including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions which are greater than fifty (50) lots or five (5)
acres, whichever is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to sections
7.11.105 and
7.11.202 of this chapter.
   (4)   All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure
to flood hazards.
   (5)   All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as
sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or
eliminate flood damage. (Ord. 2008-22, 2009)
7.11.304: STANDARDS FOR AREAS OF SHALLOW FLOODING (AO/AH ZONES):
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section
7.11.105 of this chapter are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas
have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three
feet (3') where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of
flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding
is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions
apply:
   (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the
highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet
on the community's FIRM (at least 2 feet if no depth number is specified).
   (2)   All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential
structures:
      (a)   Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the
highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet
on the community's FIRM (at least 2 feet if no depth number is specified), or
      (b)   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed
so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads of effects of buoyancy.
   (3)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a
certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this
section, as proposed in section
7.11.103 of this chapter are satisfied.
   (4)   Require within zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around
structures on slopes, to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed
structures. (Ord. 2008-22, 2009)
7.11.305: FLOODWAYS:
Floodways located within areas of special flood hazard established in section
7.11.105 of this chapter are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway
is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry
debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions
shall apply:
   (1)   Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory
floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within
the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
   (2)   If subsection (1) of this section is satisfied, all new construction
and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of this part.
   (3)   Under the provisions of 44 CFR chapter 1, section 65.12, of the
national flood insurance regulations, a community may permit encroachments
within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base
flood elevations, provided that the community first applies for a conditional
FIRM and floodway revision through FEMA. (Ord. 2008-22, 2009)
PART 4. PENALTIES FOR NONCOMPLIANCE
7.11.401: PENALTIES:
No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended,
converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter
and other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this chapter

conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall
constitute a class B misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails
to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined
not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or imprisoned for not more than
six (6) months, or both, for each violation, and in addition shall pay all
costs and expenses involved in the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent
Ivins City from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or
remedy any violation. (Ord. 2008-22, 2009)
PART 5. CERTIFICATION
7.11.501: CERTIFICATION BY CITY:
It is hereby found and declared by Ivins City that severe flooding has occurred
in the past within its jurisdiction and will certainly occur within the future;

established by the city council from time to time by resolution.

Whenever a dispute between superintendent and the property owner arises as to
the appropriate number of meters to be installed on any premises, the matter
shall be heard and determined by the city council after due notice in writing
to the parties involved.

and in its discretion, order a test of the meter measuring the water delivered
to such customer. If such request is made within twelve (12) months after the

               plant, and the extent to which the new facility is engaged in the same general type of
               activity as the existing source, should be considered.
NEW SOURCE:    (b)   Construction on a site at which an existing source is located results in a
               modification rather than a new source if the construction does not create a new
               building, structure, facility, or installation meeting the criteria of subsection (a)
               (ii) or (iii) above but otherwise alters, replaces, or adds to existing process or
               production equipment.
               (c)   Construction of a new source as defined under this paragraph has commenced if
               the owner or operator has:
                  (i)   Begun, or caused to begin, as part of a continuous onsite construction
               program:
                     (A)   Any placement, assembly, or installation of facilities or equipment; or
                     (B)   Significant site preparation work including clearing, excavation, or
               removal of existing buildings, structures, or facilities which is necessary for the
               placement, assembly, or installation of new source facilities or equipment; or
                     (C)   Entered into a binding contractual obligation for the purchase of
               facilities or equipment which are intended to be used in its operation within a
               reasonable time. Options to purchase or contracts which can be terminated or modified

of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to
SGRWRF under the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 2018-19, 2018)
10.06.302: ADDITIONAL PRETREATMENT MEASURES:
   (1)   Whenever deemed necessary, SGRWRF may require users to restrict their
discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be
discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of
discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams, and such
other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW, and determine the
user's compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
   (2)   The manager may require any person discharging into the POTW to
install and maintain, on their property, and at their expense, a suitable
storage and flow control facility to ensure equalization of flow. An individual
wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization,
   (3)   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors, such as described by the
International Plumbing Code, shall be provided when, in the opinion of the
manager, they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing
excessive amounts of liquid waste, floatable grease, oil, or sand; except, such
interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All interception
units shall be of a type and capacity approved by the manager and shall be
located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection, and away from
building entrances and exits. Such interceptors shall be cleaned, repaired, and
maintained by the user at its expense.

10.06.303: ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGE/SLUG DISCHARGE CONTROL PLANS:
The pretreatment coordinator shall evaluate whether each SIU needs an
accidental discharge/slug discharge control plan, or other actions to control
slug discharges. The pretreatment coordinator may require any user to develop,
submit for approval, and implement, such a plan, or take such other action that
may be necessary to control slug discharges. An accidental discharge/slug
discharge control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following:
   (1)   Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch
discharges;
   (2)   List and description of stored chemicals;
   (3)   Procedures for immediately notifying the manager of any accidental or
slug discharge, as required by section

designated by the manager, and at such times as are established by the manager.
Such waste shall not violate Part 2 of this chapter or any other requirements
established by SGRWRF. The manager may require septic tank waste haulers to
obtain individual wastewater discharge permits.
   (2)   The discharge of hauled industrial wastes as "industrial septage"
requires prior approval and an individual wastewater discharge permit from the
SGRWRF. The manager shall have authority to prohibit the disposal of such
wastes, if disposal would interfere with the treatment plant operations or
violate Part 2 of this chapter. Waste haulers are subject to all other sections
of this chapter.
   (3)   Waste haulers must provide a waste tracking form for every load. This
form shall include, at a minimum, the name and address of the waste hauler,
truck identification, names and addresses of sources of waste, and volume and

   (1)   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-
customary batch discharge, a slug discharge, or slug load, that might cause
potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately notify either in
person or via a phone conversation with the pretreatment coordinator of the
incident. A phone message does not satisfy this notification requirement. This
notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste,
concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user.
   (2)   Within five (5) days following such discharge, the user shall, unless
waived by the manager, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s)
of the discharge, and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar
future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any
expense, loss, damage, or other liability which might be incurred as a result
of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or
property. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any fines, penalties,
or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this chapter.
   (3)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employees of the notification procedures in the
event of a discharge described in subsection (1) above. Employers shall ensure

All users not required to obtain an individual wastewater discharge permit
shall provide appropriate reports as required by the pretreatment coordinator.
(Ord. 2018-19, 2018)
10.06.608: NOTICE OF VIOLATION/REPEAT SAMPLING AND REPORTING:
If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user shall notify
the pretreatment coordinator within twenty four (24) hours of becoming aware of
the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis, and submit
the results of the repeat analysis to the pretreatment coordinator within
thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation. Resampling by the
industrial user is not required if: 1) SGRWRF performs scheduled sampling at
the facility at least once a month; 2) if SGRWRF performs sampling at the
facility, between the time when the initial sampling was conducted, and the
time when the user receives the results of the initial sampling; or, 3) if
SGRWRF has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user,
then SGRWRF will perform the repeat sampling and analysis, unless it notifies
the User of the violation and requires the user to perform the repeat sampling
and analysis. (Ord. 2018-19, 2018)
10.06.609: NOTIFICATION OF THE DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE:
   (1)   Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify
the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and State
hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as
set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of
discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than one
hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the
notification also shall contain the following information: 1) an identification
of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes; 2) an estimation of the
mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged
during that calendar month; and 3) an estimation of the mass of constituents in
the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12)
months. All notifications must take place no later than one hundred and eighty
(180) days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph
need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However,
notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under section
10.06.605 of this chapter. The notification requirement in this section does
not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical
pretreatment standards under the self monitoring requirements of sections
10.06.601,
10.06.603, and
10.06.604 of this chapter.
   (2)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (1), above,
during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15)
kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as
specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen
(15) kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any
quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33
(e), requires a one time notification. Subsequent months during which the user
discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require
additional notification.
   (3)   In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA,
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user shall notify the manager,
the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and State hazardous
waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of
the effective date of such regulations.
   (4)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated.
   (5)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued
thereunder, or any applicable Federal, State, or local law. (Ord. 2018-19,
2018)
10.06.610: ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS:
   (1)   All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted
as part of a wastewater discharge permit application, report, permit or other
requirement by this chapter, shall be performed in accordance with the
techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto, unless
otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40
CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the
pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling
and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question,
sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods,
or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures approved by the
pretreatment coordinator.
   (2)   All laboratory samples collected for this chapter shall be analyzed by
a laboratory that is either certified by the Utah Bureau of Laboratory
Improvements or approved by the manager. (Ord. 2018-19, 2018)
10.06.611: SAMPLE COLLECTION:
Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data
obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period
covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions
occurring during the reporting period.
   (1)   Except as indicated in subsections (2) and (3) below, the user must
collect wastewater samples using twenty four (24) hour flow proportional
composite sampling techniques, unless time proportional composite sampling or
grab sampling is authorized by the pretreatment coordinator. Where time
proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by SGRWRF, the
samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including
appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA
guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a twenty four (24) hour period
may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: 1) for cyanide, total
phenols, and sulfides, the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in
the field; and 2) for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be
composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters,
unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA
methodologies, may be authorized by SGRWRF, as appropriate. In addition, grab
samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits.
   (2)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds, must be obtained using grab
collection techniques.
   (3)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and ninety
(90) day compliance reports required in sections
10.06.601 and
10.06.603, a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide,
total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for
facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist. For facilities for
which historical sampling data are available, the pretreatment coordinator may
authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by section
10.06.604, the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab
samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements. (Ord. 2018-19, 2018)
10.06.612: DATE OF RECEIPT OF REPORTS:
Written reports are deemed submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which
are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United
States Postal Service, the date the report is received shall govern. (Ord.
2018-19, 2018)
10.06.613: RECORDKEEPING:
Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain, and
make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained
pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter, any additional
records obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user
independent of such requirements, and documentation associated with BMPs
established under section
10.06.204(3). Records shall include: 1) the date, exact place, method, and time
of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; 2) the dates
analyses were performed; 3) who performed the analyses; 4) the analytical
techniques or methods used; and 5) the results of such analyses. These records
shall remain available for a period of at least three (3) years. This period
shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning
the user or SGRWRF, or where the user has been specifically notified of a
longer retention period by the pretreatment coordinator. (Ord. 2018-19, 2018)
10.06.614: CERTIFICATION STATEMENTS:
Certification Of Permit Applications, User Reports And Initial Monitoring
Waiver: The following certification statement, signed by an authorized
representative as defined in subsection
10.06.104(3), shall be submitted by users submitting permit applications under
section
10.06.406: 1) users submitting baseline monitoring reports under subsection
10.06.601(2)(e); 2) users submitting reports on compliance with the categorical
pretreatment standard deadlines under section
10.06.603; and 3) users submitting periodic compliance reports required by
subsections
10.06.604(1) through (4):
   I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were
prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed
to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information
submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system,
or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the
information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true,
accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for
submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and
imprisonment for knowing violations.
(Ord. 2018-19, 2018)
PART 7. COMPLIANCE MONITORING
10.06.701: RIGHT OF ENTRY: INSPECTION AND SAMPLING:
The manager or his or her designee shall have the right to enter the premises
of any user to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of
this chapter, and any individual wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder. Users shall allow the manager or his or her designee ready access to
all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records
examination and copying, and/or the performance of any additional duties.
Inspections and monitoring shall be conducted as frequently as determined by
the SGRWRF and may be announced or unannounced.
   (1)   Where a user has security measures in force that require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with its security guards, so, upon presentation of
suitable identification, the manager shall be permitted to enter without delay
for the purpose of performing his or her duties.
   (2)   The manager shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or
require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/
or metering of the user's operations.
   (3)   The manager may require the user to install monitoring equipment as
necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained
at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own
expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be
calibrated at least annually, or as required per the manufacturer's
recommendations and specifications to ensure their accuracy.
   (4)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be removed promptly by the user
at the verbal or written request of the manager and shall not be replaced. The
costs of clearing such obstruction and providing safe and easy access shall be
borne by the user.
   (5)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the manager or his or her designee
access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this chapter.
   (6)   The location of the monitoring facility shall provide ample room in or
near the monitoring facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of
samples and analysis. Whether constructed on public or private property, the
monitoring facility should be provided in accordance with the SGRWRF's
requirements, and all applicable local construction standard and
specifications. Such facilities shall be constructed and maintained in a manner
that enables the manager to perform independent monitoring activities.
   (7)   All significant industrial users will be inspected at least annually
including review of facilities and reports.
   (8)   SGRWRF may use a camera to photograph areas of the facility as
necessary for carrying out the duties of the industrial pretreatment program
including, but not limited to, documentation of the user's compliance status
and for reinforcement of written reports. The user shall be allowed to review
copies of the photographs for confidentiality claims. (Ord. 2018-19, 2018)
10.06.702: SEARCH WARRANTS:
If the manager or his or her designee has been refused access to a building,
structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or
that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection
and sampling program of SGRWRF designed to verify compliance with this chapter
or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public
health, safety and welfare of the community, the manager may seek issuance of a
search warrant from a court of competent jurisdiction. (Ord. 2018-19, 2018)
PART 8. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
10.06.801: CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION:
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater
discharge permit applications, individual wastewater discharge permits, and
monitoring programs, and from the manager inspection and sampling activities,
shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user
specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
manager, that the release of specific information would divulge information,
processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets
under applicable State law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of
submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the
user furnishing a report that specific information should be held confidential,
the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes
shall be redacted and not made available for inspection by the public.
Regardless of any such assertion of confidentiality, all information,
unredacted, shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental
agencies for uses related to the UPDES program or pretreatment program, and in
enforcement proceedings involving the person or entity furnishing the report.
Wastewater constituents and characteristics, and other effluent data, as
defined at 40 CFR 2.302, shall not be recognized as confidential information
and shall be available to the public without restriction. (Ord. 2018-19, 2018)
PART 9. PUBLICATION OF USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE
10.06.901: PUBLICATION OF USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE:
The manager shall publish annually, in a newspaper of general circulation that
provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdictions served by POTW, a
list of the users which, at any time during the previous twelve (12) months,
were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements. The term significant noncompliance shall be applicable to all
significant industrial users (or any other industrial user that violates
subsections (3), (4) or (8) of this section) and shall mean:
   (1)   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which sixty six percent (66%) or more of all the measurements taken
for the same pollutant parameter taken during a six (6) month period exceed (by
any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including
instantaneous limits as defined in Part 2 of this chapter;
   (2)   Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in
which thirty three percent (33%) or more of wastewater measurements taken for
the same pollutant parameter during a six (6) month period equals or exceeds
the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including
instantaneous limits, as defined by Part 2 multiplied by the applicable TRC
criteria (TRC=1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and TRC=1.2 for all
other pollutants except pH);
   (3)   Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as
defined by Part 2 (daily maximum, long term average, instantaneous limit, or
narrative standard) that the manager determines has caused, alone or in
combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including
endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public;
   (4)   Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to
the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the manager exercise of
its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
   (5)   Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in an individual wastewater discharge
permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction,
or attaining final compliance;
   (6)   Failure to provide within thirty (30) days after the due date, any
required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance
with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self monitoring
reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;
   (7)   Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
   (8)   Any other violation(s), which may include a violation of best
management practices, which the manager determines will adversely affect the
operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. (Ord. 2018-19,
2018)
PART 10. ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES
10.06.1001: NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION:
When the manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
manager may serve upon that user a written notice of violation, personally or
by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested). Within fifteen (15)
days of receipt of such notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for
the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, including specific required
actions, shall be submitted by the user to the manager. Submission of such a
plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring
before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section
shall limit the authority of the manager to take any action, including
emergency actions or any other enforcement action, before or without issuing a
notice of violation. (Ord. 2018-19, 2018)
10.06.1002: CONSENT ORDERS:
The manager may enter into consent orders, assurances of compliance, or other
similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for
noncompliance. Such documents shall include specific action to be taken by the
user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the
document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the
administrative orders issued pursuant to sections
10.06.1004 and
10.06.1005 of this chapter and shall be judicially enforceable. (Ord. 2018-19,
2018)
10.06.1003: SHOW CAUSE HEARING:
The manager may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear
before the manager and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should
not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place
for the show cause hearing, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for
such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be
served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested)
at least fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on
any authorized representative of the user as defined in subsection
10.06.104(3). A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite
for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 2018-19, 2018)
10.06.1004: COMPLIANCE ORDERS:
When the manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
manager may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing
that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does
not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be
discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related
appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may
contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional
self monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of
pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the
deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement,
nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation,
including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be
a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 2018-19, 2018)
10.06.1005: CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS:
When the manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that
the user's past violations are likely to recur, the Manager may issue an order
to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing
the user to:
   (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
   (2)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed
to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and desist
order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user. (Ord. 2018-19, 2018)
10.06.1006: ADMINISTRATIVE FINES:
   (1)   When the manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge
permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the manager may fine such user an amount not to exceed five
thousand dollars ($5,000.00). Such fines shall be assessed on a per-violation,
per-day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge
limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation.
   (2)   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after sixty (60) calendar
days, be assessed an additional penalty of ten percent (10%) of the unpaid
balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of one and one-half
percent (1.5%) per month. A lien against the user's real and/or personal
property shall be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties.
   (3)   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for
the manager to reconsider the fine, along with full payment of the fine amount,
within thirty (30) days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has
merit, the manager may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's
appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereon,
shall be returned to the user. The manager may add the costs of preparing
administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
   (4)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User. (Ord. 2018-19,
2018)
10.06.1007: EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS:
The manager may immediately suspend a user's discharge whenever such suspension
is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears
to present, or cause, an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or
welfare of persons. The manager may also immediately suspend a user's
discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere
with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an
endangerment to the environment. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted
as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension of a permit and/or
discharge to the POTW.
   (1)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately
stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the manager may take
such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer
connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or
endangerment to persons or the environment. The manager may allow the user to
recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated, to the satisfaction of
the manager, that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination
proceedings in section
10.06.1008 of this chapter are initiated against the user.
   (2)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution, and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence. The written statement shall be submitted to the
manager prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under
sections
10.06.1003 or
10.06.1008 of this chapter. (Ord. 2018-19, 2018)
10.06.1008: TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE:
   (1)   Violations Subject To Discharge Termination: In addition to the
provisions in section
10.06.506 of this chapter, any user who violates the following conditions is
subject to discharge termination:
      (a)   Violation of individual wastewater discharge permit conditions;
      (b)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
      (c)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
      (d)   Refusal of access to the user's premises for the purpose of
inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
      (e)   Violation of the pretreatment standards in Part 2 of this chapter.
   (2)   Notice Of Discharge Termination: User will be notified of the proposed
termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under
section
10.06.1003 of this chapter why the proposed action should not be taken.
Exercise of this option by the manager shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite
for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 2018-19, 2018)
PART 11. JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES
10.06.1101: INJUNCTIVE RELIEF:

provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
manager may petition the Washington County Fifth District Court through the
City Attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as
appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the
individual wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement, imposed by
this chapter on activities of the user. The manager may also seek such other
and further relief in law or equity, including a requirement for the user to
conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not
be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the
user. (Ord. 2018-19, 2018)
10.06.1102: CIVIL PENALTIES:
   (1)   A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of
this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, shall be liable
to the City for a maximum civil penalty of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00)
per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long term average
discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the
violation.
   (2)   The SGRWRF may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs,
interest, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including
sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any other actual damages
incurred by SGRWRF or the City.
   (3)   In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall take
into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the
violation, any economic benefit gained by the user from the user's violation,
corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any
other factor as justice requires.
   (4)   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 2018-19,
2018)
10.06.1103: CRIMINAL PROSECUTION:
The SGRWRF will refer to the State of Utah criminal violations of any
pretreatment standards or permit conditions. The Attorney General's office for
Utah will offer the City, wherein the violation occurred, the option to
prosecute the violator. Should the local entity decline, the State or EPA, at
their discretion, may initiate appropriate criminal action. The SGRWRF will
assist the Attorney General's office or EPA any way it can with appropriate
support for the action. The penalties set forth herein are in addition to any
other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under
State or Federal law.

10.06.1104: REMEDIES NONEXCLUSIVE:
The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive. The SGRWRF may
take any, all, or any combination of these actions, against a noncompliant
user, simultaneously or otherwise. Enforcement of pretreatment violations
generally will be in accordance with the SGRWRF's enforcement response plan.
However, SGRWRF may take other action against a user when the circumstances
warrant. Further, SGRWRF is empowered to take more than one enforcement action
against a noncompliant user. (Ord. 2018-19, 2018)
PART 12. SUPPLEMENTAL ENFORCEMENT ACTION
10.06.1201: PERFORMANCE BONDS:
The manager may decline to issue or reissue an individual wastewater discharge
permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this chapter,
a previous individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder,
or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless such user first files
a satisfactory bond, payable to the City, in a sum not to exceed a value
determined by the manager to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance.
(Ord. 2018-19, 2018)
10.06.1202: LIABILITY INSURANCE:
The manager may decline to issue or reissue an individual wastewater discharge
permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this chapter,
a previous individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder,

limited to, reimbursing the City for any costs incurred in removing, abating,
or remedying said nuisance. (Ord. 2018-19, 2018)
PART 13. AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS
10.06.1301: UPSET:
   (1)   For the purposes of this section, upset means an exceptional incident
in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical
pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the
user. Upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational
error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment
facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation.
   (2)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards, if the requirements
of subsection (3), below, are met.
   (3)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
      (a)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      (b)   The facility at the time was being operated in a prudent and
workman like manner, and in compliance with applicable operation and
maintenance procedures; and
      (c)   The user has submitted the following information to the manager
within twenty four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset, and, if this
information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within
five (5) days:
         (i)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         (ii)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times,
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
         (iii)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   (4)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   (5)   Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
   (6)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility, and until the facility
is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other situations, the primary source of
power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. (Ord. 2018-19,
2018)
10.06.1302: BYPASS:
   (1)   For the purposes of this section:
      (a)   Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any
portion of a user's treatment facility.
      (b)   Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property
damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
   (2)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment
standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential
maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to
the provision of subsections (3) and (4) of this section.
   (3)   Bypass Notifications:
      (a)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the manager, at least ten (10) days before the date of
the bypass.
      (b)   A user shall submit oral notice to the manager of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty four (24)
hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall
also be provided within five (5) days of the time the user becomes aware of the
bypass. The written submission shall contain: a) a description of the bypass;
b) its cause; c) the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times;
d) if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to
continue; and e) steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass. The manager, in his or her sole discretion, may
waive the written report on a case by case basis if the oral report has been
received within twenty four (24) hours, and the facts merit the waiver.
   (4)   Bypass:
      (a)   Bypass is prohibited, and the manager may take an enforcement
action against a user, unless:
         (i)   Bypass was unavoidable in order to prevent loss of life,
personal injury, or severe property damage;
         (ii)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         (iii)   The user submitted notices as required under subsection (3) of
this section.
      (b)   The manager may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering
its adverse effects, if the manager determines that it will meet the three (3)
conditions listed in subsection (4)(a) of this section.
      (c)   Bypass shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards, if the requirements
of this subsection (4) are met. (Ord. 2018-19, 2018)

   (1)   Grease and sand/oil interceptors, as described by the International
Plumbing Code (IPC), shall be required of any commercial user when the SGRWRF
determines they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing
FOGS in excessive amounts, except such interceptors shall not be required for
residential dwelling units.
   (2)   Any commercial user utilizing a three (3) compartment sink shall be
required to have either a grease interceptor or grease trap installed at its
own expense and shall be required to comply with maintaining the device as
outlined in the St. George City Pretreatment Operating Plan.
   (3)   All construction plans for interceptors shall be submitted to SGRWRF
for review and approval prior to installation. All interceptors shall be of a
type, construction, and capacity approved by SGRWRF.

   (5)   All newly constructed commercial structures, strip malls, multi-tenant
planned-occupied buildings, or planned-unoccupied buildings, shall install
independent six inch (6") wastewater discharge lines stubbed out within each
designated future food establishment unit. If a new source commercial
structure, strip mall, or multi-tenant building has planned occupancy by one or
more businesses that do not generate FOG, and therefore do not need a grease
interceptor, and the owner of the structure does not facilitate the
installation of independent six inch (6") wastewater discharge line and install
a common interceptor, then no future food establishments shall be permitted,
unless facilities are retrofitted for independent lines.
   (6)   All newly constructed "stand alone" commercial structures, strip
malls, multi-tenant planned-occupied buildings, where a three (3) compartment
sink will be utilized, will be required to install a grease interceptor.
   (7)   All existing commercial or industrial businesses shall have one year
to install an interceptor upon notification by SGRWRF, where required by SGRWRF
standards.
   (8)   Interceptors for businesses that have closed shall be dewatered and
cleaned by the owner of said establishment. A representative of SGRWRF may
inspect and verify this process has been completed to the satisfaction of
SGRWRF.
   (9)   Grease traps are only allowed in place of grease interceptors when in
the opinion of the manager it is physically impossible to install a grease
interceptor outside of the building or business. As such, a variance request
from the owner or lessee of the property must be made to SGRWRF with a
certification letter from a duly licensed Utah plumber or engineer. (Ord. 2018-
19, 2018)
10.06.1404: GENERAL FOGS WASTE DISCHARGE LIMITS AND REQUIREMENTS:

the periodic removal of the full contents of the interceptor. Interceptors
shall be fully emptied and cleaned at a frequency such that the combined
floating and settled FOGS accumulation does not exceed twenty-five percent
(25%) of the design hydraulic depth of the Interceptor. This is to ensure that
the minimum hydraulic retention time, and required available volume, is
maintained to effectively intercept and retain FOGS.
   (3)   If an interceptor at any time is observed by the pretreatment
coordinator or his or her designee to contain floating and settled FOGS
accumulation in excess of twenty-five percent (25%), the user shall be required
to have the interceptor serviced as soon as possible, but no later than ten
(10) days from the date the notice of violation was given, such that all FOGS,
sludge, and other materials, are completely removed from the interceptor.
   (4)   The owner of the property on which a common interceptor, and/or the
facilities discharging to a common interceptor, are located shall be primarily
responsible for the maintenance, upkeep, and repair of the interceptor.

manner attempt to dilute a discharge as a way of achieving compliance with the
St. George City Pretreatment Ordinance. (Ord. 2018-19, 2018)
10.06.1407: GREASE TRAP OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS:
   (1)   Where installed, a grease trap shall be fully maintained by the user,
at its sole expense, in a continuous and efficient manner, and at all times
subject to SGRWRF inspection and approval.
   (2)   A FSE may use, or be required to install, grease traps, in lieu of
installation of a grease interceptor, when, in the opinion of the manager: 1)
installation of an interceptor cannot physically be accomplished; 2) there is
not adequate slope for gravity flow between kitchen plumbing fixtures and a
proposed grease interceptor and/or between the grease interceptor and the
private collection lines or the public sewer; or 3) no alternative pretreatment
can be installed. Sizing of grease traps shall be performed by a professional
engineer or plumber registered in the State of Utah, but shall conform to
SGRWRF Design Standards and Construction Specifications as a minimum.
   (3)   Grease traps shall be operated in accordance with the manufacturer's
specifications.
   (4)   Grease traps shall be maintained in efficient operating condition by
removing accumulated grease on an as needed basis, or the frequency specified

inch (1") more than the thickness of the existing gravel. (Ord. 2006-18, 2006)
11.02.112: PROTECTION OF PUBLIC DURING EXCAVATION PROJECT:
Excavation operations shall be conducted in such a manner that a minimum amount
of interference or interruption of street traffic will result. Inconvenience to
residents and businesses fronting on public streets shall be minimized.
Suitable, adequate and sufficient barricades shall be available and used where
necessary to prevent accidents involving property or persons. Barricades must
be in place until all of excavator's equipment is removed from site and
excavation has been backfilled and proper temporary gravel surface is in place.
From sunset to sunrise, all barricades and excavations must be clearly outlined
by acceptable warning lights, lanterns, flares and other devices. Police and
fire departments shall be notified at least twenty four (24) hours in advance
of any planned excavation requiring street closures or detours. (Prior Code §

11.02.113: RELOCATION AND PROTECTION OF UTILITIES:
An excavator shall not interfere with any existing utility without the written
consent of the public works director and without advance notice to the owner of
the utility. If it becomes necessary to relocate an existing utility, it shall
be done by its owner unless the owner otherwise directs. No utility, whether
owned by the city or by a private enterprise, shall be moved to accommodate the
permittee unless the cost of such work be borne by the permittee or an
expressly written agreement is made whereby the utility owner and the excavator
make other arrangements relating to such cost. The permittee shall support and
protect by timbers or otherwise all pipes, conduits, poles, wires or other
apparatus, which may be in any way affected by the excavation work, and shall
do everything necessary to support, sustain and protect them under, over, along
or across the work. In any case any of the pipes, conduits, poles, wires or
apparatus should be damaged (and for this purpose pipe coating or other
encasement or devices are to be considered as part of a substructure) they
shall be repaired by the agency or person owning them, but the utility owner
shall be reimbursed for the expense of such repairs by the permittee. It is the
intent of this chapter that the permittee shall assume all liability for damage
to substructures, and any resulting damage or injury to anyone because of such
substructure damage, and such assumption of liability shall be deemed a
contractual obligation which the permittee accepts upon acceptance of an
excavation permit. The city need not be made a party to any action because of
this chapter. The permittee shall inform itself as to the existence and
location of all underground utilities and protect the same against damage.
(Ord. 2006-18, 2006)
11.02.114: JETTING PIPE PERMITTED WHEN:

   (1)   In order to ensure proper backfill and restoration of surface, the
permittee shall deposit a surety bond or cash deposit with the city recorder or
designee payable to the city, except that a public utility operating or using
any of the streets under a franchise from the city will not be required to
furnish such bond; providing, such franchise obligates the holder thereof to
restore the streets and to hold the city harmless in the event of any injury to
any person or damage to any property due to negligence of such holder in
conducting excavation and restoration operations under such franchise. The
required surety bond must be:
      (a)   With good and sufficient surety;
      (b)   By a surety company authorized to transact business in the state;
      (c)   Satisfactory to the city attorney in form and substance;
      (d)   Conditioned upon the permittee's compliance with this chapter in
order to secure and hold the city and its officers harmless against any and all
claims, judgments or other costs arising from the excavation permit or for
which the city, the city council or any city officer may be liable by reason of
any accident or injury to any person or property through the fault of the
permittee arising out of failure to properly guard the excavation or for any
other negligence of the permittee;
      (e)   Conditioned to fill up, restore and replace in good and safe
condition, as near as may be to its original condition and to the satisfaction
of the city, all openings and excavations made in streets, and to maintain any
street where excavation is made in as good condition for the period of twenty
four (24) months after the work shall be done, usual wear and tear expected, as
it was before the work shall have been done.
   (2)   The amount of the surety bond or cash deposit shall be established by
resolution and may be changed from time to time, but until such resolution is
passed, the amount of the surety or cash deposit shall be specified in the
consolidated fee schedule. (Ord. 2006-18, 2006)

which a master license agreement is granted, or upon its revocation or earlier
expiration, in any such case without renewal, extension or transfer, the City
shall have the right to require a provider to remove, at its expense, all
above-ground portions of small wireless facilities within a reasonable period
of time, which shall not be less than one hundred eighty (180) days.
   (5)   Leaving Underground System: Upon written approval by City, a wireless
provider may abandon underground portions of a small wireless facility in place
so long as it does not materially interfere with the use of the rights-of-way
or with the use thereof by any public utility, cable operator or other person.
   (6)   Provider Defaults: If a wireless provider defaults under any provision
of this chapter and such default is not cured within thirty (30) days following
notice by City to wireless provider of its default, City shall maintain all its
rights and remedies, at law and in equity, including the ability to charge
fines, recover fees and costs. In the alternative, the City may remove the

As used in this chapter, "Native American cultural resources" are defined as:
   (1)   Human remains;
   (2)   Funerary objects associated with human remains;
   (3)   Religious items; and
   (4)   Petroglyphs/pictographs. (Ord. 94-7, 1994)
13.01.102: CONFLICTS AVOIDANCE:
Conflicts can be avoided by conforming development design to avoid suspected
cultural resource sites. Consultation with local Native Americans, possibly
including the state division of Indians affairs, and developers during planning
phases prior to start of excavation, can avoid expense and delay. (Ord. 94-7,
1994)
13.01.103: DISCOVERY OF CULTURAL RESOURCES; PROCEDURES:
   (1)   When cultural resources are uncovered, found or identified, the
discoverer is required to immediately stop all activity endangering or
potentially endangering the cultural resource and notify the city.
   (2)   When notified, the city staff will immediately notify the Washington
County coroner and the Shivwits Paiute band chief. If no human remains are
identified in the discovery, the requirement to notify the county coroner is
removed.
   (3)   Under no condition shall remains be given to curator facilities,
universities or others. The remains shall not be used for display under any
conditions.
   (4)   The Shivwits Paiute band shall determine the disposition of the
remains immediately after the county coroner has determined the remains to be
Native American. The remains become a Native American responsibility once they
are identified as Native American.
   (5)   The Shivwits Paiute band must respond within twenty four (24) hours of
notification by city staff of discovery of the remains. Longer than twenty four
(24) hours' response shall be indication of no interest, and construction
activity may resume. A request for additional time because of a justifiable
reason, presented in writing, shall be granted.
   (6)   Cultural items other than human remains, where possible, are to be
given to the Shivwits Paiute band for their disposition. Cultural resources
that cannot be moved because of size or weight shall be protected from
destruction. The property owner is responsible to provide protection adequate
to prevent destruction and/or vandalism.
   (7)   The Shivwits Paiute band will remove the cultural resources within
twenty four (24) hours of notification. Exceptions will be made for weather.
   (8)   In those cases where the density of cultural resources uncovered or
anticipated to be uncovered is extensive, as determined by the Shivwits Paiute
band, the developer shall employ a Native American monitor on site to
facilitate with this chapter. Appropriate additional time for removal of
cultural resources shall be negotiated between the landowner and chief of the
Shivwits Paiute band. (Ord. 94-7, 1994)

TYPES OF SUBDIVISIONS
SECTION:
15.03.101: General
15.03.102: Conventional Subdivision
15.03.103: Phased Subdivision
15.03.101: GENERAL:
All subdivisions of land shall be divided, subdivided, reconfigured, developed
or redeveloped in accordance with the provisions of this title, the state land
sales practices act, the zoning ordinance, the general plan, the design
guidelines, the standard specifications, and all other applicable ordinances in
this code and the state code. Specific procedures for each type of subdivision
are outlined in chapters of this title as noted below. General subdivision
procedures are outlined in chapter 4 of this title. General design regulations
are outlined in chapter 5 of this title. Procedures for phased subdivisions
have additional requirements as outlined below. (Ord. 2006-02, 2006)
15.03.102: CONVENTIONAL SUBDIVISION 1 :
The purpose and intent of the conventional subdivision procedure is to allow
the division of land in all zones in a standard and more traditional
configuration of lots. While creative and innovative land development is
encouraged, the conventional subdivision may be best suited for smaller acreage
subdivisions and/or tract developments. (Ord. 2006-02, 2006)
 
Notes
1 1. See chapter 4 of this title for approval process and chapter 5 of this
  title for required improvements.
15.03.103: PHASED SUBDIVISION 1 :
Conventional subdivisions may be phased subdivisions if the project is proposed
to be completed in designated phases. The purpose of the phased subdivision
procedure is to provide general development parameters for subdivision phases
in the phased subdivision master plan prior to the detailed and comprehensive
requirements of the preliminary plan and final plat. The owner/developer shall
enter into a development agreement with the city that outlines the duties,
responsibilities, obligations, commitments and promises of the parties. (Ord.

15.05.302: STREET REQUIREMENTS:
Streets shall be designed and constructed according to the cross sections,
policies, and design standards set forth in Ivins transportation master plan
and city standard specifications.
   (1)   The developer shall dedicate right of way and install improvements for
proposed streets which are planned to adjoin or traverse the project or which
are necessary for the development. The entire proposed right of way shall be
dedicated to the city according to the design width specified by the Ivins
transportation master plan. The city may participate in a percentage of the
cost of improvements for arterial and major collector streets as proposed in
the Ivins City capital facilities plan.
   (2)   Subdivisions and other developments shall be designed to provide
future access to adjoining vacant parcels. Developments shall also be designed
so that existing stub streets in existing developments will be connected to the
proposed streets and accesses. Where a stub street is provided which accesses
more than two (2) lots on each side, a temporary turnaround and public use
easement at least eighty feet (80') in diameter, or equivalent hammerhead
turnaround, shall be provided as approved by the fire marshal. The city may
require improvements to be installed in temporary turnaround areas.
   (3)   Generally, fire apparatus access roads, including cul-de-sac and dead
end streets, may not exceed seven hundred fifty feet (750') in length, as
measured from the center of the intersection of a connecting through street to
the center of the turnaround area, without special approval by the city council
for circumstances where it would be impracticable to comply with the seven
hundred fifty foot (750') maximum length. The maximum length of a cul-de-sac
street may not be extended by additional turnarounds between the intersecting
through street and the cul- de-sac. However, if the distance from the end of a
proposed cul- de-sac to a connecting road is less than two hundred feet (200'),
where conditions permit, connection to the connecting road shall be required if
doing so does not violate requirements of the Ivins City transportation master
plan, does not disturb or eliminate any unique geographical feature, including
boundaries where the abutting property is tortoise habitat, state park, Indian
reservation or owned by the bureau of land management (BLM) thereby making it
impracticable to install a connecting road, and does not prevent full
development of approved densities.
   (4)   Cul-de-sacs shall have a minimum pavement turnaround diameter of
ninety six feet (96') with a minimum right of way line diameter of one hundred
fifteen feet (115').
   (5)   Streets in subdivisions, excluding collector streets, exceeding eighty
feet (80') in length are encouraged to be curvilinear or provide sufficient
alignment variation to calm traffic and enhance aesthetic appeal in the
subdivision.
   (6)   Subdivision streets shall be designed to approach an arterial or
collector street in accordance with the standard specifications. (Ord. 2016-02,
2016)

Sidewalks shall be required on both sides of public and private streets, with
exceptions for low volume roads as identified in the transportation master
plan.
   (1)   A ten foot (10') asphalt trail may substitute for sidewalks on both
sides of the street in the identified rural zone. Landscaped areas, in
compliance with the design guidelines, between the street curb and gutter and
the sidewalk, and between the sidewalk and outside right of way boundary, are
encouraged.
   (2)   The sidewalk may be placed in the landscaped buffer area.
   (3)   If sidewalks serving public streets are not placed within a dedicated
right of way, an easement for access and maintenance will be required.
   (4)   The minimum sidewalk width requirements shall be in accordance with
the cross sections depicted in the transportation master plan and the standard
specifications.
   (5)   Required sidewalk and bike paths shall be serpentined on streets with
a landscape buffer greater than fifteen feet (15') wide. (Ord. 2016-02, 2016)
PART 4. LANDSCAPED BUFFER AREAS
15.05.401: PURPOSE:
Landscaped buffer areas are intended to provide an area of landscaped open
space along all public streets which form the perimeter of the subdivision
where front yards of homes do not front the street and on all public streets
within the subdivision where front yards of homes do not front the street. The
intent is to provide the general public using the public streets with a more
open view of the scenic vistas prominent in the community and a less congested
experience as they travel along the public streets within the community. It is
further the intent to provide a common and consistent appearance of all public
streets within the community. (Ord. 2016-02, 2016)
15.05.402: DEDICATION AND MAINTENANCE:
After satisfactory installation of the landscaping in the landscaped buffer
area, and one hundred percent (100%) release of the security for said
landscaping, the city will accept the dedication of, and responsibility for
maintenance of, the landscaped buffer area along arterial and major collector
streets. The developer shall note on the final plat and in the covenants and
restrictions for the development, all other public street landscaped buffer
areas which the development homeowners shall be required to maintain. Failure
to place such notes will not nullify the owners' responsibility as described in
this section. (Ord. 2016-02, 2016)
15.05.403: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
All public streets which form the perimeter of any residential or
nonresidential development, and all public streets within any residential or
nonresidential development where homes or buildings within the development will
not front on the streets, shall provide a minimum landscaped buffer area that
meets the requirements set forth in the cross sections of the transportation
master plan and the following:
   (1)   Uneven, creative landscaped buffer areas with varied setbacks and wall
heights are preferred.
   (2)   Stepped and staggered buffer walls shall not exceed forty foot (40')
increments of variation of height and setback.
   (3)   Serpentine sidewalks, which are encouraged, may be located within the
buffer area.

covenants and restrictions for the development, those public right of way
areas, including park strips, for which the homeowners shall have
responsibility for landscape improvements and maintenance. Failure to place
such notes will not nullify owners' responsibilities for park strips and
medians as described in this section. (Ord. 2016-02, 2016)
PART 5. FENCING
15.05.501: PURPOSE:
Fencing may be used to provide privacy to property owners, buffer conflicting
uses, or to provide an architectural/design element to a development project.
Fencing is encouraged to be as low profile and open as possible to protect
scenic vistas from public streets and discourage separation from the community.

the fence or wall.
   (7)   Fence heights along public streets shall not exceed the maximum
heights shown in the chart that follows, except when natural lot elevation
would dictate a fence height too low to protect privacy. A five foot (5') fence
or wall may be built if the twelve foot (12') required buffer area is met.
   (8)   Fences and walls shall not exceed forty feet (40') of unbroken lengths
to reduce visual mass. Walls and fences that exceed forty feet (40') in length
shall be designed to vary in height and be stepped in an offset manner.
   (9)   When a fence or wall on a public street creates a continuous surface
greater than twenty feet (20') in length, it shall be softened visually with
acceptable vegetation.
 
Public Street Buffer Areas (Measured Maximum Height Of Fence, Including Berm
From The Street Curb To The Fence)   (Measured From Grade Back
                                     Of Curb To The Top Of Fence)1

PART 1. GENERAL PROVISIONS
15.06.101: GENERAL:
Conventional subdivisions may be completed in phases. Prior to the application
and approval of a preliminary plan and final plat, as required in chapter 4 of
this title, a developer/property owner may submit a phased subdivision master
plan that will encompass the general development parameters for the entire
subdivision. The phased subdivision master plan will establish phases, proposed
uses and general development guidelines for all phases of the subdivision. The
established uses, development parameters and guidelines shall be included in a
development agreement as required in chapter 4 of this title. (Ord. 2006-02,
2006)
15.06.102: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
The purpose and intent of the phased subdivision master plan is to allow a
conceptual review and approval of general development parameters prior to
detailed reviews of a subdivision preliminary plan and final plat. The phased
subdivision master plan is intended to establish uses, phases and general
development guidelines for all phases of a phased subdivision. It is the intent
of this process to allow a developer and the city to master plan large scale,
multi- phased developments and proceed with the development approval, as well
as the actual construction, on a phased basis over a period of years. After
approval of the phased subdivision master plan, a preliminary plan and final
plat (as required in chapter 4 of this title) must be approved prior to
development of the subdivision. Required improvements are outlined in chapter 5
of this title. (Ord. 2006-02, 2006)

with this title, the standard specifications for design and construction,
design guidelines and all applicable ordinances. If the application is not
complete or not in general compliance, the zoning administrator shall notify
the applicant in writing and specify the deficiencies in the application. When
the application is complete and in general compliance, the zoning administrator
shall forward the completed application to the technical review committee,
other city staff and departments, utility board, and affected government
entities and public utilities to obtain comment regarding the application. City
staff and the utility board will review the phased subdivision master plan,

plan and city ordinances to determine the adequacy of public facilities. The
zoning administrator shall prepare a staff report which shall include all
review comments by the technical review committee, city departments and all
other agencies required to review the application and submittals. The zoning
administrator shall forward the completed application and the staff report to
the planning commission.
   (2)   Planning Commission Public Hearing: Once all application requirements
have been met and the staff report completed, the application will be scheduled

species, and areas of lava flow(s) and rock outcroppings. (Ord. 2016-16, 2016)
      (d)   Planned Development Overlay (PD): The Planned Development District
is provided as an overlay zoning district to allow residential development
opportunities with a greater degree of flexibility than may be allowed by the
underlying RA-5, RA-1, RE-43.0, RE-37.0, or RE-25.0 District. The PD District
requires creativity and uniqueness in the proposed development with recognition
of the environmental and community values existing on the development site. The
PD District also promotes the efficient use of all land resources and requires
the provision of development and community amenities, with the preservation of
the natural and scenic qualities of the development site. (Ord. 2016-16, 2016;
amd. Ord. 2017-17, 2017)
      (e)   Subdivision Enhancement Overlay (SE): The Subdivision Enhancement
Overlay District is provided as an overlay zoning district to encourage and
reward subdivisions located in the RE-20.0, RE-17.5, RE-15.0, RE-12.5, R-1-10,
and R-1-7.5 Zoning Districts for the provision of subdivision and community
features not typically required by the subdivision requirements of the City.
These features may include street enhancement and improvement dedications,
subdivision landscaping, buffering, and compatibility features, and amenities.
The Subdivision Enhancement Overlay District (SE) is provided by the City as an
"overlay zone" to encourage the provision of desirable and attractive
Residential Estates (RE-20.0, RE-17.5, RE-15.0, and RE-12.5) and Single-Family
Residential (R-1-10 and R-1-7.5) subdivision areas.
      (f)   Mixed Use Development Overlay District (MU): The purpose of the
Mixed Use District is to provide opportunities to create land use patterns and
layouts that provide for a complementary and compatible mix of uses and a
diversity of dwelling unit types. The Mixed Use Overlay District allows a
combination of compatible residential and nonresidential uses, with necessary
supporting uses, consistent with a convenient and pedestrian friendly
development layout and a destination resort community. It is the purpose of the
MU District to allow flexibility and creativity in the combination and
arrangement of uses while promoting efficiencies in the delivery of required
infrastructure and services.
      (g)   Subdivision Lot Averaging Overlay District (SLA): The Subdivision
Lot Averaging Overlay District (SLA) is provided by the City as an "overlay
district" to provide the option for residential subdivision layout based upon
average lot size rather than the strict minimum lot size requirements of the
underlying district. The Subdivision Lot Averaging Overlay District (SLA) does
not establish any allowed uses or density for the subject property. Rather, the
identification of the allowed uses and allowed density (or base density) is
provided by the underlying zoning.
      (h)   Short Term Rental Overlay District (STRO): The purpose of this zone
is to designate areas in the community where rental of residential units on an
overnight or short term basis is desirable and in the best interests of the
community, and to aid the development of housing in those areas, particularly
by owners who reside elsewhere and wish to rent their units when not in use.
"Short term" shall be defined to mean a period of thirty (30) days or less.
      (i)   Historic Township Overlay District (HO): The purpose of this
district is to minimize flag lots and to encourage infill and redevelopment
within the Historic Township. (Ord. 2016-16, 2016)

PART 3. SENSITIVE LANDS OVERLAY DISTRICT (SL)
16.07.301: PURPOSE AND REQUIREMENTS:
The purposes and all other requirements and provisions applicable to the
sensitive lands overlay district (SL) are more fully provided by chapter 8 of
this title. (Ord. 2005-13, 2005)
16.07.302: APPLICABILITY:
The sensitive lands overlay district (SL) is an "overlay district", the
boundaries of which are identified on the city sensitive lands map. All lands
identified as being located within the sensitive lands overlay district (SL)
are identified on the city sensitive lands map and the requirements of the
district shall automatically apply to all such lands without any further action
by the commission or city council. (Ord. 2005-13, 2005)
PART 4. PLANNED DEVELOPMENT OVERLAY DISTRICT (PD)
16.07.401: PURPOSE:
The planned development overlay district (PD) is provided by the city as an
"overlay district" to provide an alternative development and subdivision option
that allows some flexibility in the development requirements of the underlying
district. The planned development overlay district (PD) does not establish, by
itself, any use or development potential for the subject property and does not
establish allowed density. Rather, the identification of allowed uses, and
allowed density (or base density) is established by the underlying zoning
district.
The planned development overlay district (PD) allows for cluster subdivisions
and requires creative and efficient subdivision designs that provide areas of
open space, and other desirable subdivision design features. The district
provides a mechanism to promote the economic values and benefits of open space
areas to the city and the accompanying values and amenities of views and
natural areas. The planned development overlay district (PD) is provided to
promote efficiencies in the delivery of required infrastructure, facilities and
services, and reductions in initial subdivision development costs and long term
maintenance costs.
All subdivisions located within a planned development overlay district (PD)
shall require a subdivision layout that achieves the following objectives:
   (1)   Protection of scenic, historic and sensitive lands, including areas
containing features such as steep slopes, rock outcroppings, lava fields,
wildlife habitat, floodplains, wetlands, or unique or other natural features.
   (2)   Provides a subdivision design that respects the topography of the site
and encourages efficiencies in the delivery of infrastructure, facilities and
services, including reductions in the length of streets and roads, subdivision
site disturbance, utility runs and the amount of required paving and hard
surfacing.
   (3)   Provides reductions in the potential for erosion and sedimentation by
the retention of existing vegetation, and the minimization of disturbed areas.
   (4)   Provides usable and linked open space areas, including public access,
recreation areas and trails.
   (5)   Creates neighborhoods with direct visual or recreational access to
open space areas.
   (6)   Preserves views. (Ord. 2005-13, 2005)
16.07.402: APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS:
In addition to the requirements for a zoning districts map amendment
application, an application for a zoning districts map amendment to establish a
planned development overlay district (PD) shall provide:
Identification of all sensitive lands areas. A sensitive lands determination
and inventory shall be provided, if applicable, consistent with the
requirements of chapter 8 of this title, which identifies all sensitive lands
areas that may be located within the property boundaries proposed for the
establishment of a planned development overlay district (PD). (Ord. 2005-13,
2005)
16.07.403: APPROVAL AND DESIGNATION:
As an overlay district, the identification of the allowed uses, development
requirements and standards, and all other applicable requirements are
determined and controlled by the underlying zoning district, or "base zone",
unless such standards are modified to the extent provided by the planned
development overlay district (PD).
The application of the planned development overlay district (PD) to any lands
within the city shall require the approval of a zoning districts map amendment
application, as provided by chapter 5 of this title, concurrent with the
approval of a subdivision application. If approved, and as an example only, a
zoning districts map amendment application to allow a planned development
overlay district (PD) for an area located within an existing residential
estates RE-25.0 district, would be identified on the zoning districts map as
RE-25.0 (PD), identifying the residential estates RE-25.0 District as the
underlying district with a Planned Development Overlay District, and (PD) as
the "overlay" district. (Ord. 2005-13, 2005)
16.07.404: ZONING DISTRICTS ALLOWED:
A Planned Development Overlay District (PD) shall only be applied to property
located within a Residential Agricultural RA-5 or RA-1 District, or Residential
Estates RE-43.0, RE-37.0, or RE-25.0 District. (Ord. 2017-06, 2017)
16.07.405: APPROVAL CRITERIA:
A zoning districts map amendment application to establish a Planned Development
Overlay District (PD) may be approved by the City Council, following the
receipt of a commission recommendation, and following the completion of all
requirements for a zoning districts map amendment application, as required by
chapter 5 of this title, concurrent with approval of a subdivision application.
The City Council, in approving a zoning districts map amendment application,
and the commission in formulating a recommendation, shall find that the Planned
Development Overlay District (PD):
   (1)   Is consistent, and does not conflict, with any policy of the General
Plan.
   (2)   Meets the purposes of this chapter.
   (3)   Provides a better land use pattern and subdivision design with
increased amenities than would be likely if the property were developed without
the establishment of a Planned Development Overlay District.
   (4)   Promotes economies in the provision of infrastructure, facilities and
services and promotes efficiencies in the long term maintenance of open space
areas and amenities.
   (5)   Meets all requirements of chapter 5 of this title for the approval of
a zoning districts map amendment application. (Ord. 2005-13, 2005)
16.07.406: APPROVAL OF SUBDIVISION APPLICATIONS AND OTHER APPLICATIONS LOCATED
IN PLANNED DEVELOPMENT OVERLAY DISTRICT:
Applications for subdivision approval or any other application for any
approval, permit or license required by all land use ordinances for lands
located in a Planned Development Overlay District (PD) shall be submitted and
reviewed in accordance with the requirements and procedures of all land use
ordinances, as applicable. (Ord. 2005-13, 2005)
16.07.407: BASE DENSITY:
The allowed base density for any proposed subdivision located in a Planned
Development Overlay District (PD) shall be determined by dividing the total
area of the subdivision site, less twenty percent (20%) of the total site area
required for street rights-of-way, utility easements and other encumbrances, by
the minimum lot size requirement of the base zoning district in which the
property is located, excluding any areas proposed to be used for schools,
churches, public facilities, or any other similar uses. (See appendix B of this
title for an example of a calculation of base density in the Planned
Development Overlay District.) (Ord. 2005-13, 2005)
16.07.408: PLANNED DEVELOPMENT LAYOUT PLAN AND/OR DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT MAY BE
REQUIRED:
A planned development project plan ("project plan") shall be presented to the
commission for recommendation, and approval by the City Council, concurrent
with and as part of the application for a zoning districts map amendment
application to establish a Planned Development Overlay District (PD). The
project plan must achieve, and must identify techniques to provide uniform and
compatible site and building standards when the project area is completely
built out. The planned development project plan must demonstrate compliance
with the requirements of this chapter and all other requirements of all land
use ordinances, as applicable.
The planned development project plan may be required to be accompanied by, or
included within, the provisions of a development agreement, when deemed
necessary by the City Council. The planned development project plan shall
include all property proposed for a Planned Development Overlay District (PD)
and shall show all phases of the development (including any phasing plans).
Once approved by the City Council, the project plan shall be controlling for
all required future approvals, permits and licenses, including, but not limited
to, subdivision and use applications, and any other requirements of all land
use ordinances, as applicable. (Ord. 2005-13, 2005)
16.07.409: REQUIRED MINIMUM OPEN SPACE:
Any subdivision development located within an area identified as a Planned
Development Overlay District (PD) shall provide a minimum of fifteen percent
(15%) of the total area of the development site as open space, provided in
accordance with the open space standards, maintenance and dedication
requirements set forth in sections
16.07.417 through
16.07.421 of this title. Such required open space may include areas such as
streams, stream corridors, watercourses, floodplains, wetlands, geological
hazards, rock outcroppings, wildlife habitat areas, slopes and historic and
cultural features. Open space areas shall not include areas within any lot,
road, street or right of way. For purposes of all land use ordinances, open
space areas shall not include any lands used for schools, churches, or any
other similar uses. (Ord. 2005-13, 2005)
16.07.410: DENSITY INCENTIVES:
Density incentives may be granted by the city council, with the receipt of a
commission recommendation, for a subdivision located within a planned
development overlay district (PD) for the provision of additional open space,
or for the provision of additional subdivision features as more particularly
set forth by sections
16.07.411 through 16.07.413 of this chapter. Such density incentives shall be
calculated from the base density as determined in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter. In no event shall the maximum density incentives
for any subdivision located in planned development overlay district (PD) exceed
thirty percent (30%) of the base density, as provided by sections
16.07.411 through
16.07.413 of this chapter. (See appendix B of this title for an example of a
calculation of density incentives in the planned development overlay district.)
(Ord. 2005-13, 2005)

PART 5. SUBDIVISION ENHANCEMENT OVERLAY DISTRICT (SE)
16.07.501: PURPOSE:
The subdivision enhancement overlay district (SE) is provided by the city as an
"overlay district" to encourage the development of desirable and attractive
residential subdivision areas that provide subdivision and community features
not typically required by the land use ordinances of the city, including the
subdivision ordinance. The district also allows flexibility in the development
requirements of the underlying district. The subdivision enhancement overlay
district (SE) does not establish any allowed uses or density for the subject
property. Rather, the identification of the allowed uses and allowed density
(or base density) is provided by the underlying zoning district.
The subdivision enhancement overlay district (SE) encourages creative and
efficient subdivision designs and the voluntary provision of subdivision and
community benefit features, including areas of open space, streetscape
enhancements and other desirable subdivision and community design features. All
subdivisions located within a subdivision enhancement overlay district (SE)
shall require a layout that achieves the following objectives:
   (1)   The voluntary provision of streetscape enhancements and improvements
by the developer, including, but not limited to, the dedication and improvement
of wider street rights of way than typically required by the city, with
associated street landscaping, street tree plantings, street medians,
pedestrian and biking facilities, and other streetscape enhancements, buffering
and screening treatments.
   (2)   The voluntary provision of park and open space areas and associated
improvements, including the preservation of natural features located on the
development site and other open space and park areas with associated
improvements, including pedestrian trails, children's play equipment, benches,
drinking fountains and landscaping improvements for the benefit of subdivision
and community residents.
   (3)   Provides subdivision design and enhancement features, including unique
and visually attractive entryways, subdivision and community landscape
treatments, public art pieces, and consistent architectural features and
building design themes.
   (4)   Provides convenience in layout and a variety of lot sizes. (Ord. 2005-
13, 2005)
16.07.502: APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS:
In addition to the requirements for a zoning districts map amendment, as
provided by chapter 5 of this title, an application for a zoning districts map
amendment to establish a subdivision enhancement overlay district (SE) shall
provide:
Identification of all sensitive lands areas. A sensitive lands determination
and inventory shall be provided, if applicable, consistent with the
requirements of chapter 8 of this title, which identifies all sensitive lands
areas that may be located within the property boundaries proposed for the
establishment of a subdivision enhancement overlay district (SE). (Ord. 2005-
13, 2005)
16.07.503: APPROVAL AND DESIGNATION:
As an overlay district, the identification of the allowed uses, development
requirements and standards, and all other applicable requirements, are
determined and controlled by the underlying zoning district, or "base zone",
unless such standards are modified to the extent provided by the subdivision
enhancement overlay district (SE).
The application of the subdivision enhancement overlay district (SE) to any
areas proposed to be subdivided for residential uses shall require the approval
of a zoning districts map amendment application, as provided by chapter 5 of
this title, concurrent with the approval of a subdivision application. If
approved, and as an example only, a zoning districts map amendment application
to allow a subdivision enhancement overlay district (SE) for an area located
within an existing residential R-1-10 district, would be identified on the
zoning districts map as R-1-10(SE), identifying the residential R-1-10 district
as the underlying district with a subdivision enhancement overlay district (SE)
as the "overlay" district. (Ord. 2005-13, 2005)
16.07.504: ZONING DISTRICTS ALLOWED:
A subdivision enhancement overlay district (SE) shall only be applied to
property located within the residential estates RE-20.0, RE-17.5, RE-15.0 and
RE-12.5 districts and the single-family residential R-1-10 and R-1-7.5
districts. (Ord. 2009-09, 2009)
16.07.505: APPROVAL CRITERIA:
A zoning districts map amendment application to establish a subdivision
enhancement overlay district (SE) may be approved by the city council,
following the receipt of a commission recommendation, concurrent with the
approval of a subdivision application, and following the completion of all
requirements for a zoning districts map amendment application, as required by
chapter 5 of this title. The city council in approving a zoning districts map
amendment application, and the commission in formulating a recommendation,
shall find that the subdivision enhancement overlay district (SE):
   (1)   Is consistent, and does not conflict, with any policy of the general
plan.

PART 7. SUBDIVISION LOT AVERAGING OVERLAY DISTRICT (SLA)
16.07.701: PURPOSE:
The Subdivision Lot Averaging Overlay District (SLA) is provided by the City as
an "overlay district" to provide the option for residential subdivision layout
based upon average lot size rather than the strict minimum lot size
requirements of the underlying district. The Subdivision Lot Averaging Overlay
District (SLA) does not establish any allowed uses or density for the subject
property. Rather, the identification of the allowed uses and allowed density
(or base density) is provided by the underlying zoning district. The
Subdivision Lot Averaging Overlay District (SLA) allows for flexibility and
creativity in subdivision design and encourages nontraditional/non-cookie
cutter subdivision layouts. The Subdivision Lot Averaging Overlay District
(SLA) meets the intent of the underlying base zone by requiring an average lot
size equal to or greater than the base zone minimum lot size. (Ord. 2013-04,
2013)
16.07.702: APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS:
In addition to the requirements for a zoning districts map amendment, as
provided by chapter 5 of this title, an application for a zoning districts map
amendment to establish a Subdivision Lot Averaging Overlay District (SLA) shall
provide identification of all sensitive lands areas. A sensitive lands
determination and inventory shall be provided, if applicable, consistent with
the requirements of chapter 8 of this title, which identifies all sensitive
lands areas that may be located within the property boundaries proposed for the
establishment of a Subdivision Lot Averaging Overlay District (SLA). (Ord.
2013-04, 2013)
16.07.703: APPROVAL AND DESIGNATION:
As an overlay district, the identification of the allowed uses, development
requirements and standards, and all other applicable requirements, are
determined and controlled by the underlying zoning district, or "base zone".
The application of the Subdivision Lot Averaging Overlay District (SLA) to any
areas proposed to be subdivided for residential uses shall require the approval
of a zoning districts map amendment application, as provided by chapter 5 of
this title, concurrent with the approval of a subdivision application. If
approved, and as an example only, a zoning districts map amendment application
to allow a Subdivision Lot Averaging Overlay District (SLA) for an area located
within an existing Residential R-1-10 District, would be identified on the
zoning districts map as R-1-10 (SLA), identifying the Residential R-1-10
District as the underlying district with a Subdivision Enhancement Overlay
District (SLA) as the "overlay" district. (Ord. 2013-04, 2013)
16.07.704: ZONING DISTRICTS ALLOWED:
A Subdivision Lot Averaging Overlay District (SLA) shall only be applied to
property located within the Residential Estates RE-43.0, RE-37.0, RE-25.0, RE-
20.0, RE-17.5, RE-15.0 and RE-12.5 Districts and the Single-Family Residential
R-1-10 District. (Ord. 2013-04, 2013; amd. Ord. 2017-17, 2017)
16.07.705: APPROVAL CRITERIA:
A zoning districts map amendment application to establish a Subdivision Lot
Averaging Overlay District (SLA) may be approved by the City Council, following
the receipt of a commission recommendation, concurrent with the approval of a
subdivision application, and following the completion of all requirements for a
zoning districts map amendment application, as required by chapter 5 of this
title. The City Council in approving a zoning districts map amendment
application, and the commission in formulating a recommendation, shall find
that the Subdivision Lot Averaging Overlay District (SLA):
   (1)   Is consistent, and does not conflict, with any policy of the General
Plan;
   (2)   Meets the purposes of this chapter; and
   (3)   Meets all requirements of chapter 5 of this title, for the approval of
a zoning districts map amendment application. (Ord. 2013-04, 2013)
16.07.706: APPROVAL OF SUBDIVISION APPLICATIONS AND OTHER APPLICATIONS LOCATED
IN SUBDIVISION LOT AVERAGING OVERLAY DISTRICT:
Applications for subdivision approval or any other application for any
approval, permit or license required by all land use ordinances for lands
located in a Subdivision Lot Averaging Overlay District (SLA) shall be
submitted and reviewed in accordance with the requirements and procedures of
all land use ordinances, as applicable. (Ord. 2013-04, 2013)
16.07.707: LOT AVERAGING FORMULA:
The total combined square footage of all lots divided by the total number of
lots shall be equal to or greater than the base zone minimum lot size. (Ord.
2013-04, 2013)
16.07.708: MINIMUM LOT SIZE REQUIREMENTS:
A maximum of twenty five percent (25%) of the total lots may be less than
minimum allowed lot size of the base zone. No lot shall be less than seventy
five percent (75%) of the minimum lot size of the base zone. (Ord. 2013-04,
2013)
16.07.709: DEVELOPMENT/LOT STANDARDS:
All lots within the subdivision lot averaging overlay district (SLA) shall
comply with the development/lot standards of the underlying zone found in
sections
16.33.103, table 33-3 and 16.33.104, table 33-4 of this title. (Ord. 2013-04,
2013)
PART 8. SHORT TERM OVERLAY DISTRICT
16.07.801: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this zone was to designate areas in the community where rental
of residential units on an overnight or short term basis were believed to be,
at that time, in the best interests of the community, and to aid the
development of housing in those areas, particularly by owners who reside
elsewhere and wish to rent their units when not in use. "Short term" shall be
defined to mean a period of thirty (30) days or less.
(Ord. 2015-04, 2015; amd. Ord. 2022-14, 2022)
16.07.802: APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS:
The short term rental overlay district (STRO) is only permitted in those areas
already approved and vested through their compliance with Ordinance 2015-04. No
further applications for a short term rental district (STRO) will be accepted
or approved in a residential zone.
In addition to the requirements for a zoning districts map amendment, as
provided by chapter 5 of this title, an application for a zoning districts map
amendment to establish a short term rental overlay district (STRO) shall
provide
   Identification of all sensitive lands areas. A sensitive lands determination
and inventory shall be provided, if applicable, consistent with the
requirements of chapter 8 of this title, which identifies all sensitive lands
areas that may be located within the property boundaries proposed for the
establishment of a short term rental overlay district (STRO).
(Ord. 2015-04, 2015; amd. Ord. 2022-14, 2022)
16.07.803: APPROVAL AND DESIGNATION:
As an overlay district, the identification of the allowed uses, development
requirements and standards, and all other applicable requirements, are
determined and controlled by the underlying zoning district, or "base zone",
unless such standards were modified to the extent provided by the short term
rental overlay district (STRO)set forth in Ordinance 2015-04.
(Ord. 2015-04, 2015; amd. Ord. 2022-14, 2022)
16.07.804: ZONING DISTRICTS ALLOWED:
A short term rental overlay district (STRO) previously approved and vested in a
residential zone, shall be identified on the Land Use Plan as "Recreational
Resort - STRO" and on the Zoning Map by "STRO" near the underlying zoning
designation.
(Ord. 2015-04, 2015; amd. Ord. 2022-14, 2022)
16.07.805: SHORT TERM RENTAL PROJECT PLAN REQUIRED:
A short term rental project plan ("project plan") was required to be presented
to the commission for recommendation, and approved by the city council, as part
of the application for a zoning districts map amendment to establish a short
term rental overlay district (STRO). The project plan must achieve, and must
have identified techniques to provide, a short term rental development with
uniform and compatible site and building standards when the project area is
completely built out. The project plan was required to also demonstrate
compliance with the requirements of this chapter, all provisions of this title,
and all other land use ordinances, as applicable.
The project plan may have been required to be accompanied by a development
agreement. Regardless of the size and ownership of lands proposed to be
included within a short term rental development overlay district (STRO), all
subdivisions are now required to have a development agreement prior to
receiving final plat approval. The required project plan shall include
amenities and elements to create, or complement a short term rental area.
The project plan and development agreement shall include all property proposed
for a short term rental development overlay district (STRO) and shall show all
phases of the development (including any phasing plans). Once approved by the
city council, the project plan and development agreement shall be controlling
for all required future approvals, permits and licenses, including, but not
limited to, subdivision and use applications, and any additional procedural
requirements set forth in this chapter, this title and all other land use
ordinances, as applicable.
(Ord. 2015-04, 2015; amd. Ord. 2022-14, 2022)
16.07.806: APPROVAL CRITERIA:
A zoning districts map amendment application to establish a short term rental
overlay district (STRO) must have been approved by the city council, following
the receipt of a commission recommendation, concurrent with the approval of any
required use application, and following the completion of all requirements for
a zoning districts map amendment application, as required by chapter 5 of this
title. The city council in approving a zoning districts map amendment

   (1)   Protect and preserve the sensitive lands areas of the city, as defined
by this chapter and this title. Such sensitive lands resources include, but are
not limited to: lava fields, major hillsides, ridges and ridgelines, knolls,
mesas, cuestas, escarpments, boulder outcroppings, large boulders, canyons,
natural drainage areas and other areas of visual significance.
   (2)   Protect the health, welfare and safety of all residents, and minimize
any risks to life and property.
   (3)   Minimize the potential for demands on the fiscal resources of the city
to mitigate and correct any risks to the health, welfare and safety of the
public, property owners, individuals, public infrastructure, facilities and
services, and private investment.
   (4)   Preserve the natural setting of the city to maintain and strengthen
private property values, provide a desirable environment for businesses and
residents, protect and enhance the city economy, and protect the quality of
life and amenities of existing and future residents.
   (5)   Guide and require responsible land use and development for those lands
identified to have development limitations due to environmental sensitivity.
   (6)   Require that all development and construction located on sensitive
lands areas occur in harmony with the natural features and topography of the
site, thereby reducing visual and site impacts.
   (7)   Establish a sensitive lands development process that requires
applicants to select suitable development sites on their property through the
use of slope calculations, maximum land holding capacity, or development
agreements to determine the appropriate density, intensity, design and location
of structures and improvements.
   (8)   Permit the flexibility to modify or remove relatively small
topographic features which may have slopes distinctly different from
surrounding property in order to facilitate reasonably efficient development in
a particular area. The exclusion of such features or areas shall not be
contrary to the overall purpose of this chapter.
   (9)   Establish a sensitive lands committee as a recommending body to staff,
planning commission and city council. The sensitive lands committee will review
proposed projects in the sensitive lands overlay district based on this
chapter.
   (10)   Establish a method of protecting sensitive lands by minimizing its
disturbance by development while allowing for land owners to develop lands in a
responsible manner and minimizing the economic impact. (Ord. 2014-08, 2014;
amd. Ord. 2023-26, 2023)
16.08.202: APPLICABILITY:
The standards, guidelines and procedures established by this chapter shall
apply to all lands lying within the sensitive lands overlay district as
delineated on the Sensitive Lands Map attached to the ordinance codified herein
or, in rare cases, in other areas deemed to meet the intent of this chapter by
the city staff. In addition, all properties seeking annexation or preapproval
of projects pending annexation to the city will be evaluated according to the
standards and procedures outlined in this chapter. (Ord. 2023-26, 2023)
16.08.203: SENSITIVE LANDS MAP AND OVERLAY DISTRICT:
The sensitive lands overlay district is delineated on the Sensitive Lands Map
attached to the ordinance codified herein.
The purpose of the sensitive lands map is to identify areas that may contain
sensitive or unique geological features within the City of Ivins. The map is
designed as an aid for general planning to indicate where more detailed, site-
specific special studies are required. The map is not a substitute for site-
specific investigations. Sensitive lands boundaries shown on the map are
approximate and are subject to change with additional information. Furthermore,
small, localized areas of sensitive lands may exist on a project site but their
identification may be limited by data availability or map scale. (Ord. 2023-26,
2023)

impacts associated with streets, street locations and other infrastructure.
   (4)   Benching And Terracing Prohibited: No cutting, grading, filling,
excavating, benching or terracing of any proposed lot or parcel shall be
permitted or authorized to occur outside of the maximum limits of disturbance
area for each lot or parcel, as provided herein.
   (5)   Maximum Limits Of Disturbance Area: The maximum area of any lot or
parcel that may be disturbed shall be limited as determined by the average
slope of the subdivision lot or parcel, as provided by
table 8-3  of this section. The maximum area of any lot or parcel that may be
disturbed may be increased, as further provided by table 8-3 of this section,
if the lot or parcel is located in an area within a planned development overlay
(PD) district. The maximum limits of disturbance area shall be identified on
each lot or parcel and shall include all graded, excavated, filled or otherwise
disturbed areas, the area occupied by the primary building, all accessory
building areas, areas of hard surfacing, including driveways, walkways, patios,
off street parking areas, and all areas of disturbance or nonnative vegetation.

blend the wall with the surrounding landscape colors and features. All exposed
portions of any retaining walls shall be treated and finished and be a color so
that no untreated concrete, concrete block or similar materials are visible.
   (14)   Transition Areas: For projects located in areas that transition from
areas with slopes less than eight percent (8%) to areas greater than or equal
to eight percent (8%). A transition area shall be defined as the area within
the slope of the first twenty five feet (25') of vertical rise in residential
areas and the first thirty five feet (35') of vertical rise in commercial
areas. See figure 8-113 of this section for illustration.
      (a)   Transition areas shall be exempted from the slope restrictions of

16.09.103: WHEN REQUIRED:
All development applications, including subdivisions, whether residential,
commercial or multi-use, shall trigger the requirement for a development
agreement to be approved by the city council, regardless of whether it is to be
constructed in a single phase or multiple phases. However, a development
agreement is not required as a condition for developing land if the city’s land
use regulations establish all applicable standards for development on the land.
(Ord. 2015-15, 2015; amd. Ord. 2021-11, 9-2-2021; amd. Ord. 2023-11, 2023)

provision of all features, dedications and improvements.
      (g)   A listing of all project features and facilities being voluntarily
provided to the city, in addition to those typically required by all land use
ordinances.
      (h)   In high density residential zones (R-1-5 to Multi-Family),
developments having twenty-five units or more shall have a requirement that a
minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the units are sold to owner occupants.
      (i)   Other conditions, terms, restrictions and requirements for
subsequent actions and approvals.
   (2)   If the development agreement restricts an applicant’s rights under
clearly established state law, the development agreement must contain a clear
disclosure, using bold type and a larger font, of the rights being restricted.

the development agreement is consistent with state law and the city’s land use
regulations. (Ord. 2015-15, 2015; amd. Ord. 2023-11, 2023)
16.09.106: APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND REGULATIONS:
All provisions of a development agreement shall comply with state law and, to
the extent allowed by state law, the city’s land use regulations governing the
uses of the land, density, design, improvement and construction standards and
specifications in effect at the time of the execution of the agreement. A
development agreement may not:
   (1)   Limit the city’s authority in the future to:
      (a)   Enact a land use regulation; or
      (b)   Take any action allowed under state code section 10-8-84;
   (2)   Require the city to change the zoning designation of an area of land
within the city in the future;
   (3)   Allow a use or development of land that applicable land use
regulations governing the area subject to the development agreement would
otherwise prohibit. (Ord. 2015-15, 2015; amd. Ord. 2023-11, 2023)
16.09.107: PERIODIC REVIEW:
The zoning administrator should review a development agreement periodically, at
which time the applicant, or the applicant’s successor, shall be required to
demonstrate good faith compliance with the terms of the development agreement.
If the zoning administrator finds, based on the evidence, that the applicant
has not complied in good faith with all terms or conditions of the agreement,
the zoning administrator shall recommend to the city council that the agreement
be enforced as written, modified, or terminated. (Ord. 2015-15, 2015)

development agreement, the city recorder shall record the development agreement
in the office of the Washington County recorder. The recorded copy of the
development agreement shall be considered the official copy of said agreement.
The benefits, rights and obligations of a development agreement shall be
binding upon and shall inure to all successors to the original parties to the
agreement. (Ord. 2015-15, 2015; amd. Ord. 2023-11, 2023)
16.09.110: MODIFICATION OR SUSPENSION TO COMPLY WITH STATE LAW:

IMAGES/0-0-0-3474.png]
 
         (i)   When drainage conditions allow, the developer, as approved by
the City, shall make a best effort to set the centerline elevation of all
adjacent roadways equal to the elevation of the existing natural grade at the
new development boundary line.
         (ii)   The pad elevation of the lot adjacent to the new development
shall be set no higher than 12-inches above the lowest point of the approved
drainage facility (usually curb and gutter) unless there is a high risk of
flooding that might require a higher pad.
         (iii)   A new privacy wall may be required to be built unless the
existing wall is designed to handle additional height and soil retention.
         (iv)   Building constructed on the new lot pads must be limited to 18-
feet height above the pad, with 4:12 pitch or less hipped roofing or flat roofs
with 50 percent at no higher than 15-feet and the remaining no higher than 13-
feet. No roof top patios shall be allowed on these lots.
         (v)   These requirements also apply when a development is uphill and
adjacent to collector/arterial street.
      (e)   When drainage conditions or excessive slopes reasonably prevents
lowering the road, as per the requirements above, such that the new lot pad
elevation is more than 2-feet above the average natural existing grade at the
property boundary of the new development, then the following additional
restrictions apply (See Figure 11-8):
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/d893e1fd2f01258397edc51c3aecb0cc2a58e863/
IMAGES/0-0-0-3472.png]
 
         (i)   If the lot is not considered to be high flood risk and has an
available location to drain properly, the pad elevation shall be lowered up to
2-feet (maximum) below the top of the curb measured at the center of the lot,
but may be less if the pad elevation is no higher than 2-feet above the average
natural existing grade elevation at the property/development boundary.
         (ii)   In the rear of the lot, the developer shall install privately
maintained underground (to handle 10-year storm events) and above ground (to
handle 100-year storm events) drainage facilities as part of the required
development improvements.
         (iii)   The developer is required to increase building setback as
follows. New setback shall be the setback as required by zoning plus the
additional setback. The additional setback shall be calculated as 5-feet plus 2
feet for every 1 foot of grade difference between the average natural existing
grade at the development boundary and the approved pad elevation of the lot.
         (iv)   A new privacy wall shall be installed at a distance equal to
the additional setback distance unless the rear yard grade is lowered to within
1-foot of the average natural existing grade elevation at the property/
development boundary.
         (vi)   Building constructed on the new lot pads must be limited to 18-
feet height above the pad, with 3:12 pitch or less hipped roofing or flat roofs
with 50 percent at no higher than 15-feet and the remaining no higher than 13-
feet. Roof top patios shall be allowed on these lots.
         (vii)   Walkout basements or daylight out basements are allowed if it
meets the same height restrictions identified above and finished floor
elevation of the main floor is no higher than 6-inches above the approved pad
elevation.
      (f)   When designing grades of lot pads and roads adjacent to undeveloped
property on the uphill side, the following requirements apply, (see Figure 11-
9).

         (i)   The privacy wall shall be required as part of the subdivision
improvements and shall be set at existing natural grade and shall not retain
any soil unless otherwise approved by the City. It shall be constructed and
engineered to retain up to 3-feet of soil by a future development unless the
developer can show that that much soil retention is unlikely.
         (ii)   The developer shall evaluate whether there is a need to collect
run-on drainage that may be interrupted by the privacy wall. If the
interruption of run-on drainage for any reason could cause harm or damage to
the undeveloped property, then the privacy wall must be offset from the
property line to create space for a drainage facility. Alternatively, the
developer may coordinate obtaining a drainage easement so that the privacy wall
may be placed on the property line.
         (iii)   The adjacent building pads shall be set at an elevation to
minimize the future difference. It may be necessary, where reasonable, to raise
new lot pads up to 4-feet above the adjacent roadway curb to minimize this
difference as approved by the City.
   (5)   All grading design shall consider drainage as follows:
      (a)   Drainage shall be directed away from structures and directly
discharged to an approved public drainage facility (i.e., public street, public
storm drain).
      (b)   Whenever possible drainage should be directed to the front of the
lot.
      (c)   To minimize the height of retaining walls between lots when
developing on steep slopes, the developer should increase pad elevations on the
uphill side of a street and decrease pad elevations on the downhill side of a
street as much as possible as shown in Figure 11-10.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/d893e1fd2f01258397edc51c3aecb0cc2a58e863/
IMAGES/0-0-0-3468.png]
 
         (i)   Maximum pad height is 4-feet above curb on driveway side of the
lot unless the lot is wide enough to accommodate a side garage for which case
the maximum driveway slope is 18 percent.
         (ii)   Minimum pad height for lots that drain to the street is 1-foot
above the curb (or similar approved drainage facility) at the lowest point in
the street frontage.
         (iii)   Pad heights may need to be raised above minimum in areas with
high flood risk as determined by the City Engineer.
         (iv)   When grade difference between two adjacent lots is greater than
4 feet. The building setback on the downhill lot shall be increased in
accordance with the following table:
 
Table 11-1 Increased Setback for Development in Steep Slopes
Difference in Pad Elevations in Feet Additional Setback to be added to setback
                                     required by zoning
0 to 4 feet                          None
4.1 to 5 feet                        5 feet

> 15 feet                            Determined by City Council
 
      (d)   Drainage across property lines is prohibited except in extreme
situations and may not in any case exceed that which existed prior to grading.
      (e)   In a development where a fence or wall that would interrupt surface
drainage is allowed but not installed with the development improvements, all
drainage and grading must be designed as if such fencing were existing.
   (6)   If the pad elevations for two (2) adjacent eleven thousand (11,000)
square foot or smaller lots vary more than two feet (2'), a retaining wall
shall be required.
      (a)   If retaining wall is to be constructed on the property line, the
retaining wall shall be constructed of masonry or concrete. and designed so
that a privacy wall up to 6-feet in height may be constructed on top of the
retaining wall by drilling in reinforcement dowels.
      (b)   Gravity rock retaining wall shall not be allowed on side lots
unless the lot width is wider than 110-feet.

      (a)   The following consistent wall design is required for use in wall
and fence installations adjacent to all major and minor arterial and collector
streets including, but not limited to, Snow Canyon Parkway, Old Highway 91, 400
East, 200 East, 400 South, 400 West, Tuacahn Drive, and Snow Canyon Drive:

"Sandstone" except on Old Highway 91 which shall be colored "Geneva".
         (ii)   All fencing walls shall have one split faced textured row of
block set on a row beneath the capstone block, except for Center Street from
200 East eastward and Snow Canyon Parkway which shall have all fence block be
split faced textured.
         (iii)   Capstones shall always be 4-inches tall and overhang the wall
front by 1-inch, except on Old Highway 91 which shall be 2-inches tall with no
overhang.
         (iv)   CMU Pilasters with smooth faced block shall be set at each
change in wall direction.
         (v)   Fencing/walls shall be segmented horizontally with the
appearance of randomness in variable lengths with no straight unbroken wall
segments longer than 40' and no intermediary pilasters in any one segment.
         (vi)   Short horizontal offset distances between the longer wall
segments should have an appearance of randomness in variable lengths between
24-inches up to 72-inches. In some limited cases where the available space is
constricted due to issues that are not in the control of the developer, the
offset maybe reduced to as low as 10-inches.
         (vii)   Each adjacent wall segment shall be at least one block higher
or lower than an adjacent segment, preferably segments that are closer to the
street are lower than segments that are further away.
         (viii)   If due to excessive grade change, the wall needs to increase
in height at a faster rate than one block per long segment than a height change
may be allowed in the middle of the long segment.
         (ix)   Gates to rear yards are not encouraged but are allowed when
requested. They must be at least 50-percent screened and placed in a
perpendicular orientation to the street in offset space between the longer
segment walls.
         (x)   Fencing/walls, generally, when possible, should be centered on
property lines. Maintenance of the wall is shared between both property owners.
Responsibility of repair of walls depends on which side the wall damage or
blemish occurred. Gates are maintained by the individual private property owner
that has the sole use of the gate.
         (xi)   If a developer can provide an acceptable justification that the
design is not compatible to a proposed development and a different
architectural design is proposed that does not use any prohibited materials
given in the following paragraph, exceptions to this consistent design may be
evaluated and approved on a case by case basis as part of a subdivision
preliminary plan approval or a conditional use permit approval by the City
Council.
         (xii)   A landscape buffer width identified by the Transportation
Master Plan in its approved cross-sections shall be considered an average width
that shall be allowed to be narrowed by no more than 25 percent if the average

buildings on and adjacent to the property.
      (11)   Quality Of Construction: All walls and fences shall be constructed
in a workmanlike manner according to industry standards.
      (12)   Maintenance Of Fences And Walls: All fences and walls shall be
maintained in good repair. Areas adjacent to the wall or fence shall be
maintained by the property owner.
      (13)   Retaining Walls Used In Association With Fences: Retaining walls
used in association with any fence shall be constructed of materials, or be
finished to blend the wall with the surrounding landscape colors and features.
All exposed portions of any retaining wall(s) shall be constructed using

16.18.101: GENERAL:
The general intent of these multi-family residential design guidelines and
standards is to improve the overall quality of multi-family development in
Ivins City, to ensure the compatibility of multi-family development with
surrounding land uses. These multi-family design guidelines and standards shall
apply to all new multi-family development within Ivins City. (Ord. 2018-05,
2018)
16.18.102: SITE PLANNING:
These guidelines and standards are intended: to improve site planning, to
enhance the image of the City, reflect unique site characteristics, and provide
strong neighborhood environments; to protect natural site features, open space
and use and incorporate such features and areas as community amenities; and to
provide usable open space and maintain significant natural areas for the use
and enjoyment by residents of the multi-family development.
   (1)   Lot Coverage And Density:
      (a)   Density Calculation: In all multi-family High Density Residential
zoning districts, densities shall be calculated as a percentage of the total
square footage of the horizontal cross section of all residential structures at
their largest point as compared to the total square footage of the parcel(s)
included in the multi-family development. In addition to structures intended
for human habitation, residential structures include but are not limited to
garages, storage units, covered patios, and any similar structures. In no
event, shall a property owner be allowed a base density that is less than the
density that would be achieved using an R-1-5 zoning district.
      (b)   Maximum Density With No Density Bonus: The maximum allowed base
densities with no bonus improvements are as follows:
         (i)   Fifteen percent (15%) for multi-family developments with
standard height restrictions.
         (ii)   Twenty percent (20%) for multi-family developments limiting the
height of all structures located within fifty feet (50') of the outside
boundary of the multi-family development to eighteen feet (18').
         (iii)   Twenty-five percent (25%) for multi-family development
limiting the height of all structures to eighteen feet (18').
   (c)   Maximum Density With Density Bonus: The maximum allowed base densities
with bonus improvements are as follows:
      (i)   An additional ten percent (10%) for multi-family developments with
standard height restrictions.
      (ii)   An additional fifteen percent (15%) for multi-family developments
limiting the height of all structures located within fifty feet (50') of the
outside boundary of the multi-family development to eighteen feet (18').
      (iii)   An additional twenty percent (20%) for multi-family development
limiting the height of all structures to eighteen feet (18').
For purposes of this section, the ten percent (10%), fifteen percent (15%), and
twenty percent (20%) respective bonuses are referred to as the "Density Bonus".
   (2)   Open Space: The intent of this section is to create areas of usable
open space for passive and active recreation that are easily accessed by
residents, provide focal points for community recreation and interaction, and
add to the overall quality of life for residents. Usable open space should be
integrated purposefully into the overall design of the development and not
merely be residual areas left over after buildings and parking lots are sited.
      (a)   Minimum Usable Open Space Required:
         (i)   All new multi-family developments shall set aside at least a
minimum area of site acreage as usable open space for the passive and active
recreational use and enjoyment of the development's residents. The usable open
space shall be aggregated into meaningful, quality open spaces. Clustering of
buildings is encouraged to minimize small, narrow, unassigned strips in front
of and between buildings. Open space shall be clearly identified on the
development plan.
         (ii)   The minimum amount of usable open space shall be eight hundred
(800) square feet for the first two (2) units and two hundred (200) square feet

minimum of two (2) architectural features that provide articulation and
shadowing. The length of required offset planes shall be twenty percent to
fifty percent (20% - 50%) of the total building length, with said percentages
reduced by ten percent (10%) each if one additional wall plane is provided. If
two (2) or more additional wall planes are provided beyond the minimum
requirement, the minimum length of any face shall be eight feet (8').
Architectural features may include covered porches, balconies, window pop outs,
inset windows, bays, etc., and shall be spread out over the length of the
building.
      (c)   Roof Variations: Roofs shall also provide variation in a manner
similar to wall variations. The same lengths used for determining the minimum
number of wall offsets shall also apply in determining the minimum number of
roof variations. However, the minimum roof offset of parapets (flat roofs) or
eve lines (pitched roofs) shall be twelve inches (12") or five percent (5%) of
the overall building height, whichever is greater. The use of front facing
gables, dormers, hip roof formations, etc., may be regarded as the required
offset for pitched roofs.
   (4)   Architectural Detail:
      (a)   Each building in a multi-family development should have a
definitive, consistent style.
      (b)   A consistent level of detail and finish on all sides of a building
shall be provided; however, a lesser degree of detail is allowed on non-street
facing sides.
      (c)   All buildings shall incorporate a minimum of three (3) additional
architectural features or repetitive details such as covered porches,
balconies, window pop outs, inset windows, bays, etc., and shall be spread out

berming being used to further screen them from view from perimeter streets.
(Ord. 2008-21, 2009)
16.18.107: LANDSCAPE:
Landscaping is a visible indicator of quality development and shall be an
integral part of every multi-family project, not merely located in leftover
portions of the site. Landscaping is intended to visually tie the entire
development together, define major entryways and circulation (both vehicular
and pedestrian) and parking patterns, and, where appropriate, help buffer less
intensive adjacent land uses.
   (1)   Landscaping Required:
      (a)   Landscaping is required in all setback areas and open space areas.

chapter 10, "Outdoor Lighting", of this Code. (Ord. 2008-21, 2009)
16.18.109: FENCING:
While fencing is required to buffer uses, it can create a visually monotonous
streetscape. These standards provide fencing and wall standards that are
visually appealing, complement the overall design of the development and
surrounding properties, and provide visual interest to pedestrians and
motorists.
   (1)   Fencing And Walls: All fencing and walls shall conform to section
16.11.135 of this title, and sections
15.05.502 and
15.05.503 of this Code. (Ord. 2008-21, 2009)
16.18.110: EQUIPMENT AND SERVICE AREA SCREENING:

condensers, shall not be located on pitched roofs or attached to the sides of
structures.
      (b)   Mechanical equipment may be located on flat roofs when fully
screened by appropriate parapet walls that blend with the architecture of the
structure. Parapet screening walls shall be included in the original
architectural drawings and not installed as an afterthought. Parapet walls
shall be constructed and designed to reduce noise from mechanical equipment.
      (c)   Ground mounted mechanical/utility equipment screening shall be an
integral part of the building structure and architecture and shall not give the
appearance of being "tacked on" to the structure. (Ord. 2008-21, 2009)
16.18.111: REDEVELOPMENT OF MULTI-FAMILY:
   (1)   Density: Up to six (6) units of existing density may be replaced with
the same or less density in townhouses.
   (2)   Parking: A minimum of two (2) parking spaces per unit is required;
however, no covered parking is required.
   (3)   Setbacks: The setbacks applicable to the Townhouse Zoning District
shall apply, i.e., ten feet (10').
   (4)   Open Space: The open space requirements of this chapter are not
applicable. (Ord. 2017-06, 2017)

   (3)   Mix Of Scales: A mixture of building scales is desired, particularly
in the case of larger buildings, with some elements scaled for appreciation
from the adjoining street and others for the enjoyment by pedestrians within
the development.
   (4)   Site Design And Layout: All site plans shall recognize and preserve,
as much as practicable, the natural features and sensitive areas occurring on
the site. Areas of sensitive lands occur throughout the city, including areas
of historic value, scenic beauty, unusual or hazardous topography, lands
subject to flooding, or lands possessing exceptional views (see also chapter 8
of this title). Site design and planning shall include the following:
      (a)   Arrangement: Recognizing that all views cannot be protected, all
buildings and structures should be arranged to preserve and provide open space
and to protect views as much as practicable. The locations of all buildings and
structures shall recognize the existing topography and natural features of the
site, including lava rock, rock outcroppings and drainageways. All natural
features shall be preserved, as much as practicable, and integrated into the
site plan design.
      (b)   Open Space: Provide an interconnected system of open space areas.

street where main entrances to buildings are located shall be provided. It
shall consist of:
         (i)   Walkway: A continuously defined five foot (5') minimum width
walkway from the public sidewalk to the building front walkway. This feature
may be included as part of the required fifteen percent (15%) landscaping so
long as it incorporates landscaping as part of the walkway that enhances the
project.
         (ii)   Landscaping Requirements: The walkway shall count as
landscaping for the parking lot landscaping requirements. Landscaping next to
the walkway shall have a ten percent (10%) area bonus in landscaping
requirements. Said bonus shall not accrue to the point where it reduces the
parking lot edge buffer.
         (iii)   Exceptions: Businesses that do not typically generate
pedestrian access shall not be required to comply with this subsection. (Ord.
2012-08, 2012)
   (5)   Views, Openness And Massing: Due to the economic value and community
quality and character created by the surrounding scenic beauty, it is essential
that the city preserve general access to significant views, openness and
minimize massing. These views include the Red Mountain, the red rock formations
north of Kayenta, Snow Canyon, Pine Valley Mountain, Land Hill, the lava flows,
and other unique features.
      (a)   The following streets have been identified as those corridors which
are significant to pedestrians, cyclists and motorists. Properties adjacent to
these streets shall be limited to setbacks and building heights to the extent
reasonably feasible as per figures 2-A and 2-B of this section, or to the
actual view angle if determined to be greater than fifteen degrees (15°) using
methods similar to those used in said figures 2-A and 2-B to preserve
significant views. Where none of the above stated views are compromised or when
the view angle to such views is less than fifteen degrees (15°), then the
minimum setback shall be thirty feet (30'). If the view angle calculation
determines a setback greater than thirty feet (30'), then up to one-third (1/3)
of a building, or cluster of buildings, can extend to the minimum setback.
Architectural features on the building such as balconies, awnings, trellises,
pop outs, etc., may encroach to a minimum twenty five foot (25') setback.
Architectural features of the type considered to be single level extensions,
such as covered patios, entryways or eating areas with a maximum height of
twelve feet (12') for a flat roof or fifteen feet (15') for a pitched roof may
encroach to a minimum twenty foot (20') setback.

16.33.105, table 33-5 of this title. (Ord. 2014-13, 2014)
   (6)   Landscaping Design Standards: Landscape improvements shall meet all
minimum standards set forth in the zone. Landscaping should be designed to
preserve and complement the desert character of the natural landscape, mitigate
building and parking lot impact, add aesthetic charm, interest and character,
and conserve water.
Landscaping is an integral element of site development. Landscaping complements
the architecture of all proposed buildings and structures and provides visual
interest and variety, provides screening elements, provides year round site
beautification, blends with the natural landscape and highlights building
design features. Landscape designers shall recognize the following landscape
design principles with landscape plans:
      (a)   Landscape Buffers: Landscape buffers between dissimilar or
conflicting land uses shall be provided to soften the effects of any adjacent
commercial building and/or service area.
      (b)   Transitional Landscaped Areas: Where new development adjoins areas

   (8)   Signage: See chapter 21, "Signs", of this title. (Ord. 2012-08, 2012)
16.19.103: BUILDING DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
   (1)   Structures To Blend With Environment: It is the vision of the city
that all buildings and their associated facilities and improvements will blend
with the forms, colors and textures of the city's desert setting. The city
encourages creative and varied architecture reflecting its desert character,
avoiding extremes and uncharacteristic themes, styles and color. The goal is
for all manmade structures to blend harmoniously with the natural environment.
To preserve and protect a desert setting and to preserve and increase property
values, all proposed uses shall incorporate building and site design elements
as follows:
      (a)   Horizontal Emphasis: Building designs and elements with a
horizontal emphasis are preferred. Vertical design elements exaggerating
building height shall be avoided.

      (b)   View Protection: Care shall be taken to control the proportion and
massing of buildings to minimize the obstruction of all views.
      (c)   Building Massing: In order to maximize the integration of manmade
structures with the natural environment and to minimize undesirable
distractions, land use applications shall demonstrate the incorporation of
techniques for reducing the apparent size and bulk of proposed buildings and
structures. At a minimum the following techniques shall be utilized,
recognizing that other techniques may be incorporated as well:
         (i)   Coherent Building Design: All sides of a building may have a
visual or other impact, and shall be coherently designed and treated. A facade
occupying a single wall of a building, not related to the rest of the building
sides (false front or storefront) shall be prohibited. A consistent level of
detail and finish on all sides of a building shall be provided; however, a
lesser degree of detail is allowed on non-street facing sides.
         (ii)   Wall Variations: Continuous building wall surfaces shall be
relieved with variations of wall planes or overhangs that create shadow areas
and add visual interest. All sides of a building visible from a public street
or other significant public views shall have variation in wall planes of at
least two feet (2') or five percent (5%) of the longest adjacent wall,
whichever is greater. In order to provide articulation and shadow areas,
offsets in wall planes shall be required as follows: buildings less than fifty
feet (50') in length shall not be required to have an offset but shall be
required to have a minimum of two (2) architectural features; buildings that
are fifty feet to one hundred feet (50' - 100') shall have a minimum of two (2)
face planes; and buildings greater than one hundred feet (100') shall provide
one additional offset per one hundred feet (100') of building length. Two (2)
nonadjoining faces may be on the same plane. A minimum of two (2) architectural
features shall be provided for each one hundred feet (100') of building length.
The length of required offset planes shall be fifteen percent to fifty percent
(15% - 50%) of the total building length, with said percentages reduced to ten
percent to forty percent (10% - 40%) if one additional wall plane is provided.
If two (2) or more additional wall planes are provided beyond the minimum
requirement, the minimum length of any face shall be ten feet (10').
Architectural features may include covered porches, balconies with railings,
window pop outs, inset windows, bays, etc., and shall be spread out over the
length of the building.
         (iii)   Reduced Upper Levels: Upper levels shall have reduced floor
area to minimize building mass. No second story shall exceed ninety percent
(90%) of the ground floor footprint. For purposes of this calculation, single
level elements such as covered porches and patios, (including those using slat
roofs), open rooms with walls at least eight feet (8') in height, and
permanently affixed trellises may be considered part of the footprint. Where
sloping sites create structures that are more than two (2) stories, the first
(ground) level floor shall be considered as the floor level closest to that of
the primary street access.
         (iv)   Roof Variations: Dominant rooflines shall be avoided. The
impact of a roofline may be minimized by a variety of roof styles, including
the use of flat or shallow pitched formations as well as variation in the
ridgelines and eave lines. Roofs shall provide variation in a manner similar to
wall variations. The same lengths used for determining the minimum number of
wall horizontal offsets set forth in subparagraph (1)(c)(ii) of this section
shall also apply in determining the minimum number of roof vertical offsets.
However, the minimum roof offset of parapets (flat roofs) or ridgelines and
eave lines (pitched roofs) shall be twelve inches (12") or five percent (5%) of
the overall building height, whichever is greater. The use of front facing
gables, dormers, hip roof formations, etc, may be considered in determining if
the required offsets for pitched roofs have been provided.
         (v)   Reduced Roof Mass: The roof of a building is often the single
greatest contributor to its mass and most obvious obstacle to the views from
adjacent properties. Visual impact is minimized when the roof is flat or a very
shallow pitch, or a hip roof formation (sloping from the sides as well as the
front and back) rather than a gabled formation (sloping from the front and back
only). Roof pitches below four to twelve (4:12) are strongly encouraged. Roof
pitches of eight to twelve (8:12) and steeper that resolve in a ridgeline are
prohibited.
         (vi)   Varying Roofline Silhouettes: Variation in the roofline
silhouette is an effective means of harmonizing buildings with their
surroundings by blending its line and form with the Red Mountain backdrop.
         (vii)   Visual Patterns: Every building should have shadow relief
created by recesses and projections. Recesses may include courtyards, entryways
or boxed window openings along the exterior of the building. Projections may
include stairs, balconies, entrances or bays. Covered walkways, breezeways,
patios, trellises, landscape areas and wide roof overhangs are encouraged to
produce shadow effects. Stepped structures may also be used to offset building
mass in sloped areas.
         (viii)   Larger Buildings And Two-Story Structures: Larger buildings
should be placed toward the interior of a development, or placed on the lower
site elevation to reduce apparent mass.
      (d)   Architectural Details: Surface details, ornaments and other
building elements that enrich the character of a building are encouraged.
Attention to detail, including all building and architectural design elements,
shall be required. The following architectural details are desirable and
encouraged:
         (i)   Stonework when implemented properly. Stone should terminate on
an inside corner.
         (ii)   Exposed beams and columns.
         (iii)   Cornices, moldings, bands, pop outs, decorative vents, cast or
sculpted features.
         (iv)   Covered entries.
         (v)   Covered walkways, breezeways, bays and balconies.
         (vi)   Enclosed courtyards and patios, trellises, landscape areas and
wide roof overhangs.
         (vii)   Accessories such as art features, benches, pots, lamps,
artwork and sculptures.
      (e)   Additions: Proposed additions to existing buildings shall
incorporate the predominant architectural features, materials and colors of the
existing buildings.
      (f)   Mechanical Equipment: Air conditioning units, generators and other
auxiliary mechanical and building equipment shall be placed at locations where
they will be least intrusive in terms of noise and appearance, particularly for
adjacent properties and public rights of way. All mechanical equipment shall be
physically screened from view so as not to be seen from public rights of way or
adjacent properties through uses of fences, walls or parapets. In the case of
roof mounted equipment, grouping of the mechanical equipment toward the uphill
parapet is encouraged; otherwise, additional parapets may be required.
Mechanical screening shall consist of a hard exterior surface that matches or
complements the adjacent building surfaces and an inner layer of nonreflective
acoustic insulation with a minimum sound transmission class (STC) of 30. Ground
mounted mechanical screening shall extend a minimum of two feet (2') higher
than the top of the equipment up to a height of six feet (6'). Above six feet
(6') it shall be the same height as the top of the equipment. All roof mounted
mechanical screening shall extend to a minimum of six inches (6") above the
mechanical equipment. All building mounted mechanical or communications
equipment shall be a color to make it as unobtrusive as possible. If located on
or adjacent to a building wall, the color of all mechanical and communications
equipment shall blend with the color and design details of the building.

   (2)   Building Scale: The size and scale of all proposed buildings and
structures should be compatible with, and not dominate, the surrounding uses
and natural features.
   (3)   Pedestrian Scale: Regardless of overall building size, elements and
facades at the pedestrian level shall achieve a sense of human scale and create
visual interest at eye level.
   (4)   Building Materials And Textures: Exterior building materials shall be
compatible with and similar to the surrounding landscape in type, texture,
color and character.
      (a)   The following materials are recommended for use on exterior walls:
         (i)   Native Stone: The use of natural or cultured stone complementing
the surroundings of the city is highly recommended. When used as an accent,
stone shall terminate at an inside corner.
         (ii)   Stucco: Stucco is a desirable exterior material, particularly
in a rough or highly textured finish.
         (iii)   Masonry: Integrally colored split faced block is generally
acceptable, as is brick in compatible earth tone blends.
         (iv)   Concrete: Exposed aggregate or colored concrete with a stamped,
pitted or other texture.
      (b)   The following materials are disallowed for use on exterior walls
except when used as architectural details:
         (i)   Unfinished block.
         (ii)   Unfinished concrete.
         (iii)   Metal.
      (c)   The following materials are recommended for sloping roofs:
         (i)   Nonreflective concrete or clay tile.
         (ii)   Wood shingles or shakes (fire retardant rated).
         (iii)   Architectural grade composition shingles.
         (iv)   Patinaed copper.
      (d)   Traditional ribbed, corrugated metal and other nonrecommended
materials are discouraged for sloping roofs.
      (e)   White, brightly colored or reflective materials are prohibited for
all roofs.
      (f)   Low profile skylights with dark framing and tinted glass are
encouraged. White framing or mirrored glass is prohibited.
   (5)   Building Material Color: The color of all exterior building materials
and surfaces shall blend the proposed new buildings with the natural
environment of the city. Color is an important and effective way to create
harmony with the natural landscape and minimize the visual impact of
structures. Color variation using compatible hues can reduce the apparent scale
and building mass. Exterior building colors that respect and enhance the
natural tones of the southern Utah environment shall be used.
      (a)   Minimize Impact: All building materials and colors shall minimize
the impact of buildings on the natural setting. All building colors shall be
earth tones and muted colors that blend and do not contrast with natural desert
colors. Wall extensions from buildings, and all walls and fences, shall be the
same or similar color and materials as the main building.
      (b)   Light Reflective Value (LRV): The LRV of materials used on all
exterior walls shall be between seven (7) (darkest value of shaded vegetation)
and thirty eight (38) (approximate value of red sandstone and soil in the
city). Generally, the more visible the structure, the lower its LRV should be.
      (c)   Color Intensity And Brightness: The strength, intensity and
brightness of the color selected (chroma) shall be in the range from very weak
(grayish) to medium weak (neutral or earth tone). Strong chroma colors should
be avoided. Stains and flat paints are encouraged.
      (d)   Finishes: High gloss paints, factory finished metals or other
materials which increase visual impacts, and aluminum, white or reflective
roofs are prohibited. Matte finishes are recommended. LRV over thirty eight
(38) and strong chroma may be allowed only for small accents and trim around
windows and doors. Chimneys, flues, vents, gutters, downspout, mechanical and
electrical equipment, railings, window shading devices and other exterior
devices shall be similar in LRV and chroma to the surrounding surfaces of the
building, unless they are a special building design feature. In such cases, a
subdued accent color may be acceptable. Bright, glossy, fluorescent and
corporate signature color schemes are strongly discouraged. The following
materials and finishes are prohibited:
         (i)   Colored plastic and fiberglass.
         (ii)   Unpainted or shiny metal details. (Ord. 2014-13, 2014; Ord.

16.23.101: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to encourage the quantity and level of lighting
necessary for safety, security and the enjoyment of outdoor living while
protecting and preserving the beauty of the night sky. The type of lighting and
the location of lighting fixtures are key components of effective lighting. It
is the intent of this chapter to effectively light areas with lighting fixtures
that limit glare and direct light onto the area to be lit.
The purpose of this chapter is to assist in implementing the Ivins City General
Plan that includes the following Vision Statement:
“Ivins is a City that values and preserves its scenic beauty and provides a
variety of intellectual, educational, cultural, recreational, historic and
economic opportunities to its diverse population and visitors. Ivins is a
vibrant community that preserves a high quality of life for residents while
promoting a resort character.”
Effective outdoor lighting enhances the City's character and identity, promotes
a pleasant and soft ambiance, protects astronomical observations, and provides
safety and security for persons and property.
Outdoor lighting has a number of functions, it must promise immediate good
vision and orientation so that an area is usable and safe at night. By means of
placement and intensity, lighting is also used to guide pedestrian and
vehicular movement and highlight areas where traffic conflicts. Lighting is
also used for architectural emphasis and effect, to attract business, and to
give a site a particular "personality". All area lighting has the ultimate
purpose of providing visibility. Good visibility is achieved through the
interaction of intensity, direction, and reflection of light so that an
observer can immediately translate received light into terms of shapes,
surfaces, distance and movement.
In order to effectively regulate these activities, communities are empowered to
establish regulations and standards for all outdoor lighting. This chapter
contains standards and guidelines to maintain appropriate levels of lighting
for safety and security while preserving, protecting, and enhancing the "night
sky" in Ivins City.
This chapter, and any rules, regulations and specifications hereafter adopted,
is initiated for the following purposes:
   (1)   To promote and protect the public health, safety and welfare.
   (2)   To preserve, protect, and enhance the natural beauty of the "night
sky".
   (3)   To encourage and promote the conservation of energy resources.
   (4)   To maintain and enhance property values.
   (5)   To adopt clear standards for all outdoor lighting and to inform the
public of those standards.
   (6)   To implement the goals and objectives of the Ivins City General Plan.
   (7)   To implement the goals and objectives of the Ivins City Design
Guidelines and Standard Specifications for Design and Construction.
   (8)   To eliminate light trespass onto abutting properties.
   (9)   To promote appropriate business.
   (10)   To allow flexibility for creative lighting.
   (11)   To avoid duplicate lighting sources.
   (12)   To enhance community image.
   (13)   To comply with adopted state energy codes.

16.31.101: POLICY CONSIDERATIONS FOR CONSTITUTIONAL TAKINGS; PURPOSE:
   (1)   It is the policy of the city to carefully consider constitutional
taking claims, in fairness to the owner of private property bringing the claim,
and in view of the uncertainty and expense involved in defending lawsuits
alleging such issues.
   (2)   At the same time, the legitimate role of the city to lawfully regulate
real property must be preserved and the public's right to require the
dedication or exaction of property consistent with the constitution. Consistent
with this policy, this chapter establishes a procedure for the review of
actions that may involve the issue of constitutional takings, as well as
providing guidelines for such considerations.
   (3)   This chapter is further intended, and shall be construed to
objectively and fairly review claims by citizens that a specific government
action should require payment of just compensation, while preserving the
ability of the city to lawfully regulate real property and fulfill its duties
and functions. (Ord. 2005-13, 2005)
16.31.102: GUIDELINES ADVISORY:

been a constitutional taking.
      (d)   A description of the property alleged to have been taken.

and after the alleged constitutional taking, the name of the party from whom
purchased, if applicable, including the relationship, if any, between the
person requesting a review and the party from whom the property was acquired.
      (f)   The nature of the property interest claimed to be affected, such
as, but not limited to, fee simple ownership or leasehold interest.

facts and information presented by the applicant to determine whether or not
the action by the land use authority constitutes a "constitutional taking", as
defined in section

   (1)   Whether the physical taking or exaction of the private real property
bears an essential nexus to a legitimate governmental interest.
   (2)   Whether a legitimate governmental interest exists for the action taken
by the city.
   (3)   Whether the property and exaction is taken roughly proportionate and
reasonably related, both in nature and extent, to the impact caused by the
activities that are the subject of the decision being reviewed.
   (4)   Other items identified by sections
16.03.118 and
16.03.119 of this title. (Ord. 2005-13, 2005)

determination regarding the above issues, and where determined to be necessary
and appropriate, shall make a recommendation to the land use authority that
made the decision giving rise to the constitutional takings claim. (Ord. 2005-

PD-SE OVERLAY DISTRICT AND EXAMPLE CALCULATIONS
PLANNED DEVELOPMENT OVERLAY DISTRICT (PD) AND SUBDIVISION ENHANCEMENT OVERLAY
DISTRICT (SE)
EXAMPLE CALCULATIONS OF BASE DENSITY, DENSITY INCENTIVES AND TOTAL ALLOWED
DENSITY
Example 1: Planned Development Overlay District (PD)
(1)   Base Density:
                                Total area of subdivision site minus 20% of
Total area available for lots = total site area minus all areas encum bered for
                                other uses (including schools, churches, public
                                facilities, etc.)
Base density                  = Total area available for lots divided by
                                minimum lot size requirement of zoning district
                             = Total allowed base density
Example, with 20 acres of total area of subdivision site and zoning district of
RE-25.0, and no areas encumbered by other uses:
Total area available for lots = 20 acres - 4 acres - 0 acres
                             = 16 acres
Base density                  = 16 acres (696,960 square feet) ÷ 25,000 square
                                feet
Total allowed base density    = 27.88 lots
 
(2)   Density Incentives:
 
                                         Total allowed base density multiplied
Maximum density incentive              = by allowed density incentives (not to
                                         exceed 30% of base density)
Provision of open space                = Maximum density incentive available is
                                         20% of total allowed base density
Improvements and enhance ments to open = Maximum density incentive available is
space areas                              5% of total allowed base density
Consistency in design elements         = Maximum density incentive available is
                                         5% of total allowed base density
Example, with a 20 acres of total area of subdivision site, total allowed base
density of 27.88 lots, and allowed density incentives of 20%:
Maximum density incentive              = 27.88 lots x 20%
Maximum density incentive              = 5.58 lots
 
(3)   Total Allowed Density:
 
Total allowed density = Total allowed base density plus maxi mum density
                        incentive
Example, with a 20 acres of total area of subdivision site, total allowed
base density of 27.88 lots and maximum density incentive of 5.58 lots:
Total allowed density = 27.88 lots + 5.58 lots
Total allowed density = 33.46 lots
Total allowed density = 33 lots (rounded down per section 16.03.112 of this
                        title)
 
 
Example 2: Subdivision Enhancement Overlay District (SE)
(1)   Base Density:
                                Total area of subdivision site minus 20% of
Total area available for lots = total site area minus all areas encum bered for
                                other uses (including schools, churches, public
                                facilities, etc.)
                                Total area available for lots divided by
Base density                  = minimum lot size requirement of base zoning
                                district
                             = Total allowed base density
Example, with a 20 acres of total area of subdivision site and zoning district
of RE-12.5, and no areas encumbered by other uses:
Total area available for lots = 20 acres - 4 acres - 0 acres
                             = 16 acres
Base density                  = 16 acres (696,960 square feet) ÷ 12,500 square
                                feet
Total allowed base density    = 55.76 lots
 
(2)   Density Incentives:
 
 
                                        Total allowed base density multiplied
Maximum density incentive             = by allowed density incentives (not to
                                        exceed 25% of base density)
Provision of open space               = Maximum density incentive available is
                                        10% of total allowed base density
Consistency in design elements        = Maximum density incentive available is
                                        5% of total allowed base density
Convenience in layout variety of lot  = Maximum density incentive available is
sizes and unique subdivision features   10% of total allowed base density
Example, with a 20 acres of total area of subdivision site, total allowed base
density of 55.76 lots and allowed density incentives of 20%:
Maximum density incentive             = 55.76 lots x 20%
Maximum density incentive             = 11.15 lots
 
(3)   Total Allowed Density:
 
Total allowed density = Total allowed base density plus maximum density
                        incentive
Example, with a 20 acres of total area of subdivision site, total allowed
base density of 55.76 lots and a maximum density incentive of 11.15 lots:
Total allowed density = 55.76 lots + 11.15 lots
Total allowed density = 66.91 lots
Total allowed density = 66 lots (rounded down per section 16.03.112 of this
                        title)
