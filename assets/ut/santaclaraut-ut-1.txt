The city council of the city of Santa Clara (the "council") finds and
determines that growth and development activity in the city will create
additional demand and need for public streets and roads, publicly owned parks,
open space and recreational facilities, storm drainage, electrical facilities,
sanitary sewer facilities, culinary water facilities, and public safety
facilities in the city and the council finds that growth and development
activity should pay a proportionate share of the cost of such planned
facilities needed to serve the growth and development activity. The council
further finds that impact fees are necessary to achieve an equitable allocation
to the costs borne in the past and to be borne in the future, in comparison to
the benefits already received and yet to be received. Therefore, pursuant to
Utah Code Annotated, title 11, chapter 36a, the council adopts this chapter to
assess impact fees for planned facilities. The provisions of this chapter shall
be liberally construed in order to carry out the purpose of the council in
establishing the impact fee program. (Ord. 2011-02)

the City Manager or City Finance Officer, and a department head, to protect

3.20.060: EXEMPTIONS:
The following transactions are exempt from the competitive bidding requirements
of this chapter. The City Manager shall determine whether or not a particular
contract or purchase is exempt under the following criteria:
   A.   When the provisions of this chapter would prevent the City from
complying with the terms and conditions of any grant, gift, or bequest that is
otherwise consistent with law.
   B.   When any purchase or encumbrance is made with State or Federal funds
and the applicable State or Federal laws or regulations are in conflict with
this chapter to the extent that following the provisions of this chapter would
jeopardize the use of those State or Federal funds, such conflicting provisions
of this chapter shall not apply and the City officials making such purchases
shall follow the procedure required by the State or Federal laws or
regulations.
   C.   Emergency contracts which require prompt execution of the contract
because of an imminent threat to the safety or welfare of the public, or public
or private property; circumstances which place the City or its officers and
agents in a position of serious legal liability; or circumstances which are
likely to cause the City to suffer financial harm or loss, the gravity of which
clearly outweighs the benefits of competitive bidding in the usual manner. The
City Manager or Mayor shall notify the City Council of any emergency contract
which would have normally required their approval at the next regularly
scheduled City Council meeting.
   D.   Projects which are acquired, expanded, or improved under the Local
Building Authority Act.
   E.   Purchases from vendors or suppliers who are a sole source of the goods
or services under procurement. If any sole source procurement exceeds forty
thousand dollars ($40,000.00), notice of the sole source procurement shall be
published in a newspaper of general circulation in the State or a newspaper of
local circulation in the area at least ten (10) days before the public meeting
to approve the purchase or contract by the City Council.
   F.   Purchases from State or local surplus property agencies or entities or
purchases from entities under State-awarded equipment contracts.
   G.   The selection of personal service contracts shall be based on an
evaluation of the services needed, the abilities of the contractors, the
uniqueness of the service and the general performance of the contractor. The
lowest quote need not necessarily be the successful contractor. Usually,
emphasis will be placed on quality, with cost being the deciding factor when
everything else is equal. (Ord. 2018-10)

expenditures are intended to include materials, supplies and services regularly
purchased and consumed by the City such as office supplies, janitorial
supplies, postage, food and beverages. Purchases shall not be artificially
divided so as to constitute a purchase or expenditure under this section.
   B.   All purchases and expenditures of more than one thousand dollars

(2) documented price quotes unless the purchase or expenditure is exempt from
the competitive bidding requirement of this chapter or requires a sealed bid.
   C.   All purchases and expenditures of more than five thousand dollars
($5,000.00) shall require a minimum of three (3) documented price quotes unless
the purchase or expenditure is exempt from the competitive bidding requirement
of this chapter or the purchase expenditure requires a sealed bid. The City
Manager may approve a purchase or expenditure without the required price quotes
if the City Manager determines that there are not two (2) additional vendors or
suppliers of such items.
   D.   Purchases made through the cooperative purchasing contracts
administered by the State Division of Purchasing shall not require bids or
quotes of any type. (Ord. 2018-10)

or department head shall issue a qualification statement. The statement shall
inform the applicant of the project for which the qualification is valid, as
well as any other conditions which may be imposed on the qualification. It
shall advise the applicant to notify the City Manager or department head
promptly if there has been any substantial change of conditions or
circumstances which would make any statement contained in the prequalification
application no longer applicable or untrue.
   B.   If the City Manager or department head does not qualify an applicant,
written notice to the applicant is required stating the reasons the
prequalification was denied and informing the applicant of the right to appeal
the decision within five (5) business days after receipt of the notice. Appeals
shall be made to the City Council. The City Manager or department head may,
upon discovering that a prequalified party is no longer qualified, revoke
prequalification by sending notification of the revocation to the party subject
to the revocation. The notice shall state the reason(s) for revocation, and
that the revocation will be effective immediately. (Ord. 2018-10)

3.20.170: COST-PLUS-A-PERCENTAGE-OF-COST PROFITS CONTRACTS:
Subject to the limitations of this section, any type of contract which will
promote the best interests of the City may be used; provided, that the use of a
cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost profit contract is prohibited unless
specifically approved by the City Council under special circumstances which
clearly justify the use of such contracts because the scope of work or the
nature of the work is to be closely supervised by the City and the City Council
so finds in writing. A cost-reimbursement contract may be used only when a
determination is made in writing that such contract is likely to be less costly
to the City than any other type or that it is impracticable to obtain the
supplies, services, or construction required except under such a contract.
(Ord. 2018-10)
3.20.180: REQUIRED CONTRACT CLAUSES:
All contracts for work entered into by the City shall, whenever practicable,
contain clauses permitting or requiring the following:

and actual quantities.
   C.   Suspension of work ordered by the City.
   D.   Requirements for performance bonds and labor and material payment bonds

All contract specifications shall seek to promote overall economy and best use
for the purposes intended and encourage competition in satisfying the needs of
the City and shall not be unduly restrictive. Where practical and reasonable,
and within the scope of this chapter, Utah products shall be given preference
as required by Utah law. (Ord. 2018-10)
3.20.190: FINAL ACTION ON APPEALS:
The decision of the City Council with respect to any appeal shall be the final
action of the City with respect to that appeal. (Ord. 2018-10)
3.20.200: CONFLICTS PROHIBITED:
No person involved in making procurement decisions may have personal
investments or derive any income from any business entity which may create a
conflict between their private interests and their public duties. In the event

particular procurement decision or decisions creating the conflict by notifying
the City Manager (or, in the event the City Manager is the conflicted party, by
notifying the Mayor) of the conflict, and shall not participate in that
particular decision or decisions. (Ord. 2018-10)

ACE PROGRAM, or TITLE 4 OF THE SANTA CLARA CITY MUNICIPAL CODE. It may be cited
and pleaded under any such designation. (Ord. 2023-01)
4.01.020: DECLARATION OF PURPOSE:
The city council finds that the enforcement of the city code and applicable
state codes throughout the city is an important public service. Code
enforcement is vital to the protection of the public health, safety, and
quality of life. The city council recognizes that enforcement starts with the
drafting of precise regulations that can be effectively applied in
administrative code enforcement hearings and judicial proceedings. The city
council further finds that a comprehensive code enforcement system that uses a
combination of judicial and administrative remedies is critical to gain
compliance with these regulations. Failure to comply with an administrative
code enforcement action may require the city attorney to file a judicial action
to gain compliance. (Ord. 2023-01)
4.01.030: SCOPE:
The provisions of this title may be applied to all violations of the city code
or applicable state codes which occur within the city. It has been designed as

4.01.050: CRIMINAL PROSECUTION RIGHT:
The city has sole discretion in deciding whether to file a civil or criminal
case for the violation of any of its ordinances. The city may choose to file
both, or one or the other. The enactment of this administrative remedy shall in
no way interfere with the city's right to prosecute city ordinance violations
as criminal offenses. The city may use any of the remedies available under the
law in both civil and criminal prosecution. If the city chooses to file both
civil and criminal charges for the same day of violation, no civil penalties
may be assessed, but all other remedies are available. (Ord. 2023-01)
4.01.060: EFFECT OF HEADINGS:
Title, chapter, part, and section headings contained herein shall not be deemed
to govern, limit, modify, or in any manner affect the scope, meaning or intent
of the provisions of any title, chapter, part, or section hereof. (Ord. 2023-
01)
4.01.070: SEVERABILITY:
If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, portion, or provision of
this title is for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional by the
decision of any court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect
the validity of the remaining portions of this title. The city council hereby
declares that it would have adopted this title and each section, subsection,
sentence, clause, phrase, portion, or provision thereof, irrespective of the

applicant's business and shall recommend to the city council a license tax for
the applicant in an amount that is nondiscriminatory, reasonable and fair, and

applicant should pay, it shall fix the license tax in such amount. If the
regular license tax has already been paid, the city council shall order a
refund of the amount over and above the tax fixed by the city council. In
fixing the fee to be charged, the license assessor and collector shall have the
power to base the fee upon a percentage of gross sales, or employees, or may
use any other method which will assure that the fee assessed shall be uniform

5.06.010: PURPOSE:
   A.   Residents of the city have an inalienable interest in their personal
safety, well being, and privacy in their residences, as well as their ability
to provide or receive information regarding matters of personal belief,
political or charitable activities, and goods and services lawfully in
commerce. The city has a substantial interest in protecting the well being,
tranquility, personal safety, and privacy of its citizens, which includes the
ability to protect citizens from unwanted intrusions upon residential property.
The city also has a substantial interest in protecting citizens from fraud or
otherwise unfair consumer sales practices as well as criminal activity.
   B.   There must be a balance between these substantial interests of the city
and its citizens, and the effect of the regulations in this chapter on the
rights of those who are regulated. Based on the collective experiences of city
officials derived from regulating business activity, protecting persons and
property from criminal conduct, responding to the inquiries of citizens
regarding door to door solicitation, the experience of its law enforcement
officers and those affected by door to door canvassing and solicitation, as
well as judicial decisions outlining the boundaries of constitutional
protections afforded and denied persons seeking to engage in door to door
solicitation, the city adopts this chapter to promote the city's substantial
interests in:
      1.   Respecting citizens' decisions regarding privacy in their
residences;
      2.   Protecting persons from criminal conduct;
      3.   Providing equal opportunity to advocate for and against religious
belief, political position, or charitable activities; and
      4.   Permitting truthful and nonmisleading door to door solicitation
regarding lawful goods or services in intrastate or interstate commerce.
   C.   The city finds that the procedures, rules and regulations set forth in
this chapter are narrowly tailored to preserve and protect the city interests
referred to herein while at the same time balancing the rights of those
regulated. (Ord. 2006-22 § 1)
5.06.020: NO OTHER CITY LICENSE OR APPROVAL REQUIRED:

uses employees, independent contractors, or agents for door to door
solicitation in an effort to provide any tangible or intangible benefit to the
business, shall be required to have such solicitors obtain a certificate,
unless otherwise exempt from registration.
   C.   Those responsible persons or entities associated with registered
solicitors need not apply for, nor obtain, any other license, permit, or
registration from the city, provided they do not establish a temporary or fixed
place of business in the city.
   D.   Nothing herein is intended to interfere with or supplant any other
requirement of federal, state, or other local government law regarding any
license, permit, or certificate that a registered solicitor is otherwise
required to have or maintain. (Ord. 2006-22 § 1)

which the appeal is taken. Such appeal shall describe in detail the nature of

for denial, suspension or revocation, and any additional information supplied
by the city, applicant or registered solicitor. Any additional information

to the opposing party. If desired, any party shall have three (3) business days

licensing officer properly denied or suspended the certificate of the applicant
or registered solicitor, the denial or suspension of the certificate shall be
affirmed and constitute a determination that the suspended certificate is
revoked.

applicant or registered solicitor by the means designated in the completed
application, or as otherwise agreed upon when the appeal was filed.
   E.   After the ruling of the appeals officer, the applicant or solicitor is
deemed to have exhausted all administrative remedies with the city.

desist from any efforts to solicit at the residence or dwelling and shall
immediately depart from such property. Possession of a certificate of
registration does not in any way relieve any solicitor of this duty.

advocating to knock on the door, ring the doorbell, or in any other manner
attempt to attract the attention of an occupant of a residence that bears a "No
Solicitation" sign or similar sign or placard for the purpose of engaging in or
attempting to engage in advocating, a home solicitation sale, door to door

to ensure compaction to a degree equivalent to that of the undisturbed ground
in which the trench was dug. Jetting or internal vibrating methods of
compacting sand fill or similar methods of compacting sand or similar granular
free draining materials will be permitted.
   B.   The density (dry) of the backfill under pavements, sidewalks, curbs, or
other structures will be not less than that existing prior to excavation. The
fill shall be restored and placed in a good condition which will prevent
settling. (Prior code § 11-385)
12.12.060: RESTORATION OF SURFACES:
   A.   General: All street surfacing, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, driveways, or
other hard surfaces falling in the line of the excavation which must be removed
in performance of the work shall be restored in kind by the excavator, unless
otherwise directed by the city council, in accordance with the specifications
contained herein governing the various types of surfaces involved.
   B.   Protection Of Paved Surfaces: In order to avoid unnecessary damage to
paved surfaces, track equipment shall use pavement pads when operating on or
crossing paved surfaces.
   C.   Time: In traffic lanes of paved streets, the excavator shall provide
temporary gravel surfaces or cold mulch in good condition immediately after
backfill has been placed, and shall complete permanent repairs on the street,
sidewalk, curb, gutter, driveway and other surfaces, within five (5) days from
the date of completion of the backfill except for periods:
      1.   When permanent paving material is not available;
      2.   When weather conditions prevent permanent replacement;
      3.   When an extension of time is granted by the superintendent of
streets.
   D.   Temporary Repair: If temporary repair has been made on paved street
with gravel and a permanent repair cannot be made within the time specified
above due to any of the above mentioned conditions, then the excavator shall be
required to replace the gravel with cold mulch as soon as possible. (Prior code
§ 11-386)
12.12.070: RESTORING BITUMINOUS, CONCRETE OR ASPHALT STREET SURFACES:
   A.   Temporary Grade Surface: Where excavations are made in paved areas, the
surface shall be replaced with a temporary gravel surface. The gravel shall be
placed deep enough to provide a minimum of six inches (6") below the bottom of
the bituminous or concrete surface. Normally, this will require nine inches
(9") of gravel for bituminous surfaces, twelve inches (12") of gravel for
concrete, and concrete base for asphalt wearing surfaces. The gravel shall be
placed in the trench at the time it is backfilled. The temporary gravel surface
shall be maintained by blading, sprinkling, rolling, adding gravel, to maintain
a safe, uniform surface satisfactory to the inspector until the final surface
is laid. Excess material shall be removed from the premises immediately.
Material for use on temporary gravel surfaces shall be obtained from sound,
tough, durable gravel or rock meeting the following requirements for gradings:
   Passing 1 inch sieve      100 percent
   Passing 3/4 inch sieve   85 percent   –   100 percent
   Passing No. 4 sieve      45 percent   –   65 percent
   Passing No. 10 sieve      30 percent   –   50 percent
   Passing No. 200 sieve   5 percent   –   10 percent
   B.   Bituminous Surface: The exposed edges of existing pavement shall be
primed with type MC-1 bituminous material. The type, grade, and mixture of the
asphalt to be used for street surface replacement shall be approved by the
superintendent of streets. The thickness shall be equal to the adjacent surface
thickness but not less than three inches (3"). The complete surface shall not
deviate more than one-half inch (1/2") between old and new work. (Prior code §
11-387)
12.12.080: CONCRETE SURFACES:
The subbase for concrete surfaces shall be sprinkled just before placing the
concrete. Joints and surfaces shall be made to match the original surfaces. The
thickness of concrete shall be equal to the adjacent concrete but in no case
less than six inches (6") thick. The mixing, cement, water content, proportion,
placement, and curing of the concrete will be approved by the superintendent of
streets. In no case shall the concrete have less comprehensive strength than
three thousand (3,000) pounds per square inch at the end of twenty eight (28)
days. (Prior code § 11-388)
12.12.090: CONCRETE BASE, BITUMINOUS WEARING SURFACES:
This type of surfacing shall be constructed as above described. (Prior code §
11-389)
12.12.100: GRAVEL SURFACES:
Trenches excavated through gravel surfaced area, such as gravel roads and
shoulders and unpaved driveways, shall have the gravel restored and maintained
as described in section
12.12.080 of this chapter, except that the gravel shall be a minimum of one
inch (1") more than the thickness of the existing gravel. (Prior code § 11-390)
12.12.110: PROTECTION OF PUBLIC DURING EXCAVATION PROJECT:
Excavation operations shall be conducted in such a manner that a minimum amount
of interference or interruption of street traffic will result. Inconvenience to
residents and businesses fronting on public streets shall be minimized.
Suitable, adequate and sufficient barricades shall be available and used where
necessary to prevent accidents involving property or persons. Barricades must
be in place until all the excavator's equipment is removed from the site and
excavation has been backfilled and proper temporary gravel surface is in place.
From sunset to sunrise all barricades and excavations must be clearly outlined
by acceptable warning lights, lanterns, flares, and other devices. Police and
fire departments shall be notified at least twenty four (24) hours in advance
of any planned excavation requiring street closures or detour. (Prior code §
11-391)
12.12.120: RELOCATION AND PROTECTION OF UTILITIES:
An excavator shall not interfere with any existing utility without the written
consent of the city council and without advance notice to the owner of the
utility. If it becomes necessary to relocate an existing utility, it shall be
done by its owner unless the owner otherwise directs. No utility, whether owned
by city or private enterprise, shall be moved to accommodate the permittee
unless the cost of such work be borne by the permittee or an expressly written
agreement is made whereby the utility owner and the excavator make other
arrangements relating to such cost. The permittee shall support and protect by
timbers or otherwise all pipes, conduits, poles, wires, or other apparatus
which may be in any way affected by the excavation work, and shall do
everything necessary to support, sustain and protect them under, over, along,
or across the work. In case any of the pipes, conduits, poles, wires, or
apparatus should be damaged (and for this purpose pipe coating or other
encasement or devices are considered as part of a substructure), they shall be
repaired by the agency or person owning them, but the utility owner shall be
reimbursed for the expense of such repairs by the permittee. It is the intent
of this chapter that the permittee shall assume all liability for damage to
substructures, and any resulting damage or injury to anyone because of such
substructure damage and such assumption of liability shall be deemed a
contractual obligation which the permittee accepts upon acceptance of an
excavation permit. The city need not be made a party to any action because of
this chapter. The permittee shall inform itself as to the existence and
location of all underground utilities and protect the same against damage.
(Prior code § 11-392)
12.12.130: JETTING PIPE:
Jetting pipe by means of water under pressure, or compressed air, is permitted
only when approved by the city. (Prior code § 11-393)
12.12.140: INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE:
   A.   In order to ensure proper backfill and restoration of surface, the
permittee shall deposit a surety bond or cash deposit with the recorder payable
to the city, except that a public utility operating or using any of the streets
under a franchise from the city will not be required to furnish such bond,
providing such franchise obligates the holder thereof to restore the streets
and to hold the city harmless in the event of any injury to any person or
damage to any property due to negligence of such holder in conducting
excavation and restoration operations under such franchise. The required surety
bond must be:
      1.   With good and sufficient surety;
      2.   By a surety company authorized to transact business in the state;
      3.   Satisfactory to the city attorney in form and substance;
      4.   Conditions upon the permittee's compliance with this chapter in
order to secure and hold the city and its officers harmless against any and all
claims, judgments, or other costs arising from the excavation and other work
covered by the excavation permit or for which the city, the city council or any
city office may be made liable by reason of any accident or injury to any
person or property through the fault of the permittee arising out of failure to
properly guard the excavation or for any other negligence of the permittee;
      5.   Conditioned to fill up, restore and place in good and safe
condition, as near as may be to its original condition, and to the satisfaction
of the city, all opening and excavations made in streets, and to maintain any
street where excavation is made in as good condition for the period of twenty
four (24) months after the work shall be done, usual wear and tear excepted, as
it was before the work shall have been done.
   B.   The amount of the surety bond or cash deposit shall be established by
resolution and may be changed from time to time, but until such resolution is
passed the amount of surety or cash deposit shall be one hundred dollars
($100.00) and one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each foot of street the
permittee shall excavate. (Prior code § 11-394)
12.12.150: APPLICATION FOR STREET EXCAVATION PERMIT:
It is unlawful for any person to break, excavate, tunnel, undermine, or in any
manner affect the surface or base of any street or to place, deposit or leave
upon any street any earth or any other excavated material obstructing or
tending to interfere with the free use of the street, unless such persons shall
first have obtained an excavation permit therefor from the recorder. Any public
utility regulated by the state of Utah or holding a franchise from the city
which in the pursuit of its calling has frequent occasion to open or make
excavations in streets, may, upon application, receive a general permit from
the city to cover all excavations such utilities may make within the streets of
the city. All permits shall be subject to revocation and the city may refuse to
issue a permit for failure of the permittee or applicant to abide by the terms
and conditions of this part. Excavation permits will not be requested prior to
excavation in case of emergency endangering life or property, providing the
city is notified as soon as practicable and a permit is applied for upon the
next working day following the emergency. (Prior code § 11-395)

   A.   Declaration Of Finding And Intent:
      1.   Findings Regarding Rights Of Way: The city finds that the rights of
way within the city:
         a.   Are critical to the travel and transport of persons and property
in the business and social life of the city;
         b.   Are intended for public uses and must be managed and controlled
consistent with that intent;
         c.   Can be partially occupied by the facilities of utilities and
other public service entities delivering utility and public services rendered
for profit, to the enhancement of the health, welfare, and general economic
well being of the city and its citizens; and
         d.   Are a unique and physically limited resource requiring proper
management to maximize the efficiency and to minimize the costs to the
taxpayers of the foregoing uses and to minimize the inconvenience to and
negative effects upon the public from such facilities' construction, placement,
relocation, and maintenance in the rights of way.
      2.   Finding Regarding Compensation: The city finds that the city should
receive fair and reasonable compensation for use of the rights of way.
      3.   Finding Regarding Local Concern: The city finds that while
telecommunications systems are in part an extension of interstate commerce,
their operations also involve rights of way, municipal franchising, and vital
business and community service, which are of local concern.
      4.   Finding Regarding Promotion Of Telecommunication Services: The city
finds that it is in the best interests of its taxpayers and citizens to promote
the rapid development of telecommunications services, on a nondiscrimination
basis, responsive to community and public interest, and to assure availability
for municipal, educational and community services.
      5.   Findings Regarding Franchise Standards: The city finds that it is in
the interests of the public to franchise and to establish standards for
franchising providers in a manner that:
         a.   Fairly and reasonable compensates the city on a competitively
neutral and nondiscriminatory basis as provided herein;
         b.   Encourages competition by establishing terms and conditions under
which providers may use the rights of way to serve the public;
         c.   Fully protects the public interests and the city from any harm
that may flow from such commercial use of rights of way;
         d.   Protects the police powers and rights of way management authority
of the city, in a manner consistent with federal and state law;
         e.   Otherwise protects the public interests in the development and
use of the city infrastructure;
         f.   Protects the public's investment in improvements in the rights of
way; and
         g.   Ensures that no barriers to entry of telecommunications providers
are created and that such franchising is accomplished in a manner that does not
prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting telecommunication services, within
the meaning of the telecommunications act of 1996 ("act") (PL 104-104).
      6.   Power To Manage Rights Of Way: The city adopts the
telecommunications ordinance codified in this chapter pursuant to its power to
manage the rights of way, pursuant to common law, the Utah constitution and
statutory authority, and receive fair and reasonable compensation for the use
of rights of way by providers as expressly set forth by section 253 of the act.
   B.   Scope Of Chapter: This chapter shall provide the basic local scheme for
providers of telecommunications services and systems that require the use of
the rights of way, including providers of both the system and service, those
providers of the system only, and those providers who do not build the system
but who only provide services. This chapter shall apply to all future providers
in the city prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this
chapter, whether operating with or without a franchise as set forth in
subsection
12.28.120B of this chapter.

      3.   Provisions Applicable To Excluded Providers: Providers excused by
other law that prohibits the city from requiring a franchise shall not be
required to obtain a franchise, but all of the requirements imposed by this
chapter through the exercise of the city's police power and not preempted by
other law shall be applicable. (Ord. 98-18 § 1)

   A.   Nonexclusive Franchise: The city is empowered and authorized to issue
nonexclusive franchises governing the installation, construction, and
maintenance of systems in the city's rights of way, in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter. The franchise is granted through a franchise
agreement entered into between the city and provider.
   B.   Every Provider Must Obtain: Except to the extent preempted by federal
or state law, as ultimately interpreted by a court of competent jurisdiction,
including any appeals, every provider must obtain a franchise prior to
constructing a telecommunications system or providing telecommunications
services using the rights of way, and every provider must obtain a franchise
before constructing an open video system or providing open video services via
an open video system. Any open video system or service shall be subject to the
customer service and consumer protection provisions applicable to the cable TV
companies to the extent the city is not preempted or permitted as ultimately
interpreted by a court of competent jurisdiction, including any appeals. The
fact that particular telecommunications systems may be used for multiple
purposes does not obviate the need to obtain a franchise for other purposes. By
way of illustration and not limitation, a cable operator of a cable system must
obtain a cable franchise, and, should it intend to provide telecommunications
services over the same system, must also obtain a telecommunications franchise.
   C.   Nature Of Grant: A franchise shall not convey title, equitable or
legal, in the rights of way. A franchise is only the right to occupy rights of
way on a nonexclusive basis for the limited purposes and for the limited period
stated in the franchise; the right may not be subdivided, assigned, or
subleased. A franchise does not excuse a provider from obtaining appropriate
access or pole attachment agreements before collocating its system on the
property of others, including the city's property. This section shall not be
construed to prohibit a provider from leasing conduit to another provider, so
long as the lessee has obtained a franchise.
   D.   Current Providers: Except to the extent exempted by federal or state
law, any provider acting without a franchise on the effective date of the
ordinance codified in this chapter shall request issuance of a franchise from
the city within ninety (90) days of the effective date of said ordinance. If
such request is made, the provider may continue providing service during the
course of negotiations. If a timely request is not made, or if negotiations
cease and a franchise is not granted, the provider shall comply with the
provisions of subsection
12.28.090D of this chapter.
   E.   Nature Of Franchise: The franchise granted by the city under the
provisions of this chapter shall be a nonexclusive franchise providing the
right and consent to install, repair, maintain, remove and replace its system
on, over and under the rights of way in order to provide services.
   F.   Regulatory Approval Needed: Before offering or providing any services
pursuant to the franchise, a provider shall obtain any and all regulatory
approvals, permits, authorizations or licenses for the offering or provision of
such services from the appropriate federal, state and local authorities, if
required, and shall submit to the city upon the written request of the city
evidence of all such approvals, permits, authorizations or licenses.
   G.   Term: No franchise issued pursuant to this chapter shall have a term of
less than five (5) years or greater then fifteen (15) years. Each franchise
shall be granted in a nondiscriminatory manner. (Ord. 98-18 § 3)
12.28.040: COMPENSATION AND OTHER PAYMENTS:
   A.   Compensation: As fair and reasonable compensation for any franchise
granted pursuant to this chapter, a provider shall have the following
obligations:
      1.   Application Fee: In order to offset the cost to the city to review
an application for a franchise and in addition to all other fees, permits or
charges, a provider shall pay to the city, at the time of application, five
hundred dollars ($500.00) as a nonrefundable application fee.
      2.   Franchise Fees: The franchise fee, if any, shall be set forth in the
franchise agreement. The obligation to pay a franchise fee shall commence on
the completion date. The franchise fee is offset by any business license fee or
business license tax enacted by the city.
      3.   Excavation Permits: The provider shall also pay fees required for an
excavation permit as provided in ordinance 97-19 (excavation permit ordinance).
   B.   Timing: Unless otherwise agreed to in the franchise agreement, all
franchise fees shall be paid on a monthly basis within forty five (45) days of
the close of each calendar month.
   C.   Fee Statement And Certification: Unless a franchise agreement provides
otherwise, each fee payment shall be accompanied by a statement showing the
manner in which the fee was calculated and shall be certified as to its
accuracy.
   D.   Future Costs: A provider shall pay to the city or to third parties, at
the direction of the city, an amount equal to the reasonable costs and
reasonable expenses that the city incurs for the services of third parties
(including, but not limited to, attorneys and other consultants) in connection
with any renewal or provider initiated renegotiation, or amendment of this
chapter or a franchise, provided, however, that the parties shall agree upon a
reasonable financial cap at the outset of negotiations. In the event the
parties are unable to agree, either party may submit the issue to binding
arbitration in accordance with the rules and procedures of the American
Arbitration Association. Any costs associated with any work to be done by the
power and public works department to provide a space on city owned poles shall
be borne by the provider.
   E.   Taxes And Assessments: To the extent taxes or other assessments are
imposed by taxing authorities, other than the city on the use of the city
property as a result of a provider's use or occupation of the rights of way,
the provider shall be responsible for payment of its pro rata share of such
taxes, payable annually unless otherwise required by the taxing authority. Such
payment shall be in addition to any other fees payable pursuant to this
chapter.
   F.   Interest On Late Payments: In the event that any payment is not
actually received by the city on or before the applicable date fixed in the
franchise, interest thereon shall accrue from such date until received at a
rate charged for delinquent state taxes.
   G.   No Accord And Satisfaction: No acceptance by the city of any fee shall
be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount,
nor shall such acceptance of such fee payment be construed as a release of any
claim the city may have for additional sums payable.
   H.   Not In Lieu Of Other Taxes Or Fees: The fee payment is not a payment in
lieu of any tax, fee or other assessment except as specifically provided in
this chapter, or as required by applicable law. By way of example, and not
limitation, excavation permit fees and fees to obtain space on the city owned
poles are not waived and remain applicable.
   I.   Continuing Obligation And Holdover: In the event a provider continues
to operate all or any part of the system after the term of the franchise, such
operator shall continue to comply with all applicable provisions of this
chapter and the franchise, including, without limitation, all compensation and
other payment provisions throughout the period of such continued operation,
provided that any such continued operation shall in no way be construed as a
renewal or other extension of the franchise, nor as a limitation on the
remedies, if any, available to the city as a result of such continued operation
after the term, including, but not limited to, damages and restitution.
   J.   Costs Of Publication: A provider shall assume any publication costs
associated with its franchise that may be required by law. (Ord. 98-18 § 4)

12.28.060 of this chapter.
      4.   Prior to making any attachments to poles, the willingness to enter

   C.   Franchise Determination: The city, in its discretion, shall determine
the award of any franchise on the basis of these and other considerations
relevant to the use of the rights of way, without competitive bidding. (Ord.
98-18 § 5)
12.28.060: CONSTRUCTION AND TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   General Requirement: No provider shall receive a franchise unless it
agrees to comply with each of the terms set forth in this section governing
construction and technical requirements for its system, in addition to any
other reasonable requirements or procedures specified by the city or the
franchise, including requirements regarding locating and sharing in the cost of
locating portions of the system with other systems or with city utilities. A
provider shall obtain an excavation permit, pursuant to the excavation
ordinance, before commencing any work in the rights of way.
   B.   Quality: All work involved in the construction, maintenance, repair,
upgrade and removal of the system shall be performed in a safe, thorough and
reliable manner using materials of good and durable quality. If, at any time,
it is determined by the FCC or any other agency granted authority by federal
law or the FCC to make such determination, that any part of the system,
including, without limitation, any means used to distribute signals over or
within the system, is harmful to the public health, safety or welfare, or
quality of service or reliability, the a provider shall, at its own cost and
expense, promptly correct all such conditions.
   C.   Licenses And Permits: A provider shall have the sole responsibility for
diligently obtaining, at its own cost and expense, all permits, licenses or
other forms of approval or authorization necessary to construct, maintain,
upgrade or repair the system, including, but not limited to, any necessary
approvals from persons and/or the city to use private property, easements,
poles and conduits. A provider shall obtain any required permit, license,

which the permit, license, approval or authorization is required.
   D.   Relocation Of The System:
      1.   New Grades Or Lines: If the grades or lines of any rights of way are
changed at any time in a manner affecting the system, then a provider shall
comply with the requirements of the excavation ordinance.
      2.   The City Authority To Move System In Case Of An Emergency: The city
may, at any time, in case of fire, disaster or other emergency, as determined
by the city in its reasonable discretion, cut or move any parts of the system
and appurtenances on, over or under the rights of way of the city, in which
event the city shall not be liable therefor to a provider. The city shall
notify a provider in writing prior to, if practicable, but in any event as soon

person other than the city for any such movement of its systems.
      4.   Rights Of Way Change; Obligation To Move System: When the city is
changing a rights of way and makes a written request, a provider is required to
move or remove its system from the rights of way, without cost to the city, to
the extent provided in the excavation ordinance. This obligation does not apply
to systems originally located on private property pursuant to a private
easement, which property was later incorporated into the rights of way, if that
private easement grants a superior vested right. This obligation exists whether
or not the provider has obtained an excavation permit.
   E.   Protect Structures: In connection with the construction, maintenance,
repair, upgrade or removal of the system, a provider shall, at its own cost and
expense, protect any and all existing structures belonging to the city (and all
designated landmarks, as well as all other structures within any designated
landmark district). A provider shall obtain the prior written consent of the
city to alter any water main, power facility, sewerage or drainage system, or
any other municipal structure on, over or under the rights of way of the city
required because of the presence of the system. Any such alteration shall be
made by the city or its designee on a reimbursable basis. A provider agrees
that it shall be liable for the costs incurred by the city to replace or repair
and restore to its prior condition in a manner as may be reasonable specified
by the city, any municipal structure or any other rights of way of the city
involved in the construction, maintenance, repair, upgrade or removal of the
system that may become disturbed or damaged as a result of any work thereon by
or on behalf of a provider pursuant to the franchise.
   F.   No Obstruction: In connection with the construction, maintenance,
upgrade, repair or removal of the system, a provider shall riot unreasonably
obstruct the rights of way of fixed guide way systems, railways, passenger
travel, or other traffic to, from or within the city without the prior consent
of the appropriate authorities.
   G.   Safety Precautions: A provider shall, at its own cost and expense,
undertake all necessary and appropriate efforts to prevent accidents at its
work sites, including the placing and maintenance of proper guards, fences,
barricades, security personnel and suitable and sufficient lighting, and such
other requirements prescribed by OSHA and Utah OSHA. A provider shall comply
with all applicable federal, state and local requirements including, but not
limited to, the national electric safety code.
   H.   Repair: After written reasonable notice to the provider, unless, in the
sole determination of the city, an eminent danger exists, any rights of way
within the city which are disturbed or damaged during the construction,
maintenance or reconstruction by a provider of its system may be repaired by
the city at the provider's expense, to a condition as good as that prevailing
before such work was commenced. Upon doing so, the city shall submit to such a
provider an itemized statement of the cost for repairing and restoring the
rights of ways intruded upon. The provider shall, within thirty (30) days after
receipt of the statement, pay to the city the entire amount thereof.

representative of the city of the system and its effect on the rights of way.

in accordance with all applicable utility restrictions, ordinance and easement
restrictions, upon and hanging over rights of way so as to prevent the branches
of such trees from coming in contact with its system. (Ord. 98-18 § 6)

   A.   Notification Of Sale:
      1.   Notification And Election: When a provider is the subject of a sale,
transfer, assignment, sublease or disposed of, in whole or in part, either by
forced or involuntary sale, or by ordinary sale, consolidation or otherwise,

approval of the PSC, the provider or its successor entity shall promptly notify
the city of the nature of the transaction. The notification shall include

certification in accordance with subsection A1a of this section, the city
designee, as provided in subsection
12.28.090A1 of this chapter, shall send notice affirming the transfer of the
franchise to the successor entity. If the city has good cause to believe that
the successor entity may not comply with this chapter or the franchise
agreement, it may require an application for the transfer. The application
shall comply with section
12.28.050 of this chapter.
      3.   If PSC Approval No Longer Required: If the PSC no longer exists, or
if its regulations or state law no longer require approval of transactions
described in subsection A of this section, and the city has good cause to
believe that the successor entity may not comply with this chapter or the
franchise agreement, it may require an application. The application shall
comply with section
12.28.050 of this chapter.
   B.   Events Of Sale: The following events shall be deemed to be a sale,
assignment or other transfer of the franchise requiring compliance with
subsection A of this section: 1) the sale, assignment or other transfer of all
or a majority of a provider's assets to another person; 2) the sale, assignment
or other transfer of capital stock or partnership, membership or other equity
interests in a provider by one or more of its existing shareholders, partners,
members or other equity owners so as to create a new controlling interest in a
provider; 3) the issuance of additional capital stock or partnership,
membership or other equity interest by a provider so as to create a new
controlling interest in such a provider; or 4) the entry by a provider into an
agreement with respect to the management or operation of such provider or its
system. (Ord. 98-18 § 7)
12.28.080: OVERSIGHT AND REGULATION:

franchise, a provider will deposit with the city an irrevocable, unconditional

franchise. A provider shall also indemnify the city as set forth in the
franchise.
   B.   Oversight: The city shall have the right to oversee, regulate and
inspect periodically the construction, maintenance, and upgrade of the system,
and any part thereof, in accordance with the provisions of the franchise and
applicable law. A provider shall establish and maintain managerial and
operational records, standards, procedures and controls to enable a provider to
prove, in reasonable detail, to the satisfaction of the city at all times
throughout the term, that a provider is in compliance with the franchise. A
provider shall retain such records for not less that the applicable statute of
limitations.

city's existing GIS system, of all existing and proposed installations and the
types of equipment and systems installed or constructed in the rights of way,
properly identified and described as to the types of equipment and facility by
appropriate symbols and marks which shall include annotations of all rights of
ways where work will be undertaken. As used herein, "as built" maps includes
"file construction prints". Maps shall be drawn to scale. "As built" maps,
including the compatible electronic format, as provided above, shall be
submitted within thirty (30) days of completion of work or within thirty (30)
days after completion of modification and repairs. "As built" maps are not
required of the provider who is the incumbent local exchange carrier for the
existing system to the extent they do not exist.
      2.   Throughout the term of the franchise, a provider shall maintain
complete and accurate books of account and records of the business, ownership,
and operations of a provider with respect to the system in a manner that allows
the city at all times to determine whether a provider is in compliance with the
franchise. Should the city reasonably determine that the records are not being
maintained in such a manner, a provider shall alter the manner in which the
books and/or records are maintained so that a provider comes into compliance
with this section. All financial books and records which are maintained in
accordance with the regulations of the FCC and any governmental entity that
regulates utilities in the state, and generally accepted accounting principles
shall be deemed to be acceptable under this section.

a protected record within the meaning of Utah government records access and
management act ("GRAMA"), making it available only to those who must have
access to perform their duties on behalf of the city, provided that a provider

shall be furnished at the sole expense of a provider, except as otherwise
provided in this chapter or a franchise.

the franchise fee, the books and records of the provider pertaining thereto
shall be open to inspection or audit by duly authorized representatives of the
city at all reasonable times, upon giving reasonable notice of the intention to
inspect or audit the books and records, provided that the city shall not audit
the books and records of the provider more often that annually. The provider
agrees to reimburse the city the reasonable costs of an audit if the audit
discloses that the provider has paid ninety five percent (95%) or less of the
compensation due the city for the period of such audit. In the event the
accounting rendered to the city by the provider herein is found to be
incorrect, then payment shall be made on the corrected amount within thirty
(30) calendar days of written notice, it being agreed that the city may accept
any amount offered by the provider, but the acceptance thereof by the city
shall not be deemed a settlement of such item if the amount is in dispute or is
later found to be incorrect. (Ord. 98-18 § 8)

      2.   Removal Of Abandoned System: The city, upon such terms as it may
impose, may give a provider written permission to abandon, without removing,
any system, or portion thereof, directly constructed, operated or maintained
under a franchise. Unless such permission is granted or unless otherwise
provided in this chapter, a provider shall remove within a reasonable time the
abandoned system and shall restore, using prudent construction standards, any
affected rights of way to their former state at the time such system was
installed, so as not to impair their usefulness. In removing its plant,
structures and equipment, a provider shall refill, at its own expense, any
excavation necessarily made by it and shall leave all rights of way in as good
condition as that prevailing prior to such removal without materially
interfering with any electrical or telephone cable or other utility wires,
poles or attachments. The city shall have the right to inspect and approve the
condition of the rights of way cables, wires, attachments and poles prior to
and after removal. The liability, indemnity and insurance provisions of this
chapter and any security fund provided in a franchise shall continue in full
force and effect during the period of removal and until full compliance by a
provider with the terms and conditions of this section.
      3.   Transfer Of Abandoned System To City: Upon abandonment of any system

transfer, the city shall have the right to require a provider to remove, at its
expense, all aboveground portions of a system from the rights of way within a
reasonable period of time, which shall not be less than one hundred eighty
(180) days. If the provider is the incumbent local exchange carrier, it shall
not be required to remove its system, but shall negotiate a renewal in good
faith.
      5.   Leaving Underground System: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this chapter, a provider may abandon any underground system in
place so long as it does not materially interfere with the use of the right of

state or local court of competent jurisdiction, to be invalid as conflicting
with any federal or state statute, or is ordered by a court to be modified in
any way in order to conform to the requirements of any such law and all
appellate remedies with regard to the validity of the chapter provisions in
question are exhausted, such provision shall be considered a separate,
distinct, and independent part of this chapter, and such holding shall not
affect the validity and enforceability of all other provisions hereof. In the
event that such law is subsequently repealed, rescinded, amended or otherwise
changed, so that the provision which had been held invalid or modified is no
longer in conflict with such law the provision in question shall return to full
force and effect and shall again be binding on the city and the provider,
provided that the city shall give the provider thirty (30) days, or a longer
period of time as may be reasonably required for a provider to comply with such
a rejuvenated provision, written notice of the change before requiring
compliance with such provision.
   C.   New Developments: It shall be the policy of the city to liberally amend
this chapter, upon application of a provider, when necessary to enable the
provider to take advantage of any developments in the field of
telecommunications which will afford the provider an opportunity to more
effectively, efficiently, or economically serve itself or the public.
   D.   Notices: All notices from a provider to the city required under this
chapter or pursuant to a franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall be

police powers of the city to adopt and enforce ordinances necessary to the
health, safety and welfare of the public. A provider shall comply with all
applicable general laws and ordinances enacted by the city pursuant to its

   A.   Santa Clara City recognizes substantial economic, environmental and
aesthetic importance of the trees and plantings within the community. It is in
the best interests of the citizens and public that a plan be developed to
regulate the planting and maintenance of trees and other plantings in or
adjacent to streets and within easements, in rights of way and other public
places within the city, to provide for orderly development and protection of
public facilities, and to regulate the removal of trees that contribute
significantly to the value of land, preservation of resources, and quality of
life in the city.
   B.   It is the intent of the city council of Santa Clara City that the terms
of this chapter shall be construed as to promote:
      1.   The planting, maintenance, restoration, and survival of desirable
trees within the city; and
      2.   The protection of community residents from personal injury and
property damage, and the protection of Santa Clara City from property damage
caused or threatened by the improper planting, maintenance, or removal of trees
located in and upon public areas and rights of way within Santa Clara City.

   TREE TRIMMING: The removal of plant parts to control growth and enhance
performance or function in the landscape by developing and preserving tree
structure and health. The removal of water sprouts, sucker growth, and hanging
limbs constituting less than ten percent (10%) of the tree canopy is not

2008-16 § 1)
12.32.030: ADMINISTRATION:
   A.   Authority: The parks and recreation director or designee shall be
responsible for administering and enforcing this chapter. He or she shall:

and removal of trees and other plants in public streets, in city cemeteries,
and in city parks to promote safety and preserve the beauty of such public

   A.   Care And Maintenance: The parks and recreation director shall initiate
and administer a program to provide for the planting, maintenance, care,
removal and replacement of street trees, consistent with resources available.
   B.   Standards: All trees located within city streets, parks, rights of way,

maintain, and remove street trees located within the public rights of way. The
city may remove, or cause or order to be removed, any tree or part thereof
which is in an unsafe condition or which by reason of its nature is injurious
to sewer, electrical power lines, natural gas lines, water lines, or other
public improvements, or is affected with any injurious fungus, insect, or other

which have died or been removed for any reason, or plant additional street
trees deemed appropriate consistent with available resources.

shall remove all dead, diseased, or dangerous trees; or broken or decayed limbs
which constitute a menace to public safety at their expense.
   F.   Tree Topping: It shall be unlawful as a normal practice for any person,
firm, or city department to top any street tree, park tree, or other tree on
public property. Trees damaged by storms or other causes, or certain trees
under utility wires or other obstructions where other pruning practices are
impractical, may be exempted from this chapter at the determination of the
parks and recreation director, or designee.
   G.   Planting Season: Planting season for trees planted along streets, in
rights of way, in landscape borders, in parks, or city maintained properties is

approval of the parks and recreation director, or designee, before proceeding.
(Ord. 2008-16 § 1)
12.32.050: REMOVAL OF TREES:
   A.   Permission Required: It shall be unlawful for any person, firm,
partnership, corporation or organization of any kind to prune or remove any
tree or shrub upon any public street or on any city owned property within the

recreation director, or designee. The request must state specifically the work
to be done and shall expire thirty (30) days after the date of its issue.
   B.   Removing Stumps: Any tree, tree stump or shrub that shall be removed
from city owned property shall be removed below the surface of the ground so
that the top of the stump shall not project above the level of the ground,
unless permission to leave a projecting stump is granted by the parks and
recreation director, or designee.
   C.   City Authority: The city may condemn and remove, or order the removal
of any tree, tree stump, shrub, or plant upon any of the public streets or on
city owned property within this city where the same is dead, diseased or for
any reason whatsoever is deemed unsafe by the parks and recreation director, or
designee. The city shall have the authority to condemn and remove, or order to
be removed any tree, tree stump, shrub, or plant upon private property when the
parks and recreation director, or designee, shall find such action necessary
for public safety or to prevent the spread of disease or insects to public
trees and places. Where no apparent emergency exists, the parks and recreation
director, or designee, shall give at least fifteen (15) days' notice of intent
to remove any street tree to adjacent property owners of the decision to remove
the street tree. (Ord. 2008-16 § 1)
12.32.060: AUTHORIZATION:
   A.   Planting: It shall be unlawful for any person to plant or cause to be
planted any tree in public rights of way without first obtaining written
permission from the parks and recreation director, or designee. Said approval
shall specify the location and variety of trees to be planted.
   B.   Trimming: It shall be unlawful for any person, other than city
personnel, to trim any approved street tree without first obtaining written
permission from the parks and recreation director, or designee. Permission is
not required for removing sucker growth, water sprouts, minor limbs causing
obstructions, or for removal of less than ten percent (10%) of the tree canopy.
   C.   Removal: Any property owner desiring to remove a tree from the park
strip or easement abutting his property shall make application to the parks and
recreation director, or designee. The parks and recreation director, or
designee, shall determine whether or not such tree is required to be retained
in order to preserve the intent and purpose of this chapter. In making this
determination the parks and recreation director, or designee, shall consider
the inconvenience or hardship which retention of the tree would cause the
property owner, and consider also the condition, age, desirability of tree
species and location. If the parks and recreation director, or designee, finds
that the tree may be removed without violating the intent and spirit of this
chapter, he may schedule the removal by city personnel or the property owner to
remove such tree at the property owner's own expense and liability providing
that any trees removed shall be replaced by street trees as approved by the
parks and recreation director, or designee.
   D.   Replacement: Any replacement shall be made based on evaluation by the
parks and recreation director, or designee, of the condition of the site to
determine whether replacement is warranted. If permission is granted for
removal of a street tree, all removal work shall be completed within thirty
(30) days from the date of issuance of the authorization and shall be under the
general supervision of, and in accordance with this chapter. All removal
authorizations shall be null and void after the expiration of thirty (30) days
from the date of issuance, unless extended by the parks and recreation
director, or designee.
   E.   Considerations: In determining whether a tree may be removed and
replaced, the parks and recreation director, or designee, shall consider, among
other things, the following:
      1.   Whether the tree or trees pose a potential for safety problems
despite a sound maintenance program;
      2.   Whether the roots from adjacent park strip trees are interfering
with sewer lines servicing the abutting property to the extent that the
property owner requires frequent repair of said sewer lines;
      3.   Whether the tree is dead, dying or incurably diseased;
      4.   Whether the tree is diseased and weakened by age, storm, fire or
other injuries so as to pose a danger to persons, property, improvements or
other trees;
      5.   Whether the tree(s) is of an undesirable species;
      6.   Whether the tree poses a hardship to the adjacent property owner
such as, but not limited to, the cracking or raising of a garage floor or, in
the case of a handicapped person, special circumstances exist which cause the
location of the tree to become a hindrance for vehicle, and handicapped access;
      7.   Whether removal is necessary for construction of a street widening
or other public improvement project, or necessary street or public improvement
repair work. (Ord. 2008-16 § 1)
12.32.070: OTHER PLANTINGS:
The property owner may plant in planting strips and easements various plantings
such as lawn, various perennials or annuals, or shrubs not to exceed two feet
(2') in height and which will not interfere with the functioning of any curb,
gutter, sidewalk, water meter, fire hydrant, or other public facility, and will
not interfere with or impair the growth of any approved street tree, or plant
in landscaped areas maintained by the city as a public improvement and will not
constitute a public nuisance. (Ord. 2008-16 § 1)
12.32.080: STREET TREE PLANTING IN PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED AREAS:
Planting of street trees in previously developed areas will be approved and
supervised by the parks and recreation director, or designee. Trees planted in
these areas will be of approved species and a sense of uniformity will be
maintained where possible. Private citizens may only plant street trees in
these areas with the approval of the parks and recreation director, or
designee. Unapproved plantings may be removed by the city. (Ord. 2008-16 § 1)
12.32.090: HERITAGE TREES:
   A.   Description: The city may, with participation of the landowner,
designate trees of importance as heritage trees. Trees receiving this
designation should have historical or peculiar significance to the community.
Trees that are designated as heritage trees will become the responsibility of
Santa Clara City and will be under the care of the parks and recreation
director, or designee.
   B.   Maintenance: Heritage trees may not be pruned, sprayed, altered in any
way, or removed without written consent of the parks and recreation director,
or designee. Heritage trees shall be protected from construction, excavation,
or any other kind of development that would negatively affect the tree, its
trunk, its branches, or its root system at any time. It will be unlawful for
anyone to disfigure, damage, compromise, or destroy a heritage tree.

13.08.060: SERVICE AGREEMENTS:
   A.   Form And Execution Of Service Agreements: Each applicant for service
shall make a written application on the department's standard form, or execute
a formal contract. The department's standard application form, when signed by
the department's authorized representative, as well as the customer, becomes a
binding service agreement. Receipt of electric power service shall constitute
an agreement to abide by all provisions of the standard application form and
this electric power service chapter.
   B.   Implied Service Agreement: In the absence of a signed service
agreement, the delivery of electric power service by the department and
acceptance thereof by the customer shall be deemed to constitute an agreement
by and between the department and the customer for delivery and acceptance of
electric power service under the terms and conditions in this electric power
service chapter.
   C.   Term Of Service Agreement: Unless otherwise provided, service
agreements are to continue in effect for an initial period of one month where a
new service is provided.
   D.   Expiration Or Renewal Of Service Agreements: Unless otherwise provided,
each service agreement will automatically extend from its expiration date for
additional successive periods of one month each, unless and until either party
has notified the other in writing not less than thirty (30) days prior to the
end of any such period of its desire to terminate such agreement.
   E.   Department's Rights To Cancel Service Agreement Or To Suspend Service:
For any default or breach of the service agreement by the customer, including
failure to pay bills within the specified period, the department, in addition
to all other legal remedies, may terminate the service agreement or suspend
service at the location where such default has occurred. No such termination or
suspension, however, will be made by the department without ten (10) days
notice to the customer, stating in what particular manner the service agreement
has been violated, except that no notice need to given in cases of theft or
unauthorized use or disposition of service by the customer, or where in the
department's judgment the customer is violating or threatening to violate the
provisions of this electric power service chapter or other ordinances, laws, or
codes. Also, no notice need be given in case of short circuit, or other
dangerous conditions on the customer's side of the point of delivery, or in
case of utilization by the customer of service in such manner as to cause
danger to persons or property, or to jeopardize service to the customer or to
others. Failure of the department at any time after any such default or breach
either to suspend supply of service, or to terminate the service agreement, or
to resort to any other legal remedy, or its failure to exercise on any one or
more of such remedies, shall not affect the department's right to resort
thereafter to any one or more of such remedies for the same or any future
default or breach by the customer.
   F.   Cancellation Of Service Agreement: Unless otherwise provided in the
service agreement, where the customer entirely suspends operations with the
intention to permanently abandon them, the service agreement may be canceled by
written notice to the department not less than thirty (30) days before the date
upon which service is to be terminated. Suspension of operation by the customer
without notification shall not release the customer from his or her prior
obligations.
   G.   Change Of Address Of The Customer:
      1.   When the customer changes his or her address, he or she shall give
notice thereof to the department at least three (3) days prior to the date of
change. The customer will be held responsible for all service supplied to the
vacated premises until such notice has been received and the department has had
a reasonable time, but not less than three (3) days, to discontinue service.
      2.   If the customer moves to an address at which he or she requires
electric power service for any purposes specified in his or her service
agreement, and at which address the department has such service available under
the same rate schedule, the notice shall be considered as the customer's
request that the department transfer such service to the new address; but if
the department does not have such service available at the new address, the old
service agreement shall, at the option of the department, either be considered
canceled or the customer remains liable thereunder. If the department has
service available at the new address to which a different rate schedule
applies, a new service agreement, including the applicable rate schedule, will
be offered to the customer. The department will make transfers of service as
promptly as reasonably possible after receipt of notice.
   H.   Successors And Assigns: Service agreements shall inure to the benefit
of and be binding upon the respective heirs, legal representatives, or
successors by operation of law, of the parties thereto. The customer may assign
his or her service agreement to a third party only with the written consent of
the department. The department may, without the customer's consent, assign any
service agreement to any person or corporation, in any lawful way acquiring or
operating all or any part of the department's property used in supplying
service under such agreement. (Ord. 1989-1 § 1: prior code § 14-315)
13.08.070: SUPPLYING AND TAKING OF SERVICE:
   A.   Power Supply: The department supplies alternating current at
approximately sixty (60) cycles. Secondary distribution voltages are available
at 120/240 volts, 120/208 volts, and 277/480 volts. The department may, at its
option, provide other voltages. All voltages are nominal and subject to
standard variation. The standard amperage shall be two hundred (200) amps.
   B.   Supply Of Service: Service will be supplied only under and pursuant to
this electric power service chapter, and any modifications or additions
thereto, and such applicable rate or rates as may from time to time be adopted.
Service will be supplied under a given rate schedule only at such point of
delivery as are adjacent to facilities of the department and are adequate and
suitable as to capacity and voltage for the service desired. Otherwise, special
agreements between the customer and the department may be required.
   C.   Continuity Of Service: The department will use reasonable diligence to
supply steady and continuous service, but does not guarantee the service
against irregularities or interruptions. The department shall not be liable to
the customer for any injury, loss, or damages occasioned by or related to
irregularities or interruptions from whatever cause, nor shall such
irregularity or interruption constitute a default in the service agreement or
on the part of the department.
   D.   Compliance With Regulations: If compliance with orders or formal
requests of any governmental agency, curtailing or diverting the department's
available electric power resources, make it impossible for the department to
supply the full electric power requirements of all its customers, the
department shall not be liable for any injury or loss caused by the resultant
curtailment, in whole or in part, of its supply to any customer. If any such
curtailment reduces the amount of power available to a customer below the
minimum amount contracted for, such a customer shall be relieved of the
obligation to pay more than the amount of power from time to time made
available by the department. Such other adjustments in amounts payable by the
customer will be made as may be equitable, taking into consideration the time
and extent of curtailment. Inability on the part of the department to meet its
contractual obligations to any customer, when such inability is due to the
department's compliance with an order or formal request of a governmental
agency, shall not constitute default on the part of the department as to any
contract or agreement, and any contract or agreement affected by such
compliance shall remain in full force and effect except as necessarily modified
during the effective period of such order or formal request.
   E.   Suspension Of Service For Repairs And Changes: When necessary to make
repairs or changes in the department's electrical facilities or other property,
the department may, without incurring any liability, suspend service for such
periods as may be reasonably necessary and in such manner as not to
inconvenience the customer unnecessarily.
   F.   Use Of Service: Service shall be supplied directly to the customer
through the department's own meter, and shall be used by the customer only for
the purposes specified in and in accordance with the provisions of the service
agreement. Service shall be for the customer's use only, and under no
circumstances may the customer or the customer's agent or any other individual
association or corporation install meters or other apparatus or facilities for
the purpose of remetering or reselling or otherwise disposing of service
supplied the customer to lessees, tenants, or others, except in accordance with
a service agreement of the department which specifically authorizes such use of
the service. In no case shall the customer, except with the consent of the
department, extend or connect his or her installation to lines across or under
a street, alley, lane, court, or avenue, or other public or private space in
order to obtain service from an adjacent property through one meter, even
though such adjacent property be owned by the customer. In case such
unauthorized remetering, sale, extension, or other disposition of service, the
department may immediately discontinue the supplying of service to the customer
until such unauthorized remetering, sale, or act is discontinued and full
payment is made for all service supplied or used, billed on proper
classification rate schedules, and reimbursement in full is made to the
department for all extra expenses incurred, including attorney fees and
expenses for clerical work, testing, and inspections.
   G.   Right Of Way: Without reimbursement, the customer shall make a proper
conveyance to the department of right of way satisfactory to the department
across the property owned by or controlled by the customer for the department's
lines or extensions thereof necessary or incidental to the supplying of service
to the customer.
   H.   Access To Premises: The duly authorized agents of the department shall
have access at all reasonable hours to the premises of the customer for the
purpose of inspecting wiring and apparatus, removing or replacing the
department's property, reading of meter, and all other purposes incident to the
supplying of electric power service. It shall be the responsibility of the
customer to provide access that is safe and free of obstruction at all times.
In the event the department determines, in its discretion, that the access
provided is not safe or is not free of obstruction, it shall give the customer
notice that the customer must remove the unsafe condition and/or obstruction
within ten (10) days of the notice. In the event the customer fails to comply
with the terms of the notice, the city may do either of the following:
      1.   The city may estimate for each month the electrical consumption at
the premises and use that estimate for purposes of charging the customer for
electrical consumption.
      2.   The city may without further notice discontinue electric power
service at the premises. If the city elects to estimate the electrical
consumption, that estimate shall equal the highest monthly level of metered
consumption at the premises during the preceding twelve (12) months, plus an
additional twenty five percent (25%). The estimate of consumption determined by
the city shall be binding upon the customer. The fact that the city estimates
consumption for one or more months shall not preclude it from subsequently
electing to terminate electric power service if the customer has not removed
the unsafe condition and/or obstruction.
   I.   Location Of Customer's Service Entrance Conductors: The customer's
service entrance conductors shall be located at a point readily accessible to
the department's service drop, such point to be determined by the department.
(Ord. 1989-1 § 1: prior code § 14-316)
13.08.080: CUSTOMER'S INSTALLATION:
   A.   Customer's Facilities For Receiving Service: The customer's facilities
for receiving shall be installed in accordance with the department's standards
and national electric code. The department's specifications mentioned above are
on file at the department's office and are made part of this electric power
service ordinance. The customer shall not employ or utilize any equipment,
appliance, or device so as to affect adversely the department's service to the
customer or to others. When polyphase service is supplied by the department,
the customer shall control the use thereof so that the load at the point of
delivery will be maintained in reasonable electric balance between the phases.
   B.   Power Factor Correction And Voltage Control:
      1.   The department reserves the right to require the customer to
install, at his or her expense, such power factor corrective and/or load
limiting equipment as is necessary for the department.
      2.   When fluorescent, neon, zeon, or other hot or cold cathode types of
gaseous tube lighting having similar power factor characteristics are installed
and used, the customer may be required to furnish, install, and maintain, at
his or her own expense, corrective apparatus designed to maintain at not less
than approximately ninety percent (90%) lagging the power factor or each unit
of such equipment or group of such equipment controlled as a unit by a single
switch or its equivalent which controls any such unit. Similarly, all air
conditioning equipment installed after the effective date of this electric
power service chapter shall be equipped so that when in operation, the power
factor is not less than ninety percent (90%) lagging.
      3.   Where the customer installs power factor corrective equipment, the
department reserves the right to require the customer to install such controls
as are necessary, in the department's opinion, to prevent voltage or other
disturbances on the department's system that are detrimental to the service
furnished other customers.
      4.   The department shall have the right to refuse or discontinue service
to any such installation, until the customer has complied with the foregoing
provisions.
   C.   Phase Of Motors:
      1.   Individual motor installations requiring less than five (5)
horsepower shall be single phase. Motors not exceeding one-half (1/2)
horsepower shall be for one hundred fifteen (115) volts; and motors of one-half
(1/2) horsepower to five (5) horsepower shall be for two hundred thirty (230)
volts. Exceptions may be served at the option of the department.
      2.   For installations of motors of five (5) horsepower and over, 3-phase
alternating current will be furnished at the voltage stated in the service
agreement, but single phase service, at the option of the department, may be
furnished for installation of motors of five (5) horsepower and over, where the
department has only single phase service available at the point where the
customer desires service.
   D.   Current-Limiting Devices:
      1.   Auto starters or other suitable devices shall be provided by the
customer for motors having above five (5) horsepower.
      2.   All motors starting on other than light load shall be provided with
suitable device or be of suitable type to limit the starting current.
   E.   Changes In Installation: Since the department's service drop,
transformers, meters, and other facilities used in supplying service to a
customer have a definite limited capacity, before making any material changes
or increases in the customer's installation or use, the customer shall give
notice thereof to the department, and obtain the department's consent thereto.
The department as promptly as possible after receipt of such notice will either
give its approval to the proposed change or increase, or will advise the
customer upon what conditions service can be supplied for such change or
increase.
   F.   Inspection By Department: The department shall have the right, but does
not assume the duty, to inspect the customer's installation at any time, and
from time to time, the department shall also have the right to refuse to
commence or to continue service whenever it does not consider such installation
to be in good operating condition, but the department does not in any event
assume any responsibility whatever in connection with the customer's
installation.
   G.   Customer's Responsibility: The customer assumes all responsibility on
the customer's side of the point of delivery for service supplied or taken, as
well as for the electrical installation, appliances, and apparatus used in
connection therewith, and shall indemnify the department from and against all
loss, cost, damage, or claims for injury or damages to persons or property
occasioned by or in any way resulting from such service or the use thereof on
the customer's side of the point of delivery. Such indemnity shall extend to
cover all expenses, including all attorney fees and court costs, incurred by
the department, with or without suit. (Ord. 1989-1 § 1: prior code § 14-317)
13.08.090: DEPARTMENT'S INSTALLATION:
   A.   Installation And Maintenance: Except as otherwise provided in this
electric power service chapter, in service agreements, or rate schedules, the
department will install and maintain its lines and equipment on its side of the
point of delivery, but shall not be required to install or maintain any lines
or equipment, except meters, on the customer's side of the point of delivery.
Only the department's agents are authorized to connect the department's service
drop to the customer's service entrance conductors.
   B.   Connections To Customer's Service: The service drop will ordinarily be
installed overhead. If the customer desires to have the service drop installed
in any other manner, special arrangement will be made between the customer and
the department whereby such service drop will be installed and maintained at
the customer's expenses.
   C.   Relocation Of Department Facilities At Customer's Request: When, solely
for the customer's convenience, the department is requested to relocate its
facilities, the customer shall pay to the department the total cost of making
the requested change, as that cost is determined by the department.
   D.   Protection By Customer: The customer shall protect the department's
wiring and apparatus on the customer's premises and shall permit no one but the
department's agents or persons authorized by law to inspect or handle same. In
the event of any loss or damage to such property of the department caused by or
arising out of carelessness, neglect, or misuse by the customer or other
unauthorized persons, the cost of making good such damages, including attorney
fees and court costs, shall be paid by the customer.
   E.   Tree Trimming: The department shall regularly review the condition of
trees growing in or near public utility easements to determine if potential
interference with overhead utility lines might pose a problem by reason of
their growth patterns during the growing season of the trees. Trees growing
under or near power lines that could potentially interfere with the system will
be trimmed no less than ten feet (10') below the nearest line. Consideration of
the growth patterns of the particular tree will be taken into account. Trees
with rapid growth may be trimmed as much as fifteen feet (15') below the lines.
The department will make a reasonable effort to contact property owners before
trimming a tree or trees, but where this is not possible, and the crew is in
the area with their equipment, the trees will be trimmed. Consideration will be
given to the appearance of the trimmed tree, but an owner who is not satisfied
with the appearance of his or her tree may at his or her expense shape the tree
to his or her liking. This work may be done by the owner or by a commercial
company paid by the owner, but is not the responsibility of the city. Access to
easements will be obtained from the property owner wherever possible. Debris
from trimming operations will be removed by the city crew. Because of the
safety hazard and potential for electric shock, owners are advised not to trim
their own trees. If the owner does his or her own trimming, he or she agrees by
so doing not to hold the city liable for his or her failure to comply with this
chapter or for any accident related to his noncompliance. In the event the
property owner refuses to permit the city crew to enter the premises to
complete the required trimming work, the city shall discontinue electrical
power service to such property owner at that location until such permission is
given. (Ord. 1989-1 § 1: prior code § 14-318)
13.08.100: METERING:
   A.   Installation: The department will furnish and install the necessary
meter or meters, and the customer shall provide and maintain locations for
installation thereof free of expense and satisfactory to the department.
   B.   Evidence Of Service Use: The registration of the department's meter
shall be accepted and received at all times and places as prima facie evidence
of the amount of power and energy taken by the customer.
   C.   Voltage Of Installation: Metering will be at secondary voltage unless
otherwise specified in the service agreement.
   D.   Meter Tests And Bill Adjustments:
      1.   When the accuracy of a meter is questioned, upon written request
from the customer, the department will test the meter by comparing with a
standard test meter. If the meter is found to be accurate within plus or minus
two percent (±2%), the customer will reimburse the department for the cost of
said test. Prior to any test, the department reserves the right to require a
deposit to cover said costs.
      2.   If the meter being tested is found to be more than two percent (2%)
slow or fast, no charge shall be made for testing, and the department will
adjust the proportion to the error (either fast or slow) for the period covered
by the billing in question and until the date of installation of a new meter,
but said adjustment period, in any event, shall not exceed ninety (90) days.
(Ord. 1989-1 § 1: prior code § 14-319)
13.08.110: BILLING:
   A.   Billing Periods: Bills ordinarily will be rendered regularly at monthly
intervals, but may be rendered more frequently at the department's option.
Nonreceipt of bills by the customer shall not release or diminish the
obligation of the customer with respect to payment thereof.
   B.   Minimums: When a customer receives service for less than thirty (30)
days during the billing period, the applicable monthly minimum shall apply.
   C.   Separate Billing For Each Point Of Delivery:
      1.   At each point of delivery, use of service shall be metered
separately for each customer served. Whenever, for any reason, the department
furnishes two (2) or more meter installations for a single customer or supplies
service under a rate schedule which does not require a meter, each point of
metering and/or point of delivery where no meter is required shall be
considered as a separate service. A separate service agreement will be
required, and bills will be separately calculated for each such separate
service, except where the department may, under special circumstances, waive
this requirement.
      2.   For service locations established prior to April 18, 1989, which
have more than one meter and which were billed on a conjunctive meter basis
under a common rate schedule, the department will continue to bill these
locations on a conjunctive meter basis until said multiple meters can be
combined into a single meter location.
   D.   Payment Of Bills: All charges due from the customer become delinquent
if not paid on or before the due date set forth on the bill. Upon becoming
delinquent, all unpaid balances will be assessed a late charge of five percent
(5%). The customer shall pay any attorney fees and court costs incurred in the
collection of past due bills. In addition the customer's service may be
terminated as provided in the city's uniform utility billing ordinance.
   E.   Billing Dispute: In the event any portion of any bill is dispute,
including questions relating to metering, the disputed amount shall be paid
under protest when due. Said protest must be in written form and must be
received by the department on or before the due date of the bill in question.
The protest shall be referred to the city recorder or his or her designee for
resolution. Upon their written determination of the amount due, the customer
may appeal to the utilities commission. In the absence of such an appeal, the
determination of the department and city recorder shall be final. If protest is
not made as herein provided, no adjustment will be made.
   F.   Tax Adjustment Clause: In the event any governmental body shall impose
a gross revenue, occupation, or franchise tax upon the city for power supplied,
then the amount of such tax shall be billed to and paid by the customers
receiving the power from the city.
   G.   Theft Of Service: In any case of tampering with a meter installation or
interfering with the proper working thereof, or theft of service by any person,
the customer shall be liable to immediate discontinuance of service as provided
herein, and the department shall be entitled to collect from the customer at
the appropriate rate for all power and energy not recorded on the meter by
reason of such tampering, interfering, or theft or service diversion, as such

appropriate to the customer for the service requested. The selection will be
based on the prospective customer's statement as to the class of service
desired, the amount and manner of use, and any other pertinent information.
This statement will be recorded and filed with the application. The department
shall not be liable for any errors in designating the applicable schedule.
      2.   If through error a service agreement is entered into specifying a
rate schedule which is not applicable to the class of service taken, on
discovery of the error, all bills rendered during the preceding twelve (12)
months shall be recalculated in accordance with the lowest properly applicable
rate schedule, and any excess paid shall be applied on any outstanding balance
owing by the customer or, if no balance is owing, shall be refunded by the
department, or any balance due shall be paid by the customer, as the case may
be. No adjustments may be made for service provided more than twelve (12)
months prior to the date on which adjustment is first requested in writing.

ARTICLE III. NET METERING POLICY
13.08.400: AVAILABILITY:
Santa Clara City ("city") desires to encourage the use of renewable resources
with Santa Clara City electric customers ("customers") by making available a
meter capable of providing the necessary accounting to allow the customer to
displace electric energy otherwise purchased from the city or to provide
electric energy to the city ("net meter"). The net meter will be available to
any electric customer connected to the Santa Clara City's electric distribution
system provided that the customer installs a solar, wind, or other city
approved renewable generation resource ("renewable resource") on the customer's
side of the meter, subject to the application provisions. (Ord. 2013-08)
13.08.410: APPLICATION PROVISIONS:
The customer must make an application to Santa Clara City and receive approval
from the city before installing an interconnected renewable resource on their
property. Santa Clara City may withhold approval if for any reason the
requested interconnection would result in a negative monetary or physical
impact on the city's electrical system. The city may approve the agreement if
there is no physical negative impact, but may terminate this agreement at any
time if it is determined to have an adverse monetary impact.
   A.   By accepting this net metering policy, the customer hereby agrees to
the following provisions:
      1.   The monthly electrical output of the renewable resource shall not be
greater than one hundred twenty percent (120%) of the historical maximum
monthly energy consumption at a single point of delivery of the customer.
      2.   A renewable resource installed by the customer shall include, at the
customer's expense, all equipment necessary to meet applicable safety, power
quality and interconnection requirements established by the national electric
code ("NEC"), national electric safety code ("NESC") and shall be manufactured
and installed to interconnection standards that meet or exceed the Institute Of
Electrical And Electronics Engineers, Inc. ("IEEE") standard 1547 for
interconnecting distributed resources with electric power systems and
Underwriters Laboratories, Inc. ("UL") standard 1741, inverters, converters and
controllers for use in independent power systems.
      3.   The customer shall be required to install a manual disconnect that
is within five feet (5') of the meter location, readily accessible by city
personnel and outside of any fenced in area. The disconnect switch shall be
lockable and shall be labeled as "generation disconnect".
      4.   The city shall install and maintain a new revenue meter for the
customer, at the customer's expense. In addition, any subsequent revenue meter
change necessitated by the customer, whether because of a decision to stop net
metering or for any other reason, shall be an expense billed to the customer at
the applicable service rates.
      5.   By accepting this agreement the customer releases to the city all
renewable energy credits ("RECs"), solar renewable energy credits ("SRECs") or
other renewable attributes as appropriate based on actual on site electric
generation from the renewable resource.
      6.   The customer will comply with all city service and utility billing
requirements, including payments for applicable monthly electrical base rates
and other utility billings, fees and taxes.
      7.   The customer will comply with all installation requirements,
applicable inspection fees, building and electric codes of the city.
      8.   The customer's facility used for net metering shall be equipped with
metering equipment, which can measure the flow of electricity in both
directions at the same rate. For customer facilities less than ten (10)
kilowatts ("kW") in rated capacity, this shall be accomplished through the use
of a single, bidirectional electric revenue meter which has only a single
register for billing purposes.
      9.   The city shall make net metering available to eligible customers on
a first come, first served basis. Single or multiple net metering connections
to a city owned transformer, which create an imbalance that exceeds twenty
percent (20%) of the nameplate, rating may be denied at the city's discretion
or, if approved may require system upgrades including additional transformers
or other system upgrades at the customer's expense.
      10.   Net metering connections to city facilities above or greater than
industry standard, secondary voltages shall not be allowed under this policy
and shall be reviewed by the city under a separate review and approval process,
which may include a system impact study. Renewable resource connections to
transmission lines within the city are prohibited.
      11.   If the net metering project requires special engineering studies as
determined by the city, the customer shall be responsible for all costs. An
estimate of costs shall be provided by a licensed engineering firm as
determined by the city and payment will be made by the customer, to the city,
before the engineering study is approved. Final billing for the study will be
trued up upon completion and the customer shall be billed for any amount above,
or their electric account credited, for any amount below the initial estimate.
      12.   The customer shall be solely responsible for all work, and costs
incurred, for installation and maintenance of the renewable resource. All
modifications or improvements required to the city's electric system due to the
customer's installation of facilities shall be paid for by the customer. (Ord.
2013-08)
13.08.420: INSPECTION:
Upon approval and installation of a renewable resource, but before
interconnection to the net meter, the city shall inspect the renewable
resource, installation and interconnection and approve or disapprove the
interconnection. The city may disapprove any final interconnection for any
reason.
   A.   The city shall have the right to inspect the customer's renewable
resource during reasonable hours and with reasonable prior notice to the
customer. If the city finds that the customer's renewable resource is not in
compliance with the requirements of the city's interconnection rules and the
standards set forth in this policy, and noncompliance adversely affects the
safety or reliability of the city's facilities or other customer's facilities,
the city may require the customer to disconnect the facility until compliance
is achieved.
   B.   If the city disconnects the renewable resource, the customer shall
receive in a timely manner, a written explanation of the disconnection. The
customer shall have the right to correct the situation and petition the city to
reestablish an interconnection. (Ord. 2013-08)
13.08.430: ENERGY RATES AND PAYMENTS:
The customer shall be subject to the following provisions for service under
this policy:
   A.   For all kWh delivered by the city the customer shall pay the normal
city rate for customer service, as if the customer had not installed a
renewable resource.
   B.   The city shall credit the customer's bill for kWhs only that exceeds
the customer's on site consumption of kWh in the billing period following the
billing period of excess production at four cents ($0.04) per kWh.
   C.   On June 1 of each calendar year any remaining unused credit accumulated
for a period of greater than thirty (30) days of historical monthly usage,
shall be relinquished by the customer with no compensation by the city to the
customer.
   D.   If a home with a renewable resource is sold, any remaining credits will
be applied to the electrical billing for kWh consumption with any remaining
unused credits above the total billing relinquished to the city.
   E.   Net metering credit shall only be applied to offset part or all of the
customer's own electrical requirements at a single metering point exclusively.
Net metering credit shall not be applied to multiple meters owned by a single
customer at separate locations.
   F.   This agreement is between the electric customer and the city. Nothing
in this policy allows for the purchase or sale of energy produced by the
customer to or from a third party. Renewable resources on rental units are not
eligible for net metering under this policy.
   G.   The city reserves the right to modify or amend this policy, the city's
avoided cost rate, the displacement ratio, or the monthly service charge, upon
reasonable advance notice to the customer (30 days). (Ord. 2013-08)
13.08.440: LIABILITY:
The customer shall be responsible for any damage caused by the customer's
renewable resource to the city's distribution system and other customer
facilities. The customer shall be responsible for the installation and
maintenance of applicable protection equipment, and for any damage caused by
improper application, maintenance or faulty equipment. The city will not be
liable directly or indirectly for permitting or continuing to allow an
attachment of a renewable resource, or the acts or omissions of the customer's
renewable resource that cause loss or injury, including death, to any third
party.
Application for the customer's net metering, within a homeowners' association
("HOA"), must be accompanied by a letter of approval of the net metering
installation, signed by the chairman of the board at the time of application.
The letter must include a copy of the minutes showing a majority vote of
approval. The city is not liable for any violation of existing CCRs within an
HOA, related to the customer's installation of a renewable resource.
Neither the city nor the customer shall be subject to any liability or damages
due to the inability of the city to serve the customer's load, due to lack of
energy from either the city or the renewable resource.
Neither the city nor the customer shall be subject to any liability or claims
for damages due to the inability of equipment manufacturers or vendors to
provide equipment or repairs essential for the safe operation of the system in
a timely manner. (Ord. 2013-08)
13.08.450: FORMS:
Forms for the net metering program are on file in the city. (Ord. 2013-08)

unequal, or unjust. They may, if they see fit, rebate all or any part of the
water bill of any indigent person. (Prior code § 14-119)
13.20.110: USE WITHOUT PAYMENT PROHIBITED:
It is unlawful for any person by himself, herself, family, servants, or agents
to utilize the city water or sewer system without paying therefor, as herein
provided or, without authority, to open any fire hydrant, stopcock, valve, or
other fixtures attached to the system of water supply unless it is done

the part of any one of the users to comply with this section, shall warrant a
withholding of a supply of water through the service connections until
compliance or payment has been made, and in any event, the property owner shall
be primarily liable to the city for all water services utilized on all such
premises. Nothing herein shall be deemed to preclude the power of the city to
require separate pipes, connections, or meters at a subsequent time. Exceptions
to the requirements of this section for service from the secondary irrigation
water system may be granted by the superintendent where a single service pipe,
connection or water meter was already installed or established prior to the
city's establishment of its secondary irrigation water system in August 2019.
For example, and only as an example, the superintendent may permit two (2) or
more families or service users to be supplied from the same service pipe,
connection or water meter if the same were already installed as part of a
private irrigation company system prior to August 2019, and thereafter that

13.20.200: NONLIABILITY FOR DAMAGES:
The city shall not be liable for any damage to a water service user by reason
of stoppage or interruption of his or her water supply service caused by fires,
scarcity of water, accidents to the water system or its mains, or which occurs
as the result of maintenance and extension operations, or from any other
unavoidable cause. This section shall not be construed to extend the liability
of the city beyond that provided in the governmental immunity act. (Prior code
§ 14-130)
13.20.210: WATER NOT SUPPLIED FOR MOTORS, SYPHONS, ETC.:
No water shall be supplied from the pipes of the city water system for the
purpose of driving motor, syphon, turbine, or other wheels, or any hydraulic

whatsoever, nor shall any license be granted or issued for any such purpose
except by special permission of the city council. (Prior code § 14-131)
13.20.220: SPRINKLERS:
   A.   It is unlawful for any person to use such number of outlets
simultaneously or to use such sprinkler or combinations of sprinkler or outlets
as will in the opinion of the city council materially affect the pressure or
supply of water in the city water system or any part thereof, and the city
council may from time to time, by resolution, specify combinations or numbers
of outlets which may have such effect.
   B.   The city council shall, after determining that such improper use
exists, notify the affected water user or the owner of the premises whereon
such use occurs of such determination in writing, order such use discontinued
and advise that such continued usage constitutes a violation of this part.
(Prior code § 14-132)
13.20.230: SCARCITY OF WATER:
If a culinary water shortage or drought is expected, the city will implement
the following 4-stage culinary water conservation management plan. The
implementation will be under the approval and direction of the city council and
city manager. The city staff (city department heads and city manager) shall
meet on a regular basis to discuss the culinary water conditions and ensure all
city departments are doing their part to comply, enforce and encourage the
outlined water conservation measures. Nonessential water use refers to those
uses not necessary to preserve the public health and sanitation and provide
fire protection services.
   A.   Conservation Stages: The stages for culinary water conservation are as
follows:
      1.   Stage 1: If total culinary supply (wells and springs) exceeds the
total daily demand by less than three percent (3%) (i.e., water tanks cannot
recover each day).
      2.   Stage 2: Total culinary demand exceeds supply by less than five
percent (5%).
      3.   Stage 3: Total culinary water demand exceeds supply by five percent
(5%) to ten percent (10%) or more.
      4.   Stage 4: Total culinary water demand exceeds supply by ten percent
(10%).
   B.   Management Plan:
      1.   Stage 1: Voluntary restriction on nonessential water use:
Estimated reduction goal: Up to five percent (5%).
         a.   Procedure: Publish news release in local newspaper, on web site
and have radio stations announce same.
      2.   Stage 2: Mandatory restrictions on nonessential water use:
Estimated reduction goal: Five percent (5%) to ten percent (10%) of peak use.
         a.   Procedure: By authority of the city manager and the city council,
the following water conservation measures along with those of stage 1 will be
implemented:
            (1)   Work with St. George City to ensure Snow Canyon Compact
members are allocated their percentage allocation of the water being produced
from Snow Canyon well system;
            (2)   All parks, schools or other areas having large grassed area
such as the city cemetery currently on culinary water will be allowed to water
at a reduced level of demand of ten percent (10%) reduction target;
            (3)   Residential and commercial users will be allowed to water
outside areas based on odd/even concept between the hours of eight o'clock (8:
00) P.M. and ten o'clock (10:00) A.M. (the address of the property, as is even
or odd will determine the day of watering);
            (4)   The use of fire hydrants for purpose other than fire
protection will not be allowed for use by municipal departments, contractors
and all others;
            (5)   Water use for the following nonessential uses will not be
allowed:
   (A) Noncommercial washing of automobiles and trucks;
   (B) The washing of streets, driveways, and sidewalks;
   (C) The use of water to fill and top off swimming pools, hot tubs etc.;
   (D) Use of water for ornamental fountains, waterfalls, or reflection pools
will not be allowed if not previously filled. Adding additional water to the
same will not be allowed.
         b.   Enforcement: If any person or entity violates these restrictions,
it shall be considered a class B misdemeanor, or lessor offense at the
discretion of the city.
      3.   Stage 3: Mandatory restriction on all culinary water uses:
Estimated reduction goal: Ten percent (10%) to twenty five percent (25%) of
peak uses.
         a.   Procedure: By authority of the city manager and the city council,
the following additional water conservation measures will be implemented along
with those in stage 1 and stage 2:
            (1)   During this stage the approval of any new building permits
and subdivision approvals will be delayed until the conservation restrictions
are lifted.
         b.   Enforcement: If any person or entity violates these restrictions,
it shall be considered a class B misdemeanor, or lessor offense at the
discretion of the city.
      4.   Stage 4: Water rationing plan for all available culinary water
resources:
Estimated reduction goal: Twenty five percent (25%) to sixty percent (60%) of
peak use.
         a.   Procedure: By the authority of the city manager and city council,
the following water rationing plan will be implemented:
            (1)   General: It is imperative that water customers within Santa
Clara City and surrounding areas achieve an immediate and further reduction in
the water use in order to extend existing water supplies and, at the same time,
assure that sufficient water is available to preserve the public health and
sanitation, and provide fire protection service.
The objective of this local water rationing plan is to effect an immediate
twenty five (25) percentage reduction in water usage. Should drought conditions
continue, further reductions in usage might be required. If it is necessary to
implement further reductions, this plan will be modified to reduce the levels
more. It is the city public service department's responsibility to continually
monitor on hand quantities to determine if amendments are required.
The plan provides for equitable reductions in water usage on the part of each
water customer. The success of this plan depends on the cooperation of all
water customers.
No outdoor use of water except the watering of outdoor gardens, landscaped
areas, trees, shrubs, and other outdoor plants, except by means of a bucket
pail, or handheld hose equipped with an automatic shutoff nozzle. Such watering
can only take place between the hours of eight o'clock (8:00) P.M. and ten
o'clock (10:00) A.M.
            (2)   Prohibited Nonessential Water Uses: The following water uses
are declared nonessential and will not be allowed within Santa Clara City along
with those of stage 1, stage 2 and stage 3:
               (A)   The watering of lawns;
               (B)   The use of water for flushing sewers or hydrants by
municipalities or any public or private individual or entity except as deemed
necessary and approved in the interest of public health or safety by the city;
               (C)   The use of fire hydrants of the fire department for
testing fire apparatus and for fire department drills, except as deemed
necessary and approved in the interest of public health or safety by the city;
               (D)   No exporting of culinary water outside of city boundaries.
         b.   Enforcement: If any person or entity violates these restrictions,
it shall be considered a class B misdemeanor lessor offense at the discretion
of the city.
   C.   Exemptions Or Variance: If compliance with the nonessential use of
water restrictions found in stages 2, 3 and/or 4 would result in extraordinary
hardship upon a water user, the water user may apply for an exemption or
variance. For purpose of this section, extraordinary hardship means a permanent
damage to property or other personal or economic loss, which is substantially
more severe than the sacrifice borne by other water users subject to the
nonessential use of water restrictions.
A person or business entity believing he/she suffers an extraordinary hardship
and desiring to be wholly or partially exempt from the restrictions on the
nonessential use of water shall submit a written request with full
documentation supporting the need for the requested relief to the city.
The application shall contain information specifying:
      1.   The nature of the hardship claimed and reasons for the requested
exemption or variance.
      2.   The efforts taken by the applicant to conserve water and extent to
which water use may be reduced by the applicant without extraordinary hardship.
The city shall advise the applicant of its decision regarding the application.
Applicant will be invited to a hearing. An exemption or variance will be
granted only to the extent necessary to relieve extraordinary hardship. Should
variance be denied, an appeal can be made to the Santa Clara city council.
Appeal will be heard during a regular or special meeting of city council. (Ord.
2002-08 § 1: prior code § 14-133)
13.20.240: WASTE OF WATER:
   A.   Users of water from the city water system shall not permit water to
continue to run wastefully and without due efforts to conserve water. If, in
the judgment of the water superintendent or of any of the officers of the city,
a user of city water engages in practices which result in the needless waste of
water and continues so to do after reasonable notice to discontinue
wastefulness has been given, the superintendent or any officer may refer the
matter to the city council.
   B.   The city council may thereupon consider terminating the right of the
individual to use culinary and/or secondary water. If it elects to consider the
matter of termination, it shall give notice to the water user of the intention
to terminate his or her water connection at least five (5) days prior to the
meeting of the city council at which termination of water service is to be
considered. The notice shall inform him or her of the time and place of the
meeting and of the charges which lead to the consideration of the termination.
   C.   A water user whose right to utilize city water is being reviewed shall
have opportunity to appear with or without counsel and present his or her
reasons why his or her water service should not be discontinued.
   D.   After due hearing, the city council may arrive at a determination. If
the determination is to discontinue the water user's service connection, it
shall notify him or her of the decision and of the period during which the
service will remain discontinued. (Ord. 2019-10 § 1: prior code § 14-134)
13.20.250: WATER METERS:
   A.   Except as otherwise expressly permitted by this chapter, all
structures, dwelling units, establishments and persons using water from the
city water system must have such number of water meters connected to their
water system as are necessary in the judgment of the superintendent to
adequately measure use and determine water charges to the respective users.
   B.   Meters will be furnished by the city upon application for a connection,
and upon payment of such connection fees and other costs as may be established
by the city council from time to time by resolution.
   C.   Meters shall be deemed to be and remain the property of the city,
whenever a dispute between superintendent and the property owner arises as to
the appropriate number of meters to be installed on any premises, the matter
shall be heard and determined by the city council after due notice in writing
to the parties involved.
   D.   The superintendent shall cause meter readings to be taken regularly and
shall advise the recorder thereof for the purpose of recording the necessary
billings for water service.
   E.   Meters may be checked, inspected or adjusted at the discretion of the
city, and they shall not be adjusted or tampered with by the customer. Meter
boxes shall not be opened for the purpose of turning on or off the water except
by an authorized representative of the city unless special permission is given
by the city through its representatives to the customer to do so.
   F.   If a customer submits a written request to the superintendent to test
his or her water meter, the city may, if under the circumstances it deems it
advisable and in its discretion, order a test of the meter measuring the water
delivered to such customer. If such request is made within twelve (12) months
after the date of the last previous test, the customer may be required to pay
the cost of such test. If the meter is found in such test to record from ninety
seven percent (97%) to one hundred three percent (103%) of accuracy under
methods of testing satisfactory to the city council, the meter shall be deemed
to accurately measure the use of water.
   G.   If the city's meters fail to register at any time, the water delivered
during the period of failure shall be estimated on the basis of previous
consumption during a period which is not questioned. In the event a meter is
found to be recording less than ninety seven percent (97%) or more than one
hundred three percent (103%) of accuracy, the city shall make such adjustments
in the customer's previous bills as are just and fair under the circumstances.
   H.   All damages or injury to the lines, meters or other materials of the
city on or near the customer's premises caused by any act or neglect of the
customer shall in the discretion of the city be repaired by and at the expense
of the customer, and the customer shall pay all costs and expenses, including a
reasonable attorney fee, which may arise or accrue to the city through its
efforts to repair the damage to the lines, meters or to other equipment of the
department or collect such costs from the customer. (Prior code § 14-135)
13.20.260: PERMITS FOR INSTALLATION:
It is unlawful for any person to lay, repair, alter or connect any water line
to any city water system without first having received a construction permit
from the office of the recorder or from the water superintendent. (Ord. 2019-10

13.20.270: APPLICATIONS FOR INSTALLATION PERMIT:
   A.   Applications for permits to make water connections or other alteration
or for laying or repairing lines connected directly or indirectly to the city
water system must be made in writing by a licensed plumber, his or her
authorized agent, or by the owner of the premises who shall describe the nature
or the work to be done for which the application is made.
The application shall be granted if the superintendent determines that:
      1.   The connection, repair, alteration or installation will cause no
damage to the street in which the water main is laid, or that it will not be
prejudicial to the interests of persons whose property has been or may
thereafter be connected to the water main.
      2.   The connection conforms to the ordinances, regulations,
specifications and standards of materials required by the city.
All connections, alterations or installations shall be to the line and grade
designated by the water superintendent.
   B.   Fees for permits or for inspection services shall be of such amounts as
the city council shall from time to time determine by resolution. (Prior code §
14-137)
13.20.280: MOVING OR REPLACEMENT OF WATER LINES:
In the event that the city in its sole discretion determines that any water
line of the city must be moved or replaced, the city shall bear that portion of
the cost of such move or replacement which applies to main lines up to the
property line of the customer. The cost of reconnecting such new line or lines
from the customer's water system(s) to his or her property line shall be borne
by the customer. (Ord. 2019-10 § 1: prior code § 14-138)
13.20.290: WHEN PERMITS SHALL NOT BE ISSUED:
Permission to connect with the city water system shall not be given unless the
plumbing in the customer's water system(s) to be connected meets the provisions
of the building and plumbing codes of the city. (Ord. 2019-10 § 1: prior code §
14-139)
13.20.300: DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICE:
Any customer desiring to discontinue service shall notify the city in writing
of such fact at least ten (10) days before the date when such service shall be
discontinued. On giving such written notice, the customer shall not be
responsible for water bills incurred after the date specified in the notice.
Any credit balance in favor of the customer as a result of an advance payment
of bills or a deposit will be refunded upon discontinuance of service. (Prior
code § 14-140)
13.20.310: FIRE HYDRANTS:

13.20.410: PURPOSE FOR CONTROL OF CROSS CONNECTIONS POLICY:
   A.   Numerous parcels of property, primarily in the "valley" area of the
city, have access to secondary, nonpotable water via a pressurized irrigation
system that was installed in the spring and early summer of 2004. Lots that
have access to secondary, nonpotable water and the city's drinking water
distribution system risk cross connecting the two (2) water systems; thereby,
potentially compromising the integrity of the public drinking water supply.
   B.   To protect the public drinking water supply of Santa Clara City from
the possibility of contamination or pollution by requiring compliance with the
Utah state rules for public drinking water systems and the uniform plumbing
code, that require a cross connection control protection of all public drinking
water systems in the state of Utah.
   C.   To promote the reasonable elimination or control of cross connections
in the plumbing fixtures, residential and commercial, of the consumer, as
required by the state and plumbing regulations to assure water system safety.
   D.   To provide for the administration of a continuing program for the
control of cross connections, which will systematically examine risk and
effectively prevent the contamination or pollution of the drinking water
system. (Ord. 2004-16 § 2)

department of environmental quality, division of drinking water, as meeting an
applicable specification or as suitable for the proposed use.
   AUXILIARY WATER SUPPLY: Any water supply on or available to the premises
other than the purveyor's public water supply will be considered as an
auxiliary water supply. These auxiliary waters may include water from another
purveyor's public potable water supply or any natural source(s) such as well,
spring, river, stream, etc., or "used waters" or "industrial fluids". These
waters may be contaminated or polluted or they may be objectionable and
constitute an unacceptable water source over which the water purveyor does not
have authority for sanitary control.

backflow, specifications for backflow prevention assemblies are contained
within the uniform plumbing code and in the cross connection control program
for Utah maintained by the division of drinking water.
   CONTAMINATION: A degradation of the quality of the potable water supply by
nonpotable water, sewage, industrial fluids or waste liquids, compounds or
other materials that may create a health hazard.
   CROSS CONNECTION: Any physical connection or arrangement of piping of
fixtures which may allow nonpotable water or industrial fluids or other
material of questionable quality to come into contact with potable water inside
a water distribution system. This would include temporary conditions, such as
swing connections, removable sections, four-way plug valves, spools, dummy
sections of pipe, swivel or change over devices or sliding multiport tubes or
other plumbing arrangements.
   CROSS CONNECTION CONTAINMENT: The installation of an approved backflow
assembly at the water service connection to any customer's premises where it is
physically and economically infeasible to permanently eliminate or control all
actual or potential cross connections within the customer's water distribution
system; or, it means the installation of an approved backflow prevention
assembly on the service line leading to and supplying a portion of a customer's
water system where there are actual or potential cross connections which cannot
be effectively eliminated or controlled at the point of the cross connection
(isolation).
   CROSS CONNECTION CONTROLLED: A connection between a potable water system and
a nonpotable water system with an approved backflow prevention assembly
property installed and maintained so that it will continuously afford the
protection commensurate with the degree of hazard.

   B.   It shall be the responsibility of the consumer to purchase, install,
and arrange testing (annual testing and other testing times as deemed necessary
by water purveyor) and maintenance of any backflow prevention device/assembly
required to comply with this chapter. Failure to comply with this chapter shall
constitute grounds for discontinuation of service.
   C.   To attend a training session, and provide documentation thereof to
water purveyor, approved by water purveyor, prior to utilizing and connecting
to the pressurized irrigation system and/or using an auxiliary water supply.
Subsequent first time users of the pressurized irrigation system are also
required to attend a training course prior to their use of the pressurized
irrigation system and/or use of an auxiliary water supply. The purpose of the
training course is to inform consumer of regulations governing backflow and
cross connections as well as to impart an understanding of the potential risks
of contamination to the city's drinking water distribution system. (Ord. 2004-
16 § 2)
13.20.450: RESPONSIBILITY; BUILDING INSPECTOR:
   A.   The building inspector's responsibility to enforce the applicable
sections of the plumbing code begins at the point of service (downstream or
consumer side of the meter) and continues throughout the length of the

   A.   In the case of a consumer requiring an assembly to be tested, any
currently certified backflow technician is authorized to make the test and
report the results to the consumer and the water purveyor. If any residential
tested assembly is in need of repair R309-305 of the Utah administration code
requires that an individual certified for such work make actual repairs. If any
commercially tested assembly is in need of repair the construction trade
license act, title 58, chapter 55-2-(21), requires a licensed plumber to make
actual repairs on any assembly within a building. (Ord. 2004-16 § 2)
13.20.480: REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTROL OF CROSS CONNECTIONS:
   A.   No water service connection to any premises shall be installed or
maintained by the water purveyor unless the water supply is protected as
required by state laws, regulations, codes, and this chapter. Service of water
to a consumer found to be in violation of this chapter shall be discontinued by
the water department after due process of written notification of violation and
an appropriate time suspense for voluntary compliance, if:
      1.   A backflow prevention assembly required by this chapter for the
control of backflow and cross connection is not installed, tested, and
maintained;
      2.   If it is found that a backflow prevention assembly has been removed
or bypassed;

   B.   The customer's system(s) shall be open for inspection at all reasonable
times to authorized representatives of the water purveyor to determine whether
cross connections or other structural or sanitary hazards, including violation
of this chapter exist and to audit the results of the required survey (R309-
102-5 of the Utah administration code). In order to make such determination,
the inspection shall include access to above ceiling areas, pits, paneled
interior areas, or other locations where cross connections might exist. The
customer shall be responsible to provide a route of access across the property
for inspection purposes that is free from litter, overgrowth, the threat of a
vicious animal, or other hindrance that may be detrimental to the safety of the
inspector or obstructive to his or her ease of access.
   C.   Whenever the public water purveyor deems a service connection's water
usage contributes a sufficient hazard to the water supply, an approved backflow
prevention assembly shall be installed on the service line of the identified
consumer's water system, at or near the property line or immediately inside the
building being served; but, in all cases, before the first branch line leading
off the service line.
   D.   The type of protective assembly required under subsection C of this
section shall depend upon the degree of hazard which exist at the point of
cross connection (whether direct or indirect), applicable to local and state
requirements or resulting from the required survey.
   E.   It shall be the responsibility of the consumer at any premises where
backflow prevention assemblies are installed to have certified survey/
inspections, and operational test made at least once per year at the consumer's
expense. In those instances where the public water purveyor deems the hazard to
be great, he or she may require certificate surveys/inspections and test at a
more frequent interval. It shall be the duty of the purveyor to see that these
tests are made according to the standards set forth by the state department of
environment quality, division of drinking water.
   F.   All backflow prevention assemblies shall be tested within ten (10)
working days of initial installation.
   G.   No backflow prevention assemblies shall be installed so as to create a
safety hazard (example: installed over an electrical panel, boilers, or above
ceiling level). (Ord. 2004-16 § 2)
13.20.490: VIOLATIONS OF THE CROSS CONNECTION POLICY:
If violations of this chapter exist or if there has not been any corrective
action taken by the consumer within ten (10) days of the written notification
of the deficiencies noted within the survey or test results, then the water
purveyor shall deny or immediately discontinue service to the premises by
providing a physical break in the service line until the customer has corrected
the condition(s) in conformance with all state and local regulations and
statutes relating to plumbing, safe drinking water suppliers, and the ordinance
codified in this chapter. If the nature of the violation presents immediate and
serious implications to the integrity of the public drinking water supply as
established by the water purveyor, water purveyor is authorized to immediately
discontinue water service after making a reasonable attempt to notify water
customer. Other penalties may apply per
chapter 1.16 of this code. (Ord. 2004-16 § 2)
13.20.500: WATER USE EFFICIENCY IN LANDSCAPE IRRIGATION:
   A.   Time Of Day Watering Parameters:

eight o’clock (8:00) P.M.
      2.   Secondary (untreated or reclaimed wastewater) water systems have
limited capacity and are therefore exempt from this section. Facilities
irrigated with secondary water systems include public amenities (parks, golf
courses, schools, cemeteries) and some residential neighborhoods. Using
secondary water for irrigation extends our water resources and saves residents
millions of dollars in annual treatment costs.
   B.   Applicability Of Time Of Day Watering Regulations: The provisions of
this section shall apply to all landscapes watered with potable water within
the city. This section does not apply in the following situations:
      1.   New lawn, that requires frequent irrigation for establishment

shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed
plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to
the Manager for review, and shall be acceptable to the Manager before such
facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures
shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such
facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to SGRWRF under the
provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 2018-09)
13.22.210: ADDITIONAL PRETREATMENT MEASURES:
   A.   Whenever deemed necessary, SGRWRF may require users to restrict their
discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be
discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of
discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams, and such
other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW, and determine the
user's compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
   B.   The Manager may require any person discharging into the POTW to install
and maintain, on their property, and at their expense, a suitable storage and
flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. An individual wastewater
discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.
   C.   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors, such as described by the
International Plumbing Code, shall be provided when, in the opinion of the
Manager, they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing
excessive amounts of liquid waste, floatable grease, oil, or sand; except, such
interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All interception
units shall be of a type and capacity approved by the Manager, and shall be
located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection, and away from
building entrances and exits. Such interceptors shall be cleaned, repaired, and
maintained by the user at its expense.

13.22.220: ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGE/SLUG DISCHARGE CONTROL PLANS:
The Pretreatment Coordinator shall evaluate whether each SIU needs an
accidental discharge/slug discharge control plan, or other actions to control
slug discharges. The Pretreatment Coordinator may require any user to develop,
submit for approval, and implement, such a plan, or take such other action that
may be necessary to control slug discharges. An accidental discharge/slug
discharge control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following:
   A.   Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch
discharges;
   B.   List and description of stored chemicals;
   C.   Procedures for immediately notifying the Manager of any accidental or
slug discharge, as required by section
13.22.525 of this chapter; and

future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any
expense, loss, damage, or other liability which might be incurred as a result
of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or
property. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any fines, penalties,
or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this chapter.
   C.   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employees of the notification procedures in the
event of a discharge described in subsection A of this section. Employers shall
ensure that all employees, who could cause such a discharge to occur, are
advised of the emergency notification procedure.
   D.   Significant industrial users are required to notify the Pretreatment
Coordinator immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential
for a slug discharge. (Ord. 2018-09)
13.22.530: REPORTS FROM UNPERMITTED USERS:
All users not required to obtain an individual wastewater discharge permit
shall provide appropriate reports as required by the Pretreatment Coordinator.
(Ord. 2018-09)
13.22.535: NOTICE OF VIOLATION/REPEAT SAMPLING AND REPORTING:
If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user shall notify
the Pretreatment Coordinator within twenty four (24) hours of becoming aware of
the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis, and submit
the results of the repeat analysis to the Pretreatment Coordinator within
thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation. Resampling by the
industrial user is not required if: a) SGRWRF performs scheduled sampling at
the facility at least once a month; b) if SGRWRF performs sampling at the
facility, between the time when the initial sampling was conducted, and the
time when the user receives the results of the initial sampling; or, c) if
SGRWRF has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user,
then SGRWRF will perform the repeat sampling and analysis, unless it notifies
the user of the violation and requires the user to perform the repeat sampling
and analysis. (Ord. 2018-09)
13.22.540: NOTIFICATION OF THE DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE:
   A.   Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify
the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and State
hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
CFR part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as
set forth in 40 CFR part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of
discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than one
hundred kilograms (100 kg) of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the
notification also shall contain the following information: 1) an identification
of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes; 2) an estimation of the
mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged
during that calendar month; and 3) an estimation of the mass of constituents in
the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12)
months. All notifications must take place no later than one hundred eighty
(180) days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph
need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However,
notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under section
13.22.520 of this article. The notification requirement in this section does
not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical
pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of sections
13.22.500,
13.22.510, and
13.22.515 of this article.
   B.   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection A of this
section, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen
kilograms (15 kg) of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous
wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than
fifteen kilograms (15 kg) of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or
of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and
261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the
user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require
additional notification.
   C.   In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA,
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user shall notify the Manager,
the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and State hazardous
waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of
the effective date of such regulations.
   D.   In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall
certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of
hazardous wastes generated.
   E.   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued
thereunder, or any applicable Federal, State, or local law. (Ord. 2018-09)
13.22.545: ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted
as part of a wastewater discharge permit application, report, permit or other
requirement by this chapter, shall be performed in accordance with the
techniques prescribed in 40 CFR part 136 and amendments thereto, unless
otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40
CFR part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the
pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the part 136 sampling
and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question,
sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods,
or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures approved by the
Pretreatment Coordinator.
   B.   All laboratory samples collected for this chapter shall be analyzed by
a laboratory that is either certified by the Utah Bureau of Laboratory
Improvements or approved by the Manager. (Ord. 2018-09)
13.22.550: SAMPLE COLLECTION:
Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data
obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period
covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions
occurring during the reporting period.
   A.   Except as indicated in subsections B and C of this section, the user
must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow- proportional composite
sampling techniques, unless time- proportional composite sampling or grab
sampling is authorized by the Pretreatment Coordinator. Where time-proportional
composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by SGRWRF, the samples must
be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate
preservation) specified in 40 CFR part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance,
multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior
to the analysis as follows: 1) for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides, the
samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; and 2) for
volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the
laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters, unaffected by the
compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies, may be
authorized by SGRWRF, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required
to show compliance with instantaneous limits.
   B.   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds, must be obtained using grab
collection techniques.
   C.   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day
compliance reports required in sections
13.22.500 and
13.22.510 of this article, a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for
pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic
compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist. For
facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the Pretreatment
Coordinator may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by section
13.22.515 of this article, the industrial user is required to collect the
number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. (Ord. 2018-09)
13.22.555: DATE OF RECEIPT OF REPORTS:
Written reports are deemed submitted on the date postmarked. For reports, which
are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United
States Postal Service, the date the report is received shall govern. (Ord.
2018-09)
13.22.560: RECORDKEEPING:
Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain, and
make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained
pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter, any additional
records obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user
independent of such requirements, and documentation associated with BMPs
established under subsection 13.22.130C of this chapter. Records shall include:
a) the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the
person(s) taking the samples; b) the dates analyses were performed; c) who
performed the analyses; d) the analytical techniques or methods used; and e)
the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period
of at least three (3) years. This period shall be automatically extended for
the duration of any litigation concerning the user or SGRWRF, or where the user
has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the Pretreatment
Coordinator. (Ord. 2018-09)
13.22.565: CERTIFICATION STATEMENTS:
Certification of permit applications, user reports and initial monitoring
waiver. The following certification statement, signed by an authorized
representative as defined in section
13.22.040 of this chapter, shall be submitted by users submitting permit
applications under section
13.22.350 of this chapter: a) users submitting baseline monitoring reports
under subsection
13.22.500B5 of this article; b) users submitting reports in compliance with the
categorical pretreatment standard deadlines under section
13.22.510 of this article; and c) users submitting periodic compliance reports
required by subsections
13.22.515A through D of this article:
I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were
prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed
to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information
submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system,
or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the
information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true,
accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for
submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and
imprisonment for knowing violations.

ARTICLE 6. COMPLIANCE MONITORING
13.22.600: RIGHT OF ENTRY; INSPECTION AND SAMPLING:
The Manager or his or her designee shall have the right to enter the premises
of any user to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of
this chapter, and any individual wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder. Users shall allow the Manager or his or her designee ready access to
all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records
examination and copying, and/or the performance of any additional duties.
Inspections and monitoring shall be conducted as frequently as determined by
the SGRWRF and may be announced or unannounced.
   A.   Where a user has security measures in force that require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with its security guards, so, upon presentation of
suitable identification, the Manager shall be permitted to enter without delay
for the purpose of performing his or her duties.
   B.   The Manager shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or
require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/
or metering of the user's operations.
   C.   The Manager may require the user to install monitoring equipment as
necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained
at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own
expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be
calibrated at least annually, or as required per the manufacturer's
recommendations and specifications to ensure their accuracy.
   D.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be removed promptly by the user
at the verbal or written request of the Manager and shall not be replaced. The
costs of clearing such obstruction and providing safe and easy access shall be
borne by the user.
   E.   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Manager or his or her designee
access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this chapter.
   F.   The location of the monitoring facility shall provide ample room in or
near the monitoring facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of
samples and analysis. Whether constructed on public or private property, the
monitoring facility should be provided in accordance with the SGRWRF's
requirements, and all applicable local construction standard and
specifications. Such facilities shall be constructed and maintained in a manner
that enables the Manager to perform independent monitoring activities.
   G.   All significant industrial users will be inspected at least annually
including review of facilities and reports.
   H.   SGRWRF may use a camera to photograph areas of the facility as
necessary for carrying out the duties of the Industrial Pretreatment Program
including, but not limited to, documentation of the user's compliance status
and for reinforcement of written reports. The user shall be allowed to review
copies of the photographs for confidentiality claims. (Ord. 2018-09)
13.22.610: SEARCH WARRANTS:
If the Manager or his or her designee has been refused access to a building,
structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or
that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection
and sampling program of SGRWRF designed to verify compliance with this chapter
or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public
health, safety and welfare of the community, the Manager may seek issuance of a
search warrant from a court of competent jurisdiction. (Ord. 2018-09)
ARTICLE 7. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
13.22.700: RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION:
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater
discharge permit applications, individual wastewater discharge permits, and
monitoring programs, and from the Manager inspection and sampling activities,
shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user
specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
Manager, that the release of specific information would divulge information,
processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets
under applicable State law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of
submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the
user furnishing a report that specific information should be held confidential,
the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes
shall be redacted and not made available for inspection by the public.
Regardless of any such assertion of confidentiality, all information,
unredacted, shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental
agencies for uses related to the UPDES Program or Pretreatment Program, and in
enforcement proceedings involving the person or entity furnishing the report.
Wastewater constituents and characteristics, and other effluent data, as
defined at 40 CFR 2.302, shall not be recognized as confidential information
and shall be available to the public without restriction. (Ord. 2018-09)
ARTICLE 8. PUBLICATION OF USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE
13.22.800: PUBLICATION OF SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE:
The Manager shall publish annually, in a newspaper of general circulation that
provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdictions served by POTW, a
list of the users which, at any time during the previous twelve (12) months,
were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements. The term significant noncompliance shall be applicable to all
significant industrial users (or any other industrial user that violates
subsection C, D or H of this section) and shall mean:
   A.   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which sixty six percent (66%) or more of all the measurements taken
for the same pollutant parameter taken during a six (6) month period exceed (by
any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including
instantaneous limits as defined in article 1 of this chapter;
   B.   Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in
which thirty three percent (33%) or more of wastewater measurements taken for
the same pollutant parameter during a six (6) month period equals or exceeds
the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including
instantaneous limits, as defined by article 1 of this chapter multiplied by the
applicable TRC criteria (TRC = 1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and TRC
= 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
   C.   Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as
defined by article 1 of this chapter (daily maximum, long-term average,
instantaneous limit, or narrative standard) that the Manager determines has
caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass
through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general
public;
   D.   Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to
the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the Manager exercise of
its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
   E.   Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in an individual wastewater discharge
permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction,
or attaining final compliance;
   F.   Failure to provide within thirty (30) days after the due date, any
required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance
with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring
reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;
   G.   Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
   H.   Any other violation(s), which may include a violation of Best
Management Practices, which the Manager determines will adversely affect the
operation or implementation of the local Pretreatment Program. (Ord. 2018-09)
ARTICLE 9. ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES
13.22.900: NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION:
When the Manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Manager may serve upon that user a written Notice of Violation, personally or
by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested). Within fifteen (15)
days of receipt of such notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for
the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, including specific required
actions, shall be submitted by the user to the Manager. Submission of such a
plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring
before or after receipt of the Notice of Violation. Nothing in this section
shall limit the authority of the Manager to take any action, including
emergency actions or any other enforcement action, before or without issuing a
Notice of Violation. (Ord. 2018-09)
13.22.910: CONSENT ORDERS:
The Manager may enter into consent orders, assurances of compliance, or other
similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for
noncompliance. Such documents shall include specific action to be taken by the
user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the
document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the
administrative orders issued pursuant to sections
13.22.930 and
13.22.940 of this article and shall be judicially enforceable. (Ord. 2018-09)
13.22.920: SHOW CAUSE HEARING:
The Manager may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear
before the Manager and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should
not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place
for the show cause hearing, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for
such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be
served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested)
at least fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on
any authorized representative of the user as defined in section
13.22.040 of this chapter. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 2018-09)
13.22.930: COMPLIANCE ORDERS:
When the Manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Manager may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing
that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does
not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be
discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related
appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may
contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional
self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of
pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the
deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement,
nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation,
including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be
a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 2018-09)
13.22.940: CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS:
When the Manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that
the user's past violations are likely to recur, the Manager may issue an order
to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing
the user to:
   A.   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
   B.   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to
properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and desist
order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user. (Ord. 2018-09)
13.22.950: ADMINISTRATIVE FINES:
   A.   When the Manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge
permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the Manager may fine such user an amount not to exceed five
thousand dollars ($5,000.00). Such fines shall be assessed on a per-violation,
per-day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge
limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation.
   B.   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after sixty (60) calendar
days, be assessed an additional penalty of ten percent (10%) of the unpaid
balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of one point five
percent (1.5%) per month. A lien against the user's real and/or personal
property shall be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties.
   C.   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for
the Manager to reconsider the fine, along with full payment of the fine amount,
within thirty (30) days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has
merit, the Manager may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's
appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereon,
shall be returned to the user. The Manager may add the costs of preparing
administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
   D.   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 2018-09)
13.22.960: EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS:
The Manager may immediately suspend a user's discharge whenever such suspension
is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears
to present, or cause, an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or
welfare of persons. The Manager may also immediately suspend a user's
discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere
with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an
endangerment to the environment. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted
as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension of a permit and/or
discharge to the POTW.
   A.   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately
stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Manager may take
such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer
connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or
endangerment to persons or the environment. The Manager may allow the user to
recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated, to the satisfaction of
the Manager, that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination
proceedings in section
13.22.970 of this article are initiated against the user.
   B.   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution, and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence. The written statement shall be submitted to the
Manager prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under
section
13.22.920 or
13.22.970 of this article. (Ord. 2018-09)
13.22.970: TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE:
   A.   Violations Subject To Discharge Termination: In addition to the
provisions in section
13.22.450 of this chapter, any user who violates the following conditions is
subject to discharge termination:
      1.   Violation of individual wastewater discharge permit conditions;
      2.   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
      3.   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
      4.   Refusal of access to the user's premises for the purpose of
inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
      5.   Violation of the pretreatment standards in article 1 of this
chapter.
   B.   Notice Of Discharge Termination: User will be notified of the proposed
termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under
section
13.22.920 of this article why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise
of this option by the Manager shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 2018-09)
ARTICLE 10. JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES
13.22.1000: INJUNCTIVE RELIEF:
When the Manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Manager may petition the Washington County Fifth District Court through the
City Attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as
appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the
individual wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement, imposed by
this chapter on activities of the user. The Manager may also seek such other
and further relief in law or equity, including a requirement for the user to
conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not
be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the
user. (Ord. 2018-09)
13.22.1010: CIVIL PENALTIES:
   A.   A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this
chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder,
or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, shall be liable to the City
for a maximum civil penalty of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) per violation,
per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit,
penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.
   B.   The SGRWRF may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs,
interest, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including
sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any other actual damages
incurred by the City.
   C.   In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into
account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent
of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation,
any economic benefit gained by the user from the user's violation, corrective
actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor
as justice requires.
   D.   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 2018-09)
13.22.1020: CRIMINAL PROSECUTION:
The SGRWRF will refer to the State of Utah criminal violations of any
pretreatment standards or permit conditions. The Attorney General's Office for
Utah will offer the City of St. George, wherein the violation occurred, the
option to prosecute the violator. Should the local entity decline, the State or
EPA, at their discretion, may initiate appropriate criminal action. The SGRWRF
will assist the Attorney General's Office or EPA any way it can with
appropriate support for the action. The penalties set forth herein are in
addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage
available under State or Federal law.
   A.   A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this

ARTICLE 12. AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS
13.22.1200: UPSET:
   A.   For the purposes of this section, upset means an exceptional incident
in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical
pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the
user. Upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational
error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment
facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation.
   B.   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards, if the requirements
of subsection C of this section, are met.
   C.   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
      1.   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      2.   The facility at the time was being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner, and in compliance with applicable operation and
maintenance procedures; and
      3.   The user has submitted the following information to the Manager
within twenty four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset, and, if this
information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within
five (5) days:
         a.   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         b.   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times, or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
         c.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   D.   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   E.   Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
   F.   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility, and until the facility
is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other situations, the primary source of
power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. (Ord. 2018-09)
13.22.1210: BYPASS:
   A.   Definitions: For the purposes of this section:
   BYPASS: Means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of
a user's treatment facility.
   SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE: Means substantial physical damage to property,
damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or
substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be
expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not
mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
   B.   Allowable Bypass: A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not
cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it
also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses
are not subject to the provision of subsections C and D of this section.
   C.   Bypass Notifications:
      1.   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit
prior notice to the Manager, at least ten (10) days before the date of the
bypass.
      2.   A user shall submit oral notice to the Manager of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty four (24)
hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall
also be provided within five (5) days of the time the user becomes aware of the
bypass. The written submission shall contain: a) a description of the bypass;
b) its cause; c) the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times;
d) if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to
continue; and e) steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass. The Manager, in his or her sole discretion, may
waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been
received within twenty four (24) hours, and the facts merit the waiver.
   D.   Bypass:
      1.   Bypass is prohibited, and the Manager may take an enforcement action
against a user, unless:
         a.   Bypass was unavoidable in order to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage;
         b.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         c.   The user submitted notices as required under subsection C of this
section.
      2.   The Manager may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its
adverse effects, if the Manager determines that it will meet the conditions
listed in subsection D1 of this section.
      3.   Bypass shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards, if the requirements
of this subsection D are met. (Ord. 2018-09)

at its sole expense, in a continuous and efficient manner, and at all times
subject to SGRWRF inspection and approval.
   B.   Interceptors shall be maintained in efficient operating condition by
the periodic removal of the full contents of the interceptor. Interceptors
shall be fully emptied and cleaned at a frequency such that the combined
floating and settled FOGS accumulation does not exceed twenty five percent
(25%) of the design hydraulic depth of the interceptor. This is to ensure that
the minimum hydraulic retention time, and required available volume, is
maintained to effectively intercept and retain FOGS.
   C.   If an interceptor at any time is observed by the Pretreatment
Coordinator or his or her designee to contain floating and settled FOGS
accumulation in excess of twenty five percent (25%), the user shall be required
to have the interceptor serviced as soon as possible, but no later than ten
(10) days from the date the notice of violation was given, such that all FOGS,

   A.   Projects Greater Than Or Equal To One (1) Acre: Newly developed and
redeveloped projects that disturb greater than or equal to one (1) acre,
including projects less than one (1) acre that are of a larger common plan of
development or sale, are required to submit a low impact development (LID)
approach to be evaluated by the City of Santa Clara. A LID approach promotes
the implementation of BMPs that allow storm water to infiltrate, evapotranspire
or harvest and use storm water on site to reduce runoff from the site and
protect water quality. Guidance for implementing LID can be found in State of
Utah DWQ’s LID controls which are appropriate for use in the State of Utah and
can be found in A Guide to Low Impact Development within Utah (the Guide),
available on DWQ’s website or Green Infrastructure and Low Impact Development
Application Guidance for Washington County Utah, available from the City of
Santa Clara.
   B.   Specific Criteria: Newly developed and redeveloped projects must meet
the required best management practices (BMPs) that are designed to manage
rainfall on-site, and prevent the off-site discharge of the precipitation from
all rainfall events less than or equal to the 80th percentile rainfall event or
a predevelopment hydrologic condition, whichever is less. This objective must
be accomplished by the use of practices that are designed, constructed, and
maintained to infiltrate, evapotranspire and/or harvest and reuse rainwater and
must be incorporated into the permittee’s development plans and long term
stormwater management plan which includes the LID approach. If meeting the 80th
percentile standard is infeasible an alternative design approach may be used
provided that the permittee documents that infiltration, evapotranspiration,
and rainwater harvesting have been used to the maximum extent feasible and that
full employment of these controls are infeasible due to constraints. For
guidance including alternative design approaches see “A Guide to Low Impact
Development within Utah” published by the DWQ, and “Green Infrastructure and
Low Impact Development Application Guidance for Washington County Utah.”
   C.   Inspections Of Storm Water Management Facilities: Owners/operators
shall perform necessary maintenance to protect water quality and reduce the
discharge of pollutants to the MS4. Owners/operators of newly developed and
redeveloped projects shall conduct inspections at least every other year and
provide certification that adequate maintenance has been performed and the
structural controls are operating as designed to protect water quality. This
required inspection shall be conducted by the property owner/operators or
qualified third parties. On sites where the property owner/operator is
conducting maintenance, the permittee shall allow municipal inspections to
conduct inspections at least once every five (5) years, or more frequently as
needed to show that adequate maintenance is being performed. The owner shall
grant access to the City of Santa Clara to inspect storm water control measures
on private properties that discharge to the MS4 to ensure that adequate
maintenance is being performed. The findings of each inspection shall be
documented in an inspection report, and must contain the following:
      1.   Inspection date;
      2.   Name and signature of inspector;
      3.   Project location;
      4.   Current ownership information;
      5.   A description of the condition of the storm water control measure
including the quality of: vegetation and soils; inlet and outlet channels and
structures; catch basins; spillways; weirs, and other control structures; and
sediment and debris accumulation in storage as well as in and around inlet and
outlet structures; and
      6.   Specific maintenance issues or violations found that need to be
corrected by the property owner or operator along with deadlines and re-
inspection dates. If there is an observed failure of a facility to perform as
designed, the failure must be corrected and documented in the inspection
report.
   D.   Record Drawings: All applicants are required to submit actual record
drawings for any structures located on site after final construction is
completed. The plan must show the final design specifications for all
stormwater management facilities and must be sealed by a registered
professional engineer licensed to practice in Utah. A final inspection by the
public services director is required before any performance security or
performance bond will be released. The public services director shall have the
discretion to adopt provisions for a partial pro rata release of the
performance security or performance bond on the completion of various stages of
development. In addition, occupation permits shall not be granted until
corrections to all BMPs have been made and accepted by the public services
director.
   E.   Landscaping And Stabilization Requirements: Any area of land from which
the natural vegetative cover has been either partially or wholly cleared by
development activities shall be revegetated according to a schedule approved by
the public services director. The following criteria shall apply to
revegetation or stabilization efforts:
      1.   Reseeding must be done with an annual or perennial cover crop
accompanied by placement of straw mulch or its equivalent of sufficient
coverage to control erosion until such time as the cover crop is established
over ninety percent (90%) of the seeded area or stabilization put in place.
      2.   Replanting with native woody and herbaceous vegetation must be
accompanied by placement of straw mulch or its equivalent of sufficient
coverage to control erosion until the plantings are established and are capable
of controlling erosion or stabilization put in place.
      3.   Any area of revegetation must exhibit survival of a minimum of
seventy five percent (75%) of the cover crop throughout the year immediately
following revegetation. Revegetation must be repeated in successive years until
the minimum seventy five percent (75%) survival for one year is achieved.
      4.   In addition to the above requirements, a landscaping plan must be
submitted with the final design describing the vegetative or other
stabilization and management techniques to be used at a site after construction
is completed. This plan will explain not only how the site will be stabilized
after construction, but who will be responsible for the maintenance of
vegetation or other stabilization at the site and what practices will be
employed to ensure that adequate cover is preserved.
   F.   Records Of Installation And Maintenance Activities: Parties responsible
for the operation and maintenance of a stormwater management facility shall
make records of the installation of the stormwater facility, and of all
maintenance and repairs to the facility, and shall retain the records for at
least three (3) years. These records shall be made available to the public
services director during inspection of the facility and at other reasonable
times upon request.
   G.   Failure To Meet Or Maintain Design Or Maintenance Standards: If a
responsible party fails or refuses to meet the design or maintenance standards
required for stormwater facilities under this chapter, the public services
director, after reasonable notice, may correct a violation of the design
standards or maintenance needs by performing all necessary work to place the
facility in proper working condition. In the event that the stormwater
management facility becomes a danger to public safety or public health, the
public services director shall notify in writing the party responsible for
maintenance of the stormwater management facility. Upon receipt of that notice,
the responsible person shall have fifteen (15) days to effect maintenance and
repair of the facility in an approved manner. In the event that corrective
action is not undertaken within that time, the public services director may
take necessary corrective action. The cost of any action by the public services
director under this section shall be charged to the responsible party. (Ord.
2020-11 § 1: Ord. 2009-06 § 1)
13.24.060: WAIVERS:
   A.   General: Every applicant shall provide for postconstruction stormwater

      3.   Provisions are made to manage stormwater by an off-site facility.
The off-site facility must be in place and designed to provide the level of
stormwater control that is equal to or greater than that which would be
afforded by on-site practices. Further, the facility must be operated and
maintained by an entity that is legally obligated to continue the operation and
maintenance of the facility.
   C.   Downstream Damage: In order to receive a waiver, the applicant must
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the public services director that the waiver
will not lead to any of the following conditions downstream:
      1.   Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams, and other
structures;
      2.   Degradation of biological functions or habitat;
      3.   Accelerated stream bank or streambed erosion or siltation;
      4.   Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life or property.
   D.   Land Disturbance Permit: No land disturbance permit shall be issued
where a waiver has been requested until the waiver is granted. (Ord. 2020-11 §
1: Ord. 2009-06 § 1)
13.24.070: ILLICIT DISCHARGES:
   A.   Scope: This section shall apply to all water generated on developed or
undeveloped land entering the municipality's separate storm sewer system.
   B.   Prohibition Of Illicit Discharges: No person shall introduce or cause

      2.   This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection.
   D.   Reduction Of Stormwater Pollutants By The Use Of Best Management
Practices: Any person responsible for a property or premises, which is, or may
be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at the
person's expense, the BMPs necessary to prevent the further discharge of
pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all
terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of
stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable,
shall be deemed in compliance with the provisions of this section.
   E.   Notification Of Spills: Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as
soon as any person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for
emergency response for a facility or operation has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are resulting in, or may result in,
illicit discharges or pollutants discharging into the city stormwater system,
the person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment,
and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous
materials the person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of
the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of
nonhazardous materials, the person shall notify the public services director in
person or by telephone or facsimile no later than the next business day.
Notifications in person or by telephone shall be confirmed by written notice
addressed and mailed to the public services director within three (3) business
days of the telephone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates
from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such
establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and
the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for
at least three (3) years. (Ord. 2020-11 § 1: Ord. 2009-06 § 1)
13.24.080: ENFORCEMENT:
   A.   Enforcement Authority: The public services director or his designees
shall have the authority to issue notices of violation, stop work orders, and
citations, and to impose the civil penalties provided in this section.
      1.   With the issuance of a land disturbance permit, the public services
director shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to this
chapter at all reasonable times and as often as necessary to determine
compliance. Failure to comply with the terms of this chapter may result in
punitive actions by Santa Clara City ordinance enforcement or by other means
identified in permits or terms set forth in development applications.
   B.   Notification Of Violation:
      1.   Written Notice: Whenever the public services director finds that any
permittee or any other person discharging stormwater has violated or is
violating this chapter or a permit or order issued hereunder, the director may
serve upon such person written notice of the violation. Within ten (10) days of
this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory
correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall
be submitted to the public services director. Submission of this plan in no way
relieves the discharger of liability for any violations occurring before or
after receipt of the notice of violation.
      2.   Consent Orders: The public services director is empowered to enter
into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar
documents establishing an agreement with the person responsible for the
noncompliance. Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the
person to correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the
order. Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as administrative
orders issued pursuant to subsections B4 and B5 of this section.
      3.   Show Cause Hearing: The director may order any person who violates
this chapter or permit or order issued hereunder, to show cause why a proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the person
specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action
and the reasons for such action, and a request that the violator show cause why
this proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting
shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested) at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing.
      4.   Compliance Order: When the director finds that any person has
violated or continues to violate this chapter or a permit or order issued
hereunder, he may issue an order to the violator directing that, following a
specific time period, adequate structures, devices, be installed or procedures
implemented and properly operated. Orders may also contain such other
requirements as might be reasonably necessary and appropriate to address the
noncompliance, including the construction of appropriate structures,
installation of devices, self-monitoring, and management practices.
      5.   Cease And Desist Orders: When the director finds that any person has
violated or continues to violate this chapter or any permit or order issued
hereunder, the director may issue an order to cease and desist all such
violations and direct those persons in noncompliance to:
         a.   Comply forthwith; or
         b.   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and terminating the discharge.
   C.   Conflicting Standards: Whenever there is a conflict between any
standard contained in this chapter and in the Santa Clara City stormwater
management program adopted by the municipality under this chapter, the
strictest standard shall prevail. (Ord. 2020-11 § 1: Ord. 2009-06 § 1)

   A.   Violations: Any person who shall commit any act declared unlawful under
this chapter, who violates any provision of this chapter, who violates the
provisions of any permit issued pursuant to this chapter, or who fails or
refuses to comply with any lawful communication or notice to abate or take
corrective action by the public services director, shall be guilty of a class B
misdemeanor.
   B.   Penalties: Any person who violates this chapter or any lawful notice or
order issued pursuant to this chapter shall be assessed a penalty of not less
than fifty dollars ($50.00) and not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00)
in a civil proceeding, and in a criminal proceeding is guilty of a class B
misdemeanor punishable by a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars
($1,000.00). In the case of a continuing violation, each day that the violation
continues shall constitute a separate and distinct offense.
   C.   Measuring Civil Penalties: In assessing a civil penalty, the public
services director may consider:
      1.   The harm done to the public health or the environment;
      2.   Whether the civil penalty imposed will be a substantial economic
deterrent to the illegal activity;
      3.   The economic benefit gained by the violator;
      4.   The amount of effort put forth by the violator to remedy this
violation;
      5.   Any unusual or extraordinary enforcement costs incurred by the
municipality;
      6.   The amount of penalty established by ordinance or resolution for
specific categories of violations; and
      7.   Any equities of the situation which outweigh the benefit of imposing
any penalty or damage assessment.
   D.   Recovery Of Damages And Costs: In addition to the civil penalty in
subsection B of this section, the municipality may recover:
      1.   All damages caused by the violator to the municipality, which may
include any reasonable expenses incurred in investigating violations of, and
enforcing compliance with, this chapter, or any other actual damages caused by
the violation.
      2.   The costs of the municipality's maintenance of stormwater facilities
when the user of such facilities fails to maintain them as required by this
chapter.
   E.   Other Remedies: The municipality may bring legal action to enjoin the
continuing violation of this chapter, and the existence of any other remedy, at
law or equity, shall be no defense to any such actions.
   F.   Remedies Cumulative: The remedies set forth in this section shall be
cumulative, not exclusive, and it shall not be a defense to any action, civil
or criminal, that one or more of the remedies set forth herein has been sought
or granted. (Ord. 2020-11 § 1: Ord. 2009-06 § 1)
13.24.100: APPEALS:
Pursuant to Utah code, any person aggrieved by the imposition of a civil
penalty or damage assessment as provided by this chapter may appeal said
penalty or damage assessment to the municipality's governing body.
   A.   Appeals To Be In Writing: The appeal shall be in writing and filed with
the municipal recorder or clerk within fifteen (15) days after the civil
penalty and/or damage assessment is served in any manner authorized by law.
   B.   Hearing: Upon receipt of an appeal, the municipality's governing body
shall hold a hearing within thirty (30) days. Ten (10) days' notice by
registered mail shall be provided to the aggrieved party, such notice to be
sent to the address provided by the aggrieved party at the time of appeal. The
decision of the governing body of the municipality shall be final.
   C.   Appealing Decisions Of The Municipality's Governing Body: Any alleged
violator may appeal a decision of the municipality's governing body pursuant to
the provisions of the Utah code. (Ord. 2020-11 § 1: Ord. 2009-06 § 1)
13.24.110: FEES:
Each developed parcel of real property in Santa Clara City shall be charged a
stormwater utility fee.
   A.   ESU: The fee shall be based on the number of equivalent service units
(ESUs) contained in the parcel. The city council finds that the ESU is the most
accurate measurement for determining the amount that each parcel contributes
to, benefits from and otherwise uses the storm sewer utility.
   B.   Calculation: Santa Clara City council finds that each single-family
residential parcel contributes approximately the same amount of stormwater
runoff; therefore each developed single-family residential parcel shall pay a
base rate of one ESU. All developed nonsingle-family residential parcels shall
pay a multiple of this base rate, expressed in ESUs, according to the measured
impervious area on the parcel.
   C.   Charge Per ESU: The amount charged for each ESU shall be established by
resolution of the Santa Clara City council.
   D.   Exemptions And Credits: Santa Clara City council may establish
exemptions and credits to the stormwater utility fee by resolution.
   E.   Policies: The public services department may adopt policies, consistent
with this chapter and any resolution passed by the Santa Clara City council, to
assist in the application, administration and interpretation of this chapter
and any resolutions related to the stormwater utility.
   F.   Appeals: Any person or entity that believes that any decision made
under the stormwater utility rate resolution was interpreted or applied
incorrectly may appeal to the public services director ("director") or the
director's designee. The appeal shall be in writing, shall state any facts
supporting the appeal and shall be made within ten (10) days of the decision,
action, or bill being appealed. The public services director shall decide the
appeal within ten (10) days of when the appeal was filed. If the person or
entity is not satisfied with the public services director's decision, a further
appeal may be made to the city council. The appeal to the city council shall
follow the same procedure as the appeal to the public services director. The
city council's decision shall be final and binding on all parties. (Ord. 2020-
11 § 1: Ord. 2009-06 § 1)

ARTICLE I. STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS
OF FACT, PURPOSE AND METHODS
15.36.010: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION:
The legislature of the state of Utah has in section 10-8-84 delegated the
responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to
minimize flood losses and promote the public health, safety, and general
welfare of its citizenry. (Ord. 2009-04 § 1)
15.36.020: FINDINGS OF FACT:
   A.   The flood hazard areas of Santa Clara City are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   B.   These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by
the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous
to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or
otherwise protected from flood damage. (Ord. 2009-04 § 1)
15.36.030: STATEMENT OF PURPOSE:
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   A.   Protect human life and health;
   B.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
   C.   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   D.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   E.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
floodplains;
   F.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas;
   G.   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood
area; and
   H.   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions. (Ord. 2009-04 § 1)
15.36.040: METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES:
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following methods:
   A.   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood, or which result in damaging increases in erosion
hazard, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities;
   B.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   C.   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
   D.   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage;
   E.   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas. (Ord. 2009-04 § 1)
ARTICLE II. DEFINITIONS
15.36.050: DEFINITIONS OF WORDS AND PHRASES:
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall
be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give
this chapter its most reasonable application:
   ALLUVIAL FAN FLOODING: Flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan
or similar landform which originates at the apex and is characterized by high
velocity flows; active processes of erosion, sediment transport, and
deposition; and unpredictable flow paths.
   APEX: A point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow
path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial
fan flooding can occur.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING: A designated AO, AH, or VO zone on a community's
flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with a one percent (1%) or greater annual
chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet (3') where a
clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is
characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD: The land in the floodplain within a community
subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
The area may be designated as zone A on the flood hazard boundary map (FHBM).
After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of
the FIRM, zone A usually is refined into zone A, AE, AH, AO, A1-99, VO, V1-30,
VE or V.
   BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
   BASEMENT: Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
   CRITICAL FEATURE: An integral and readily identifiable part of a flood
protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire
system would be compromised.
   DEVELOPMENT: Any manmade change in improved and unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
   ELEVATED BUILDING: A nonbasement building: a) built, in the case of a
building in zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, and D, to have the top of
the elevated floor, or in the case of a building in zone V1-30, VE, or V, to
have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structure member of the elevated floor
elevated above the ground level by means of pilings, columns (posts and piers),
or shear walls parallel to the floor of the water and b) adequately anchored so
as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood of up
to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case of zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO,
AH, B, C, X, and D, "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by
means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to
facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters. In the case of zone V1-30,
VE, or V, "elevated building" also includes a building otherwise meeting the
definition of "elevated building", even though the lower area is enclosed by
means of breakaway walls if the breakaway walls met the standards of section
60.3(e)(5) of the national flood insurance program regulations.
   EROSION HAZARD ZONE: Land adjoining a body of water or adjacent to or
partially or wholly within a delineated area of special flood hazard which due
to soil instability, is likely to suffer flood related erosion damage. The area
may be designated on the erosion hazard zone maps.
   EXISTING CONSTRUCTION: Means, for the purposes of determining rates,
structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective
date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that
date. "Existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures".
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM): An official map of a community, on which
the federal emergency management agency has delineated both the areas of
special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY: An official report provided by the federal emergency
management agency. The report contains flood profiles, water surface elevation
of the base flood, as well as the flood boundary and floodway maps.
   FLOOD OR FLOODING: A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
   A.   The overflow of inland or tidal waters.
   B.   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any
source.
   FLOOD PROTECTION SYSTEM: Those physical structural works for which funds
have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been
constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of
the areas within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent
of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes
hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized
flood modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound
engineering standards.

preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including, but not limited to,
emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management
regulations.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS: Zoning ordinances, subdivision
regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances
(such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control
ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term describes such
state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards
for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction.
   FLOODPLAIN OR FLOOD PRONE AREA: Any land area susceptible to being inundated
by water from any source (see definition of Flood Or Flooding).
   FLOODPROOFING: Any combination of structural and nonstructural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities,
structures and their contents.
   FLOODWAY (REGULATORY FLOODWAY): The channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the
base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more
than a designated height.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE: A use which cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term
includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the
loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and shipbuilding and ship repair
facilities, but does not include long term storage or related manufacturing
facilities.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE: The highest natural elevation of the ground surface
prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE: Any structure that is:

or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
   LEVEE SYSTEM: A flood protection system which consists of a levee, or
levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which
are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
   LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable nonelevation design requirement of section 60.3 of the national
flood insurance program regulations.
   MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of
land divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   MEAN SEA LEVEL: Means, for purposes of the national flood insurance program,
the national geodetic vertical datum (NGVD) of 1929, or other datum, to which
base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are
referenced.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION: Means, for the purpose of determining insurance rates,
structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the
effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is
later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For
floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which
the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a
floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE: A vehicle which is:
   A.   Built on a single chassis;
   B.   Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projections;
   C.   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty
truck; and
   D.   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary
living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION: For other than new construction or substantial
improvements under the coastal barrier resources act (Pub. L. 97-348), includes
substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one
hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The "actual start" means either
the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as
the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of
columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land
preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the
installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for
basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms;
nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings,
such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main
structure. For a substantial improvement, the "actual start of construction"
means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural
part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the building.
   STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage
tank that is principally aboveground, as well as a manufactured home.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty
percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before "start of
construction" of the improvement. This includes structures which have incurred
"substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not, however, include either:
   A.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary conditions; or
   B.   Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic
structure".
   VARIANCE: A grant of relief to a person from the requirement of this chapter
when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance,
therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited
by this chapter. (For full requirements, see section 60.6 of the national flood
insurance program regulations.)
   VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications,
or other evidence of compliance required in section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)
(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) of the national flood insurance program
regulations is presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.
   WATER SURFACE ELEVATION: The height, in relation to the national geodetic
vertical datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of
various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine
areas. (Ord. 2009-04 § 1)
ARTICLE III. GENERAL PROVISIONS
15.36.060: LANDS TO WHICH THIS CHAPTER APPLIES:
This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the
jurisdiction of the city of Santa Clara. (Ord. 2009-04 § 1)
15.36.070: BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD:
The areas of special flood hazard are identified by the federal emergency
management agency in a scientific and engineering report entitled, "Flood
Insurance Study For Washington County, Utah And Incorporated Areas", dated
April 2, 2009. Copies are available for review at the office of the city
floodplain administrator. (Ord. 2009-04 § 1)
15.36.080: COMPLIANCE:
No structure or land shall hereafter be located, altered, or have its use
changed without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other
applicable regulations. (Ord. 2009-04 § 1)
15.36.090: ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS:
This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing
easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and
other ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restrictions conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 2009-04
§ 1)
15.36.100: INTERPRETATION:
In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be:

statutes. (Ord. 2009-04 § 1)
15.36.110: WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. On rare occasions greater floods can and will occur and flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the community or any official or
employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this
chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. (Ord. 2009-04 §
1)
ARTICLE IV. ADMINISTRATION
15.36.120: ESTABLISHMENT OF DEVELOPMENT PERMIT:
A development permit shall be required to ensure conformance with the
provisions of this chapter. Application for a development permit shall be
presented to the floodplain administrator on forms furnished by him/her and may
include, but not be limited to, plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the
location, dimensions, and elevation of proposed landscape alterations, existing
and proposed structures, including the placement of manufactured homes, and the
location of the foregoing in relation to areas of special flood hazard.
Additionally, the following information is required:
   A.   Elevation (in relation to mean sea level), of the lowest floor
(including basement) of all new and substantially improved structures;
   B.   Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any nonresidential

will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development;
   E.   Maintain a record of all such information in accordance with subsection
15.36.140A of this chapter;
   F.   Approval or denial of a development permit by the floodplain
administrator shall be based on all of the provisions of this chapter and the
following relevant factors:
      1.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      2.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      3.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      4.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      5.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;

conditions including maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and public
utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems;
      7.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site;
      8.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      9.   The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding
or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
      10.   The relationship of the proposed use to the Santa Clara City
general plan designated use for that area. (Ord. 2009-04 § 1)
15.36.125: VARIANCE PROCEDURES:
   A.   The appeal board as established by the community shall hear and render
judgment on requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter.
   B.   The appeal board shall hear and render judgment on an appeal only when
it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination
made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of
this chapter.
   C.   Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the appeal board may
appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction.
   D.   The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all actions
involving an appeal and shall report variances to the federal emergency
management agency upon request.
   E.   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or
the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of this chapter.
   F.   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size
contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below
the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in section
15.36.120 of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond the one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
   G.   Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this
chapter, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this
chapter (see section
15.36.030 of this chapter).
   H.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   I.   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
   J.   Prerequisites for granting variances:
      1.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard to afford
relief.
      2.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         a.   Showing a good and sufficient cause;
         b.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         c.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      3.   Any application to which a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
   K.   Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of
a functionally dependent use provided that:
      1.   The criteria outlined in subsections A through I of this section are
met, and
      2.   The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats
to public safety. (Ord. 2009-04 § 1)
15.36.130: DESIGNATION OF THE FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR:
The building official is hereby appointed the floodplain administrator to
administer and implement the provisions of this chapter and other appropriate
sections of 44 CFR (national flood insurance program regulations) pertaining to
floodplain management. (Ord. 2009-04 § 1)
15.36.140: DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR:
Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall include, but
not be limited to, the following:
   A.   Maintain and hold open for public inspection all records pertaining to
the provisions of this chapter.
   B.   Review permit application to determine whether proposed building site,
including the placement of manufactured homes, will be reasonably safe from
flooding.
   C.   Review, approve or deny all applications for development permits
required by adoption of this chapter.
   D.   Review permits for proposed development to assure that all necessary
permits have been obtained from those federal, state or local governmental
agencies (including section 404 of the federal water pollution control act
amendments of 1972, 33 USC 1334) from which prior approval is required.
   E.   Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the
boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions)
the floodplain administrator shall make the necessary interpretation.
   F.   Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the state of
Utah, department of natural resources, division of water rights, prior to any
alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such
notification to the federal emergency management agency.
   G.   Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated
portion of any watercourse is maintained.
   H.   When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with
section
15.36.070 of this chapter, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review
and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation data and floodway data
available from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer the
provisions of article V of this chapter.
   I.   When a regulatory floodway has not been designated, the floodplain
administrator must require that no new construction, substantial improvements,
or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within zones A1-30 and
AE on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative
effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and
anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the
base flood more than one foot (1') at any point within the community.
   J.   Under the provisions of 44 CFR chapter 1, section 65.12 of the national
flood insurance program regulations, a community may approve certain
development in zones A1-30, AE, AH, on the community's FIRM which increases the
water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one foot (1'), provided
that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM revision through FEMA
(conditional letter of map revision). (Ord. 2009-04 § 1)
ARTICLE V. PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
15.36.150: GENERAL STANDARDS:
In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required for
all new construction and substantial improvements:
   A.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy;
   B.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed
by methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
   C.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed
with materials resistant to flood damage;
   D.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed
with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment
and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent
water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of
flooding;
   E.   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system and discharge
from the systems into floodwaters; and
   F.   On site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to
them or contamination from them during flooding. (Ord. 2009-04 § 1)
15.36.160: SPECIFIC STANDARDS:
In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data has been
provided as set forth in section
15.36.070 of this chapter, the following provisions are required:
   A.   Residential Construction: New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement),
elevated a minimum of two feet (2') above the base flood elevation. A
registered professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a
certification to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this
subsection, as proposed in subsection
15.36.120C of this chapter, is satisfied.
   B.   Nonresidential Construction: New construction and substantial
improvements for any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure
shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated a minimum of
one foot (1') above the base flood elevation or together with attendant utility
and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the
structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water and with structural components having the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered
professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural
design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that
the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted
standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of such
certification which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) to which such structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the
floodplain administrator.
   C.   Enclosures: New construction and substantial improvements, with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of
vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which
are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic
flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of
floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a
registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
      1.   A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
      2.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot (1')
above grade.
      3.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
   D.   Manufactured Homes:
      1.   Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within zone A on a
community's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which
minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes
must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over
the top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to
applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
      2.   Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially
improved within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites: a)
outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, b) in a new manufactured
home park or subdivision, c) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home
park or subdivision, or d) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision
on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a
flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the
manufactured home is elevated two feet (2') above the base flood elevation and
be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
      3.   Require that manufactured homes placed or substantially improved on
sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within zones A1-30,
AH and AE on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of
this subsection D be elevated so that either:
         a.   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is two feet (2') above
the base flood elevation, or
         b.   The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or
other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than
thirty six inches (36") in height above grade and be securely anchored to an
adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and
lateral movement.
   E.   Recreational Vehicles: Require that recreational vehicles placed on
sites within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM either:
      1.   Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive
days,
      2.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or
      3.   Meet the permit requirements of section
15.36.120 of this chapter, and the elevation and anchoring requirements for
"manufactured homes" in subsection D of this section. A recreational vehicle is
ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to
the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has
no permanently attached additions. (Ord. 2009-04 § 1)
15.36.170: STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS:
   A.   All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions shall be consistent with sections
15.36.020,
15.36.030 and
15.36.040 of this chapter.
   B.   All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the
placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet development
permit requirements of sections
15.36.080 and
15.36.120 of this chapter and this article.
   C.   Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals
and other proposed development including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions which are greater than fifty (50) lots or five (5)
acres, whichever is less, if not otherwise provided pursuant to section
15.36.070 or article IV of this chapter.
   D.   All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure
to flood hazards.
   E.   All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as
sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or
eliminate flood damage. (Ord. 2009-04 § 1)
15.36.180: STANDARDS FOR AREAS OF SHALLOW FLOODING (AO/AH ZONES):
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section
 15.36.070 of this chapter, are areas designated as shallow flooding. These
areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to
three feet (3') where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the
path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following
provisions apply:
   A.   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the
highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet
on the community's FIRM (at least 2 feet if no depth number is specified).
   B.   All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential
structures:
      1.   Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the
highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet
on the community's FIRM (at least 2 feet if no depth number is specified), or
      2.   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed
so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads or effects of buoyancy.
   C.   A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a
certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this
section, as proposed in subsection 15.36.120C of this chapter, are satisfied.
   D.   Require within zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures
on slopes, to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. (Ord.
2009-04 § 1)
15.36.190: FLOODWAYS:
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section
15.36.070 of this chapter, are areas designated as floodways. Since the
floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters
which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following
provisions shall apply:
   A.   Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory
floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within
the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
   B.   If subsection A of this section is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of this article.
   C.   Under the provisions of 44 CFR chapter 1, section 65.12 of the national
flood insurance regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the
adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood
elevations, provided that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM
and floodway revision through FEMA. (Ord. 2009-04 § 1)
15.36.200: ESTABLISHMENT OF EROSION HAZARD ZONES:
   A.   Delineation: Erosion hazard zones (EHZ) are delineated on the Santa
Clara City erosion hazard boundary maps on file at the city office.
   B.   Revision Of Erosion Hazard Zones:   EHZ cannot be revised unless a
study, sealed by a registered engineer with experience in river mechanics,
sediment transport, riverine erosion, hydraulics, and hydrology, is performed
that includes the tasks outlined in the "Santa Clara City Construction Design
Standards", section 3.4.9.
   C.   Regulations For Development Within Erosion Hazard Zones: Development
within the adopted EHZ may occur only if protected by adequately designed
erosion protection. Engineering analyses required to support engineering design
of erosion protection are outlined in the Santa Clara construction design
standards, section 3.4.9.
      1.   All new development proposals, including subdivisions, located
within an erosion hazard area shall be consistent with the need to minimize
flood damage. Proposals within these areas shall comply with the following
requirements:
         a.   Meet all applicable provisions of this chapter;
         b.   Meet all applicable provisions of the international building code
with regard to wall and footing setbacks for slopes, grading, drainage and
compaction of fills;
         c.   Provide an engineering study, prepared by a professional civil
engineer licensed to practice in the state, which includes a hydraulic
analysis, a historical and geological evaluation of potential erosion hazards,
and an analysis of long term channel degradation, movement and bank erosion.
The study shall also include recommendations for erosion protection measures,
if any. The study shall include the engineer's professional opinion that when
the erosion protection measures, if any, are implemented, the proposed
development will not be adversely affected by erosion and that the erosion
protection measures, if any, will not adversely affect reaches or development
upstream, downstream, and across river over a one hundred (100) year planning
period;
         d.   Provide for the perpetual maintenance of the erosion protection,
if any, at no cost to the city or other public agency;
         e.   Provide a maintenance and access easement to any erosion
protection. Access to erosion protection, if any, shall be located and
constructed so as to minimize flood damage;
         f.   Obtain necessary section (404) permit from the United States army
corps of engineers, and stream alteration permits from the office of the Utah
state engineer prior to any construction activity at no cost to the city;
         g.   Hold the city harmless from all claims resulting from erosion or
any other flood related damage to development within an erosion hazard zone by
executing a "flood and erosion hazard disclaimer of liability and agreement"
and by placing a "notice of hazard" on the final plat if applicable.
      2.   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed so as
to minimize flood damage;
      3.   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood damage; and
      4.   Base flood elevation data shall be provided for each lot or building
pad for all subdivision proposals and other development.
   D.   Development In Areas Without NRCS Or City Erosion Protection
Improvements: A minimum river corridor width of four hundred feet (400') as
defined in the river master plan is established within which no residential

Development of any subdivision shall comply with the following procedures.
(Ord. 2023-21: Ord. 2023-04 § 1: Ord. 2009-02 § 1)
16.12.020: STEP ONE, BASIC DATA AND INFORMATION:
   A.   Before initiating the process for subdivision plat consideration, the
owner, which may be the owner, or an agent designated by the owner and
authorized to act for the owner, shall obtain and review the following:
      1.   The city's subdivision ordinance.
      2.   The city's general plan, land use ordinance, construction standards,
and other applicable information.
      3.   Plat maps and record of survey maps of existing subdivisions and
parcels of land adjacent to the proposed subdivision.
      4.   A copy of the city's hillside protection overlay, HP zone where
applicable.
   B.   The owner shall visit with the city technical review committee (TRC) to
discuss the proposed subdivision, gain a general understanding of the
subdivision procedure, and to discuss any other information relative to the
specific area being considered for development.
(Ord. 2023-21: Ord. 2023-04 § 1: Ord. 2009-02 § 1)
16.12.030: STEP TWO, CONCEPT PLAN:
   A.   The owner initiates the subdivision plat consideration process by
submitting a concept plan to the technical review committee (TRC).
   B.   The concept plan need not be prepared by a design professional.
However, detailed, and accurate information incorporated into the concept plan
will enable the TRC to make more meaningful comments to the development process
at an early stage of development.
   C.   If a zone change is required before the approval of a preliminary plat,
the requirements for a zone change found in title 17,
chapter 17.18  of this code shall be followed.
   D.   A preliminary plat shall not be submitted to the planning commission
for consideration until after the zone change shall have been favorably acted
upon by the city council. (Ord. 2023-21: Ord. 2023-04 § 1: Ord. 2009-02 § 1)
16.12.040: STEP THREE, PRELIMINARY PLAN:
The preliminary plat step is the point at which the owner and city staff work
closely together to resolve issues relative to the subdivision, and to
determine its feasibility. All information required by this title as well as
additional requirements of the hillside protection overlay, HP zone, floodplain
ordinance, planned development zoning requirements, and any other information
deemed to be appropriate to the proposed development, will all be reviewed at
the preliminary plat phase. Reports from the hillside review board shall be
required by the TRC, where applicable, prior to submitting the plat to the
planning commission.
   A.   Preparation: The owner will prepare a preliminary plat and vicinity
map. The preliminary plat shall contain all required information listed in this
title, as applicable, and the vicinity map will show the relationship of the
proposed subdivision to adjacent subdivisions and to the city in general.
   B.   Submission: The preliminary plat should be submitted promptly after
concept plan review. If city ordinances or regulations change between concept
plan review, and before preliminary plat submission, the owner must comply with
the new ordinances and regulations. A minimum of four (4) scale drawings shall
be submitted along with twelve (12) reduced eleven inch by seventeen inch (11"
x 17") drawings, and one copy in electronic format.
   C.   Review By City Departments: The administrative officer shall deliver
copies of the preliminary plat and vicinity plan to city departments affected
by the proposed subdivision. City departments shall review the preliminary plat
for compliance with city ordinances, policies, and regulations. Copies of their
comments and suggestions will be reviewed with the owner as often as necessary
at TRC meetings to resolve as many concerns as possible.
   D.   Completion: Upon completion of TRC and applicant review meetings, the
owner shall submit the same number of copies of the completed preliminary
subdivision plat with supporting documentation, pay the subdivision filing fee,
and zone change application fee, as may be applicable, as found in the
development fee schedule established by resolution of the city council from
time to time. The preliminary plat shall be considered at the next available
planning commission meeting. The administrative officer shall send all
necessary notices, agendas, and other materials to members of the planning
commission.
   E.   Planning Commission Review:
      1.    A preliminary plat application must be reviewed by the Planning
Commission within fifteen (15) business days from the date of receiving a
complete application. In considering the preliminary plat, the planning
commission shall approve only those preliminary plats that it finds to be in
accordance with the standards and criteria set forth in this title, and all
other city ordinances and policies including, but not limited to, the general
plan, the standard specifications for design and construction, the land use
ordinance, the historic preservation ordinance, the building codes, and the
city's land use, street, utility and drainage master plans, the hillside
protection overlay zone, and soils and floodplain ordinances. The planning
commission may approve the plat fully or conditionally, may impose conditions
or revisions that they feel may be necessary to bring the subdivision into full
compliance with city requirements, it may table the plat for further
information or study, or it may reject the plat. If rejected, the planning
commission shall indicate reasons for the rejection. The owner may redesign the
plat using recommendations from the planning commission and reprocess it
beginning with step three. If plat revisions are required, the owner shall
complete the revisions, and the administrative officer shall resubmit the
preliminary plat to the city staff for review, comment, and compliance with
city ordinances. The officer will then place the plat on the next available
planning commission agenda for further consideration.
      2.   The planning commission may set special meetings to visit the site
prior to considering the preliminary plat for approval. All special meetings
shall be advertised in the same manner as regular planning commission meetings.
The planning commission may also schedule work meetings to consider aspects of
the proposed development under the same advertising conditions as indicated for
special meetings. The planning commission, during their review, may require
further information to be submitted in addition to information already provided
to the TRC.
   G.   Additional Studies: In carrying out its responsibilities pursuant to
this section, the TRC, or planning commission may require the applicant to
submit such additional information, data, studies, plans, analyses, or maps as
may be necessary to make the factual determinations set forth herein. Any of
the above groups may also request a third-party review at any time of the
information submitted. If further study or information is required, the owner
shall bear the full cost of meeting this requirement. In situations with severe
limitations, actual construction drawings, as required in step four below, may
be required for proper preliminary plan review and approval.
(Ord. 2023-21: Ord. 2023-04 § 1: Ord. 2015-19: Ord. 2009-02 § 1)
16.12.050: STEP FOUR, FINAL PLAT:

owner shall meet with the technical review committee (TRC) for detailed project
design information. The owner's engineer shall prepare complete construction
drawings for street profiles, utility construction, drainage, soils reports,
flood studies, and any other drawings or plans required by this title, or the
hillside protection overlay zone. The owner shall submit four (4) sets of scale
drawings, along with twelve (12) reduced scale sets of the drawings, and one
copy in an electronic format to the administrative officer for distribution to
required departments.
   B.   The city departments shall review the final plat and construction
drawings. Staff will submit comments to the administrative officer. Based upon
review and comments, the city shall advise the owner of any required
engineering drawing revisions. The owner shall revise the drawings to comply
with the required revisions and submit four (4) sets of final scale drawings
along with twelve (12) reduced size drawings, and one copy in electronic
format, to the city. A review must be completed within 20 business days from
the date of receiving a complete application. The City may perform up to four
reviews on a given application. A review cycle is not considered complete until
the applicant has adequately addressed all redlines identified by the City. The
City may only add new redlines after the first review cycle in response to
changes made or if a correction is necessary to protect the public health or
safety, or to enforce state or federal law.
   C.   In considering the final plat for approval, the TRC shall approve only
those final plats that it finds to be in accordance with the requirements of
preliminary and final plat approval, the standards and criteria set forth in
this title, and all other city ordinances and policies.
   D.   After TRC review and approval, the city shall review the final plat and
construction drawings, along with an estimate from the applicant's engineer of
estimated construction costs for the project.
   E.   The administrative officer will verify, using the subdivision ordinance
check sheet, that all final plat requirements are submitted and reviewed before
placing the final plat on the next regularly scheduled TRC meeting agenda. The
TRC , after review, may approve, conditionally approve, request further changes
or corrections, or deny the final plat. If changes are requested, it may be
brought back to another TRC meeting for review. The TRC will approve the final
plat, and the construction drawings, which may then be stamped as "approved".
If a final plat is denied by the TRC , the applicant may make changes and
submit a revised final subdivision plat for consideration.
   F.   Following TRC approval, the applicant shall post with the city, the
required guarantees, inspection fees, impact fees, recording fees, approval

the final plat and the construction drawings.
   I.   All final plats and construction drawings shall be prepared and
approved within one year of Planning Commission approval of the preliminary
plat. Any final plat not submitted and approved within one year of preliminary
plat approval is void. If the owner, or any subsequent owner, later desires to
submit this same or modified plat for approval, submittal shall begin with step
three of this chapter.
   J.   A final plat must be recorded within eighteen (18) months of Planning
Commission approval. Extensions may be granted by the Planning Commission for
periods not to exceed eighteen (18) month intervals. Any plat, with or without
posted guarantees, not recorded, nor extended, becomes void eighteen (18)
months following Planning Commission approval. If the owner, or any subsequent
owner later desires to develop the subdivision, the process shall start with
step three of this chapter. Construction of any plat extended by the Planning
Commission shall meet all requirements of the subdivision ordinance that may
have been amended between the final approval and the actual construction of the
subdivision.
   K.   Appeal Process: The following appeal processes may be applied for after
the four review cycles have been exhausted and 20 business days have passed:

16.16.060: SPECIAL CONDITIONS:
The zoning laws of the city of Santa Clara shall confer no vested right to
develop under the terms of the zone in which any proposed development is
located if the development, due to access and/or other on-site development
conditions which cannot, in the judgment of the city, be developed safely under
reasonably anticipated conditions. Safety shall include safety to the users,
their invites, safety to the residents of Santa Clara City, and to the public,
and safety of the structural integrity of the improvements.
If the proposed subdivision presents a development condition that the city
planning commission or the city council (hereinafter referred to as the "city")
deems to be unsafe, the city shall require, prior to preliminary plat approval
or building permit issuance (as the case may be), such engineering studies as
may be reasonably required to render the site safe for the long-term viability
and safety of the proposed building site. Included in the consideration of
unsafe conditions shall be sites which have any, or a combination, of the
following conditions:
   A.   Unsafe or steep access.
   B.   Steep slopes.
   C.   Underground water/damage issues.
   D.   Flooding issues (sites in 100-year floodplain, or subject to flood
erosion that may extend beyond the 100-year floodplain).
   E.   Washes.
   F.   Adverse soils conditions.
   G.   Adverse rock or soils formations.
   H.   Slide hazards.
   I.   Liquefaction/earthquake hazard.
   J.   Such other hazards as may be considered unsafe by the city.
If an unsafe condition is found, then the city shall specify such studies as
may be necessary to determine if safe mitigation is reasonably certain to allow
the development to proceed. The city shall then consider the reports of the
owner's experts/engineers, and the reports of any special consultants that the
city may hire at the expense of the owner. The city shall also consider the
effects of the development on adjacent properties where the site presents
evidence of risk outside of the proposed development. The city may also conduct
on site reviews of the possible unsafe condition. If, after review of these
reports and the evidence presented, the city determines that the site may not
be developed safely, then the project shall be denied to preserve the health,
safety, and welfare of city residents. The city shall determine if a portion of
the site can be developed, which ruling shall be given to the owner, and the
owner shall be given the opportunity to submit an amended plan which can be
developed safely. If an adverse ruling is given, the city shall issue written
findings of the reasons why the site is not considered safe.
(Ord. 2023-21: Ord. 2023-04 § 1: Ord. 2009-02 § 1)
16.16.070: APPROVAL PROCEDURE:
   A.   City planning staff will transmit the Preliminary Plat, and Preliminary
Plat review application, along with all accompanying plans, reports, and
studies to appropriate city officials and other official agencies or bodies as
deemed necessary or as required by law, to allow such persons to review the
application.
   B.   After the Preliminary Plat review application is found to meet the
requirements of this title, and all comments have been received from those to
whom a request to review was made, the planning manager or designee shall cause
the Preliminary Plat to be placed on the next available planning commission
agenda, and shall notify the applicant of the date, time, and place of the
meeting at which the application shall be reviewed.
   C.   The planning commission is the city land use authority for subdivision
plats. The Planning Commission may grant approval of a Preliminary Plat which
it finds to be in accordance with the standards and criteria set forth by the
city in this title and all other ordinance, plans, and policies of the city.
The planning commission may also conditionally approve a Preliminary Plat,
imposing such conditions as it may require bringing the Preliminary Plat into
compliance with the requirements of the city's ordinances, plans, and policies.
   D.   After reviewing the Preliminary Plat, the planning commission will make
a determination that the Preliminary Plat be approved, conditionally approved,
or disapproved.
   E.   Upon approval of the Preliminary Plat, and approval of the Construction
Drawings, a permit may be issued which allows the applicant to begin
construction at their own risk, of the infrastructure improvements required for
the subdivision prior to the Final Plat approval. Issuance of a permit to
construct infrastructure prior to Final Plat approval does not constitute a
vesting of development rights.
   F.   If the final subdivision plat, or phase thereof, is not approved by the
city within one (1) year after Planning Commission approval of the Preliminary
Plat, all approvals shall be deemed expired and void. If eligible, the
applicant may submit for approval a new Preliminary Plat in accordance with
this section, if it is determined by the planning manager or designee that
substantial progress toward completion of the final subdivision plat has been
done, and the Final Plat cannot be submitted due to reasons beyond the control
of the applicant, the item shall be placed on the next available Planning
Commission agenda for consideration of a reasonable extension of time to
complete the final plat, but no longer than one (1) year. A second extension
not to exceed one (1) additional year may be granted in extraordinary
circumstances demonstrated by the applicant.
   G.   No extension will be granted to any applicant unless the applicant
first submits documentation evidencing that WCWCD has consented to the
extension of applicants "Will-Serve" letter consistent with the extension
sought from the city.
   H.   Approval of the Preliminary Plat does not constitute full approval of
the development nor vest any development rights as additional requirements may
be imposed that are a result of more detailed and thorough review of all plans,
specifications, reports, and investigations.

16.24.050: STORM DRAINAGE AND NUISANCE WATER CONTROL:
   A.   A storm or nuisance water drainage system shall be provided and shall
be separate and independent from the sanitary sewer system.
   B.   No ditch or canal shall be approved as suitable for the use of storm
drainage without the written permission of the appropriate ditch or canal
company or of the water users for such use, and the approval of the city. No
ditch or canal shall be used for stormwater unless adequately improved to
handle such water as might be reasonably expected to flow from canal and ditch
water, subdivision runoff water, and other water expected to reach the
subdivision, canal, or ditch. Where subdivision improvements affect existing
canals or ditches, specific modifications shall be in accordance with the
requirements of the irrigation company and the city. In situations where the
city already has a drainage plan or system in place, the owner shall be
expected to participate in the expansion, extension, or enlargement of such
system to accommodate water from the subdivision. Retention basins developed as
a part of the subdivision may also be required.
   C.   Drainage and flood control shall be designed in conformance with the

(Ord. 2023-21: Ord. 2023-04 § 1: Ord. 2009-02 § 1)
16.24.060: STREET IMPROVEMENTS:
   A.   Definitions: For purposes of this Section 16.24.060, each reference to
a "subdivision" herein shall mean and refer to either (1) a "subdivision," as
defined in Santa Clara City Code §
16.08.010 ; or (2) a "streets project area," as may be defined by the city
council from time to time, on recommendation of the technical review committee
(TRC) and planning commission.
   B.   Streets Project Areas: The purpose of defining a "streets project area"
is so that existing parcels not requiring further subdivision before
development may still have the benefit of complete and well-maintained street
improvements. A streets project area shall be created when at least eighty
percent (80%) of the owners on the public street in the proposed streets
project area, as measured by linear foot of frontage, have signed a document
notifying the city of their agreement with the conditions of such designation.
Such designation shall signify the intent of the signing owners to bear a share
of costs to improve the public street to applicable city standards, as set
forth in this section. The following areas of the city shall, for purposes of
this section, each be considered a potential streets project area:
      1.   Vernon Street, North of Santa Clara Drive
      2.   Vernon Street, South of Santa Clara Drive
      3.   Victors Street, North of Santa Clara Drive
      4.   Victors Street, South of Santa Clara Drive
      5.   Quail Street, North of Santa Clara Drive
      6.   Quail Street, South of Santa Clara Drive
      7.   Hamblin Drive and Gates Lane, North of Santa Clara Drive
      8.   West Vineyard Drive, from Old Farm Road to Heights Drive
      9.   West Arrowhead Trail, from Arrowhead Circle to Santa Clara Parkway
      10.   South Arrowhead Trail, from Pearl Rose Drive to Concord Drive
   Any other combination of adjacent parcels, having direct access from the
same public street, may also seek recognition as a "streets project area" by
obtaining a recommendation from the technical review committee and planning
commission and approval from the city council.
   C.   When multiple streets project areas are designated or eligible by
designation, the city council shall have the right to determine the relative
priority of the projects for application of available city resources. The city
council will consider the following information when determining priority
between any two (2) streets project areas:
      1.   Citizen input;
      2.   Whether the proposed streets project area will help to mitigate the
anticipated impacts of growth or development;
      3.   Availability of utility services;
      4.   Relative size of streets project areas;
      5.   Availability and cost of contractor services;
      6.   Any other reasonable consideration related to the health, safety,
and welfare of city residents and visitors.
   D.   The City Council shall ultimately have the right to make a final
determination as to the feasibility and timing of any proposed streets project,
and in doing so may consider the availability of funds or financing, the
feasibility of constructing required improvements and the interfacing of new
improvements with existing improvements, the feasibility of necessary land
acquisition, or any other reasonable consideration.
   E.   All streets shall be designed in accordance with the city design
standards, AASHTO, or other approved standards. All streets within the city
shall be improved with streetlights and pavements bounded by integral concrete
curbs, gutters, and sidewalks. All street improvements will be completed to the
boundaries of the subdivision.
   F.   The arrangement of streets in new subdivisions and in designated
streets project areas shall provide for the continuation of principal streets
between adjacent properties when such continuation is necessary for convenient
movement of traffic, effective fire protection, for efficient provision of
utilities, and where such continuation is in accordance with the general plan.
   G.   The owner(s) of the subdivision shall be responsible to bear all costs
of required improvements as set forth in this chapter, shall provide a bond or
other security to warranty the improvements for not less than one (1) year from
the date of completion, and shall provide traffic control and street name signs
conforming to the city's design specifications and approved by the city.
   H.   The owner(s) of parcels comprising a designated streets project area
shall also be responsible to bear certain costs of required improvements;
however, the city agrees to bear a portion of material and improvement costs,
as set forth in the following table:
 
Owner(s) pay for:                        City pays for:
Sidewalk                                 Asphalt and base
Right of way and public utility easement Storm Drain System including curb &
dedication as needed                     gutter
Bond or other security for 1-year
warranty, covering Owner(s)' pro rata    Civil engineering costs, including
portion of project costs (if required by required surveys
City)
New lateral connections to service       Utility replacement and upsizing
individual properties (if required or    (excluding new lateral connections to
desired)                                 service individual properties)
Own legal and professional fees          Streetlights
                                        Own legal and professional fees
 
   Where a corner lot is part of the streets project area, the owner(s) in the
streets project area shall only be responsible for the above costs in relation
to improvements along the side of the corner lot having the longest public
street frontage; the city will pay all costs of improvements along the side
having the shorter frontage. Owner(s) may negotiate among themselves to modify
their respective obligations, provided that any such agreement shall not be
enforceable against the city. The city shall have no obligation to proceed with
improvements to a designated streets project area until having received from
   the owner(s) thereof one hundred percent (100%) of the funds anticipated to
be required to complete the planned improvements. Impact fees designated for
road improvements, or any funds or other security previously deposited with the
city by owner(s) in lieu of impact fees, may be applied by the city to any
designated streets project area in the city, regardless of location.
   I.   All subdivision lots shall have frontage on a dedicated public street
improved to city standards unless the lot is approved as a flag lot under the
city's flag lot ordinance or is approved by the city council on some other
basis. Streets project areas are assumed by definition to have such frontage.
Private streets, alleys, or ways shall not be approved except as may be
approved as a part of a planned development project under the city planned
development ordinance or when, because of hazardous slopes, soils, floodplains,
or other conditions, the city council determines that approval is not in the
best interest of the city.
   J.   The technical review committee (TRC) or the planning commission may
recommend to the city council that an exception for private roadways, utility
improvements, or other improvements be approved for a specific subdivision or
streets project area. In any event, private streets and utility construction
will conform to the construction standards required for dedicated streets and
utilities regarding quality of construction, whether dedicated or not.
   K.   All off-site access roads providing the subdivision or streets project
area with access to the nearest public street shall be improved as required by
this section. Wherever feasible, local streets shall be laid out to provide
connectivity to adjoining residential areas. If the adjacent property is
undeveloped and the street must be a temporary dead-end street, the right of
way shall be extended to the property line and a temporary turnaround shall be
provided. All permanently dead-end streets shall end in an approved cul-de-sac
or other improved turnaround, including appropriate signage, unless otherwise
approved by the city council.
   L.   Intersections shall be designed in conformance with AASHTO standards to
provide adequate sight distance and other performance and safety needs as
approved by the city.
   M.   No subdivision shall be approved which does not have access to an
improved and dedicated city street. Where a subdivision or existing streets
project area obtains access from a street which does not meet minimum city
standards, the access road shall be improved to a minimum width of twenty-five
feet (25'). Additionally, all utilities will be brought up to current city
construction standards.
   N.   Where a subdivision or designated streets project area abuts a master
planned road, utility, or drainage system, the owner(s) shall complete their
portion of such improvements the full length of their project in conformance
with the official city master plan unless otherwise approved by the city
council. Any owner(s) of parcels which are part of a larger designated streets
project area shall have the same obligation with respect to their own
respective parcels.
   O.   Streets shall have the following minimum right of way widths:
      1.   Arterial Street: Eighty-foot (80') minimum.
      2.   Collector Street: Sixty-six feet (66').
      3.   Local Street: Forty-seven (47').
      4.   In planned development areas, subdivisions, and designated streets
project areas, the minimum street width is forty-five (45') feet as per City
Construction Standards.
   P.   Streets shall have the following paved roadway width (lip of curb to
lip of curb):
      1.   Arterial Street: Fifty-five feet (55').
      2.   Collector Street: Forty-nine feet (49').
      3.   Local Street: Thirty-two feet (32') of paved roadway is the minimum
required; however, a developer may build a wider paved roadway width if
approved by the city.
      4.   Modified Local Street: Thirty feet (30') of paved roadway is the
minimum required for a planned development area, infill subdivision, or
designated streets project area.
   Q.   Cul-de-sacs shall be no longer than eight hundred feet (800') in length
without a request for an exception from the applicant and approval by the
planning commission upon recommendation from the TRC.
   R.   The radius of the turnaround in a cul-de-sac shall be a minimum of
fifty feet (50').
   S.   Streets should intersect as nearly as possible to ninety-degree (90°)
angles and shall not be offset less than two hundred fifty feet (250') from the
centerline of the nearest intersecting street.
   T.   Streets shall have the names or numbering system of all streets in
city-approved sequence. Permanent street name or number signs shall be
installed by the owner at their expense according to city requirements and
standards at the time of development of the subdivision and shall be provided
for along with other elements of the subdivisions for which a guarantee is
posted.
   U.   Traffic control signs required by the city shall also be installed to
ensure a smooth flow of traffic through the subdivision.
   V.   Streetlights, of a type approved by the Power Department, shall be
installed in every subdivision. Spacing of streetlights shall be within two
hundred fifty feet (250'), except as approved by the Power Department, and
shall be installed at all intersections, or in other locations as determined by
the city.
   W.   Curb, gutter, and sidewalk are required in all subdivisions and
designated streets project areas, in accordance with the city's design and
construction standards. Additionally, all existing utilities in these areas
will be brought up to current city construction standards.
   X.   The minimum centerline radii for local streets shall be one hundred
fifty feet (150'). For collector streets the minimum shall be three hundred
feet (300'). For arterial streets the minimum shall be five hundred feet
(500'), unless otherwise approved by the city council upon recommendation of
the city engineer.
   Y.   The grade of streets shall not exceed eight percent (8%) for arterial
or collector streets and fifteen percent (15%) for local streets.
   Z.   Blocks shall not be longer than one thousand feet (1,000') and shall be
at least two (2) building lots in depth, unless otherwise approved by the
planning commission upon recommendation from the TRC.
   AA.   All arterial streets are classified as limited access streets, and no
individual lot shall front on an arterial street.
   BB.   All street widths shall conform to the width requirements unless
otherwise recommended by the TRCfor approval by the planning commission. Such
recommendation and approval shall normally apply only to developments in the
planned development zone.

Ord. 2012-13: Ord. 2009-02 § 1)
16.24.070: LAYOUT OF LOTS:
   A.   The design and development of the subdivision shall preserve, insofar
as possible, the natural terrain, drainage, existing topsoil, and vegetation.
   B.   In general, side lot lines shall be at right angles to street lines, or
radial curving street lines, unless a variation from this rule will give a
better street or lot plan. Dimensions of corner lots shall be large enough to
allow erection of buildings, observing the minimum front yard setbacks unless
other provisions are approved by the planning commission upon recommendation
from the TRC.
(Ord. 2023-21: Ord. 2023-04 § 1: Ord. 2009-02 § 1)
16.24.080: LOT ARRANGEMENT:
   A.   Lot Arrangement Considerations: The lot arrangement shall be such that
there will be no foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of topography or other
conditions, in securing building permits to build on all lots in the
subdivision in compliance with the zoning ordinance and in providing driveway
access to buildings on all lots from an approved street unless otherwise
approved by the Planning Commission for reasons listed elsewhere in this title.
   B.   Lot Dimensions: Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards
of the zoning ordinance. Where lots are more than double the minimum required
area for the zoning district, the planning commission may require that the lots
be arranged to allow further subdivision and the opening of future streets
where they would be necessary to serve potential lots, all in compliance with
the zoning ordinance and these regulations.
   C.   Double Frontage Lots: Double frontage lots are lots which have the rear
property line adjacent to a public street. Double frontage lots shall not be
permitted except where necessary to provide separation of residential
development from traffic arterials or to overcome specific disadvantages of
topography and orientation. All double frontage lots must be approved by the
Planning Commission. A solid block or masonry wall shall be provided on all
double frontage lots as a part of the required development of improvements,
unless waived or modified by the Planning Commission. Where a privacy wall is
constructed, there shall be a landscape strip provided between the sidewalk and
privacy wall with a minimum average width of ten feet (10'). The wall may be of
serpentine design so that the distance between the wall and sidewalk varies,
but the wall shall not be closer to the sidewalk at any point than four feet
(4'). The minimum ten foot (10') wide planter strip may include landscape area
on both sides of the sidewalk where the sidewalk is separated from the curb by
a landscape area.
   Where the privacy wall on the adjoining property has a curvilinear or
serpentine design, the Planning Commission may require the continuation of such
wall design to provide for a uniform appearance along the public street.
   Where the city determines that a turning lane is needed at an intersection,
the Planning Commission may reduce the landscape strip to accommodate the
turning lane. There shall be a minimum separation of one foot (1') between the
sidewalk and privacy wall. The subdivision developer shall make provisions for
the long-term maintenance of the planter strip either through a homeowners
association (HOA), or other approved maintenance plan, or where the City agrees
to provide long term maintenance for the planter area, in which case the
developer shall on the final subdivision plat grant to the City a landscape
maintenance easement upon all private property which may be on the street side
of the privacy wall.
   D.   Access From Major Arterials and Collector Streets: Residential lots
shall not derive access from major arterial streets, and access shall be
limited on collector streets, except where approved by the City. In cases where
driveway access from such streets may be necessary for several adjoining lots,
the Planning Commission may require that such lots be served by a combined
access drive to limit possible traffic hazards on these streets. In these
cases, driveways shall be designed and arranged to avoid requiring vehicles to
back into traffic.
   E.   Flag Lots: After determination by the Planning Commission that standard
lots are not feasible, the Planning Commission, may, to encourage more
efficient use of the land, allow flag lots to be developed subject to the
following conditions:
      1.   The property cannot be subdivided with public street and standard
sized lots, either at the present time or in the foreseeable future.
      2.   The staff portion of the lot shall front on a dedicated public
street. The minimum width of the staff portion of the lot shall be twenty-five
feet (25') and the maximum length shall be two hundred feet (200').
      3.   No building or construction, except driveways, shall be allowed on
the staff portion of the lot.
      4.   The front side of the flag lot shall be deemed to be the side
nearest the dedicated public street upon which the staff portion fronts.
      5.   All lot size and setback requirements shall be the same as required
by the zone in which the lot is located. The staff portion of the lot shall not
be included in these calculations.
      6.   No more than two (2) flag lots or four (4) dwelling units may be
served by one staff portion of the lots.
      7.   Each flag lot shall be specifically approved by the Planning
Commission.
      8.   The staff portion of the lot shall be owned by the owner of the flag
lot, or jointly in the case of two (2) lots served by one staff portion.

16.28.040: RELEASE OF GUARANTEE/POSTING OF MAINTENANCE WARRANTY:
   A.   After completion of all subdivision improvements the owner shall make a
written request to the city for a final inspection. Upon receipt of the
inspection reports from affected departments the city shall notify the owner in
writing specifying the acceptability of all subdivision improvements and
itemizing those improvements not acceptable along with the actions necessary to
render those improvements acceptable.
   B.   After acceptance of all improvements by the city, the city may release
up to ninety percent (90%) of the guarantee amount. The city shall continue to
hold the security covering the remaining ten percent (10%) guarantee to ensure
that all improvements shall be free from defective material and workmanship and
in compliance with all city standards for a period of one (1) or two (2) years
as may be determined by the city engineer or public works director. This period
is marked from the date of final approval of all improvements until the
performance guarantee is replaced by a maintenance guarantee in the same ten
percent (10%) amount. At the end of the performance period, the city shall
perform a second inspection of all improvements. The city shall notify the
owner in writing of any corrective measures that are required. If the defects
are identified as a part of the inspection, the owner shall have the option of
correcting the defects to the satisfaction of the city or shall forfeit the
maintenance guarantee to the city as damages for the defective work.
   C.   The improvement guarantee may be released in part as progress payment
for improvements, subject to the following conditions:
      1.   The owner shall submit to the city a request for payment against the
guarantee showing to whom and for what amount the release is requested. The
request shall include an updated engineers estimate for completion of the
remaining improvements. Upon inspection by the city, and approval of the
requested amount, the city will authorize the holder of the guarantee amount to
disperse the approved payments, less any amount required to secure completion
of remaining improvements. Payments may be made upon completion of the various
phases of development as follows:
         a.   The complete water system including mains, outfall lines, valves,
hydrants, or any other part of the required water system.
         b.   The complete road construction, including all survey monuments,

work.
         e.   The completion of each required utility system, including power,
telephone, natural gas, cable TV, internet connections, or any other utility
service that may have been bonded for by the owner. Each required utility may
be released independent of other utility installation.
      2.   Requests shall not be submitted more frequently than monthly. A
minimum of twenty percent (20%) of each element shall be retained as required
for the guarantee required in subsection B of this section. A guarantee of the
same type used to guarantee installation of all improvements shall be posted
prior to final release of the improvement guarantee amount. The city reserves
the right to require updated engineers estimates of the remaining improvements,
and additional security if required, every six (6) months in the event that no
partial releases are requested.
      3.   For an owner who proposes to install all improvements prior to final
recording of a final plat, a cost estimate of improvements shall be submitted
to the city and approved by the city engineer or public works director prior to
the start of construction, as the basis for determining the amount of the ten
percent (10%) guarantee that shall be posted upon final approval of the
improvements by the city, and prior to the recording of the final plat.

17.04.125: NOTICE OF NONCOMPLIANCE:
   A.   Purpose: To enforce compliance with the international building code,

building and land use in the city of Santa Clara. The building official, or
other city representative, may issue a “stop work order” and may record, or
cause to be recorded, a notice of noncompliance to be filed with the county
recorder’s office against the property where the violation has been committed.
   B.   Permanent File: Prior to notice and processing of the certificate of
noncompliance with the county, a permanent file will be developed which will
include:
      1.   A statement of the failure to comply with the building regulations.
      2.   Attempts to obtain compliance.
      3.   A corrections list to bring the construction into compliance.
      4.   Copies of all attempts to contact the permit holder/owner.
      5.   A review of the file to determine the proper course of action.
   C.   First Notice: The builder/owner shall be notified in writing of the
failure to comply with the building regulations. The owner/builder will be
given ten (10) to thirty (30) days to comply, depending upon the circumstances.
If the matter is one of public safety immediate compliance will be required.
   D.   Second Notice: If the owner/builder fails to comply with the first
notice, the building official will prepare a second notice. The second notice
shall be mailed by certified mail to the owner who will be given ten (10) days
to comply. The second notice will contain a copy of the certificate of
noncompliance that will be recorded against the property at the county
recorder’s office if the owner/builder fails to comply with the building
violations.
      1.   If the owner fails to comply with the second notice within the
required period, or if the notice is returned as being undeliverable at the
owner/builder’s last known address, the certificate of noncompliance will be
recorded. Any returned mail will be kept in the file as evidence of an attempt
to serve notice at the last known address.
      2.   No work may be done on the property until the noncompliance notice
has been released and a new building permit has been issued.
      3.   To release the certificate, a new building permit shall be obtained,
and the plans will be reviewed according to the building regulations currently
in place. If issued within one year, the permit fee shall be one-half (½) of a
regular permit. If more than one year has expired, the permit fee will be the
complete amount of a new building permit.
      4.   After the construction work shall have been completed and approved,
the city will record a notice to remove the certificate of noncompliance with
the county recorder, and a copy of the release notice will be mailed to the
owner/builder.
      5.   If all other efforts to correct the violation fail, the city may
commence steps to have the building removed as a public nuisance. (Ord. 2023-05

that a proper permit has been granted before such work is begun. Any such
person doing or performing any such work without a permit having been issued
conflicts with the requirements of this title and shall be deemed to be guilty

owner of the premises or the persons for whom the use is established, and shall
be subject to the penalties, prescribed for violation in this chapter. (Ord.

property owners.
The city council, as an agenda item at a regularly scheduled council meeting

2006-02: Ord. 2004-19 § 1: Ord. 97-06 § 1-17)

are vested with authority to issue the permits or licenses provided for herein

authority to prezone properties lying outside of the city limits to determine,
in advance of the annexation, the zone or zones into which the property should
be zoned upon annexation. Upon the recommendation of the planning commission,
and subject to approval of the city council, such areas may come into the city
in other zoning classifications than outlined in the previous paragraph.
All annexations to the city shall comply with all laws and requirements of the

improvements required under city ordinance, shall be completed prior to the

completed prior to receiving a certificate of occupancy, due to weather
conditions, or other unusual circumstances, or at the decision of the city, a
guarantee in the form of a cashier’s check, cash bond, letter of credit or
other means acceptable to the city, shall be provided to the city’s guarantee
that such required improvement will be fully completed as required. (Ord. 2023-
05 § 1: Ord. 2004-19 § 1: Ord. 97-06 § 1-20)
17.04.210: DENIED AMENDMENTS; RECONSIDERATION:
In the event that a petition for a zone change or an ordinance amendment is
denied by the city council, or is withdrawn after the planning commission
hearing, the planning commission shall not consider the petition, or any other
petition for the same zone change or amendment of this title as it applies to
the same property described in the original petition, or any part thereof,
within a period of one year from the date of such denial action, unless the
conditions upon which the original denial was based have substantially changed.
For this section, a “substantial change” in a request shall mean a substantial
reduction in density, and/or land area involved, a change in the proposed use,
such as residential rather than commercial, or other factors which, in the
opinion of the planning commission, clearly constitute a significant change in
a zone change request. (Ord. 2023-05 § 1: Ord. 97-06 § 1-22)

      2.   Uses and Density. A Land Use Application shall not be considered
formally approved or vested in that approval until the Land Use Authority has
approved the final site plan, final Construction Drawings, or Final Plat
   B.    Expiration: Recognizing that the length of the planning, building, and
engineering review process will vary with the size and complexity of each
proposal, applicants must move their applications either to approval or denial
in a reasonably expeditious manner. The city may formally close applications
which remain inactive for one (1) year or longer due to acts or omissions of
the applicant.
      1.   An application is deemed inactive and subject to closure based on
inactivity if, through the act or omission of the applicant and not the city,
one of the following occurs:
         a.   More than one (1) year has passed since the last substantive
contact between staff and the applicant. Sporadic non-substantive contact shall
not be sufficient to move an application forward or prevent closure.
         b.   More than one (1) year has passed since a request for additional
information was made by staff, which request has:
            (1)   Not been complied with; or
            (2)   Was incomplete or insufficient.

payment of any fee assessed or required by ordinance.

application.

thirty (30) calendar days’ written notice to the applicant. Written notice may
be delivered in person, by mail or by email. Such notice must state the intent
of the respective department to have the Project closed because of inaction and
what the applicant must submit in a timely manner to maintain an active file.

not prevent closure if the requested information or submissions are
insufficient, untimely, or incomplete. (Ord. 2023-05 § 1)

Anyone appealing any such decision shall be deemed not to have exhausted his or
her administrative appeals until the decision has been appealed and reviewed
pursuant to this section.
   A.   Procedure, Time Limit: A notice of appeal of a request for variance or
other land use decision must be commenced within ten (10) calendar days of the
adverse order, requirement, decision or determination by filing a written
notice of appeal with the Santa Clara Planning Manager at the Santa Clara City
Building Department Office. If the tenth day falls on a weekend or holiday, it
will be accepted on the next business day. The notice must indicate the
decision appealed from, the grounds upon which the appeal is based, and
identify the parties making the appeal. Any notice of appeal must include a
list containing the names and addresses of adjoining property owners. Adjoining
property owners include all owners of property within a five-hundred-foot
(500') radius of the property affected by the appeal or request for variance as
shown on the tax rolls of Washington County. The Santa Clara Planning Manager
shall notify the appropriate Appeal Authority of the notice of appeal within
seven (7) working days.
   B.   Fee: The filing of an appeal shall be accompanied by a fee established
by the City Council, which amount shall be used to defray the cost of
administering the appeal, including, but not limited to, costs of mailing and
publishing notice.
   C.   Hearing To Be Scheduled; Notice: When a notice of appeal is filed, the
Appeal Authority of the adverse order, requirement, decision or determination
shall schedule a meeting for a hearing within fifteen (15) working days, unless
such time is extended for good cause or stipulation of the parties. Notice of
the time, place, and subject matter of the meeting shall be given to the person
making the appeal, the Land Use Authority or official who issued the adverse
order, requirement, decision or determination, and all parties in interest,
including adjoining property owners within a five-hundred-foot (500') radius of

Authority may require such written briefs or memorandum of the parties, as the
Appeal Authority deems advisable. At the hearing, the appellant shall appear in
person or by agent or attorney.
   D.   Stay Of Proceedings: The filing of a notice of appeal stays all
proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the City
official, from whom the appeal is taken, after receiving notice of appeal,
certifies in writing with specificity to the Appeal Authority the reasons why a
stay would cause imminent peril to life or property. In such cases, the Appeal
Authority may lift the stay, upon notice to the parties, with the opportunity
to respond.
   E.   Burden Of Proof: At all times, the appellant has the burden of proving
that the Land Use Authority's decision was in error.
   F.   Standard Of Review: The Appeal Authority shall review the matter de
novo, without deference to the land use authority's determination of factual
matters. The Appeal Authority shall determine the correctness of a decision of
the Land Use Authority in its interpretation and application of a land use
ordinance. Only those decisions in which a Land Use Authority has applied a
land use ordinance to a particular application, person, or parcel may be
appealed to the Appeal Authority.

may be appealed directly to the district court. Before petitioning for district
court review, a person must exhaust all remedies by appealing to the Appeal
Authority in accordance with this section and receive a final decision issued
by the appeal authority. The City, the applicant, and any person adversely
affected by a final decision of the Appeal Authority may petition the District
Court for review of the decision as permitted by law. Such a petition is barred
unless filed within thirty (30) days after the Appeal Authority's decision is
final.
   I.   Action Of Variance Withdrawal, No Refund: Unless otherwise specified by
the Appeal Authority, any order or decision of the Appeal Authority authorizing
a variance shall expire if the applicant fails to obtain a building permit
within one year from the date of the decision. Any applicant may voluntarily
withdraw the appeal or variance request at any time prior to a decision of the
Appeal Authority. No person shall be entitled to a refund of costs for any
reason whatsoever. (Ord. 2022-09)

where building is to occur (according to the storm sewer master plan), then no
fee shall be exacted.

shall constitute a covenant to run with the land. A sample of the improvement
and cash bond agreement is attached to the ordinance codified herein, and is
hereby incorporated by reference herein. The cash bond deposit shall be put at
interest by the city to assist in defraying the cost of inflation. The amount
of cash bond to be deposited shall be computed by the city engineer based on
the engineer's estimate of the cost of installation under the standards stated
above. Each applicant shall pay an engineer's review fee in connection with
applying for the building permit, as the city council may establish by
resolution, to cover the cost of the engineer's review.
   H.   Upon actual building of the improvements involved, the cash bond,
including interest earned thereon, shall be applied to the cost, including the
city's reasonably allocated engineering, legal and administrative costs. (Ord.

intersection of the property lines nearest the intersection.
      1.   On local streets, the distance may be reduced to forty feet (40') or
twenty five feet (25') from the point of curvature of the radius, whichever is
greater, with planning commission approval, after receiving a recommendation
from staff that:
         a.   The length of the local street is of such length that most local
traffic is diverted onto other local or collector streets and is not a
collector street by way of use, or
         b.   The lot is adjacent to a collector or major street which
restricts lot access, and is therefore feasible to enter only from the local
street, or
         c.   The size or shape of the lot is such that it justifies a
reduction as opposed to other lots in the area.
         d.   Other findings of the staff that may be peculiar to the specific
lot, and which may not be applicable to other lots in the area.
      2.   The reduction of the setback distance may not be to simply
accommodate the desire of the property owner without cause, as identified
above.
      3.   The approval of a reduced setback serves to modify the city
construction standards relative to the setback from the corner for any lot so
approved.
   D.   Any unused curb cuts for driveways shall be replaced with standard
curb, gutter, and sidewalk, unless otherwise approved by the city.

as a turnaround, and not as a joint use for such things as parking, garbage
collection, or otherwise.
   E.   Flag lots approved by the planning commission and city council shall be
designed to meet all applicable requirements of section
17.20.220 of this title dealing with flag lots. (Ord. 2004-26 § 1: Ord. 97-06 §

   D.   In cases where there is an existing curb and gutter, or sidewalk on the
street, the property owner shall provide a safety island along the entire
frontage of the property, except for the permitted driveways.
   E.   No driveway shall be located closer to a public street intersection
than fifty feet (50') from the point of intersection of the property lines
nearest the intersection. (Ord. 2004-26 § 1: Ord. 97-06 § 8-4)
17.36.050: SCREENING OF PARKING LOTS:
The sides and rear of any parking lot which faces or adjoins a residential
district shall be screened from such district by a masonry wall, solid visual
barrier fence, or earth berm of a height six feet (6'), or as may be required

on the lot, adequate space for standing, loading, and unloading services, in
order to avoid undue interference with public use of streets. In no case shall
required loading and unloading spaces be part of those areas used to satisfy
the parking requirement. Exceptions may be granted by the planning commission

CHAPTER 17.38
HOME OCCUPATIONS
SECTION:
17.38.010: Purpose And Intent

17.38.030: Home Occupation Permit Required
17.38.040: Business License Required
17.38.050: Procedure
17.38.060: Inspection Authority
17.38.070: Requirements
17.38.080: Categories Of Permitted And Nonpermitted Uses
17.38.010: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
The purpose and intent of this chapter is to encourage the majority of business
activities to be conducted in appropriate commercial zones. Business activities
may be conducted within a residence on a limited basis if such activities
comply with the standards of this chapter. All home occupations shall be
secondary and incidental to the residential use. The use should be conducted so
that neighbors, under normal conditions, would not be aware of its existence.
Home occupations are a privilege which can be revoked if disruption of the
neighborhood occurs. (Ord. 2012-02)
17.38.020: HOME OCCUPATION DEFINED:
A "home occupation" as used herein shall mean the conducting of any business
transaction, or activity for which consideration of any nature is received in
any zone classified as residential under the land use ordinance. Occasional
"garage sales" held on an irregular basis not to exceed one per year, do not
constitute a home occupation. (Ord. 2012-02)
17.38.030: HOME OCCUPATION PERMIT REQUIRED:
To ensure compliance with the provisions of this chapter, and to protect the
health, safety, and welfare of residential neighborhoods, a home occupation
permit shall be obtained by filing an application, and paying the required fee,
to the city of Santa Clara. The application requires the submission of an
accurate and legible drawing of the home, and the yard, as may be necessary,
showing how the various parts of the home and parking areas will be used in
accommodating the requested use of the home. The request may be heard by either
the city staff, or the planning commission as may be determined by the staff.
(Ord. 2012-02)
17.38.040: BUSINESS LICENSE REQUIRED:
To ensure compliance with the provisions of this chapter, and to protect the
character of residential neighborhoods in the city, a business license shall be
obtained from the city after the home occupation permit has been approved, and
before a dwelling unit in a residential zone may be used for business purposes.
Business licenses shall be renewed annually. (Ord. 2012-02)
17.38.050: PROCEDURE:
Upon approval by the city staff, or planning commission, a permit will be
issued to the applicant and will allow them to obtain a business license from
the city office. The approval will contain whatever requirements will be
imposed on the applicant. The approval of the application is dependent upon
meeting all of the listed requirements in the following section, and the
applicant will agree in writing within the application form to comply with all
said requirements. (Ord. 2012-02)
17.38.060: INSPECTION AUTHORITY:
Any approved home occupation that may require changes in the home such as fire/
safety requirements that would be required for a child daycare business, or any
building code requirements, will require an inspection by the building official
to determine compliance, or to identify changes that would need to be made. The
zoning administrator, or building official, shall have authority at any time to
inspect the dwelling and premises to determine that all requirements for the
home occupation, and the requirements of the international building code, are
being complied with. (Ord. 2012-02)
17.38.070: REQUIREMENTS:
Each requirement listed below must be observed at all times by the holder of a
home occupation permit:
   A.   The holder of a home occupation permit shall be a bona fide resident of
the residence. Persons who are not bona fide residents of the premises shall
not be employed on said premises, or come to the premises to receive regular
work assignments.
   B.   The home occupation business shall be conducted wholly within the
dwelling on the premises, and shall not exceed twenty five percent (25%) of the
total floor area. The home occupation shall not occupy any area in the garage
unless the garage still functions for parking of at least one vehicle, and as
long as two (2) parking spaces for residential use are still available. Tandem
parking in the driveway is not permitted.
   C.   Promotional meetings for the purpose of selling merchandise, taking
orders, or training shall not be held more than once per month.
   D.   The home occupation may include the sale of commodities. However, it is
the intent of this chapter that the items be primarily limited to those
produced on the property, or items that are incidental to the service provided
(i.e., a beautician who sells hair care or other beauty products to the
clientele). Sales of products and services are allowed at the home with a
maximum of two (2) nonoverlapping customers per hour.
   E.   No business or commercial sign or advertising shall be displayed on the
premises except for an identification sign not larger than twelve inches by
twelve inches (12" x 12") located on the inside of a window on the front of the
home.
   F.   There shall be no storage of materials, samples, displays, or supplies
outdoors, nor shall any indoor storage be visible from the exterior of the
residence. In no case shall any materials, samples, supplies, machinery, or
equipment be left, placed, stored, or parked on any public street or sidewalk
area, or on any private street or sidewalk.
   G.   Only one vehicle may be used in connection with the home occupation.
The vehicle used for the home occupation shall be limited to a maximum of one
ton gross vehicle weight, nor shall a business be permitted that requires
receipt or delivery of merchandise, goods, or equipment by other than a
passenger vehicle, or parcel or delivery service vehicle in excess of those
usually and customarily used for residential deliveries. No regular deliveries
shall be made by semitractor, or semitrailer truck.
   H.   The home occupation shall not cause a demand for utility, garbage, or
community services beyond those usually provided for residential use.
   I.   The home occupation shall not alter the residential character of the
premises, nor unreasonably disturb the peace and quiet, including radio,
television, and computer reception of the neighborhood by reason of color,
design, materials, construction, lighting, sounds, noises, vibrations, or
electronic disruptions.
   J.   The home occupation shall not cause, directly or indirectly, any
excessive negative impacts on the residential neighborhood, including, but not
limited to, noise, traffic, vehicular or pedestrian, or parking impacts, which
cause three (3) or more persons residing within a five hundred foot (500')
radius of the home occupation to file legitimate complaints, as determined by
the zoning administrator, with the city concerning the home occupation. When
complaints are filed, they will be investigated, and may result in the permit
being called back before the planning commission for determination as to
whether to continue the use, or to terminate it.
   K.   Any requirements established by the staff, or by the planning
commission, authorized by this chapter regarding the home occupation
application shall be made of record, and shall become the basis upon which the
home occupation is approved or later reviewed.
   L.   A home occupation permit shall not be issued unless and until all other
federal, state, county, city, and any other public agency license requirements
to conduct said business have been met, unless city approval is a condition of
receiving state or federal approval.
   M.   Most home occupations can be approved by the planning staff unless the
staff feels that approval should be considered at a public meeting in order to
allow adjoining neighbors the opportunity to respond.
   N.   The planning commission may grant a permit for an indefinite period of
time, unless something in the nature of the use would require them to call it
back up again to be reheard, reinstated, or possibly terminated. In all cases a
permit shall be subject to termination for violating conditions of approval, of
the purpose and intent of this chapter.
   O.   Any use may still be called back for review for cause. (Ord. 2012-02)
17.38.080: CATEGORIES OF PERMITTED AND NONPERMITTED USES:
   A.   In order to minimize traffic and parking problems and to avoid health,
safety, and sanitation risks from the disposal of wastes, health service
businesses are not permitted except for emergency consultation. Other uses,
such as the repair or painting of automobiles, commercial kennels, commercial
stables, and major appliance repair, lawnmower repair, or repair of similar
motorized equipment, manufacturing and industrial type uses, and any other uses
that the planning commission deems to be not in harmony with intent and
character of the residential area, may be denied by the planning commission.
   B.   A sample of some uses that could be permitted as home occupations, as
long as they meet the requirements of this chapter could include artist
studios, architectural services, barber and beauty services, consulting
services, computer services, computer business with sales away from the home,
dance classes, music lessons, swimming lessons, tennis lessons, or any such
lessons (not to exceed 10 students at any 1 time), data processing, secretarial
services, family daycare not to exceed five (5) children plus those living at
the residence, unless otherwise approved by the planning commission and
licensed by the state of Utah. Other similar uses determined by the planning
commission to be compatible with the intent and purpose of the residential zone
and not specifically excluded herein, may also be approved. (Ord. 2012-02)

permits for approval prior to construction. (Ord. 97-06 § 9-1)
17.40.020: PERMIT REQUIRED:
An approved conditional use permit shall be required for each conditional use
listed in this title. No building permit or other permit or license shall be

permit shall first have been approved by the Planning Commission. (Ord. 97-06 §
9-2)
17.40.030: APPLICATION PROCESS:
Application for a conditional use permit shall be made at the City office in
the same manner as a request for a zone change, subdivision plat review, or
other similar planning request. (Ord. 97-06 § 9-3)

preparation and submission of an accurate and complete development plan. (Ord.
97-06 § 9-5)
17.40.055: GENERAL STANDARDS FOR APPROVAL OF CONDITIONAL USES:
A conditional use shall be approved if reasonable conditions are imposed to
mitigate the reasonably anticipated detrimental effects of the proposed use.
The following standards must be met in order to mitigate the reasonably
anticipated detrimental effects, if imposed as a condition of approval:
   A.   Noise:
      1.   Excessive noise (unwanted or undesired sound) can cause serious
impacts to health, property values, and economic productivity. Conditional uses
shall not impose excessive noise on surrounding uses. "Excessive noise"
generally means noise that is prolonged, unusual, or a level of noise that in
its time, place and use annoys, disturbs, injures or endangers the comfort,
repose, health, peace or safety of others.
   B.   Dust:
      1.   Comply with all air quality standards, State, Federal and local.
      2.   Use shall not create unusual or obnoxious dust beyond the property
line.
   C.   Odors:
      1.   Comply with all air quality standards, State, Federal and local.
      2.   Use shall not create unusual or obnoxious odors beyond the property
line.
   D.   Aesthetics:
      1.   Blend harmoniously with the neighborhood so the use does not change
the characteristics of the zone.
   E.   Safety:
      1.   Take the necessary measures to avoid or mitigate any safety problems
created by the use, including problems due to traffic, rock fall, erosion,
flooding, fire, hazardous materials, or related problems.
      2.   Uses shall not locate within the 100-year floodplain as identified
by FEMA unless expressly recommended by the City Engineer in conformance with
City engineering standards and all State, local and Federal laws.
   F.   Traffic:
      1.   Traffic increases due to the conditional use shall not cause streets
or nearby intersections to fall more than one grade from the existing level of
service grade or fall below a level of service "C".
      2.   Uses shall follow City access management standards and not create
hazards to other drivers or pedestrians.
   G.   Height:
      1.   A building's height and scale shall fit into the overall context of
the surrounding area.
      2.   Photo simulations may be required by City staff or Planning
Commission showing all sides of the building(s) and showing how the building
fits into the surrounding area, including its relationship to nearby ridges,
hills, and buildings.

   A.   A use permit issued pursuant to this chapter or a site plan approval
issued pursuant to this chapter authorizing establishment of a
telecommunication facility, except exempt facilities as defined in section
17.42.020 of this chapter, shall be reviewed every five (5) years. Costs
associated with the review process shall be borne by the telecommunication
facility owner/provider. Grounds for revocation of the conditional use permit,
pursuant to section 26-509 of the Santa Clara zoning ordinance, shall be
limited to a finding that: 1) the use involved is no longer allowed in the
applicable zoning district, 2) the facility fails to comply with the relevant
requirements of this chapter as they exist at the time of renewal and the
permittee has failed to supply assurances acceptable to the city that the
facility will be brought into compliance within one hundred twenty (120) days,
3) the permittee has failed to comply with the conditions of approval imposed,
4) the facility has not been properly maintained, or 5) the facility has not
been upgraded to minimize its impact, including community aesthetics, to the
greatest extent permitted by the technology that exists at the time of renewal
and is consistent with the provisions of universal service at affordable rates.
The grounds for appeal of issuance of a renewal shall be limited to a showing
that one or more of the situations listed above do in fact exist or that the
notice required under section
17.42.320 of this chapter was not provided.
   B.   If a use permit or other entitlement for use is not renewed, it shall
automatically become null and void without notice or hearing ten (10) years
after it is used or upon cessation of use for more than a year and a day,
whichever comes first. Unless a new use permit or entitlement of use is issued,
within one hundred twenty (120) days thereafter all improvements installed
including their foundations down to three feet (3') below ground surface shall
be removed from the property and the site restored to its natural
preconstruction state within one hundred eighty (180) days of nonrenewal or
abandonment. Any access road installed shall also be removed and the ground
returned to its natural condition unless the property owner establishes to the
satisfaction of the city that these sections of road are necessary to serve
some other allowed use of the property that is permitted or is currently
present or to provide access to adjoining parcels. (Ord. 99-26 § 1)
17.42.160: STRUCTURAL REQUIREMENTS:
No telecommunication facility shall be designed and/or sited such that it poses
a potential hazard to nearby residences or surrounding properties or
improvements. To this end, any telecommunication tower, except exempt
facilities as defined in section
17.42.020 of this chapter, located at a distance of less than one hundred
percent (100%) of its height from a habitable structure, property line, or
other tower shall be designed and maintained to withstand without failure the
maximum forces expected from wind and earthquakes when the tower is fully
loaded with antennas, transmitters and other equipment, and camouflaging.
Initial demonstration of compliance with this requirement shall be provided via
submission of a report to the building official prepared by a structural
engineer licensed by the state of Utah a describing the tower structure,
specifying the number and type of antennas it is designed to accommodate,
providing the basis for the calculations done, and documenting the actual
calculations performed. Proof of ongoing compliance shall be provided via
submission to the city at least every five (5) (self-supporting and guyed
towers)/ten (10) (monopoles) years of an inspection report prepared by a Utah
licensed structural engineer indicating the number and types of antennas and
related equipment actually present and indicating the structural integrity of
the tower. Based on this report, the city may require repair or, if a serious
safety problem exists, removal of the tower. (Ord. 99-26 § 1)
17.42.170: BASIC TOWER AND BUILDING DESIGN:
All telecommunication facilities, except exempt facilities as defined in
section
17.42.020 of this chapter, shall be designed to blend into the surrounding

nonflammable material, unless specifically conditioned by the city to be
otherwise.
   B.   Telecommunication towers taller than thirty five feet (35') shall be
monopole or guyed/lattice towers except where satisfactory evidence is
submitted to the city, as appropriate, that a self-supporting tower is required
to provide the height and/or capacity necessary for the proposed
telecommunication use to minimize the need for screening from adjacent
properties, or to reduce the potential for bird strikes. Maximum height
allowance shall be eight feet (80') except that consideration may be given to
heights up to one hundred twenty feet (120') at the discretion of the city
council.
   C.   Satellite dishes other than microwave dishes shall be of mesh
construction, except where technical evidence is acceptable to the city, as
appropriate, is submitted showing that this is infeasible.
   D.   Telecommunication support facilities (i.e., vaults, equipment rooms,
utilities, and equipment enclosures) shall be constructed out of nonreflective
materials (visible exterior surfaces only) and shall be placed in underground
vaults to all extent possible.
   E.   Telecommunication support facilities in an area of high visibility
shall, where possible, be sited below the ridge line or designed (i.e., placed
underground, depressed, or located behind earth berms) to minimize their
profile.
   F.   All buildings, poles, towers, antenna supports, antennas, and other
components of each telecommunications site shall be initially painted and
thereafter repainted as necessary with a "flat" paint. The color selected shall
be one that in the opinion of the city, is appropriate, to minimize their
visibility to the greatest extent feasible.
   G.   The project description and permit shall include a specific maximum
allowable gross cross sectional area, or silhouette, of the facility. The
silhouette shall be measured from the "worst case" elevation perspective.
   H.   The city shall have the authority to require special design of the
telecommunication facilities where findings of particular sensitivity are made
(e.g., proximity to historic or aesthetically significant structures, views
and/or community features).
   I.   Telecommunication facilities shall ensure that sufficient anticlimbing
measures have been incorporated into the facility, as needed, to reduce
potential for trespass and injury. (Ord. 99-26 § 1)
17.42.180: CRITICAL DISASTER RESPONSE FACILITIES:
   A.   All radio, television and voice communication facilities providing
service to government or the general public shall be designed to survive a

and A5 of this section (fire only) shall be evidenced by a certificate signed
by the public safety director on the building plans submitted.
   C.   Demonstration of compliance with requirements of subsections A3 through
A5 (earthquake only) shall be provided via a second certification on said plans
signed by a structural engineer or other appropriate professional licensed by
the state of Utah. (Ord. 99-26 § 1)
17.42.190: LOCATION:
All telecommunication facilities shall be located so as to minimize their
visibility and the number of distinct facilities present. To this end all of
the following measures shall be implemented for all telecommunications
facilities, except exempt facilities as defined in section
17.42.020 of this chapter:
   A.   No telecommunication facility shall be installed at a location where
special painting or lighting will be required by the FAA regulations unless
technical evidence acceptable to the city, as appropriate, is submitted showing
that this is the only technically feasible location for this facility.
   B.   No telecommunication facility shall be installed on an exposed ridge
line, in or at a location readily visible from Pioneer Parkway, a public trail,
public park or other outdoor recreation area, or in property designated with a
floodway (FW), park or open space (OS) on the Santa Clara general plan, unless
it blends with the surrounding existing natural and manmade environment in such
a manner as to be effectively unnoticeable and a finding is made that no other
location is technically feasible.
   C.   No telecommunication facility that is readily visible from off site
shall be installed closer than one-half (1/2) mile from another readily visible
uncamouflaged or unscreened telecommunication facility unless it is a
collocated facility, situated on a multiple user site, or blends with the
surrounding existing natural and manmade environment in such a manner as to be
effectively unnoticeable; or technical evidence acceptable to the city, as
appropriate, is submitted showing a clear need for this facility and the
infeasibility of collocating it on one of these former sites.
   D.   No telecommunication facility that is readily visible from off site
shall be installed on a site that is not already developed with
telecommunication facilities or other public or quasi-public uses unless it
blends with the surrounding existing natural and manmade environment in such a
manner so as to be effectively unnoticeable or technical evidence acceptable to
the city, as appropriate, is submitted showing a clear need for this facility
and the infeasibility of collocating it on one of these former sites. (Ord. 99-
26 § 1)
17.42.200: HEIGHT DETERMINATION:
The height of a telecommunication tower shall be measured from the natural
undisturbed ground surface below the center of the base of said tower to the
top of the tower itself or, if higher, to the tip of the highest antenna or
piece of equipment attached thereto. In the case of building mounted towers the
height of the tower includes the height of the portion of the building on which
it is mounted. In the case of "crank up" or other similar towers whose height
can be adjusted, the height of the tower shall be the maximum height to which
it is capable of being raised. (Ord. 99-26 § 1)
17.42.210: COLLOCATED AND MULTIPLE USER FACILITIES:
   A.   An analysis shall be prepared by or on behalf of the applicant, subject
to the approval of the decision making body, which identifies all reasonable,
technically feasible, alternative locations and/or facilities which would
provide the proposed telecommunication service. The intention of the
alternatives analysis is to present alternative strategies which would minimize
the number, size, and adverse environmental impacts of facilities necessary to
provide the needed services to the city and surrounding rural and urban areas.
The analysis shall address the potential for collocation at an existing or a
new site and the potential to locate facilities as close as possible to the
intended service area. It shall also explain the rationale for selection of the
proposed site in view of the relative merits of any of the feasible
alternatives. Approval of the project is subject to the decision making body
making a finding that the proposed site results in fewer or less severe
environmental impacts than any feasible alternative site. The city may require
independent verification of this analysis at the applicant's expense.
Facilities which are not proposed to be collocated with another
telecommunication facility shall provide a written explanation why the subject
facility is not a candidate for collocation.
   B.   All collocated and multiple user telecommunication facilities shall be
designed to promote facility and site sharing. To this end telecommunication
towers and necessary appurtenances, including, but not limited to, parking
areas, access roads, utilities and equipment buildings shall be shared by site
users when in the determination of the city, as appropriate, this will minimize
overall visual impact to the community.
   C.   The facility shall make available unutilized space for collocation of
other telecommunication facilities, including space for these entities
providing similar, competing services. A good faith effort in achieving
collocation shall be required of the host entity. Requests for utilization of
facility space and responses to such requests shall be made in a timely manner
and in writing and copies shall be provided to the city's permit files.
Unresolved disputes may be mediated by the planning commission or city council.
Collocation is not required in cases where the addition of the new service or
facilities would cause quality of service impairment to the existing facility
or if it became necessary for the host to go off line for a significant period
of time.
   D.   Approval for the establishment of facilities improved with an existing
microwave band or other public service use or facility, which creates
interference or interference is anticipated as a result of said establishment
of additional facilities, shall include provisions for the relocation of said
existing public use facilities. All costs associated with said relocation shall
be borne by the applicant for the additional facilities. (Ord. 99-26 § 1)

from public areas as well as from private residences. The analysis shall assess
the cumulative impacts of the proposed facility and other existing and
foreseeable telecommunication facilities in the area, and shall identify and
include all feasible mitigation measures consistent with the technological
requirements of the proposed telecommunication service. All costs for the
visual analysis, and applicable administrative costs, shall be borne by the
applicant. (Ord. 99-26 § 1)
17.42.290: NIER EXPOSURE:
   A.   No telecommunication facility shall be sited or operated in such a
manner that it poses, either by itself or in combination with other such
facilities, a potential threat to public health. To that end no
telecommunication facility or combination of facilities shall produce at any
time power densities in any inhabited area as this term is defined in section
17.42.020 of this chapter that exceed the ANSI (American National Standards
Institute) C95.1-1992 standard for human exposure or any more restrictive
standard subsequently adopted or promulgated by the city, county, the state of
Utah, or the federal government.
   B.   Initial compliance with this requirement shall be demonstrated for any
facility within three hundred feet (300') of residential uses or sensitive
receptors such as schools, churches, hospitals, etc. and all broadcast radio
and television facilities, regardless of adjacent land uses, through
submission, at the time of application for the necessary permit or entitlement,
of NIER (nonionizing electromagnetic radiation calculations) specifying NIER
levels in the inhabited area where the levels produced are projected to be
highest. If these calculated NIER levels exceed eighty percent (80%) of the
NIER standard established by this section, the applicant shall hire a qualified
electrical engineer licensed by the state of Utah to measure NIER levels at
said location after the facility is in operation. A report of these
measurements and his/her findings with respect to compliance with the
established NIER standard shall be submitted to the city. Said facility shall
not commence normal operations until it complies with, or has been modified, to
comply with this standard. Proof of said compliance shall be a certification
provided by the engineer who prepared the original report. In order to assure
the objectivity of the analysis, the city may require, at the applicant's
expense, independent verification of the results of the analysis.
   C.   Every telecommunication facility within three hundred feet (300') of an
inhabited area and all broadcast radio and television facilities shall
demonstrate continued compliance with the NIER standard established by this
section. Every five (5) years a report listing each transmitter and antenna
present at the facility and the effective radiated power radiated shall be
submitted to the city. If either the equipment or effective radiated power has
changed, calculations specifying NIER levels in the inhabited areas where said
levels are projected to be highest shall be prepared. NIER calculations shall
also be prepared every time the adopted NIER standard changes. If calculated
levels in either of these cases exceed eighty percent (80%) of the standard
established by this section, the operator of the facility shall hire a
qualified electrical engineer licensed by the state of Utah to measure the
actual NIER levels produced. A report of these calculations, required
measurements, if any, and the author's/engineer's findings with respect to
compliance with the current NIER standard shall be submitted to the city within
five (5) years of facility approval and every five (5) years thereafter. In the
case of a change in the standard, the required report shall be submitted within
ninety (90) days of the date said change becomes effective.
   D.   Failure to supply the required reports or to remain in continued
compliance with the NIER standard established by this section shall be grounds
for revocation of the use permit or other entitlement. (Ord. 99-26 § 1)
17.42.310: EXCEPTIONS:
   A.   Exceptions to the requirements specified within this chapter may be
granted through issuance of a conditional use permit by the planning
commission. Such a permit may only be approved if the planning commission
finds, after receipt of sufficient evidence, that failure to adhere to the
standard under consideration in the specific instance will not increase the
visibility of the facility or decrease public safety.
   B.   An exception to the requirements of sections
17.42.180 and
17.42.250 of this chapter may only be granted upon written concurrence by the
public safety director.
   C.   Tower setback requirements may be waived under any of the following
circumstances:
      1.   The facility is proposed to be collocated onto an existing, legally
established telecommunication tower; and
      2.   Overall, the reduced setback enables further mitigation of adverse
visual and other environmental impacts than would otherwise be possible. (Ord.
99-26 § 1)
17.42.320: PUBLIC NOTICE:
In addition to the public notice required within this chapter, the following
special noticing shall be provided:

or major use permit authorizing the establishment or modification of a
telecommunication facility shall be provided to the operators of all
telecommunication facilities, registered with the city of Santa Clara pursuant

this chapter may appeal the matter to the land use authority. Such appeal shall
be made in writing and filed with the city recorder within fourteen (14)
calendar days of the ruling or interpretation. The city recorder will then

the meeting on the appeal at least ten (10) calendar days prior to the meeting.
The city shall transmit the application and all exhibits therewith to the land
use authority for consideration. For the purposes of this section, a ruling is
a discretionary action, e.g., a minor conditional use permit or a site plan and
architectural review; and, an interpretation refers to the determination of the
intent and application of provisions of this chapter. Application or
enforcement of provisions of this chapter shall not be considered
interpretations or rulings and are not subject to appeal. Notwithstanding this

17.45.100: MASTER SIGN PLANS:
Each business may have multiple permanent signs. These may be awning or canopy,
monument, hanging, wall, or pole style. These permanent signs may not be
printed on pliable material (such as vinyl or cloth); primary signs must be
constructed out of materials of a more permanent and rigid nature. In addition,
each business may be permitted to utilize a number of temporary signs; the
number of which can be used on a regular or rotating basis will be determined
by the commission. All signage must be applied for and presented to the
heritage commission through a master sign plan unless otherwise allowed by this
chapter. The master sign plan must include the number and area of both current
and proposed signage (including temporary signs) and should have a drawing(s),
sketch(es) or photorealistic depiction(s) of the proposed plan to help aid in
reasonably visualizing the proposal. The heritage commission will determine
what can reasonably be permitted giving consideration to street frontage, size
and scale of the building and of the property. Businesses are encouraged to
plan ahead for future signage needs.
   A.   Multiple Tenant Master Sign Plan: Buildings or clusters of buildings
within a project or premises, having more than one tenant or use, shall submit
a master sign plan application for the entire structure or project prior to any
sign permit approval.
      1.   Design: The master sign plan shall be designed to establish a common
theme or design for the entire building, using similar construction methods,
compatible colors, scale, and backgrounds. This is not meant to require
monotony, but to require variety while maintaining compatibility. All
regulations as stated in this chapter shall be addressed in the master sign
plan.
      2.   Master Sign Plans For Office Buildings: Master sign plans for office
buildings must focus primarily on the identification of the building.
Individual tenants may be identified with lettering on exterior windows, doors,
or a building directory.
      3.   Sign Area: Total sign area within the master sign plan is subject to
the size limitations of this chapter. Sign area cannot be transferred to a
single building or facade from other buildings in the project.
      4.   Lighting: Master sign plans shall include the location and fixture
type of all exterior lighting of the proposed signs. The lighting plan shall
comply with the lighting standards as stated in subsection
17.45.110J of this chapter. Lighting fixtures shall be similar in style,
compatible with the architecture and should direct all light onto the sign
surface.
   B.   Advertising Master Sign Plan: Individual business owners who anticipate
the need to change temporary signage frequently are encouraged to submit a
master sign plan for temporary advertising to the city. The purpose of said
plan is to eliminate the need to apply for repetitive sign permits for
temporary signs where such are used on a regular basis.
      1.   Where Permitted: This type of master sign plan is intended for
businesses that have a need to advertise new products for sale (when the
product will be available on a temporary basis) or where the business has
frequent or seasonal sales.
      2.   Permit: A permit shall be issued by the city for the master sign
plan and a fee required by the city. Review and approval of the master sign
plan is required before it may be implemented. Permits for temporary signage
covered under the master sign plan, once approved, will not require further
permits as long as the approved plan is followed. Said plan may be amended from
time to time through the same process. Refer to section
17.45.050 of this chapter for review procedures. Refer to the city general sign
ordinance for standards relative to temporary signs. (Ord. 2015-13)
17.45.110: SIGN STANDARDS:

specified in this section through section
17.45.130 of this chapter. The cumulative sign area per business shall not
exceed one hundred (100) square feet consistent with the master sign plan.
Signage affixed to a building facade may not exceed ten percent (10%) of the
building facade. For double faced signs (where both sides are the same) only
one side shall be counted against the square footage requirements. Nonregulated
signs (except for private plaza signs), murals and umbrella signs are not
included in the cumulative sign area. Signs included as part of a master sign
plan shall be included in the cumulative sign area.
   B.   Area Of Individual Signs: The area of a sign shall include the entire
area within any type of perimeter or border that may enclose the outer limits
of any writing, representation, emblem, figure, or character, exclusive of the
supporting framework.

height of eighteen inches (18"). A single letter which is a signature letter or
logo of the business need not comply with this requirement. For information a
nine inch (9") high letter with clear type will be legible in the historic
district from vehicles passing at thirty (30) miles per hour.
   D.   Location On Building: The location of a sign on a structure or building
has a major impact on the overall architecture of the building. To ensure that
signs enhance this architecture, the following criteria must be met:
      1.   Height: The name of a building or business may be located at the top
of a building wall, but not above the parapet wall or roofline.
      2.   Location: Architectural details of a building often provide an
obvious location, size, or shape for a sign. Wherever possible, applicants
should utilize these features in the placement of signs. See figure 110.1 of
this section.

which it is attached. Signs should not obscure historically significant
architectural details of the building.
   E.   Setback Requirements: Permanent or temporary signs shall not be placed
in the public right of way except as permitted in this chapter.
   F.   Projection And Clearance: No portion of a hanging, projecting, or pole
sign including its support may project more than forty eight inches (48") from
the face of a building or pole. Projecting and hanging signs must maintain at
least eight feet (8') of clearance from ground level. Awning clearances are
covered in section
17.45.120 of this chapter.
   G.   Sign Materials: The sign materials should be compatible with the face
of the building and should be colorfast and resistant to corrosion. Signs may
be made of any durable exterior grade materials so long as the appearance is
compatible with the associated business/building and the historic district.
Wall signs may not be suspended by ropes. Wall signs must be securely fastened
directly to the wall.
   H.   Color: Fluorescent colors are prohibited. Reflective colored materials
that give the appearance of changing color are prohibited.

ornamental wood, brick, stucco covered frames, adobe, or ornamental cast steel
poles. The following materials are examples of acceptable frames for hanging,
projecting and pole signs: rustic wood timbers, ornamental wood, ornamental
cast steel, or wrought iron.
   J.   Illumination: The purpose of regulating sign illumination is to prevent
light trespass, provide clear illumination of signs without causing potential
hazards to pedestrians or vehicles, and to promote the traditional character of
Santa Clara.
      1.   Illumination Types:
         a.   Externally Illuminated Signs: Externally lit signs shall be
illuminated only with steady, stationary, shielded light sources directed
solely onto the sign without causing glare. Light fixtures used for
illuminating a sign shall be simple in form and should not clutter the building
or structure. Light bulbs or lighting tubes should be shielded so as to not be
physically visible from adjacent public rights of way or residential
properties.
         b.   Backlit Letters And Logos: Letters and logos may be lit from
behind as long as the light source is not visible.
      2.   Intensity: The intensity of sign lighting shall not exceed that
necessary to illuminate and make legible a sign from the adjacent travelway or
closest right of way.
      3.   Prohibited Lighting:
         a.   Lights that flash or move in any manner are prohibited.
         b.   Internally illuminated signs which are lit by a light source
located within the sign are not permitted. See figure 110.2 of this section.

(Ord. 2020-10)
17.68.030: PLANNED DEVELOPMENT PROCESS:
   A.   A request for a PDR, PDC, PDO, or PDI zoning designation must include
the following:
      1.   All submittals required under
chapter 17.18 for a zoning amendment;
      2.   A project plan that meets the requirements of subsection C below;
and
      3.   A detailed landscape plan that shows landscaped areas, any areas to
be preserved in their natural state, and any common open space areas.
   B.   The planning commission and city council will consider any request for
a PDR, PDC, PDO, or PDI zoning designation in accordance with
chapter 17.18 and this chapter.
   C.   Project Plan: A project plan is a professionally designed schematic
plan showing the layout of the development and associated text. The applicant
shall submit the project plan in digital format and submit twelve (12) hard
copies of the plan, ten (10) of which must be eleven inches by seventeen inches
(11" X 17"), and two (2) copies must be twenty four inches by thirty six inches
(24" x 36"). The plan must include the following elements:
      1.   The boundary of the project property;
      2.   Phase boundaries (if applicable) and acreage associated with each
phase;
      3.   Total project site area and area by type of land use;
      4.   Proposed land uses including square footage or acreage and
percentage of each component;
      5.   The number of residential units and/or square footage of floor area
of nonresidential uses by type;
      6.   Density of uses within each land use component or phase using units
per acre for residential uses and floor area ratio (FAR) for nonresidential
components;
      7.   Proposed vehicular and pedestrian circulation plan including
entrances and exits and connections to vehicular and pedestrian facilities
external to the project property. The project should have primarily public
roadways, but private roadways may be approved by the city council in limited
circumstances;
      8.   Existing natural features of the site including rivers, lakes,
ponds, streams, wetlands, steep slopes, mature trees, and tree stands,
topography at contour intervals of two feet (2'), and other natural features;
      9.   Square footage or acreage and percentage of open space as a part of
the total project;
      10.   Show where common open space will be provided and limits on
accessibility;
      11.   Typical elevations; and
      12.   If only one phase of the project is proposed, a preliminary plat
that conforms to
chapter 16.16.
   D.   Preliminary Plats: For any planned development that will be subdivided,
the applicant may submit a preliminary plat at the same time as the zone-change
application for the planned development. To be considered for concurrent
review, the application must include all preliminary plat requirements set
forth in
chapter 16.16. A preliminary or final plat may not be approved in any planned
development zone unless the plat is consistent with the approved project plan.
The city council may allow exceptions to city standards and subdivision
requirements relating to roadway design standards and layout, but only if the
exceptions are supported by adequate studies and approved with the project
plan. If any part of this chapter conflicts with any part of the subdivision
ordinance, this chapter controls.
   E.   Detailed Site Plan: The applicant shall submit a detailed site plan for
any individual lot other than single-family lots. The planning commission
considers any request for site plan review of a lot in any planned development.
The planning commission may not approve a site plan unless it is consistent
with the approved project plan. A request for site plan review must include a
digital copy and ten (10) site development plans, of which one set must be in
color. A site plan submittal shall include, in addition to the requirements for
all other site plans, the following items:
      1.   A plan showing how the lot relates to the plat including previously
developed sites in the project, the location, required open space, ingress, and
egress to the lot from the rest of the phase and other adjacent land;
      2.   Location of building(s); and
      3.   Typical elevations.
   F.   Other Data Or Information: An applicant who has requested a PDR, PDC,
PDO, or PDI zoning designation shall provide any additional information,
detail, or analysis requested by the planning commission or city council at any
point in the zone change process. The city council may deny a request for a
PDR, PDC, PDO, or PDI zoning designation if the city council determines, in its
sole discretion, that it does not have adequate information, detail, or
analysis to approve a zone change request.
   G.   Subsequent Land Use Approvals: The city shall not approve any land use
entitlement or permit for property within an approved project plan area unless
the entitlement or permit is consistent with the approved project plan and any
conditions to the city council's approval of the project plan. Property in an
approved project plan area shall not be used in any manner that is inconsistent
with the approved project plan.
   H.   General Plan: An applicant that has a master plan for development is
encouraged to seek a general plan amendment to incorporate the applicant's
master plan into the general plan. (Ord. 2020-10)
17.68.040: PLANNED DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   The following landscaping requirements apply in the PDR zone:
      1.   Entry points to the development shall be landscaped using plant
specimens used throughout the development.
      2.   Landscaping shall be provided adjacent to all buildings and
structures including solid waste receptacles.
      3.   Landscaping shall be provided in all front setback areas along
streets, whether the streets are public or private.
   B.   Common Open Space Standards and Requirements for Residential
Development: This subsection B applies only in a PDR zone and in any
residential component in any other planned development. This subsection B does
not apply to nonresidential development, lots, or buildings.
      1.   Definitions: "Common open space" under this chapter is defined as a
portion of a project or development that is accessible by all residents in the
development and provides scenic, recreational, resting, or similar purposes.
Common open space may include gathering places, recreation areas, natural
areas, and other similar areas. Common open space should, in general, be
available for entry and use by the residents of the development with which it
is associated. Common open space does not include any parking area, any area
where a charge is made for use (except for a fifty percent (50%) common open
space credit as provided in subsection B2 below), or any area to which access
is limited due to runoff, such as retention basins or areas with steep slopes
or similarly difficult terrain if determined by the city council to be
similarly restrictive.
      2.   Common Open Space Requirement: At least thirty percent (30%) of a
project area must be common open space. The following natural areas do not
count toward the fulfillment of the common open space requirement: an area with
a slope of thirty percent (30%) or more, any area within a federally designated
floodway, and any wetland area. Up to fifty percent (50%) of the land in a
public golf course within a development may be credited toward the minimum
common open space required in this subsection.
   C.   Nonresidential Standards And Requirements: The following requirements
apply to nonresidential components of any PD zone:
      1.   Location: Location of commercial phases or service uses shall be
concentrated for maximum pedestrian convenience and located for easy
accessibility by any residents of the zone, workers within the zone, and
visitors.
      2.   Common Walls: Common walls between residential and nonresidential
uses should be constructed to minimize noise transmission.
      3.   Nuisances: No commercial use may expose residential uses to
offensive odors, dust, electrical interface, and/or vibration.
      4.   Outdoor Lighting: All outdoor lighting shall not adversely impact
surrounding residential uses. Lighting shall not be directed toward residential
units and shall not include lighting that blinks, flashes, oscillates, or is of
unusual brightness or intensity. Outdoor lighting shall be directed downward
unless otherwise approved.
      5.   Building Design: The city requires buildings that have architectural
interest and strong curb appeal. The design guidelines in this section are
imposed to achieve this objective. All sides of a commercial building that are
visible from any public street or adjacent residential zone shall include a
combination of at least two (2) of the following exterior finishing materials:
masonry, decorative wood, stone, stucco, cinder block, metal panels, Masonite,
or other exterior finishing that is approved as part of the project plan. The
rear and sides of a building shall be finished similarly to the front of the
building. Unfinished concrete, plywood, and vinyl siding are discouraged
finishes for commercial buildings. Where feasible, building setbacks should be
varied. In addition, each commercial building must include the following:
         a.   Features such as trellises or awnings to provide shadows at
ground level;
         b.   Variations in rooflines, belt courses, and trim colors;
         c.   Recessed windows and doors; and
         d.   Exterior landscaping along storefront areas.
      6.   Density And Minimum Square Feet: The maximum density for any
residential component within a PDC zone is twelve (12) dwelling units per acre
for horizontal mixed-use projects. For projects with vertical mixed-use (i.e.,
residential and commercial combined in the same building), the density shall be
as approved by the Planning Commission and City Council as part of the project
plan review and approval, and subject to the development standards in this
chapter. Each dwelling unit within a vertical mixed-use building must have at
least four hundred fifty (450) square feet of living area on its main floor.
      7.   Landscaping:
         a.   The entire area along the public street frontage between the
street curb and setback line shall be landscaped. This landscape area may
include a sidewalk and a driveway crossing the landscape strip when part of the
site plan approved by the city. On a corner lot, both street frontages shall be
landscaped.
         b.   Notwithstanding the requirement stated in subsection C7a above,
the city council may approve a reduced landscape strip of no less than ten feet
(10') in width, provided that the city council determines that the additional
landscaping elsewhere on the site (including any landscaping that is provided
in fulfillment of subsection C7c below) compensates for reduced landscaping
within the front setback area.
         c.   If a parking lot includes thirty (30) or more off-street parking
spaces, at least five percent (5%) of the parking lot area shall contain
interior parking lot landscaping. This requirement applies without regard to
the location of lot lines so that when a parking lot with thirty (30) or more
off-street parking spaces is fully constructed, including one that allows for
shared parking, the total parking lot area will have at least the five percent
(5%) landscaping required by this section. Shade trees shall be planted in
parking areas to reduce the "heat island" effect and provide aesthetic beauty
to the site. Interior parking lot landscape requirements may be met using
terminal islands, divider medians, or landscaping on the perimeter of the
parking lot.
      8.   Parking:
         a.   Conflict Between Provisions: If there is a conflict between the
provisions of
chapter 17.32 and this section, the more restrictive provision shall govern.
         b.   Shared Parking: A shared parking plan may be submitted that
indicates a shared parking formula and supporting information. Up to thirty
percent (30%) of total combined required parking may be waived with an approved
shared parking plan.
         c.   Location Of Parking: Parking should be located to the rear, a
mixture of side and rear, or underground.
         d.   Illumination Of Parking: All parking areas shall be illuminated
with light that is focused down and light fixtures that will not create a
nuisance to other uses within the PD development or to uses near the PD
development.
   D.   Ownership And Management Standards And Requirements:
      1.   Ownership And Management Control:
         a.   Initial Ownership: If the property located in a planned
development will be owned individually or jointly, where the property is not
intended to be resold in separate parcels, the property shall be made subject
to permanent covenants, conditions and restrictions requiring that the property
be built and operated consistent with the approved planned development zone.
         b.   Subdivided Properties: Properties in a planned development zone
that are intended to be subdivided and sold in separate ownership shall be made
subject to covenants, conditions and restrictions which shall require that the
property be built and maintained consistent with the requirements of the
planned development zone for the property. If the property will have commonly
owned properties, they shall be owned by an appropriate owners' association
that shall be responsible for the ownership and maintenance of the project,
consistent with the requirements of the zone. In this event, the owners'
association shall be separately incorporated as a Utah nonprofit corporation
with appropriate articles of incorporation and bylaws, and a declaration of
covenants, conditions and restrictions that are subject to the approval of the
city attorney of the city of Santa Clara as being legally sufficient. If the
property will be a condominium project, the property shall be made subject to a
declaration of condominium and other documentation prepared pursuant to the
requirements of the Utah Condominium Act and shall include a provision that the
owners' association thereof shall manage the property consistent with the
requirements of the planned development zone.
         c.   Owner/Developer Responsibilities: Initial owners/developers of PD
projects are responsible for the following elements of the project:
            (1)   Development And Maintenance: Development and maintenance of
general common areas (this may be accomplished through the establishment of an
owners' association which the developer shall agree to subsidize until seventy
five percent (75%) of the lots or units are sold). In the case of
condominiumization or subdivision of the property, the developer shall deed the
common areas to the owners' association, free and clear of all money liens or
encumbrances, or in the case of a blanket lien, the lender shall subordinate
its security interest in the project to the planned unit development or
condominium plan. This shall be accomplished by covenant in the declaration of
covenants, conditions and restrictions (or declaration of condominium, as the
case may be) that shall require this to be accomplished upon completion of
construction of the project, provided that if at least forty percent (40%) of
the units in the project have been sold, the developer shall also be required
to make this conveyance. The city of Santa Clara shall not be responsible to
the unit or lot owners for this, but the documentation shall provide for this
as a matter of requirement in the documentation, which shall confer upon any
purchasing unit owners the right to enforce the deeding of the common areas as
required just above.
            (2)   Arterials, Roadways, Related Infrastructures: Development of
arterial and other major roadways and related infrastructures serving the
development including the extension of utilities to serve the development.
            (3)   Development Of Management Plan: Development of the management
plan including management association setup, and related responsibilities to
assure that ownership and management standards are met in full.
            (4)   Approvals And Conditions: All approvals and conditions
therefrom received related to the PD and its elements.
            (5)   Landscaping And Open Space: All overall requirements such as
landscaping and open space meet PD requirements.
            (6)   Change Of Ownership: Any conditions attached to an approved
PD plan or subdivision plat shall not lapse or be waived as a result of any
subsequent change in tenancy or ownership of said land.
   E.   Mixed Uses: The minimum and maximum component of each use and type of
mixed use within a development shall be as recommended by the planning
commission and approved by the city council.
   F.   A proposed accessory retail use in a PDQ zone must be clearly
subordinate to the principal use.
   G.   Gated Communities: No gated communities are permitted in any planned
development zone.
   H.   Density Equivalency For Assisted Living and/or Independent Care
Facilities:
      1.   For living units wherein each unit has its own cooking facilities,
each such unit shall be considered as equivalent to a standard residential
dwelling unit for the purpose of calculating the facility’s overall density.
      2.   For living units without their own cooking facilities (i.e., where
meals are primarily served at, or delivered to each unit from, a central dining
facility two (2) of such units shall be considered the equivalent of one (1)
standard residential dwelling unit for the purpose of calculating the
facility’s overall density.
      3.   For purposes of this regulation, if a unit has only a microwave, a
small capacity refrigerator, a sink, or some combination of the three, such
amenities will not be considered “cooking facilities”, provided meals for the
residents of such unit are primarily served at, or delivered to each unit from
a central dining facility. (Ord. 2020-10: Ord. 2004-36: Ord. 2021-09)
17.68.050: PDR ZONE DENSITY BONUS CRITERIA AND LIMITATIONS:
   A.   The base maximum density for the PDR zone is eight (8) du/acre.
   B.   The city council, after receiving a recommendation from the planning
commission, may approve a density bonus of up to four (4) du/acre, for a total
of up to twelve (12) du/acre, based on the following criteria:
      1.   Exceptional Building Design And Materials: The building elevations
shall show variation in roof height, variation in the building footprint, and
building features that improve visual interest by the use of balconies, patios,
roof overhang, and use of varied colors and textures. Exterior building
materials consisting primarily of brick, stone, or stucco. On the front
elevation and also street side elevation for corner lots, stucco may not exceed
fifty percent (50%) of the wall area, not including windows. Wood, metal, or
hardy board may be used for accents. Roofing materials shall be durable such as
tile, slate, or similar material (not asphalt shingles).
      2.   Site Design: Site design shall provide for compatibility with any
adjacent residential areas. Site design shall emphasize overall project
aesthetics, with scattered parking areas rather than large asphalt areas,
masonry walls on the perimeter where walls are required, and blending building
heights to adjacent residential buildings.
      3.   Landscaping: Landscape design shall incorporate water conservation
principles while providing suitable trees, shrubs, and ground covers throughout
the project. The landscape plan shall describe both the type of plant materials
used and the initial plant container size. Trees shall be planted throughout
the project site at approximately one tree per five hundred (500) square feet
of landscaped area.
      4.   Project Amenities: Project amenities include recreational facilities
such as tennis courts, playground equipment, swimming pool, clubhouse, and
other common amenities such as outdoor cooking/eating areas, gazebo, or
gardens. Based on the project size, a development should have one or more
significant project amenities. Each unit should have some form of private
outdoor space in the form of balconies or patios.
   C.   An apartment project is limited to thirty (30) dwelling units per
project unless the proposed project is a senior housing project with half or
more of the units designed for single occupancy, or is an affordable housing
project meeting the criteria for federal tax credits, or similar state or local
affordable housing criteria, and is approved for such credits prior to
beginning construction. (Ord. 2020-10: Ord. 2015-17; Ord. 2021-12, 9-8-2021)

   B.   Density: Land used for common open space, interior streets, drives,
sidewalks, and other circulation ways may be included as part of the land area
used for determining the number of dwelling units allowed, or the amount of
required land. Land characterized by floodway, steep slopes, wetlands, or other
unbuildable or sensitive lands may not be included as part of the land area for
density calculations, except that a twenty five percent (25%) density provision
may be applied to the buildable portion of the development. Therefore, twenty
five percent (25%) of the land area of the unbuildable area may be added to the
buildable portion of the property to increase net density. Density is
calculated for the project and for individual phases. Within phases, density
for a specific phase may exceed that permitted provided that the overall
density for the project meets the required maximum density. The phase with the
highest density may not be the first phase developed.
   C.   Where a sidewalk and a driveway are located in the same setback of a
dwelling, the garage setback shall be a minimum of twenty feet (20') from the
back edge of the sidewalk to the garage. Where no sidewalk is located in the
setback, or where a side entry garage has a minimum twenty foot (20') long
driveway from the back edge of the sidewalk, the garage setback shall be the
same as required for the dwelling unit.
   D.   The setback and height minimums and maximums listed in this section are
intended to guide the planning commission, the city council, and the project
developer in reviewing the standard requirements for development throughout the
city. The city council, after receiving a recommendation from the planning
commission, may adopt modifications to the above specifications to provide
harmony within a PD zone and as may be requested by the developer. Items of a
life/safety nature (i.e., building separation as per fire code, and building
code requirements) may not be modified. However, other elements of the plan may
be approved according to the specific development plan, map, and text being
considered as a part of the PD zone change approval. (Ord. 2020-10: Ord. 2017-

17.74.010: PURPOSE:
The purpose of the Historic District/Mixed Use Zone is:
   A.   Santa Clara has a strong historical background. There is a special
character about the early pioneer homes that were constructed along, and near
Santa Clara Drive that the city wants to maintain and preserve. Many of these
early pioneer homes are already listed on the State and national list of
historic places. The city has previously created a Historic District from east
to west along Santa Clara Drive. Development that takes place in the Historic
District will be subject to architectural design review and careful site plan
review by the Heritage Commission, Planning Commission, and City Council.
   B.   Santa Clara City has adopted Historic District Design Guidelines that
are intended to be a companion document to Chapters
17.74 and
17.76 of city code. The design guidelines are intended to promote sensitive
design. The design guidelines provide a framework to create an environment that
respects the special setting of the Santa Clara Historic District. All
commercial and residential buildings within the Historic Districts shall be
compatible with both the visual qualities of the immediate area in which the
property is located, as well as the overall context of the Historic District.
   C.   To encourage the continued use, maintenance and special character of
homes and businesses in the Historic District, this chapter contains provisions
allowing for the mixed use of land for residential and commercial uses. The
intent of these provisions is to encourage flexibility and creativity in the
design and development of comprehensively planned mixed use of property that
would not be possible under conventional zoning districts. Some of the specific
purposes of this zone are to:
      1.   Encourage residential uses in conjunction with commercial and other
compatible activities to create an active street life, enhance the vitality of
businesses, reduce vehicular traffic, and maintain the special character of the
Historic District;
      2.   Encourage orderly, planned development of mixed-use developments in
the Historic District by providing procedures for plan review and approval;
      3.   Assure compatibility of proposed land uses with surrounding historic
uses by incorporating higher standards designed specifically for the Historic
District;
      4.   Strengthen the City's economic base and to provide linkages between
employment opportunities and housing;
      5.   Encourage open space to function for the general benefit of the
City;
      6.   Encourage and provide for non-vehicular circulation linking
developed areas, open spaces and public facilities;
      7.   Promote the reuse of existing historic structures for the purpose of
stabilizing and improving property values;
      8.   Foster civic pride in the beauty, history, and accomplishments of
the past;
      9.   Protect and enhance the City's attractions for tourists and
visitors; and
      10.   Strengthen and help diversify the economic well-being of the City
and promote the use of historical-cultural landmarks for education, pleasure,
and the welfare of the community. (Ord. 2024-12: Ord. 2022-22: Ord. 2017-14:

   A.   It is the intent of the city to encourage creative design. Existing
historical dwellings and buildings may be preserved and enhanced with
commercial, residential, or mixed uses.
   B.   Open spaces and outdoor living areas are encouraged. Lack of such areas
may be the basis for denial of a zone change request. Circulation between
developments in the Historic District is encouraged. Visitors to the area
should be encouraged to visit, park, walk between developments, and enjoy the
time spent in a quiet and relaxing atmosphere. Public access to open space
areas will also be considered in approving the Development Plan.
   C.   Cooperation between property owners on adjacent properties is strongly
encouraged.
   D.   In any zone in which residential dwellings or dwelling units are
permitted, portable or mobile recreational units such as campers, travel
trailers, fifth wheel trailers, tent trailers, tents or any other type of
recreational, mobile or portable housing unit ("recreational housing unit") are
not permitted for housing use, except that such a unit may be used to house
guests of the primary dwelling for up to eight (8) days in any calendar month
without being in violation of this title subject to the following conditions:
      1.   No recreational housing unit may be located on any street or other
part of a public right-of-way, except for temporary loading and unloading of
such unit but not to exceed forty-eight (48) hours.
      2.   A recreational housing unit may be in the side or rear yard of the
permanent residential dwelling.
      3.   The use of such recreational housing unit shall not cause unusual
noise, require additional automobile parking, or other problems to adjacent
neighbors.
      4.   No recreational housing unit shall be permitted on any property that
does not contain a dwelling or dwelling unit located on the property.
      5.   Where an unusual health related hardship exists for an extended
family member of the principal dwelling unit, the Planning Manager or designee
may grant a time extension beyond the eight (8) daytime limit for occupancy of
the recreational housing unit. However, any time extension beyond sixty (60)
days shall require the approval of the City Council. (Ord. 2024-12: Ord. 2022-

site plan review. Some access drives may be approved as being temporary until
such time as additional properties in an area are changed to this zone.
All other requirements of
chapter 17.36, "Motor Vehicle Access and Loading", of this title, will be
reviewed as part of the site plan review and exceptions to the requirements may
be made as indicated above to the extent that such exceptions will enhance the
overall development of the property and will not compromise the health, safety,
and welfare of the public. (Ord. 2024-12: Ord. 2022-22: Ord. 2004-01 § 2)

for every two hundred fifty (250) square feet of commercial floor area and two
(2) spaces, one (1) of which shall be covered, for each residential dwelling.
   A.   The Planning Commission may use the additional requirements of
chapter 17.32, "Off Street Parking Requirements", of this title, but shall
determine the number of spaces required based upon the plan submitted, and the
type of use proposed. Shared parking between adjacent parcels is encouraged,
and excessive parking shall be avoided. Parking should be located to the side
or behind a building, where its visual impact will be minimized.
   B.   Exceptions to the parking requirements contained in
Chapter 17.32 of city code may be considered on a case-by-case basis to promote
compatibility with the character of the Historic District. The property owner/
developer will be required to submit technical information done by a licensed
professional that justifies any requested exception.
   C.   All access drives shall be approved as part of the site plan approval.
Reduced widths of driveways will be considered on an individual site plan
basis. Curb cuts, driveways, and off-street parking shall be carefully designed
to protect the historic character of the district.
   D.   All driveways and parking areas, unless determined to be temporary in
nature, shall be surrounded by a concrete curb or other appropriate material as
approved with the Site Plan. Surface of parking areas may be as approved by the
Planning Commission. (Ord. 2024-12: Ord. 2022-22: Ord. 2017-14: Ord. 2004-01 §

An application to rezone property to the Historic District/Mixed Use (HD/MU)
Zone shall be made in the same manner as a zone change to any other zone in the
City. An application shall be filled out in the City office requesting the zone
change. After paying all fees, and submitting all information required by this
chapter, or by other chapters of the zoning ordinance where applicable, the
zone change will be processed by the city.
Where zoning requests are tied to a parcel of property upon which is located an
existing dwelling unit, all requests shall be considered based on creatively
maintaining, enhancing and preserving the historical character of the original
dwelling as a part of the approved zone change. (Ord. 2024-12: Ord. 2022-22:

17.74.140: PLAN APPROVAL:
After review of the proposed site plan and following receipt of any
recommendations of the TRC and Heritage Commission, the Planning Commission may
recommend the site plan as submitted, or as may be amended because of site plan
review, to the City Council for final review and approval. Following action by
the City Council, the applicant may request permits for the development to be
issued by the Building Department. Upon City Council approval, the development
project shall be diligently pursued to final completion.
On the date the site plan and zoning are approved by the City Council, all
conditions and requirements attached to that approval are binding on the
property unless an amendment is approved. All subsequent development and use of
the property shall be in accordance with the approved plan. If a subdivision
was a part of the application, the effect of approval will also result in an
approved preliminary plat. The requirements for final subdivision approval and
recording shall be met by complying with all requirements of the City
subdivision ordinance prior to any development taking place on the property.
The rezoning of property, along with the approval of a site-specific
development plan for the property so zoned, shall run with the land. Any
subsequent owner will be bound by the same plans and requirements as originally
approved unless the specific plans are subsequently amended by the Planning
Commission and City Council. (Ord. 2024-12: Ord. 2022-22: Ord. 2017-14: Ord.

CHAPTER 17.80
HP HILLSIDE PROTECTION OVERLAY ZONE
SECTION:
17.80.010: Purpose And Intent
17.80.020: Applicability
17.80.030: Application Procedure
17.80.040: Development Standards
17.80.050: Hillside Review Board
17.80.060: Definitions
17.80.010: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
   A.   Purpose: The city finds that the health, safety, and general public
welfare of the current and future residents of the city and the fiscal health
of the city will be promoted by establishing standards for the development and
grading on hillsides and slope areas wherever development is proposed to be
located in the city. The purpose of the HP hillside protection overlay zone is
to minimize soil and slope instability and erosion, to minimize the adverse
effects of grading, to minimize surface and subsurface water problems, preserve
the character and aesthetics of the city's developed and undeveloped hillsides
and to otherwise supplement and amplify the city subdivision and zoning
ordinances while protecting and preserving significant scenic resources for the
long term benefit of Santa Clara City as a whole. This is facilitated by
establishing a hillside review board (HRB) as a recommending body to staff, the
planning commission and the city council. The HRB will review proposed projects
in the HP zone based on this chapter. Additionally, the purpose of this HP zone
is to further the goals and policies of the general plan in relation to land
use, densities, open space and community image.
   B.   Intent: The standards set forth herein are intended to achieve the
following objectives:
      1.   Minimize adverse soil and slope instability; decrease the potential
for erosion; prohibit activities and uses which would result in the degradation
of fragile soils and steep slopes.
      2.   Protect and preserve the visual resources which are of significant
value to the community. Such resources include, but are not limited to, major
hillsides, hilltops, ridges and ridgelines, knolls, mesas, cuestas and
escarpments, boulder outcroppings and large boulders, canyons and natural
drainage areas, and other areas of historical or visual significance. Retain
the integrity of significant on site and off site views to or from these
resources.
      3.   Minimize the adverse effects of grading and cut and fill operations;
avoid highly visible scarring of hillsides and protect natural vegetation,
sensitive hydrologic features including both surface and subsurface water, and
visually prominent landforms.
      4.   Discourage mass grading and terracing of large pads but permit
flexibility for reasonable development practices as appropriate.
      5.   Establish a hillside development process that requires applicants to
select suitable development sites on their property through the use of slope
calculations, maximum land holding capacity, or development agreements to
determine the appropriate density, intensity, design and location of structures
and improvements.
      6.   Provide hillside development standards and guidelines that maximize
the positive impacts of site sensitive design, grading, landscape architecture
and building architecture that will protect the inherent scenic value in the
proposed projects subject to this chapter.
      7.   Permit the flexibility to modify or remove relatively small
topographic features which have slopes distinctly different from surrounding
property in order to facilitate reasonably efficient development in a
particular area. The exclusion of such features or areas shall not be contrary
to the overall purpose of this chapter.
      8.   Encourage the appropriate location, design and development of
proposed projects which provide enhanced human enjoyment, while protecting
people and property from hazardous conditions including rockfalls, rolling
boulders, unstable slopes, landslides, mudslides, and erosion.
      9.   Minimize the impacts of development to the surrounding natural
environment by controlling the location, intensity, pattern, design,
construction techniques, and materials of development.
      10.   Provide for the ongoing upkeep and maintenance of all projects
approved within the hillside protection overlay zone.
      11.   Prohibit development of uses which would likely result in an
especially risky or hazardous situation (peril, jeopardy, or to expose to
danger) due to slope instability, rockfalls, excessive soil erosion, expansive
soils, surface water problems or subsurface water problems.
      12.   Prohibit building in areas in which geologic hazards cannot
reasonably be mitigated to a generally acceptable level.
      13.   Encourage the city and owners to work together on homesites in
existing subdivisions to allow building so long as it can be done safely.
      14.   Notwithstanding the above, the city council may grant a variance to
allow building in any situation where a reliable taking analysis performed by
the city attorney reveals that there is good cause for the property owner to
assert that the city is taking all, or substantially all, of the value of the
property being developed and that competent engineering, approved by the city
engineer, reveals that the property will be graded and built upon safely. In
the event that the affected landowner shall not be satisfied with the taking
analysis, the landowner may seek the opinion of the state of Utah property
ombudsman, which the city council will then consider in making its decision on
the variance. (Ord. 2008-14)
17.80.020: APPLICABILITY:
The standards, guidelines and procedures established by this chapter shall
apply to all lands lying within the hillside protection overlay zone as
delineated in exhibit A attached to the ordinance codified herein or in rare
cases in other areas deemed to meet the intent of this chapter by the city
staff due to slopes greater than fifteen percent (15%). In addition, all
properties seeking annexation or preapproval of projects pending annexation to
the city will be evaluated according to the standards and procedures outlined
in this chapter.
   A.   HP Hillside Protection Overlay Zone: The HP zone is delineated in the
hillside protection overlay zone exhibit attached to the ordinance codified
herein. The HP zone established by this chapter shall overlay the existing
zoning classifications listed in this title. In cases of conflict between the
provisions of this chapter and other established regulations, the most
restrictive provisions shall apply. Lands located within the HP zone are
encouraged to apply for planned development (PD) zoning to discourage hillsides
from being disturbed and encourage clustering of development on land more
suitable for development.
   B.   Hillside Classification Standards: Each slope category range delineates
the relative suitability of land for development.
      1.   The slope categories are described as follows:
         a.   Zero percent (0%) to fifteen percent (15%); flat to gently
rolling land: Development with grading is permitted in this zone. These areas
are still subject to the requirements of the excavation and grading permit
requirements of the applicable building code.
         b.   15.01 percent to twenty five percent (25%); moderate hillside:
Special hillside architectural and design techniques that minimize grading and
harmonize the built and natural environments are required in this zone.
Architectural prototypes and infrastructure elements are expected to complement
the natural landform by using techniques required herein. Impact of streets and
trails is to be minimized by following natural contours where practicable.
         c.   25.01 percent to thirty percent (30%); hillside: Development
within this zone shall be restricted to slopes where it can be demonstrated
with sufficient evidence to the HRB that slopes are safe and that environmental
and aesthetic impacts can be minimized. The use of larger lots, variable
setbacks, and variable building structural techniques such as stepped or pole
foundations are expected. Structures shall blend with the natural environment
through their shape, materials, and colors. Impact of streets and trails is to
be minimized by following natural contours where practicable.
         d.   30.01 percent to forty percent (40%); steep hillside: This is a
sensitive slope condition and development is limited unless a specific
exception is allowed by the city council as outlined in this chapter.
         e.   Greater than forty percent (40%); mountainous: This is a severe
slope condition and development is prohibited unless a specific exception is
allowed by the city council as outlined in this chapter.
      2.   Restrictions on potential development apply to the hillside
protection overlay zone in order to preserve the character of the natural
terrain as much as possible. The following provisions shall be applied to

facilities.
            (2)   Design Of Lot To Address Drainage: Each lot or parcel shall
be designed in such a manner that stormwater or nuisance water shall not
adversely impact other properties in the area. Property development shall not
unnecessarily cause a natural drainage channel to be filled in, obstructed or
diverted. When modification to a natural drainage channel is proposed within
the development, such changes will be addressed in the drainage study and shown
on the improvement plans, and the developer may be required to dedicate rights
of way or record drainage easements for structures and/or improvements needed
to carry storm runoff in the event approval is given for the proposed
modifications.
            (3)   Drainage Systems Separate From Sanitary Sewer System: All
drainage systems shall be separate and independent from the sanitary sewer
system.
            (4)   Drainage And Flood Control Design: Drainage and flood control
shall be designed in conformance with applicable city and state drainage, flood

stormwater from a 100-year frequency storm event onto streets or stormwater
drainage easements without creating flood hazards to dwellings.
            (5)   Underground Pipe System: If an underground pipe system is
required, it shall be designed to meet Santa Clara City standards and generally
accepted engineering criteria. Major hydraulic structures shall be designed to
carry a 100-year storm minimum. The minimum storm drain size shall be twelve
inches (12").
            (6)   Detention: Detention shall be considered where it is suitable
as confirmed by all required reports. Detention basins shall be used for the
purpose of eliminating the effects of the peak runoff of storms and releasing
water flow at the preproject, or approved, rate.
            (7)   Protection To Lower Lots: Water from precipitation and/or
irrigation must be contained within the lot boundaries, or piped to appropriate
drainage systems designed to safely transmit it to safe disposal. Water stored
on the lot must not create unsafe slope conditions from soil saturation or
erosion. A conceptual plan for all drainage shall be provided.
         c.   Improvement Plans: These plans shall show any existing and
proposed buildings or structures and cross sections of the areas where they are
or will be located, and all proposed roads, utilities, easements and drainage
channels on the property where the work is to be performed. Also, the location
of any buildings or structures on adjacent property which may be affected by
grading operations shall be shown. All retaining structures shall be shown with
location, height, construction type and any other details needed.

practice of geotechnical engineering shall prepare the geotechnical report. The
geotechnical report shall include the following:
            (1)   Conditions And Features: A general description of the
topography, drainage conditions and surface vegetation. The report shall
include surface features such as rock outcroppings, existing structures,
debris, and unstable or wet conditions.
            (2)   Location Map: A location map showing the footprints of the
planned improvements and the exploration locations with elevations.
            (3)   Subsurface Condition Evaluation: An evaluation of the
subsurface conditions, including a complete record of the explorations,
laboratory test results, and the elevation of the water table, if encountered.
            (4)   Potential Geotechnical Constraints: Identification of
potential geotechnical constraints on the project site (such as expansive rock
and soil, collapsible soil, shallow bedrock and caliche, gypsiferous rock and
soil, potentially unstable rock or soil units, shallow ground water, and
windblown sand), and recommendations for their mitigation.
            (5)   Springs And Seeps: The locations of any springs and seeps on
the project site, and recommendations concerning the effects of the springs and
seeps on the proposed development.
            (6)   Geotechnical Recommendations: Specific geotechnical
recommendations for the design and construction of the proposed project, which
shall include the following:
               (A)   A general assessment of the requirements needing to be met
to develop the proposed site.
               (B)   Site preparation and grading, and the suitability of the
on site soils for use as structural fill.
               (C)   Stable cut and fill slopes, including recommendations
concerning the effects of material removal and the introduction of water, both
on and off site.
               (D)   Recommendations for foundation type and design criteria,
including, but not limited to, bearing capacity of natural or compacted soils,
provisions to mitigate the effects of expansive, compressible or collapsible
soils, differential settlement and varying soil strength, and the effects of
adjacent loads.
               (E)   Anticipated total and differential settlement.
               (F)   Special design and construction considerations, as
necessary, such as the excavation and replacement of unsuitable materials,
excavation difficulties, stabilization, or special foundation provisions for
problem soil conditions.
               (G)   Design criteria for restrained and unrestrained retaining
walls.
               (H)   Soil corrosion.
               (I)   Moisture protection and surface drainage.
            (7)   Design Recommendations For Walls And Fill Slopes: Detailed
design recommendations for any planned rockery walls, mechanically stabilized
earth (MSE) walls, and/or reinforced fill slopes.
            (8)   Slope Stability Analysis: A detailed slope stability analysis
may be required if potentially unstable rock or soil units or slope creep has
been identified on the site. The analysis should include, but not be limited
to, a determination of shear strength and in some instances residual shear
strength, soil saturation, and treatment methods required to provide a minimum
safety factor of 1.5 for any slope within the project boundary.
            (9)   Risk Factors: The HRB shall use their best judgment when
requested by city staff in determining risk factors for all proposals under the
jurisdiction of the hillside protection overlay zone. Risk factors will be
assessed using a scale of from 1 (very low risk) to 10 (extreme risk).
Development where risk factors (see below) are rated 9 (very high risk) or 10
(extreme risk) and where grading is proposed shall apply geotechnical solution
to increase ground stability by at least fifty percent (50%) above existing
conditions. Furthermore any property proposed for development with a risk
factor of 9 (very high risk) or 10 (extreme risk) shall provide the city with
an extended warranty bond for a period of two (2) years for all public
improvements.
The HRB will make a recommendation when requested by city staff for assigning
risk factors to each proposal as circumstances warrant in order to ensure the
present and future health, welfare, and safety of residents of Santa Clara. In
the absence of other compelling risk factors the following criteria should be
used within the hillside protection overlay zone to assess risk:
Low (risk factor 1-5): No risk factors present other than slope.
Moderate (risk factor 6-7): Fat (blue) clay present at the surface or under the
surface.
High (risk factor 8): Fat (blue) clay together with surface or subsurface water
present.
Very high (risk factor 9): Fat (blue) clay and water present together with the
observation of slope instability in similar geologic conditions.
Extreme (risk factor 10): The above conditions, together with a stream or other
significant erosion potential near the toe of the slope.
            (10)   Inspection And Certification: It is strongly recommended
that the geotechnical firm for the project also provide inspection, testing,
and verification services for all grading, foundations, pavement sections,
retaining structures, utility line placement, and backfill and any other
construction relating to geotechnical aspects of the development. For real
property for which development has proceeded on the basis of a geologic or
geotechnical report which has been accepted by the city, no final inspection of
a subdivision or other improvements shall be completed or certificate of
occupancy issued or performance bond released until the engineering geologist
or geotechnical engineering firm who prepared and approved the report provides
a letter of compliance, in writing, that the completed improvements and
structures conform to the descriptions and requirements contained in said
report including any approved revisions.
            (11)   Geotechnical Mitigation Measures: Geotechnical mitigation
measures must be reasonable and practical to implement, especially if such
measures require ongoing maintenance by property owners.
            (12)   Infrastructure Maintenance: Infrastructure maintenance shall
be addressed in the engineering studies. Most generally Santa Clara City
maintains public improvements such as sanitary sewer, water, storm drains,
power, pavement, curb, gutter and sidewalks within the public road right of
way. Generally it is the property owners and homeowners' associations that
maintain subsurface or surface drain lines, irrigation, drains for intercepting
ground water, sewer laterals, water lines to homes, and other utilities and
improvements that are located on private property.
               (A)   For all projects located within the HP zone, the
engineering studies shall propose a plan for providing long term maintenance
for all improvements to the property, including those improvements listed as
being normally maintained by the city. Any exception to this requirement must
be made by specific city council approval.
         e.   Geology Report: "The Geologic Hazard And Adverse Conditions, St.
George - Hurricane Metropolitan Area" document and maps prepared by the Utah
geological survey (current edition) shall be reviewed when considering a site
for development. A Utah licensed professional engineering geologist or a Utah
licensed professional engineer who is trained and experienced in the practice
of geotechnical engineering shall prepare the geology report. The geology
report may be included in the geotechnical report, and shall include the
following:
            (1)   The location and boundaries of the project site and its
general geologic setting.
            (2)   A description of the specific geologic conditions at the
site.
            (3)   Identification of potential geologic hazards (such as faults,
landslides, rockfall, flooding and liquefaction).
            (4)   Conclusions and recommendations regarding the effects of the
geologic conditions and any potential hazards on the proposed development, and
recommendations to minimize any hazard to life or property, or any adverse
impact on the natural environment.
         f.   Landscape Plan: A landscape plan and report shall be prepared by
a professional landscape architect licensed in the state of Utah. The report
shall describe how the landscape plan meets the requirements of the HP zone and
shall include a description of existing vegetation, a plan of any proposed
vegetation of the site or modifications to existing vegetation, and a plan for
the preservation of existing vegetation during construction activities. Erosion
protection of existing and proposed slopes shall be included in the plan.
         g.   Other Reports: Other reports deemed necessary by the HRB,
planning commission, and/or city council to assure the health, safety and
welfare of the project residents or general public may be requested from the
applicant by written specification. These may include phase I or phase II
environmental hazardous materials studies, biological resources reports, or
other reports. Such reports shall be submitted with other application
materials.
         h.   Grading Limit Monuments: Permanent monuments shall be installed
to permit monitoring and enforcement of the grading limits during and after
construction activities. The monuments shall be installed at locations
determined by the city in accordance with survey standards for monumentation of
property corners in the state of Utah. A tee post or other approved device
shall be set near all corners to clearly show the extents of the grading limit
lines. Monuments shall be installed and preserved during construction at the
sole expense of the applicant.
      4.   Additional Exhibits Or Reports: The HRB, planning commission and/or
the city council may require additional visual analysis exhibits or other
reports to adequately address unique circumstances and comprehend the full
impact of any proposed development in the HP zone.
         a.   The hillside review board (HRB) may at its discretion require
more detailed grading exhibits showing mitigation or grading details. The HRB
shall determine the number of additional exhibits required and their locations
and perspectives by visiting the site with the developer's representative;
         b.   Furthermore, in some cases the HRB may require the preparation of
computer generated three-dimensional imaging or photo imbedded visual
simulations to adequately depict the postdevelopment conditions and their
impact on the visual character of the site. Included shall be depictions of any
topographical areas with steep slopes and/or unique topographical features
planned for disturbance illustrated at a distance and perspective that will
adequately illustrate postdevelopment conditions along with the proposed
mitigation for development. In tandem with these exhibits, shall be included
predevelopment digital photographs of the site showing identical views utilized
in the postdevelopment computer generated three-dimensional imaging exhibits
for comparison. The HRB shall determine the number of computer generated
exhibits and their locations and perspective by visiting the site with the
developer's representative.
   F.   Approval Required Before Excavation: It shall be unlawful to excavate
or grade any area within the HP hillside protection overlay zone prior to final
approval of the site plan for permitted uses and conditional uses and the

any other applicable city codes.
   H.   Appeals: In the event of a disagreement with the requirements imposed
by the city in connection with this chapter, or the determined lack of
completeness of the required submittals of this chapter, an applicant may
appeal the matter as per chapter 17.16 of this title. The city shall then hear
and make the final determination of the issue, subject in any event to an
appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction as permitted by Utah Code Annotated
section 10-9a-704.
   I.   Previously Approved Grading Permits: The requirements of this chapter
shall not apply to developments or subdivisions or individual lots which had an
approved grading permit or approved grading and drainage construction drawings

building department or public works department shall have the right to order a
halt to construction of any improvements within an HP zone where, in the
officer's discretion, there exists a condition which violates, or threatens to
violate, any provisions of this chapter. Such suspension of construction
activities shall continue until the city officer is satisfied that measures
have been implemented for substantial compliance with this chapter. The
developer may appeal to the city council. The city may enter legal proceedings
to require any person who violates this section to fund and return a site to
the condition found prior to any disturbance, with a city official to determine
when this natural state has been achieved, or to set specific requirements
necessary to achieve the natural and restored state. Legal proceedings may also
seek to impose and collect a fine in order to recover staff costs incurred
through addressing any violation of this section. (Ord. 2008-14)
17.80.040: DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
All proposed development and improvements within the HP zone are subject to the
following required development standards. These standards are intended to
provide a framework for development that is sensitive to the unique
characteristics of hillside properties. Their purpose is not to discourage
proposals for innovative or alternative methods of design in a hillside area;
innovation is encouraged as long as the end result is one which respects
significant landform features and is consistent with the purposes expressed in
this chapter and in the goals and objectives of the Santa Clara City general
plan.
   A.   Disturbance Limitations: The following criteria shall be applied in
establishing the limits of disturbance for a site:
      1.   Adverse visual impacts from within and without the development shall
be minimized unless doing so precludes another objective of the HP zone. The
screening of cuts and fills, and the visual protection of prominent ridgelines,
rock outcroppings, scenic views, and the natural terrain is required unless
doing so precludes another objective of the HP zone.
      2.   Disturbed slopes should be treated to minimize erosion, and natural
drainageways shall be protected unless doing so precludes another objective of
the HP zone.
      3.   The clearing of trees, shrubs and other native vegetation should be
limited to: the approved locations for streets, driveways and easements; the
approved locations for building pads for structures, other main buildings and
accessory structures; the minimum distance between structures and surrounding
vegetation for established fire prevention and safety standards or
recommendations.
      4.   Significant trees, shrubs and other native vegetation should be
preserved in the design of the development. Significant vegetation is to be
identified on a map with the application submittals and the HRB will review the
submittals and visit the site to determine the significance of existing
vegetation.
      5.   All topsoil from any disturbed portion of the site should be
preserved and utilized in revegetation areas. The soil in the upper portion of
fill areas shall be of a sufficient quality to support native plant growth.
      6.   The maximum limits of disturbance shall be identified on each lot or
parcel of the approved site plans and subdivision plats and shall include all
graded, excavated, and filled areas, the areas occupied by main and accessory
structures, hard surface areas that include driveways, walkways, patios and
parking areas, and all other areas of disturbance or nonnative vegetation.
      7.   All lots and building pads shall be graded during construction of
the development, including all retaining walls, roadways, utilities, and all
other improvements needed to complete the site work. No building permits for
structures will be issued or recordation of any subdivision plats prior to
completion of all site work unless specifically approved by the city council.
   B.   Grading Design: Grading for all developments shall be designed to blend
with the contours of the adjacent natural terrain.
      1.   Limits Of Grading: No grading, cutting, filling, excavating,
benching or terracing of any proposed lot or parcel shall go beyond the maximum
limits of disturbance for each lot or parcel as provided herein.
      2.   Cuts And Fills: All cuts and fills shall be minimized and shall be
included within the maximum limits of disturbance for each lot or parcel. All
cut and fill areas shall be recontoured to the natural, varied contours of the
surrounding terrain with a maximum slope transition back to the natural grade
no greater than two to one (2:1). Slope ratios greater than two to one (2:1)
are prohibited except for approved cuts into solid rock only. Any such proposed
cut into rock shall be reviewed by the HRB for appropriateness, suitability,
and visual impact in order to grant approval if warranted. For approved cuts
into solid rock, the slope may be as steep as one-half to one (1/2:1) if
recommended by a Utah licensed professional engineer who is trained and
experienced in the practice of geotechnical engineering, and if the visual
impact of the cut can be adequately mitigated. All areas of cut and fill shall
be protected from erosion during the period of construction and shall be
permanently planted or otherwise protected from erosion within twenty (20) days
of the completion of grading and excavation as identified by the approved
landscape plan.
Where cut or fill conditions are created, slopes shall be varied and rounded
where feasible rather than left at a constant angle which may be unstable or
create an unnatural, rigid, engineered appearance.

      3.   Cuts And Fills Visual Mitigation: The visual impact of cuts and
fills shall be mitigated by methods approved by the city council. Mitigation
shall predominantly be contour grading along with plantings as identified on
the approved landscape plan that will stabilize the cut or fill slope and blend
with the surrounding vegetation. Other mitigation may include, but is not
limited to, the placement of buildings so as to screen the cuts and/or the
placement of retaining walls designed to blend with the surrounding terrain to
stabilize the cut and blend with the surrounding terrain. The use of retaining
walls is to be as limited in scope and height as feasible to ensure the visual
predominance of vegetation. Contour grading techniques shall be used to provide
a natural appearing variety of slope transitions, slope percentage and slope
direction in a three-dimensional undulating pattern similar to existing
terrain.
         a.   Cut and fill operations shall be given a rounded appearance that
closely resembles the natural contours of the land.

         b.   Graded slopes adjacent to roadways shall be softened by
sufficient berms, contour grading, and/or landscaping to create natural, varied
and pleasing streetscapes.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/723f82ae0e8bb7779375fbc10ae10d662e313102/
IMAGES/0-0-0-74.png]
 
      4.   Street And Driveway Alignment: Street alignments shall run generally
parallel along the contours of the natural terrain. Short sections of streets
that run perpendicular to natural contours and serve the purpose of connecting
main parallel sections of streets are permitted and shall follow the natural
curves of drainageways where practicable. Streets shall not greatly alter the
physical and visual character of a hillside by creating large notches in
ridgelines or by defining wide straight alignments. Contour grading techniques
shall be employed on all streets and associated cut and fill areas to minimize
any adverse impacts. Reduced width road sections, split road sections, and
split parking bays are potentially acceptable techniques to employ in the
layout of hillside streets to reduce grading.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/723f82ae0e8bb7779375fbc10ae10d662e313102/
IMAGES/0-0-0-76.png]
 
The portions of driveways that run perpendicular to natural contours and serve
the purpose of accessing building lots and parcels shall be as short as
practicable. Driveways that serve more than one parcel are permitted as a
method of reducing unnecessary grading, paving and site disturbance. If lots
and parcels will be sharing driveways, cross use easements shall be recorded
with the subdivision.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/723f82ae0e8bb7779375fbc10ae10d662e313102/
IMAGES/0-0-0-78.png]
 
Shared driveways can reduce grading.
      5.   Open Space Trails: Trails through open space shall be located such
that cuts and fills are minimized and visual character is preserved.
      6.   Building Site Grading: Building site grading shall be minimized so
as to preserve natural features. Careful consideration shall be given to the
general orientation of the slope when locating structures.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/723f82ae0e8bb7779375fbc10ae10d662e313102/
IMAGES/0-0-0-80.png]
 
      7.   Cut And Fill Conditions: On each building site, careful
consideration shall be given to the cut and fill conditions such that a balance
is achieved where feasible and consistent with the intent of this chapter to
minimize the visual impact of grading. Different terrain conditions call for
corresponding different cut and fill solutions such that the structure fits
well into the topography as illustrated below. Impact to natural drainageways
shall be avoided.

   C.   Prominent Ridgeline And Mesa Edge Visual Preservation: To minimize the
adverse visual impacts that new development can have on prominent ridgelines
and their associated viewsheds, the following setbacks shall apply:
      1.   For new developments the minimum setback from a prominent ridgeline,
as shown on the hillside protection overlay zone map, is fifty feet (50') for
one-story structures and sight obscuring privacy fences and walls unless a
greater setback is recommended in the geotechnical report. The setback is one
hundred feet (100') for 11/2- and two-story structures unless a greater setback
is recommended in the geotechnical report. On individual lots previously
platted, any setback; front, rear, or side may be modified by the city council
as determined in the best interest of the city unless a greater setback is
recommended in the geotechnical report or a greater setback is recommended by
the HRB for safety and stability.
   D.   Architectural Standards: The purpose of establishing architectural
design standards in the HP zone is to ensure quality development that blends
with the hillside environment and to create neighborhoods that display
harmonious and complementary architectural styles. To achieve hillside
compatible development, the city recognizes the importance of having
architectural design that incorporates low profile rooflines and other building
elements which reflect the naturally occurring ridgeline silhouettes and
topographical variations.
      1.   Building Setbacks: A variety of building and lot orientations shall
be provided in order to encourage development suitable with the hillside
character of the site.
         a.   Rear Setback: Unless a greater setback is recommended in the
geotechnical report or the structure is located on a prominent ridgeline where
a greater setback applies as detailed herein, a minimum building setback of
fifteen feet (15') from top of slope and/or an average setback of fifteen feet
(15') shall be provided from the edge of the pad.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/723f82ae0e8bb7779375fbc10ae10d662e313102/
IMAGES/0-0-0-86.png]
 
         b.   Viewshed Protection:
            (1)   Structures shall be designed so the slope angle of the roof
pitch is generally at or below the angle of the natural hillside or graded
slope.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/723f82ae0e8bb7779375fbc10ae10d662e313102/
IMAGES/0-0-0-88.png]
 
            (2)   Site planning shall emphasize the preservation of views to
prominent visual features such as ridgelines, as viewed from within and outside
the hillside development. This includes building orientation to allow view
opportunities and locating buildings on the least sensitive portions of the
site so as to preserve landforms, vegetation and topographical features.
            (3)   Hillside buildings shall be stepped to follow the contours of
the slope. For aesthetic reasons, exterior structural supports and undersides
of floors and decks not enclosed by walls are discouraged but may be permitted
with fire safety and architectural considerations adequately addressed to the
satisfaction of the city.
      2.   Building Style: Architectural styles shall be compatible with the
hillside character, topography, and theme of the community. Hillside adaptive
architecture, as described below, shall be used within the HP zone:
         a.   Buildings shall be stepped as necessary to minimize grading.
         b.   A variety of roof orientations and types which emphasize roof
pitches reflecting the overall slope of the hillside shall be incorporated into
the design of the buildings.
         c.   Enhanced architectural elevations are required where the front,
rear or side of units face public view. Units shall avoid massive walls and
monotonous patterns of building silhouettes to the satisfaction of the city
council.
         d.   The dimensions of a building, measured in the direction of the
slope shall be minimized in order to limit the amount of cut and fill and to
better incorporate the structure to the natural terrain.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/723f82ae0e8bb7779375fbc10ae10d662e313102/
IMAGES/0-0-0-90.png]
 
         e.   Buildings may be clustered to respect and adapt to the existing
topography. Flexible siting techniques including varying the position of the
structures and varying the sizes of lots shall be used as necessary to preserve
the character of the hillside setting.
      3.   Architectural Treatments: Publicly visible exterior walls of any
building shall be designed to avoid monotonous or continuous facades. A single,
continuous vertical or horizontal plane on the front and rear facade of any
building is not permitted. Architectural features and details shall be
incorporated in all exterior walls of the building, including the rear and
sides of the building. Buildings may utilize wall articulation (i.e., insets,
pop outs, etc.) and roof orientation as a means to break up the massing.
         a.   The form, mass and profile of the individual buildings and
architectural features shall be designed to blend with the natural terrain and
preserve the character of the natural slope. Avoid the use of large gable ends
on downhill elevations. The predominant roof slope shall be oriented in the
same general direction as the natural slope.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/723f82ae0e8bb7779375fbc10ae10d662e313102/
IMAGES/0-0-0-92.png]
 
         b.   Avoid large roof overhangs and cantilevers on downhill elevations
to reduce the massive appearance from below.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/723f82ae0e8bb7779375fbc10ae10d662e313102/
IMAGES/0-0-0-94.png]
 
      4.   Finish Materials, Color, And Reflectivity: Building materials and
colors shall blend with the natural setting. The color, material and texture
palette shall be reinforced with compatible landscaping consistent with the
landscaping requirements of this chapter. The light reflective value (LRV) of
materials used on all exterior walls and roof areas shall be similar to the LRV
of the surrounding terrain. The building material colors and their LRVs shall
be submitted with the final application.
      5.   Fencing And Privacy Walls: All fences and privacy walls adjacent to
or clearly visible from public roads or parks shall be either virtually
transparent (such as wrought iron fencing) or constructed of materials which
have a natural appearance and color that blends with the surrounding
environment and is complementary to the landscape. The applicant shall present
illustrations, sample materials, and descriptions of fencing and wall materials
to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this subsection.
All walls and fences adjacent to or visible from public roads shall be set back
from the road right of way by a minimum of six feet (6') (or greater where
cited elsewhere in this code) landscaped area on the street side of the wall or
fence. Additionally, walls and fences not exceeding six feet (6') in height are
permitted adjacent to structures in order to provide a private outdoor area. A
minimum flat area from top or toe of slope of three feet (3') or more as
required by the adopted building codes of the city shall be maintained to face
of wall on slopes with slope heights of thirty feet (30') or greater as per the
following diagrams:
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/723f82ae0e8bb7779375fbc10ae10d662e313102/
IMAGES/0-0-0-96.png]
 
   E.   Landscape Design Standards:
      1.   Landscaping shall be designed to stabilize graded slopes, prevent
erosion and be compatible with surrounding natural vegetation.
         a.   Cut Or Fill Slopes: All plant material used on cut or fill slopes
shall be as nearly compatible with plant material found on adjacent undisturbed
hillsides as possible. Such slopes shall use Xeriscaping landscape methods with
no irrigation systems allowed on or adjacent to the slope itself.
         b.   Pad Sites Or Flat Areas: All plant materials on pad sites or
relatively flat areas shall be of a desert type requiring little or no
irrigation. Hand watered fired pots or other similar watertight containers may
be used to hold additional landscape materials. Any lawn area shall consist of
artificial grass. Rocks and colored or natural stones make desirable landscape
materials for pad areas. Any other proposed landscaping shall be specifically
approved by the city council and should consist of low water plantings with
minimal irrigation requirements.
         c.   Terraced Areas: On terraced areas between retaining walls,
minimal desert type landscaping may be considered using the same methods as
used for pad sites.
         d.   Slope And Landscape Maintenance: Homeowners' associations (HOAs)
and assessment districts or other acceptable legal entities are required in the
HP zone to maintain common open space. All landscaped slopes not included
within a landscape maintenance district (LMD) shall be maintained by an HOA or
a property owners' association (POA) for the permanent maintenance of
landscaped slopes and other areas. An HOA or POA shall be required to establish
a maintenance district with responsibility for maintenance. Should the HOA
disband or neglect their duties to maintain the slopes and landscaping, the
city may contract with a landscape maintenance contractor for ongoing
maintenance and place a lien against any and all private or common areas in the
project to ensure repayment to the city of any incurred expense.
      2.   Prior to an occupancy permit being issued, landscaping plans for
individual homes within any development must be reviewed and approved by the
city to assure compliance with this chapter and any conditions imposed during
the hillside development permit process.
   F.   Retaining Walls: The purpose and intent of establishing development
standards for retaining walls is to ensure that the retaining walls are
structurally sound and are not visually intrusive. The location of all
retaining walls, privacy walls, and fences along with their proposed heights,
materials and colors, shall be shown on the grading plan and concept plan. All
retaining walls, privacy walls and fences shall be located within the maximum
limits of disturbance for each lot or parcel.
      1.   General Standards:
         a.   The maximum length of any continuous retaining wall shall not be
more than two hundred (200) linear feet.
         b.   Retaining walls shall be used for the purpose of containing fill
material or for minimizing cut or fill slopes. The retaining wall may only
extend six inches (6") above the material it is retaining.
         c.   A retaining wall shall not block or restrict vehicular access to
a dedicated or implied dedicated alley, accessway, pedestrian access, trail,
sidewalk, easement, or right of way.
         d.   All retaining walls, privacy walls and fences surrounding a
development's perimeter shall be faced with stone or earth colored materials
that blend with the color and texture of the surrounding natural landscape.
         e.   Curved retaining walls that follow the natural contours are
strongly recommended, but not required.
         f.   All retaining walls as well as all freestanding walls and fences
shall comply with the adopted building codes of the city.
      2.   Height Standards:
         a.   No portion of a retaining wall shall exceed nine feet (9') in
height as measured from the immediately adjacent lowest natural or finished
grade to the top of wall unless it can be demonstrated in the overall
mitigation plan for cuts and fills that taller walls will not detract from the
surrounding terrain. Retaining walls shall not be stacked or terraced in any
manner that increases their combined height beyond nine feet (9'). If desired,
two (2) subwalls may be stacked or terraced to a maximum combined height of
nine feet (9'). A minimum separation of six feet (6') is required between
subwalls as measured from face of wall. The separation area between the sets of
subwalls shall be planted with low water use/low maintenance shrubs or other
vegetation as approved in the landscape plan. This vegetation will help reduce
the apparent visual height of the walls. Tree planting in the zone between
subwalls requires a separation of at least twenty feet (20').
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/723f82ae0e8bb7779375fbc10ae10d662e313102/
IMAGES/0-0-0-98.png]
 
         b.   For purposes of this subsection, retaining walls are not
considered stacked or terraced if there is a minimum horizontal separation of
ten feet (10') between sets of retaining walls. With the minimum ten foot (10')
separation, each retaining wall set may be constructed to the maximum allowed
height; either the nine foot (9') height or the taller height demonstrated that
would not detract from the surrounding terrain. The separation area between the
sets of retaining walls shall be planted with low water use/low maintenance
shrubs or other vegetation as approved in the landscape plan. No more than
three (3) adjacent retaining walls (or 27 feet in total height) will be
allowed, unless specifically approved by the city council.
         c.   Retaining walls may be constructed to varying heights throughout
a development.
            (1)   Retaining walls constructed in the side yard area between two
(2) homes shall not exceed a height of four feet (4'); provided that such wall
does not extend into a required front yard setback adjacent to a street.
            (2)   Retaining walls constructed in the rear yard area of a lot
shall not exceed a height of eight feet (8').
            (3)   All planting areas between and adjacent to retaining walls
shall be provided with an automatic irrigation system suitable for low water
use vegetation. Such irrigation system shall be approved and inspected prior to
the construction of any wall.
            (4)   Where a retaining wall contains fill above the natural grade
and is located within a required setback yard, the height of the retaining wall
shall be considered as contributing to the permissible height of a fence or
wall at that location. A nonview obscuring fence up to three and one-half feet
(3.5') in height may be erected at the top of the retaining wall for safety.
         d.   Retaining walls not exceeding six feet (6') in height are
permitted adjacent to structures in order to provide a private outdoor area.
   G.   Corrective Work: Nothing in this section shall prohibit the city from
authorizing grading deemed necessary to correct previously disturbed natural
areas or existing hazardous conditions that are on site but not a part of the
proposed development area that are brought to the city's attention, in which
case the applicant will investigate possible alternatives with subsequent
review by city staff, city engineer, hillside review board, planning commission
and/or city council. (Ord. 2008-14)

ocean.
   MASS GRADING: The movement of large quantities of earth over large areas.
Disruption of the majority of the on site surface terrain is common and often
results in a successive pad/terrace configuration. Modification or elimination
of natural landforms may result.
   MESA: A typically flat topped landform with generally steep sides.
   MINIMAL GRADING: A grading concept designed to minimize excavation and

            (1)   Property lines and street names, existing and proposed
buildings, walls, fences, utilities, paved areas, and other site improvements;
and
            (2)   Existing and finished contour lines and spot elevations as
necessary for the proposed site improvements, as well as drainage.
      2.   Plan Review, Construction Inspection, and Post-Construction
Monitoring:
         a.   As part of the building permit approval process, a copy of the
Landscape Documentation Package must be submitted with a city provided pre-
submittal checklist completed for the city to initiate a review and approval
process before construction begins.
         b.   All installers and designers must meet state and local license,
insurance, and bonding requirements, and be able to show proof of such.
         c.   During construction, site inspection of the landscaping may be
performed by the Building Department or other city official tasked with such
inspections.
         d.   Following construction and prior to issuing an occupancy permit,
an inspection must be scheduled with the Building Department or other city
official tasked with such inspections to verify compliance with the approved
landscape plans. The Certificate of Substantial Completion must be completed by
the property owner, developer, contractor, or landscape architect and submitted
to the city. The Certificate of Substantial Completion must be accompanied by a
certification from the landscape architect that the landscaping, irrigation,
and related improvements have been installed consistent with the approved
Landscape Documentation Package.
         e.   The Building Department or other city official tasked with such
inspections reserves the right to perform site inspections at any time before,
during, or after the irrigation system and landscape installation, and to
require corrective measures if requirements of this chapter are not satisfied.

17.92.050: LANDSCAPE AND IRRIGATION DESIGN AND OPERATION STANDARDS:
The provisions of this section shall apply to all new landscaping and
irrigation in the City.
   A.   Plants must be well-suited to the microclimate and soil conditions at
the project site. Native, locally adaptable, and environmentally sustainable
plants are acceptable. See the Washington County Water Conservancy District’s
recommended plant list on https://wcwcd.org. Plants with similar water needs
must be grouped together as much as possible into hydrozones for efficient
irrigation. Invasive plant species as identified by Washington County must not
be planted.
      1.   Areas with slopes greater than twenty percent (20%) slope must be
landscaped with deep-rooting, water-conserving plants that do not include lawn.
      2.   Park strips and other landscaped areas less than eight feet (8')
wide must be landscaped with water-conserving plants and/or mulch that do not
include lawn.
   B.   Tree species must be selected based on growth characteristics and site
conditions, including available space, overhead clearance, soil conditions,
exposure, and desired color and appearance. Trees should be suited for water-
efficient landscapes; however, fruit trees are allowed where permitted by
zoning. Trees must be selected and planted in accordance with the following
city guidance:
      1.   Broad canopy trees may be selected where shade or screening of tall
objects is desired.
      2.   Low-growing trees must be selected for spaces under utility wires.
      3.   Select trees from which lower branches will be trimmed to maintain a
healthy growth habit where visual clearance and natural surveillance is a
concern.
      4.   Narrow or columnar trees are recommended for small spaces, or where
awnings or other building features limit growth, or where greater visibility is
desired between buildings and the street for natural surveillance.
      5.   Tree placement must provide canopy cover (shade) and avoid conflicts
with existing trees, retaining walls, above and below ground utilities,
lighting, and other obstructions.
   C.   Irrigation Design Standards:
      1.   Pressure Regulation. A pressure regulating valve must be installed
by the builder or developer, and maintained by the owner, if the static service
pressure exceeds ninety (90) pounds per square inch (psi). The pressure
regulating valve must be located between the meter and the first point of water
use, or first point of division in the pipe, and must be set at the
manufacturer’s recommended pressure for the sprinklers.
      2.   Irrigation Controller. It is required that landscaped areas use a
WaterSense labeled smart irrigation controller, which automatically adjusts the
frequency and/or duration of irrigation events in response to changing weather
conditions. All controllers must be equipped with automatic rain delay or rain
shut-off capabilities. All controllers must have memory retention capability to
retain pre-programmed irrigation schedules. Sites are not exempt from water
waste prohibitions.
      3.   Low-volume irrigation equipment (i.e., drip emitters, bubblers) must
be provided for each tree.
      4.   Drip irrigation must be used to irrigate plants in non-lawn areas.
      5.   High conservation efficiency spray nozzles are required for
sprinkler applications.
      6.   Sprinkler heads must have matched precipitation rates with each
control valve circuit.
      7.   Filters and end-flush valves must be provided for drip irrigation
lines.
   D.   Irrigation Operation Standards:
      1.   Landscape watering with potable (treated) water is prohibited from
ten o’clock (10:00) a.m. to eight o’clock (8:00) p.m., from June 1 to October
1, to maximize irrigation efficiency.
      2.   Water waste is prohibited. Waste includes overwatering, irrigating
during a precipitation event, water that sprays or flows off your property,
failure to comply with drought restrictions and/or a failure to repair
irrigation system leaks and/or malfunctions in a timely manner.
      3.   Overwatering can be avoided by following the water district’s
recommended irrigation schedule and practices as noted on wcwcd.org. The
generally recommended schedule is:
         a.   Winter (Nov - Feb) - sprinkler and drip irrigation up to one (1)
day a week. Irrigation is typically not needed in December and January.
         b.   Spring (Mar - April) - sprinkler irrigation up to three (3) days
a week and drip irrigation up to two (2) days a week.
         c.   Summer (May - Aug) - sprinkler irrigation up to four (4) days a
week and drip irrigation up to three (3) days a week.
         d.   Fall (Sept - Oct) - sprinkler irrigation up to three (3) days a
week and drip irrigation up to two (2) days a week.
      4.   Program valves for multiple repeat cycles are required to reduce
runoff on slopes and for soils with slow infiltration rates. (Ord. 2024-02:

17.92.060: RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS IN CONFLICT WITH WATER EFFICIENCY STANDARDS:
Any homeowners’, condominium owners’, or property owners’ association governing
documents, such as bylaws, operating rules, covenants, conditions, and
restrictions that govern the operation of a common interest development,
recorded after passage of this chapter, are void and unenforceable if they
conflict with the water efficiency standards in this chapter, or if they have
the effect of prohibiting or restricting compliance with this chapter. (Ord.
