conflict of interest requiring disclosure and recusal, it is the responsibility
of that officer or employee to seek advice from the Mayor, City Manager, or the
City Attorney prior to any discussion or action being taken on the matter
presenting the potential conflict. Recusal is required for actual conflicts of

Code. The ACE Program may be used by the City for the administrative
enforcement of City Code violations in accordance with the procedures outlined
in this Chapter. (Ord. 2022-01, 3-22-2022)

be cited and pleaded under either designation.

the enforcement of the South Weber City Code throughout South Weber City is an
important public service. Code enforcement is vital to the protection of the
public’s health, safety, welfare, and quality of life. A comprehensive code
enforcement system that uses a combination of judicial and administrative
remedies is critical to gaining compliance with City ordinances.
   B.   Scope. The provisions of this Chapter may be applied to all violations
of the City Code. It has been designed as an additional remedy for the City to
use in achieving compliance with its ordinances and regulations.
The provisions of this Chapter do not invalidate any other title, chapter, or
ordinance, but shall be read in conjunction with those titles, chapters, and
ordinances as an additional remedy available for enforcement of those
ordinances.
   C.   Criminal Prosecution Right. The City has sole discretion in deciding
whether to file a civil or criminal case for the violation of any of its
ordinances. The enactment of this administrative remedy shall in no way
interfere with the City’s right to prosecute City ordinance violations as
criminal offenses. The City may use any of the remedies available under the law
in both civil and criminal prosecution. Although most minor City Code
violations should be enforced through this Chapter, the City may choose to file
a criminal prosecution under any of the following circumstances:
      1.   The violator has one prior violation of the City Code within the
last year;
      2.   The violation caused bodily injury, substantial bodily injury, or
serious bodily injury to an individual, all of which shall have the same

provisions of the Utah Criminal Code as well as one or more provisions of the
City Code, and all violations are being charged as a single criminal episode as
defined in Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-401;
      4.   The violation caused a significant health or safety risk to the
public.
   D.   No Mandatory Duty - Civil Liability. It is the intent of the City

perform his or her directed duty or duties.

Interest shall be assessed per City policy on all outstanding civil penalties
balances until the case has been paid in full. The City may use one form for
both notices of violation and administrative citations. Payment of the
penalties, fines, and fees shall not excuse the failure to correct the

violation, administrative citation, or administrative enforcement order, the
Hearing Officer may modify the civil penalties on a finding of good cause as
defined in this Chapter.

   A.   Declaration Of Purpose. The City Council finds that there is a need to
establish uniform procedures for administrative code enforcement hearings
conducted pursuant to this Chapter. It is the purpose and intent of the City
Council to afford due process of law to any person who is directly affected by
an administrative action. Due process of law includes notice, an opportunity to
participate in the administrative hearing including the opportunity to call
witnesses, present evidence, and cross-examine witnesses, and an explanation of
the reasons justifying the administrative action. These procedures are also
intended to establish a forum to efficiently, expeditiously, and fairly resolve
issues raised in any administrative code enforcement action.
   B.   Policies And Procedures Of Hearings. The Hearing Officer may develop
policies and procedures to regulate the hearing process for any violation of
the City Code that is handled pursuant to the administrative abatement
procedures, the emergency abatement procedures, the demolition procedures, or
the administrative citation procedures. Such policies and procedures shall be
consistent with this Chapter and other City ordinances and codes.
   C.   Powers Of The Hearing Officer.

      3.   The Hearing Officer may issue subpoenas for witnesses, documents,
and other evidence where such is deemed necessary to decide the issues at the
hearing. All costs related to the subpoena, including witness and mileage fees,
shall be borne by the party requesting the subpoena. The Hearing Officer shall
develop policies and procedures relating to the issuance of subpoenas in
administrative code enforcement hearings, including the form of the subpoena
and related costs. In the absence of any adopted policies, the Hearing Officer

contain the case number, the address of the violation, the signature of the
responsible party, and the reason for the hearing including justifications for
the offense, defenses, and requests for waiver or reduction in fines.
      3.   As soon as practicable after receiving the written notice of the
request for hearing, the Code Enforcement Coordinator shall schedule a date,
time, and place for the hearing.
      4.   Failure to request a hearing as provided shall constitute a waiver
of the right to a hearing and a waiver of the right to challenge the action.
   E.   Notification Of Administrative Code Enforcement Hearing.

served by the Code Enforcement Coordinator or Code Enforcement Officer to the

shall be set for a default hearing by the Code Enforcement Coordinator. The
Code Enforcement Coordinator shall notify the responsible person of the date,
time, and place of the hearing by one of the methods listed in this Chapter.
      2.   A default hearing shall also be scheduled for all cases that have
outstanding or unpaid civil penalties, fines, fees, or costs due to the City
before collection, if a hearing on that case has not already been held.

         c.   Excuse the responsible person’s failure to request a hearing
within the ten-day period.
      4.   If the evidence shows that the violations existed, the Hearing
Officer shall enter an order requiring abatement of the violations and the
payment of all fines, costs, and fees. Fines and costs shall run until the City
issues a notice of compliance stating when the violations were abated. The
order by the Hearing Officer shall not suspend further accrual of fines and
costs.
   G.   Procedures At Administrative Code Enforcement Hearings.
      1.   Administrative code enforcement hearings are intended to be informal
in nature. Formal rules of evidence and discovery do not apply; however, an
informal exchange of discovery may be required. The request for discovery must
be in writing and filed at least ten (10) business days before the hearing.
Failure to request discovery shall not be a basis for a continuance.

unless the complainant is a witness at the hearing.
      3.   The procedure and format of the administrative hearing shall follow
the procedures promulgated by the Hearing Officer.
      4.   The City bears the burden of proof at an administrative code
enforcement hearing to establish the existence of a violation of the City Code
or City ordinances.
      5.   The standard of proof to be used by the Hearing Officer in deciding
the issues at an administrative hearing is whether there is substantial
evidence in the record that the violations exist and that the person before the
Judge is the responsible person.
      6.   Hearsay evidence, as defined by the Utah Rules of Evidence, is
admissible so long as such hearsay evidence is not the only evidence relied
upon by the Hearing Officer.
      7.   Each party shall have the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses
that are in attendance and present evidence in support of his or her case. A
written declaration signed under penalty of perjury may be accepted in lieu of
a personal appearance so long as the declaration is not the only evidence
relied upon by the Hearing Officer. Testimony may be given by telephone or
other electronic means so long as the testimony by telephone or electronic
means is not the only evidence relied upon by the Hearing Officer.
      8.   All hearings are open to the public. They shall be recorded by audio
recording.
      9.   Hearings may be held at the location of the violation if the Hearing
Officer so chooses, and means are provided for an audio recording of the
proceeding.
      10.   The responsible person has a right to be represented by an
attorney.
      11.   No new hearing shall be granted, unless the Hearing Officer
determines that extraordinary circumstances exist which justify a new hearing.
   H.   Failure To Attend Administrative Code Enforcement Hearings. Any party
whose property or actions are the subject of any administrative code
enforcement hearing and who fails to appear at the hearing is deemed to have
waived the right to a hearing, which will result in a default judgment for the
City provided that proper notice of the hearing has been provided. The City
shall not be required to put on evidence or prove that a violation was
committed by the Responsible Person in such an event, and an entry of a default
judgment shall have the same effect as if there was a judgment on the merits of
the case.
   I.   Hearing Officer Order.
      1.   The parties may enter into a stipulated agreement, which must be
signed by both parties or verbally stipulated on the record during the
administrative code enforcement hearing. This agreement or stipulation shall be
entered as the Hearing Officer Order. Entry of this agreement or stipulation
shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing and the right to appeal.
      2.   Once all evidence and testimony are completed, the Hearing Officer
shall issue a Hearing Officer Order that affirms, modifies, or rejects the
notice, citation, or action by the Code Enforcement Officer. The Hearing
Officer may increase or decrease the total amount of civil penalties and costs
that are due pursuant to the City’s fee schedule and the procedures in this
Chapter.
      3.   The Hearing Officer may order the City to enter the property and
abate all violations, which may include removing animals kept in violation of
the City Code.
      4.   The Hearing Officer may revoke a kennel permit, an animal license,
or the right to possess animals as provided in the City Code.
      5.   As part of the Hearing Officer Order, the Hearing Officer may reduce
or stay civil penalties on the condition that the responsible person complete
compliance by specified deadlines.
      6.   The Hearing Officer may schedule subsequent review hearings as may
be necessary or as requested by a party to the hearing to ensure compliance
with the Hearing Officer Order.
      7.   The Hearing Officer may order the responsible person to post a
performance bond to ensure compliance with the order.
      8.   The Hearing Officer Order shall become final on the date of the
signing of the Order.
      9.   The Hearing Officer Order shall be served on all parties by any one
of the methods listed in this Chapter.
   J.   Failure To Comply With Order.
      1.   After the Hearing Officer issues a Hearing Officer Order, the Code
Enforcement Officer and Hearing Officer may monitor the violations and
determine compliance.
      2.   Upon the failure of the responsible person to comply with the terms
and deadlines set forth in the Hearing Officer Order, the City may use all
appropriate legal means to recover the civil penalties and administrative costs
to obtain compliance.
   K.   Administrative Enforcement Appeals.
      1.   Any person adversely affected by any decision made in the exercise
of the provisions of this Chapter may file a petition for review of the
decision or order to district court within thirty (30) days after the decision
is rendered.
      2.   No person may challenge in district court the Hearing Officer’s
decision until that person has exhausted his or her administrative remedies
herein.
      3.   Unless otherwise provided by the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure or
local court rules, within 120 days after submitting the petition, the party
petitioning for appeal shall request a copy of the record of the proceedings,
including transcripts of hearings when necessary. The Code Enforcement
Coordinator shall not submit copies of files or transcripts to the reviewing
court until the party petitioning for appeal has paid all required costs. The
petitioning party’s failure to properly arrange for copies of the record, or to
pay the full costs for the record, within 180 days after the petition for
review was filed shall be grounds for dismissal of the petition, unless
otherwise provided by the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure or local court rules.
      4.   If a transcript of a hearing cannot be prepared because the tape
recording is incomplete or unintelligible, the district court may, in its
discretion, remand the matter to the Hearing Officer for a supplemental
proceeding to complete the record. The district court may limit the scope of
the supplemental proceeding to issues that, in the court’s opinion, need
clarification.
      5.   The district court’s review is limited to the record of the
administrative decision that is being appealed. The court shall not accept nor
consider any evidence that is not part of the record of that decision.
      6.   The courts shall:
         a.   Presume that the Hearing Officer’s decision and orders are valid;
and
         b.   Review the record to determine whether or not the decision was
arbitrary, capricious, or illegal. (Ord. 2022-01, 3-22-2022)
1-10-7: ORDERS, ABATEMENT, AND COST RECOVERY:
   A.   Recordation Of Notices Of Violation And Hearing Officer Orders.
      1.   Declaration of Purpose.
         a.   The City Council finds that there is a need for alternative
methods of enforcement for violations of the City Code and City ordinances that
are found to exist on real property. The City Council further finds that an
appropriate method of enforcement for these types of violations is the issuance
and recordation of notices of violation and Hearing Officer Orders.
         b.   The procedures established in this shall be in addition to
criminal, civil, or any other remedy established by law that may be pursued to
address the violation of the City Code or City ordinances.

Coordinator determines that a property or violation has not been brought into
compliance as required in this Chapter, the Code Enforcement Coordinator has
the authority to record the notice of violation or Hearing Officer Order with
the Recorder’s Office of Davis County.
      3.   Procedures for Recordation.
         a.   If a Code Enforcement Officer issues a notice of violation or
administrative citation to a responsible person, and the property remains in
violation after the deadline established in the notice of violation or is not
corrected after the administrative citation is issued, and no request for an
administrative hearing has been filed, the Code Enforcement Coordinator shall
record a notice of violation with the Recorder’s Office of Davis County.
         b.   If an administrative hearing is held, and an order is issued in
the City’s favor, the Code Enforcement Coordinator shall record the Hearing
Officer’s Hearing Officer Order with the Recorder’s Office of Davis County.
         c.   The recordation shall include the name of the property owner, the
parcel number, the legal description of the parcel, a copy of the notice of
violation, administrative citation, or order, and any other relevant
information.
         d.   The recordation does not encumber the property, but merely places
future interested parties on notice of any continuing violation found upon the
property.
      4.   Service of Notice of Recordation. A notice of the recordation shall
be served on the responsible person and the property owner pursuant to any of
the methods of service set forth in this Chapter.
      5.   Failure to Request. The failure of any person to file a request for
an administrative code enforcement hearing when served with a notice of
violation shall constitute a waiver of the right to an administrative hearing
and shall not affect the validity of the recorded notice of violation.
      6.   Notice of Compliance-Procedures.
         a.   When the violations have been corrected, the responsible person
or property owner may request an inspection of the property from a Code
Enforcement Officer.
         b.   Upon receipt of a request for inspection, the Code Enforcement
Officer shall reinspect the property as soon as practicable to determine
whether the violations listed in the notice of violation, administrative
citation, or the order have been corrected, whether all necessary permits have
been issued, and/or whether final inspections have been performed.
         c.   The Code Enforcement Officer, in conjunction with the Code
Enforcement Coordinator, shall serve a notice of compliance to the responsible
person or property owner in the manner provided in this Chapter if the Code
Enforcement Officer determines that:
            (1)   All violations listed in the recorded notice of violation or
order have been corrected;
            (2)   All necessary permits have been issued and finalized;
            (3)   All civil penalties, fines, and costs assessed against the
property have been paid or satisfied; and/or
            (4)   The party requesting the notice of compliance has paid all
administrative fees and costs.
         d.   If a request to issue a notice of compliance is denied, then,
upon request, the Code Enforcement Officer, in conjunction with the Code
Enforcement Coordinator, shall serve the responsible person with a written
explanation setting forth the reasons for the Code Enforcement Officer’s
denial. The written explanation shall be served by any of the methods of
service listed in this Chapter.
      7.   Withholding the Issuance of Municipal Permits and Business Licenses.
         a.   The City may withhold permits and business licenses until a
notice of compliance has been issued by a Code Enforcement Officer.
         b.   The City may withhold business licenses, permits for kennels,
permits for any alteration, repair, or construction pertaining to any existing
or new structures or signs on the property, and any permits pertaining to the
use and development of the real property or the structure.
         c.   The City may, in its sole discretion, issue permits or business
licenses that are necessary to obtain a notice of compliance or that are
necessary to correct serious health and safety violations.
      8.   Cancellation of Recorded Notice of Violation or Hearing Officer
Order. In conjunction with the Code Enforcement Officers, the Code Enforcement
Coordinator shall record the notice of compliance with the County Recorder’s
Office. Recordation of the notice of compliance shall have the effect of
canceling the recorded notice of violation, administrative citation, or
recorded Hearing Officer Order but shall not cancel any outstanding fines,
fees, or costs.
   B.   Abatement Of Violation.
      1.   Authority to Abate.
         a.   A Code Enforcement Officer is authorized to enter upon any
property or premises to abate the violation of the City Code and City
ordinances.
         b.   A Code Enforcement Officer is authorized to assess all costs for
the abatement to the responsible person and use any remedy available under the
law to collect the costs.
         c.   If additional abatement is necessary within two years, treble
costs may be assessed against the responsible person(s) for the actual
abatement.
      2.   Procedures for Abatement.
         a.   Once the procedures set forth in this Chapter have been complied
with, the violation may be abated by City personnel or by a private contractor
acting under the direction of the City.
         b.   These City personnel or private contractors may enter upon
private property in a reasonable manner to abate the ordinance violation as
specified in the notice of violation or Hearing Officer Order.
         c.   If the responsible person abates the violation before the City
performs the actual abatement pursuant to a notice of violation, administrative
citation, or Hearing Officer Order, a Code Enforcement Officer may still assess
all costs incurred by the City against the responsible person.
         d.   When the abatement is completed, a report describing the work
performed and an itemized account of the total abatement costs shall be
prepared by the Code Enforcement Officer overseeing the abatement. The report
shall contain the names and addresses of the responsible persons of each parcel
and the tax parcel numbers.
         e.   The Code Enforcement Coordinator shall serve the notice of costs
and the itemized bill of costs through any of the means in Section 20.01.09.
The notice shall demand full payment within twenty days to the City Treasurer.
   C.   Recovery Of Costs.
      1.   Declaration of Purpose.
         a.   The City Council finds that there is a need to recover costs
incurred by Code Enforcement Officers and other City personnel who spend
considerable time inspecting and reinspecting properties throughout the City to
ensure compliance with the City Code or City ordinances.
         b.   The City Council further finds that the assessment of costs is an
appropriate method to recover expenses incurred for actual costs of abating
violations, reinspection fees, filing fees, attorney fees, hearing officer
fees, title search, and any additional actual costs incurred by the City for
each individual case.
         c.   The assessment and collection of costs shall not preclude the
imposition of any administrative or judicial civil penalties or fines for
violations of the City Code or City ordinances.
      2.   Authority.
         a.   Whenever actual costs are incurred by the City on a property to
obtain compliance with provisions of the City Code and City ordinances, a Code
Enforcement Officer or Code Enforcement Coordinator may assess costs against
the responsible person.
         b.   Once a notice of violation has been issued, the property shall be
inspected one time if the responsible person requests an inspection in writing.
Any additional inspections shall be subject to reinspection fees pursuant to
the City fee schedule.
      3.   Notification of Assessment of Reinspection Fees.
         a.   Notification of reinspection fees may be provided in the notice
of violation served to the responsible person.
         b.   Reinspection fees assessed or collected pursuant to this Section
shall not be included in any other costs assessed.
         c.   The failure of any responsible person to receive notice of the
reinspection fees shall not affect the validity of any other fees imposed under
this Section.
      4.   Failure to Timely Pay Costs. The failure of any person to pay
assessed costs by the deadline specified in the invoice shall result in a late
fee pursuant to City ordinances.
   D.   Administrative Fees. The Code Enforcement Officers and Code Enforcement
Coordinator are authorized to assess administrative fees for costs incurred in
the administration of the code enforcement program, such as investigation of
violations, preparation for hearings, hearings, and the collection process. The
fee assessed shall be the amount set forth in this Chapter or in the City fee
schedule.
   E.   Injunctions. In addition to any other remedy provided under the City
Code or state codes, including criminal prosecution or administrative remedies,
any provision of the City Code may be enforced by injunction issued in the
Second District Court upon a suit brought by the City.

      1.   As part of any notice, order, or action, the Hearing Officer has the
authority to require any responsible person to post a performance bond to
ensure compliance with the City Code, City ordinances, or any judicial action.
      2.   If the responsible person fails to comply with the notice, order, or
action, the bond will be forfeited to the City.
   G.   Code Enforcement Tax Liens.
      1.   Declaration of Purpose. The City Council finds that recordation of
code enforcement tax liens will assist in the collection of civil penalties,
administrative costs, and administrative fees assessed by the administrative
code enforcement hearing program or judicial orders and lessen the cost to City
taxpayers of code enforcement. The City Council further finds that collection
of civil penalties, costs, and fees assessed for code enforcement violations is
important in deterring future violations and maintaining the integrity of the
City’s code enforcement system. The procedures established in this Section
shall be used to complement existing administrative or judicial remedies that
may be pursued to address violations of the City Code or City ordinances.
      2.   Tax Liens for Abatement Costs.
         a.   Once the City has abated a property for weeds, garbage, refuse,
or unsightly or deleterious objects or structures, the Code Enforcement
Coordinator shall prepare three copies of the Itemized Statement of Costs
incurred in the removal and destruction of the violations and deliver them to
the City Treasurer within ten days after completion of the work of removing the
violations.
         b.   The Code Enforcement Coordinator shall serve the Responsible
Person by any of the methods in this Chapter a copy of the Itemized Statement
of Costs informing him or her that a code enforcement tax lien is being
recorded for actual costs of abatement. Payment shall be due within twenty
calendar days from the date of mailing.
         c.   Upon receipt of the Itemized Statement of costs, the City
Treasurer shall record a Code Enforcement Tax Lien against the property with
the county treasurer’s office.
         d.   The failure of any person with a financial interest in the
property to receive the notice of the lien shall not affect the validity of the
lien or any proceedings taken to collect the outstanding costs of abatement.
      3.   Tax Liens for Judgments. Once a judgment has been obtained from the
appropriate court imposing costs, fines, or fees against the responsible
person, the Code Enforcement Coordinator may record a code enforcement tax lien
against any real property owned by the responsible person.
      4.   Cancellation of Code Enforcement Tax Lien.
         a.   Once payment in full is received for the outstanding civil
penalties and costs, or the amount is deemed satisfied pursuant to a subsequent
administrative or judicial order, the Code Enforcement Coordinator shall either
record a notice of satisfaction of judgment, or provide the property owner or
financial institution, through any of the means of service in Section 20.01.09,
with the notice of satisfaction of judgment so that it can record this notice
with the county recorder’s office.
         b.   The notice of satisfaction of judgment shall include the same
information as provided for in the original code enforcement tax lien.
         c.   Such notice of satisfaction of judgment shall cancel the code
enforcement tax lien.
   H.   Recover Of Costs By Writ Of Execution. After obtaining a judgment, the
City may collect the obligation by use of all appropriate legal means. This may
include the execution on personal property owned by the responsible person by
filing a writ with the applicable court.
   I.   Recovery Of Costs By Writ Of Garnishment. After obtaining a judgment,
the City may collect the obligation by use of all appropriate legal means. This
may include the garnishment of paychecks, financial accounts, and other income
or financial assets by filing a writ with the applicable court. (Ord. 2022-01,

the cost of service.
   C.   Purchases of supplies, services, or construction materials of more than

   A.   Small Purchases.
      1.   The City’s policy and procedure governing purchases under $25,000 is
as follows:
         a.   Before making a purchase less than $1,000, the Department Head
responsible for purchase shall use means which are reasonable under the
circumstances to assure that the City is getting good value and a reasonable
price.
         b.   A purchase of goods or services greater than $1,000 but not
exceeding $25,000 shall be awarded after solicitation of price quotes from
enough prospective vendors to reasonably ensure that the City received a
competitive price, unless an exempt expenditure process in 2.1.060.C is
followed. Solicitations may be made electronically or in writing. The
Purchasing Agent or Department Head shall evaluate the quotes received to
determine the lowest responsible and responsive quote. Such quotes shall be
recorded and kept by the City.
         c.   It is unlawful for a person to intentionally or knowingly divide
a procurement into small procurements with the intent to make the procurement
qualify as a small purchase or meet the small purchase threshold of $25,000.
         d.   Purchases for construction, job order contracting, design
professional services, other professional services, information technology, and
goods may not exceed an annual cumulative threshold of $25,000 from the same
source, unless the Chief Procurement Officer gives written authorization to
exceed the threshold that includes the reasons for exceeding the threshold.
   B.   Large Purchases.
      1.   The City’s policy and procedure governing purchases of $25,000 and
over is as follows:
         a.   A purchase of goods or services $25,000 or over shall be awarded
with a bidding procedure, unless an exempt expenditure process in 2.1.060.C is
followed.
      2.   Bidding Procedures.
         a.   Type of Purchases and Bid Limits. The following purchases and bid
limits require bidding procedures:
            (1)   Capital equipment purchases estimated to cost $25,000 or
more; and
            (2).   Building improvement or public works projects estimated to
cost $25,000 or more.
         b.   Plans and Specifications. The City shall cause plans and
specifications to be prepared and approved prior to any Invitation for Bids.
         c.   Invitation for Bids. An Invitation for Bids shall be prepared by
the City and shall include:
            (1)   A description of the goods or services to be purchased or
work to be performed;
            (2)   Contract terms, conditions and bond requirements applicable
to the purchase or work;
            (3)   The criteria that will be used to evaluate the bid;
            (4)   Notification of the location where plans, specifications and
other information may be obtained;
            (5)   The time and place of the bid opening; and
            (6)   The right of the City to reject any and all bids.
         d.   Publication. Public notice of an invitation for bids shall follow
applicable state law.
         e.   Amendment. The City may amend, supplement, or cancel an
Invitation for Bids at any time prior to the opening of the bids when deemed in
the best interest of the City.
         f.   Submission. All bids received by the City shall be received
according to the instructions in the Invitation for Bid. The bids shall not be
opened or reviewed prior to the time set for opening of the bids, except as
provided in subsection
2-1-6. B.2.g.
         g.   Correction or Withdrawal of Bids. The City may permit correction
or withdrawal of bids prior to any bid opening. After bid opening, no changes
in bid prices may be permitted. However, the City, in its discretion and upon a
showing of hardship by the bidder, may allow the withdrawal of a bid containing
a substantial error. Any decision to permit the correction or withdrawal of
bids shall be supported, in writing, by the City.
         h.   Opening Bids. Bids shall be opened in public and in the presence
of one or more documented witnesses at the time and place designated in the
Invitation for Bids. Bids shall be opened by the Chief Procurement Officer or
designee.
         i.   Recording Bids. The total amount of each bid and the name of the
bidder shall be read aloud as the bids are opened, and such information shall
be recorded and open to public inspection.
         j.   Evaluating Bids. At the time of opening, the bids shall be
briefly reviewed by the City to determine the apparent lowest responsible and
responsive bidder based on the criteria set forth in the Invitation for Bids.
Bids shall thereafter be fully evaluated within a reasonable time by the
Purchasing Agent or designee to determine the lowest responsive and responsible
bidder, whose bid or quote conforms in all material aspects to the bid
specifications, and who has the capacity in all respects to perform in full the
contract or purchase order requirements in a timely manner. The Purchasing
Agent or designee may not use criteria not described in the Invitation for Bids
to evaluate a bid.
         k.   Determination. The City may request additional information with
respect to the responsibility of a bidder. The unreasonable failure of a bidder
to promptly supply information or proof regarding responsibility may be grounds
for a determination of non-responsibility or non-responsiveness of the bidder.
         l.   Award. Following full evaluation of the bids, the City Council
may accept, reject, or modify the determination and thereupon award the
contract or reject any and all bids.
         m.   Tie Bids. If two or more bids received are for the same total
amount or unit price, quality and service being equal, and if the public
interest will not permit the delay of re-soliciting bids, the Chief Procurement
Officer or designee shall resolve a tie bid using the following considerations:
            (1)   Bidder closest to the point of delivery;
            (2)   Bidder who received the previous award;
            (3)   Bidder who will provide the earliest delivery date; or
            (4)   By drawing lots.
         n.   Single Bids. In the event only one bid is received, the
Purchasing Agent shall determine whether it is in the best interests of the
City to re-solicit for additional bids or proceed with a procurement award
using the single bid received.
         o.   No Bids or Proposals. In the event no bids or proposals are
received, the Purchasing Agent shall determine whether the delay of re-
soliciting bids or proposals will be detrimental to the public interest. If a
delay in re-soliciting bids or proposals will be detrimental to the public
interest, the Purchasing Agent may purchase the supplies or services with as
much competition as practicable under the circumstances.
         p.   Dividing the Cost of a Construction Project. The cost of a
construction project may not be divided to avoid exceeding the bid limit.
However, the cost of a construction project that exceeds the bid limit may be
divided if the selection procedures comply with the requirements of this
chapter with respect to each part of the construction project that results from
dividing the cost.
         q.   Exceptions. Any exceptions to the procedures set forth in this
section must be in the best interest of the City and must have prior written
approval of the Chief Procurement Officer or designee.
   C.   Exemptions from Small and Large Purchases.
      1.   The following expenditures are exempt from the small and large
purchases procedures of this chapter, but shall be made with as much
competition as practical under the circumstances:
         a.   Procurement under City, County, State, or Federal Contracts or
Pre-Qualified Lists. An expenditure for which requests for qualifications,
competitive bidding or price negotiation according to a procedure comparable to
the City’s process has already occurred at the City, county, state or federal
level.
         b.   Service Contracts and Professional Services. Service contracts
and professional services, but not design professional services, are
expenditures that, by their nature, are not reasonably adapted to award by
competitive bidding. The Chief Procurement Officer or designee shall award
service contracts and professional services contracts based on the Chief
Procurement Officer’s evaluation of the provider’s professional qualifications,
service ability, experience, cost of services, and other applicable criteria as
may be established. A Request for Proposal or Request for Qualifications may be
used to make such a determination. Prior to entering into a service or
professional services contract, the Chief Procurement Officer shall determine
that it is within the best interest of the City to do so, and that as many
providers as practical have been considered for the service. Once a service or
professional services contract has been issued, any periodic payments do not
require additional approval from the Chief Procurement Officer, provided the
contract payments have been properly budgeted. A department may proceed with a
service contract or the purchase of professional services according to the
terms and conditions of an existing City contract.
            (1)   Request for Proposals
               (A)   Form. When the City is unsure of what procurement item is
required or the abilities of various providers, the Chief Procurement Officer
or Purchasing Agent may prepare a Request for Proposals, which shall include
such specifications as are known and the various skills and qualifications
needed, to be used to obtain a procurement item.
               (B)   Evaluating Proposals. Proposals shall be evaluated within
a reasonable time by an evaluation committee comprised of at least three city
employees to determine which proposal provides the best value to the City. The
committee shall evaluate each responsive and responsible proposal, which
proposal conforms in all material aspects to the proposal specifications, and
which demonstrates the proposal has the capacity in all respects to perform in
full the contract or purchase order requirements in a timely manner. Evaluation
criteria for a proposal may include items such as experience, qualifications,
approach to the project, references, management plans, schedule of delivery,
cost, and other subjective or objective criteria. At any time during the
evaluation process, the evaluation committee may request additional information
from a proposer or proposers, including oral interviews or presentations.
Criteria not described in the Request for Proposals may not be used to evaluate
a proposal. See section
2-1-14 for soliciting design professional services using a Request for
Proposals or Requests for Qualifications.
               (C)   Sole Source. Expenditures for goods or services which, by
their nature, are not reasonably adapted to award by competitive bidding,
including goods or services which can be purchased only from one source;
contracts for additions to and repair and maintenance of equipment already
owned by the City which may be more efficiently added to, repaired or
maintained by a certain person or firm; and equipment which, by reason of the
training of City personnel or an inventory of replacement parts, is compatible
with the existing equipment owned by the City. Prior to any expenditure under
this subsection, the Chief Procurement Officer shall determine, in writing,
that the requirements of this subsection have been satisfied.
               (D)   Interlocal Agreement: An expenditure made in conjunction
with an interlocal agreement between the City and another governmental entity
in compliance with the Interlocal Cooperation Act, Utah Code Title 11, Chapter
13.
               (E)   Emergency Procurement. The existence of an emergency
condition may create an immediate and serious need for supplies, services,
repairs, or construction that cannot be met through normal procurement methods
and policy. An emergency procurement of supplies, services, repairs, or
construction shall be made using as much competition as practical under the
circumstances. Emergency procurement shall be limited to only those supplies,
services, repairs, or construction necessary to mitigate the emergency.
Following an emergency expenditure, and as soon as practicable, a purchase
order shall be submitted by the department for which the emergency purchase was
made. Such purchase orders shall be treated as regular purchase orders and
shall require the appropriate approval signatures as stated in this chapter.
(Ord. 2020-01, 4-14-2020; amd. Ord. 2023-08, 6-27-2023)
2-1-7: CANCELLATION AND REJECTION OF BIDS AND PROPOSALS:
The City reserves the right to cancel an Invitation for Bids, Request for
Proposals, or to reject any or all bids or proposals. Any cancellation or
rejection shall be in writing. If, after cancellation or rejection of all bids
or proposals, the City decides to make the purchase or encumbrance, it shall,
when required by State law, reinitiate the Invitation for Bids or Request for
Proposals process. If after repeating the process, no satisfactory bid or
proposal is received, the City may negotiate or make the improvement or
acquisition or enter such other agreements as it deems necessary or desirable.

may require performance and payment bonds to be provided in such form and
amounts as required by law and by the City as reasonably necessary to protect
the best interest of the City.
   B.   Bid Security. Contracts for construction projects may require a bid
security in an amount equal to at least five percent of the amount of the bid.

contractor for similar supplies or services as deemed appropriate.
   B.   A contract for supplies, services, or construction materials shall have
a stated end date and may be entered into for any stated period of time deemed
to be in the best interest of the City. The term of the contract and the
conditions of renewal or extension, if any, shall be included in the
solicitation. No contract may be renewed indefinitely.
   C.   Payment and performance obligations for succeeding fiscal periods shall
be subject to the availability and appropriations of funds by the City Council.
   D.   Contracts and purchase orders may be amended, modified or supplemented
only by written amendment to the contract or purchase order, executed by the
parties thereto.
   E.   The City Recorder shall countersign all contracts made on behalf of the
City or to which the City is a party. Department heads shall provide the City
Recorder with a fully conformed original copy of all procurement contracts upon
their execution. The City Recorder shall maintain an indexed record of all
procurement contracts.
   F.   In the event a construction project has a change order or a price
variance due to unknown or unforeseen circumstances, conditions, or factors
affecting the outcome of the project, the Chief Procurement Officer shall
notify the City Council of any condition that would exceed 20% of the original
bid amount. Change orders in construction project contracts that cause the
contract price to exceed the total project budget shall not be approved until
reviewed and approved as a budget adjustment by the City Council. (Ord. 2020-
01, 4-14-2020; amd. Ord. 2023-08, 6-27-2023)

   D.   Stay of Proceedings: In the event of a timely protest, the City shall
not proceed further with the solicitation or with the award of the contract or
purchase until the protest is sustained or rejected by the Purchasing Agent,
unless an immediate award of the contract or purchase is required to protect
substantial interests of the City.
   E.   Protest Review: The Purchasing Agent shall determine if the protest is
timely filed. If the Purchasing Agent determines the protest is timely filed,
the protest shall be dismissed if the Purchasing Agent determines the protest
alleges facts that, if true, do not provide an adequate basis for the protest.
Otherwise, the Purchasing Agent shall uphold the protest.
   F.   Appeal: Any person aggrieved of a determination of a Department Head,
the Purchasing Agent or Chief Procurement Officer in connection with the
provisions of this chapter may appeal the determination or action to the City
Council within five business days from the Purchasing Agent’s decision by

real property is a parcel greater than one acre or that has a reasonable value
more than $100,000.
      2.   The Chief Procurement Officer shall make an initial determination
that real property is surplus. Surplus real property may include real property
that is not needed for City infrastructure; property whose cost to maintain
outweighs its value to the City; property that is part of a trade that will
benefit the City, the sale of which will realize significant financial benefits
to the City; or the disposal of which is otherwise in the public interest.
      3.   Before the City may dispose of a significant parcel of real
property, the City shall provide notice and hold a public meeting at which the
City Council shall accept public comment on the proposed disposition.
      4.   All disposal, leases, or subleases of such real property of the City
other than a significant parcel of real property, shall be made, as nearly as
possible, under the same conditions and limitations as required by this chapter
for the purchase of property, including notice and bidding procedures.

terms and conditions as it deems desirable, fair and appropriate, considering
the intended use, property tax value and the interests of the City, the sale of
any surplus real property, through public auction or other method designed to
best serve the interests of City residents and produce a fair return; the trade
or exchange or any surplus real property; or the lease or sublease of any
surplus real property.
   B.   Personal Property.
      1.   Whenever personal property is no longer needed by a City department,
the Department Head having control of such property shall notify the Chief
Procurement Officer or designee. The Chief Procurement Officer or designee
shall notify other City departments of the availability of such property. If
the property is requested, the Chief Procurement Officer or designee shall
supervise the transfer of such property to the department requesting the
property.
      2.   If City personal property becomes surplus, unused, obsolete,
unsuitable for public use, or otherwise no longer needed, the property shall be
disposed of as follows:
         a.   City personal property that is included in the fixed asset
register shall not be disposed of, or sold through public auction, until such
property is declared surplus by the City Council. Once this property is
declared surplus by the City Council, it may be sold to the highest bidder by
the Purchasing Agent through an approved public auction service provider or
through public auction.
         b.   City personal property that was not originally included in the
fixed asset register may be sold to the highest bidder by the Purchasing Agent
through an approved public auction service provider or by conducting a public
auction.
      The Chief Procurement Officer shall have the right to reject any bids or
offers for City personal property when in the best interest of the City.
         c.   If a surplus item remains unsold after reasonable attempts to
sell it through public auction, the Chief Procurement Officer may sell the
surplus item to any person for such price as the Chief Procurement Officer
deems appropriate or may dispose of the item at the Chief Procurement Officer’s
discretion.
         d.   Personal property that is fully consumed in its use for official
City business shall be disposed of in any reasonable manner approved by the
Purchasing Agent.
         e.   Monetary proceeds from the sale or other disposition of items
pursuant to this section which were an enterprise fund asset or purchased with
enterprise fund revenues shall be credited to the respective enterprise fund.
All other proceeds shall be credited to the City’s general fund.
         f.   Where personal property is of such a size, shape, or is so unique
as to be unmarketable, the requirements of this section may be waived and such
property may be sold or otherwise disposed of in any reasonable manner, with
the approval of the City Council. (Ord. 2020-01, 4-14-2020; amd. Ord. 2023-08,
6-27-2023)

not been constructed and are required to be consistent with the City's general
plan and to protect the public's health, safety, and welfare.

imposition and collection of impact fees pursuant to law that require
development to pay its fair share of the cost of providing public facilities
occasioned by the demands and needs of the development project at service
levels necessary to promote and preserve the public health, safety, and
welfare.
   C.   The impact fees established by this chapter are based upon the costs
which are generated through the need for new facilities and other capital
acquisition costs required, incrementally, by new development within the City.
   D.   The impact fees established by this chapter do not exceed the
reasonable cost of providing public facilities occasioned by development
projects within the City.

Basin Water Conservancy District's treated water impact fee for developments
creating additional demand on that system and remit the same to each respective

   C.   Impact fees are hereby levied for the City service area for the systems
identified in this section as set forth in the City's consolidated fee

3-8-1: PURPOSE:
Residents of South Weber City have an inalienable interest in their personal
safety, well being, and privacy in their residences, as well as their ability
to provide or receive information regarding matters of personal belief,
political or charitable activities, and goods and services lawfully in
commerce. The city has a substantial interest in protecting the well being,
tranquility, personal safety, and privacy of its citizens, which includes the
ability to protect citizens from unwanted intrusions upon residential property.
The city also has a substantial interest in protecting citizens from fraud or
otherwise unfair consumer sales practices as well as criminal activity.
There must be a balance between these substantial interests of the city and its
citizens, and the effect of the regulations in this chapter on the rights of
those who are regulated. Based on the collective experiences of city officials
derived from regulating business activity, protecting persons and property from
criminal conduct, responding to the inquiries of citizens regarding door to
door solicitation, the experience of its law enforcement officers and those
affected by door to door canvassing and solicitation, as well as judicial
decisions outlining the boundaries of constitutional protections afforded and
denied persons seeking to engage in door to door solicitation, the city adopts
this chapter to promote the city's substantial interests in:
   A.   Respecting citizens' decisions regarding privacy in their residences;
   B.   Protecting persons from criminal conduct;
   C.   Providing equal opportunity to advocate for and against religious
belief, political position, or charitable activities; and
   D.   Permitting truthful and nonmisleading door to door solicitation

submitted by the applicant or registered solicitor to the licensing officer,
any additional information relied upon by the licensing officer as the basis
for denial, suspension or revocation, and any additional information supplied
by the city, applicant or registered solicitor. Any additional information
submitted by any party to the appeal to the appeals officer shall be
simultaneously submitted to the opposing party. If desired, any party shall
have three (3) business days to submit rebuttal documentation to the appeals
officer regarding the additional information submitted by the opposing party.
   D.   The appeals officer will render a decision no later than fifteen (15)
calendar days from the date the appeal was taken, unless an extension of time

(3) days for rebuttal.

appeals officer if upon review of the written appeal and information submitted,
the appeals officer finds that the licensing officer made a material mistake of
law or fact in denying or suspending the applicant's or registered solicitor's
certificate.
      2.   If the written appeal and information submitted indicates that the
licensing officer properly denied or suspended the certificate of the applicant
or registered solicitor, the denial or suspension of the certificate shall be
affirmed and constitute a determination that the suspended certificate is
revoked.

applicant or registered solicitor by the means designated in the completed
application, or as otherwise agreed upon when the appeal was filed.

4-8-4: STANDARDS FOR MEASURING SOUND LEVELS:
The following standards shall apply to the measurement of sound levels pursuant
to sections
   A.   Insofar as practicable, sound will be measured while the source under
investigation is operating at normal, routine conditions and, as necessary, at
other conditions, including, but not limited to, design, maximum, and
fluctuating rates.
   B.   When a noise source can be identified and measured in more than one
type of premises, the limits of the most restrictive use shall apply at the
property line between different premises types.
   C.   All tests shall be conducted in accordance with the following
procedures:
      1.   The enforcement officer shall, to the extent practicable, identify
all sources contributing sound to the point of measurement.
      2.   Measurements shall be taken at or within the property line of the
receiving property; provided that whenever it is impossible or impractical to
measure at the property line, a greater distance from the noise source shall be
used to determine compliance with this chapter.
      3.   The Sound Level Meter (SLM) must be calibrated in accordance with
manufacturer specifications.
      4.   No outdoor measurements shall be taken:
         a.   During periods when wind speeds (including gusts) exceed fifteen
miles per hour (15 mph);
         b.   Without a windscreen, recommended by the SLM manufacturer,
properly attached to the SLM;
         c.   Under any condition that allows the SLM to become wet (e.g.,
rain, snow, or condensation); or
         d.   When the ambient temperature is out of the range of the tolerance
of the SLM.
   D.   The report for each measurement shall include:
      1.   The date, day of the week, and times at which measurements are
taken;
      2.   The times of calibration;
      3.   The weather conditions;
      4.   The identification of all monitoring equipment by manufacturer,
model number, and serial number;
      5.   The normal operating cycle of the sources in question with a
description of the sources;
      6.   The ambient sound level, in dBA, with the sources in question
operating;
      7.   The background sound level, in dBA, without the sources in question
operating; and
      8.   A sketch of the measurement site, including measurement locations
and relevant distances, containing sufficient information for another
investigator to repeat the measurements under similar conditions.
   E.   Prior to taking measurements the enforcement officer shall explore the
vicinity of the source in question to identify any other sound sources that
could affect measurements, to establish the approximate location and character
of the principal sound source, and to select suitable locations from which to
measure the sound from the source in question.
   F.   When measuring continuous sound, or sound that is sustained for more
than one second at a time, the SLM shall be set for A-weighting, slow meter
response speed, and the range (if the SLM is designed to read levels over
different ranges of sound pressure levels (SPL) shall be set to that range in
which the meter reads closest to the maximum end of the scale. When the
measured sound level is variable or fluctuating over a range greater than +3
dBA, using the slow meter response speed, the fast meter response speed shall
be used. In either case, both the minimum and maximum readings shall be
recorded to indicate the range of monitored values.
   G.   The SLM shall be placed at a minimum height of three feet (3') above
the ground or from any reflective surface. When handheld, the microphone shall
be held at arm's length and pointed at the source at the angle recommended by
the SLM manufacturer.
   H.   If extraneous sound sources, such as aircraft flyovers or barking dogs,
that are unrelated to the measurements increase the monitored sound levels, the
measurements should be postponed until these extraneous sounds have become of
such a level as not to increase the monitored sound levels of interest.
   I.   The monitoring session should last for a period of time sufficient to
ensure that the sound levels measured are typical of the source in question.
   J.   The background sound levels shall be subtracted from the measured sound
levels of the source of interest by using table 1 of this section to determine
the sound levels from the source of interest alone. If the ambient sound level
is less than 3 dBA higher than the background sound level, the source level
cannot be derived, and a violation of this chapter cannot be substantiated.

4-8-5: SOUND LEVEL LIMITATIONS:
   A.   No person shall cause, suffer, allow, or permit the operation of any
sound source in such a manner as to create a sound level that exceeds the
background sound level by at least ten (10) dBA during daytime hours (7:00 A.M.
to 10:00 P.M.) and by at least five (5) dBA during nighttime hours (10:00 P.M.
to 7:00 A.M.) when measured at or within the property line of the receiving
property, except as otherwise provided in subsection B of this section.
   B.   If the background sound level cannot be determined, the absolute sound
level limits set forth in table 2 of this section shall be used.
   C.   If the sound source in question is a pure tone, the limits of table 2
of this section shall be reduced by five (5) dBA.

excavation to be performed under a permit; provided, however, that the holder
of the permit shall be and remain responsible for the performance of the
excavation under the permit, and for all bonding, insurance and other
requirements of this chapter and under said permit. (Ord. 98-22, 9-22-1998)
7-3-8: GENERAL STANDARDS:
   A.   Environmental And Deposition Controls:
      1.   Dust And Debris: The permittee or contractor shall keep dust and
debris controlled at the work site at all times. If necessary, the work site
shall be wet down to control dust and containers shall be provided for all
debris. The city reserves the right to shut down the work or issue a citation
if dust is not controlled.
      2.   Noise: The permittee or contractor shall keep noise to a minimum as
determined by the public works director.
      3.   Cleanup: The permittee or contractor shall remove all equipment,
material, barricades, and similar items or other debris from the right of way
areas used.
      4.   Water Not To Be Discharged On Streets: It shall be unlawful for any
person or organization owning, occupying or having control of any premises
within the city to suffer or permit water to be discharged upon the surface of
any street right of way to the point where the public works director deems it a
hazard or a nuisance to the community.
      5.   Depositing Material On Streets Prohibited: It shall be unlawful for
any person or organization intentionally or carelessly to throw, cast, deposit,
put into, or leave, or allow the same, in any street, gutter, public right of
way, or public place, any stones, gravel, sand, cement, coal, dirt, manure,
snow, garbage, leaves, lawn or hedge clippings, or rubbish of any kind, or any
other substance which in the opinion of the public works director shall render
any such street, gutter, public right of way, or public place unsafe, or
unsightly, or shall interfere with travel thereon.
   B.   Excavation Operations:
      1.   Blue Stakes: Before commencing excavation operations, the permittee
shall call "Blue Stakes" at 1-800-662-4111. The contractor shall use extreme
caution to avoid a conflict, contact or damage to existing utilities such as
power lines, sewer lines, storm drains, streetlights, telephone lines,
television cable lines, water lines, gas lines, poles, survey monuments or
other appurtenances during the course of construction. Any such conflict,
contact or damage shall be immediately communicated to the city.
      2.   Traffic Control Devices: Traffic control devices must be in place
before excavating begins and must be installed in accordance with the current
edition of the "Manual On Uniform Traffic Control Devices" (MUTCD).
      3.   Protection Of Paved Surfaces Outside Of Excavation Area: In order to
avoid unnecessary damage to paved surfaces, backhoes, outriggers, track
equipment or any other construction equipment that may prove damaging to
asphalt shall use rubber cleats or paving pads when operating on or crossing
said surfaces.
      4.   Open Trench Limits: Open trenches will be limited to one thousand
feet (1,000'). No excavation shall be allowed to continue until the one
thousand feet (1,000') of trench has been restored with proper asphalt surface.
   C.   Utility Drawing Requirements: Whenever the work involves the extension,
placement or the relocation of a utility easement, two (2) copies of the
drawings shall be provided for the city engineer for approval which detail the
location and type of the proposed facility. Work involving maintenance of
existing facilities or placement of laterals does not require a drawing.
   D.   Street Excavation In Winter: Excavation of city streets during the
winter months (herein defined as November 15 to April 1) will be allowed only
if the work is a new service connection, required maintenance or emergency, or
otherwise approved by the city. Permanent patching of a city street excavated
in winter may be delayed until April 1, provided the permittee maintains a
temporary untreated base course surface until such time as the permanent
surfacing is accomplished. This provision applies regardless of whether the
permittee or city crews are performing the permanent resurfacing. (Ord. 09-02,
3-10-2009)
7-3-9: TIME LIMIT FOR COMPLETION:
All work provided under this chapter must be completed within seven (7)
calendar days from the date of first excavation, unless otherwise requested and
authorized on the application. All roads are to be restored to a passable and
safe condition within twelve (12) hours of completion. If, within the standard
seven (7) days or other time limit authorized by the city, the road cut or
excavation has not been repaired as required, the city may revoke the
excavation bond and cause the repairs to be made. The costs of repairs shall
include administrative costs. (Ord. 09-02, 3-10-2009)
7-3-10: ONE YEAR GUARANTEE:
The applicant, his/her contractor, and agent will maintain and be responsible
for the excavation performed under the permit for a period of one year from the
date of completion and will assume full responsibility for any injury or
settling in any portion of the public right of way in which they have worked.
Should the applicant within said year receive notice from the city that the
work they have performed under their permit has settled, raised, or
deteriorated, the applicant will immediately place barricades to protect the
traveling public, and will within seven (7) business days, unless otherwise
authorized by the city, repair the work at the point of construction placing it
back in a condition equal to its original condition. Should the applicant or
the contractor or agency fail to do this within seven (7) business days, the
city shall have the authority, without further notice, to employ a third party
contractor to repair the work. The city may also choose to perform the
necessary work with their own work crews. The city will first use funds held
within the escrow account to pay for the work performed. In the event that
escrow funds are insufficient to pay for the work performed, the applicant and
his contractor, upon notice from the city, will immediately pay the city the
remaining amount for the work performed. (Ord. 09-02, 3-10-2009)
7-3-11: RELOCATION OF STRUCTURES IN PUBLIC WAYS:
   A.   The city may direct any person owning or maintaining facilities or
structures in the public way to alter, modify or relocate such facilities or
structures as the city may require. Sewers, pipes, drains, tunnels, conduits,
pipe driveways, vaults, trash receptacles and overhead and underground gas,
electric, telephone, telecommunication and communication facilities shall
specifically be subject to such directives. The person owning or maintaining
the facilities or structures shall, at their own cost and expense and upon
reasonable written notice by the city, promptly protect, or promptly alter or
relocate such facilities or structures, or part thereof, as directed by the
city. In the event that such person refuses or neglects to conform to the
directive of the city, the city shall have the right to break through, remove,
alter or relocate such part of the facilities or structures without liability
to such person. Such person shall pay to the city all costs incurred by the
city in connection with such excavation performed by the city, including also
design, engineering, construction, materials, insurance, court costs and
attorney fees.
   B.   Any directive by the city shall be based upon one of the following:
      1.   The facility or structure was installed, erected or is being
maintained contrary to law, or is determined by the city to be structurally
unsound or defective;
      2.   The facility or structure constitutes a nuisance as defined under
state statute or city ordinance;
      3.   The permit under which the facility or structure was installed has
expired or has been revoked;
      4.   The public way is about to be repaired or improved and such
facilities or structures may pose a hindrance to construction; or
      5.   The grades or lines of the public way are to be altered or changed.
   C.   Any person owning or maintaining facilities or structures in the public
way who fails to alter, modify or relocate such facilities or structures upon
notice to do so by the city shall be guilty of a class B misdemeanor. All costs
of alteration, modification or relocation shall be borne by the person owning
or maintaining the facilities or structures involved.
   D.   Any directive of the city under this section shall be under and
consistent with the city's police power. Unless an emergency condition exists,
the city shall make a good faith effort to consult with the person regarding
any condition that may result in a removal or relocation of facilities in the
public way to consider possible avoidance or minimization of removal or
relocation requirements and provide the directive as far enough in advance of
the required removal or relocation to allow the person a reasonable opportunity
to plan and minimize cost associated with the required removal or relocation.
   E.   This obligation does not apply to facilities or structures originally
located on private property pursuant to a private easement, which property was
later incorporated into the public way, if that prior private easement grants a
superior vested right.
   F.   The city may, at any time, in case of fire, disaster or other
emergency, as determined by the city in its reasonable discretion, cut or move
any parts of the system and appurtenances on, over or under the public way, in
which event the city shall not be liable therefor to a person. The city shall
notify a person in writing prior to, if practicable, but in any event as soon
as possible and in no case later than the next business day following any
action taken under this subsection. (Ord. 98-22, 9-22-1998; amd. Ord. 09-02, 3-

   B.   A suspension or revocation by the city, and a stop order, shall take
effect immediately upon entry thereof by the public works director and notice
to the person performing the excavation in the public way. Notice to the person
performing the excavation shall be accomplished when the public works director
has posted a stop work order at the location of the excavation and written
notice has been mailed, return receipt requested, to the address indicated by
the permittee on the permit.
   C.   Whenever the city finds that a default has occurred in the performance
of any term or condition of the permit, written notice thereof may be given to
the principal and to the escrow agent if there is an escrow. Such notice shall
state the excavation to be done, the estimated cost thereof, and the period of
time deemed by the city to be reasonably necessary for the completion of the
excavation.
   D.   In the event that the principal or escrow agent, within a reasonable
time following the giving of such notice (taking into consideration the
exigencies of the situation, the nature of the excavation, the requirements of
public safety and for the protection of persons and property), fails either to
commence and cause the required excavation to be performed with due diligence,
or to indemnify the city for the cost of doing the excavation, as set forth in
the notice, the city may perform the excavation, at the discretion of the
public works director, with city personnel or independent contractors or both,
and suit may be commenced by the city against the principal or escrow agent,
and such other persons as may be liable, to recover the entire amount due to
the city, including attorney fees, on account thereof. In the event that cash
has been deposited, the cost of performing the excavation may be charged
against the amount deposited, and suit brought for the balance due, if any.

otherwise complying with the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 98-22, 9-22-
1998; amd. Ord. 09-02, 3-10-2009)
7-3-18: EXCAVATIONS FEE CALCULATION:
This section has been prepared in order to demonstrate the process by which the
following fees were calculated:
   A.   Explanation: It is assumed that a brand new road has a design life of
approximately fifteen (15) years. Meaning that if new pavement is installed,
receives the proper maintenance (crack seal, seal coats, etc.), and is not cut
or compromised in any way, it will last approximately fifteen (15) years before
another overlay is needed. If the road is cut, however, the design life of the
road is compromised. The road is now more susceptible to water getting
underneath the asphalt. This allows damage to the road due to freeze/thaw
situations as well as degradation of the base and possibly subbase material.
The square footage of the excavation site restoration is measured to be the
impact on the road. The age of the road being cut has also been considered. If
the road is less than two (2) years old, the design life is shortened more than
if the road is older than two (2) years old.
For the purpose of calculating the fee, the following assumptions have been
made: If a road that is less than two (2) years old is cut, the design life has
been shortened by approximately six (6) years (or 40 percent); if a road that
is older than two (2) years old is cut, the design life has been shortened by
approximately four (4) years (or 25 percent). Also, even though potholes have
minimal square footage, the impact on the road is still the same. Therefore, in
order to adequately compensate for the diminished road integrity of the road,
the fee is the same for all small excavations of one hundred (100) square feet
or less. The following equations represent how the fees are being calculated:
(The following variables and equations are for illustration purpose only. For
actual figures, see current consolidated fee schedule on file with the city.)
Variables:
 
NPC  = New pavement cost = $2.80/s.f.
SSFF = Small square footage compensation factor, less than 2' x 2' = 0.045
TSF  = Total square footage of excavation site restoration
L2F  = Roads less than 2 years old factor = 40% = 0.4
M2F  = Roads more than 2 years old factor = 25% = 0.25
 
   B.   Inspection Fee: This is the cost of the estimated time required for
city staff to inspect the work being performed and give additional direction if
the work being performed is inadequate.
   C.   Diminished Road Integrity Fee:
      Equations:
      Potholes (100 s.f. or less) on roads Less than 2 years old
      = (NPC * 100 s.f. * L2F) / SSFF = ($2.80 * 100 s.f. * 0.4) / 0.045 = $112
      Potholes (100 s.f. or less) on roads More than 2 years old
      = (NPC * 100 s.f. * M2F) / SSFF = ($2.80 * 100 s.f. * 0.25) / 0.045 = $70
      Diminished road integrity fee on roads Less than 2 years old
      = NPC * L2F * TSF = $2.80 * 0.4 * TSF = $1.12 * TSF
      Diminished road integrity fee on roads More than 2 years old
      = NPC * M2F * TSF = $2.80 * 0.25 * TSF = $0.70 * TSF
   D.   Financial Guarantee:
      Equation:
      Escrow amount = NPC * TSF = $2.80 * TSF

known as cellular and PCS services that do not install any system or portion of
a system in the rights-of-way.
   PROVIDER: An operator, infrastructure provider, resaler, or system lessee.

(Ord. 98-3, 2-10-1998)
7-6-3: FRANCHISE REQUIRED:
   A.   Nonexclusive Franchise: The City is empowered and authorized to issue
nonexclusive franchises governing the installation, construction, and
maintenance of systems in the City's rights-of-way, in accordance with the
provisions of this Chapter. The franchise is granted through a franchise
agreement entered into between the City and provider.
   B.   Every Provider Must Obtain: Except to the extent preempted by Federal
or State law, as ultimately interpreted by a court of competent jurisdiction,
including any appeals, every provider must obtain a franchise prior to
constructing a telecommunications system or providing telecommunications
services using the rights-of-way, and every provider must obtain a franchise
before constructing an open video system or providing open video services via
an open video system. Any open video system or service shall be subject to the
customer service and consumer protection provisions applicable to the cable TV
companies to the extent the City is not preempted or permitted as ultimately
interpreted by a court of competent jurisdiction, including any appeals. The
fact that particular telecommunications systems may be used for multiple
purposes does not obviate the need to obtain a franchise for other purposes. By
way of illustration and not limitation, a cable operator of a cable system must
obtain a cable franchise, and, should it intend to provide telecommunications
services over the same system, must also obtain a telecommunications franchise.
   C.   Nature Of Grant: A franchise shall not convey title, equitable or
legal, in the rights-of-way. A franchise is only the right to occupy rights-of-
way on a nonexclusive basis for the limited purposes and for the limited period
stated in the franchise; the right may not be subdivided, assigned, or
subleased. A franchise does not excuse a provider from obtaining appropriate
access or pole attachment agreements before collocating its system on the
property of others, including the City's property. This Section shall not be
construed to prohibit a provider from leasing conduit to another provider, so
long as the lessee has obtained a franchise.
   D.   Current Providers: Except to the extent exempted by Federal or State
law, any provider acting without a franchise on the effective date of this
Chapter shall request issuance of a franchise from the City within ninety (90)
days of the effective date of this Chapter. If such request is made, the
provider may continue providing service during the course of negotiations. If a
timely request is not made, or if negotiations cease and a franchise is not
granted, the provider shall comply with the provisions of subsection
7-6-9D of this Chapter.
   E.   Nature Of Franchise: The franchise granted by the City under the
provisions of this Chapter shall be a nonexclusive franchise providing the
right and consent to install, repair, maintain, remove and replace its system
on, over and under the rights-of-way in order to provide services.
   F.   Regulatory Approval Needed: Before offering or providing any services
pursuant to the franchise, a provider shall obtain any and all regulatory
approvals, permits, authorizations or licenses for the offering or provision of
such services from the appropriate Federal, State and local authorities, if
required, and shall submit to the City upon the written request of the City
evidence of all such approvals, permits, authorizations or licenses.
   G.   Term: No franchise issued pursuant to this Chapter shall have a term of
less than five (5) years, or greater than fifteen (15) years. Each franchise
shall be granted in a nondiscriminatory manner. (Ord. 98-3, 2-10-1998)
7-6-4: COMPENSATION AND OTHER PAYMENTS:
   A.   Compensation: As fair and reasonable compensation for any franchise
granted pursuant to this Chapter, a provider shall have the following
obligations:
      1.   Application Fee: In order to offset the cost to the City to review
an application for a franchise and in addition to all other fees, permits or
charges, a provider shall pay to the City, at the time of application, five
hundred dollars ($500.00) as a nonrefundable application fee.
      2.   Franchise Fees: The franchise fee, if any, shall be set forth in the
franchise agreement. The obligation to pay a franchise fee shall commence on
the completion date. The franchise fee is offset by any business license fee or
business license tax enacted by the City.
      3.   Excavation Permits: The provider shall also pay fees required for an
excavation permit as provided in Section
7-3-1 of this Title.
   B.   Timing: Unless otherwise agreed to in the franchise agreement, all
franchise fees shall be paid on a monthly basis within forty five (45) days of
the close of each calendar month.
   C.   Fee Statement And Certification: Unless a franchise agreement provides
otherwise, each fee payment shall be accompanied by a statement showing the
manner in which the fee was calculated and shall be certified as to its
accuracy.
   D.   Future Costs: A provider shall pay to the City or to third parties, at
the direction of the City, an amount equal to the reasonable costs and
reasonable expenses that the City incurs for the services of third parties
(including, but not limited to, attorneys and other consultants) in connection
with any renewal or provider-initiated renegotiation, or amendment of this
Chapter or a franchise; provided, however, that the parties shall agree upon a
reasonable financial cap at the outset of negotiations. In the event the
parties are unable to agree, either party may submit the issue to binding
arbitration in accordance with the rules and procedures of the American
Arbitration Association.
   E.   Taxes And Assessments: To the extent taxes or other assessments are
imposed by taxing authorities, other than the City on the use of the City
property as a result of a provider's use or occupation of the rights-of-way,
the provider shall be responsible for payment of its pro rata share of such
taxes, payable annually unless otherwise required by the taxing authority. Such
payments shall be in addition to any other fees payable pursuant to this
Chapter.
   F.   Interest On Late Payments: In the event that any payment is not
actually received by the City on or before the applicable date fixed in the
franchise, interest thereon shall accrue from such date until received at the
rate charged for delinquent State taxes.
   G.   No Accord And Satisfaction: No acceptance by the City of any fee shall
be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount,
nor shall such acceptance of such fee payment be construed as a release of any
claim the City may have for additional sums payable.
   H.   Not In Lieu Of Other Taxes Or Fees: The fee payment is not a payment in
lieu of any tax, fee or other assessment except as specifically provided in
this Chapter, or as required by applicable law. By way of example, and not
limitation, excavation permit fees and fees to obtain space on the City- owned
poles are not waived and remain applicable.
   I.   Continuing Obligation And Holdover: In the event a provider continues
to operate all or any part of the system after the term of the franchise, such
operator shall continue to comply with all applicable provisions of this
Chapter and the franchise, including, without limitation, all compensation and
other payment provisions throughout the period of such continued operation,
provided that any such continued operation shall in no way be construed as a
renewal or other extension of the franchise, nor as a limitation on the
remedies, if any, available to the City as a result of such continued operation
after the term, including, but not limited to, damages and restitution.
   J.   Costs Of Publication: A provider shall assume any publication costs
associated with its franchise that may be required by law. (Ord. 98-3, 2-10-
1998)
7-6-5: FRANCHISE APPLICATIONS:
   A.   Franchise Application: To obtain a franchise to construct, own,
maintain or provide services through any system within the City, to obtain a
renewal of a franchise granted pursuant to this Chapter, or to obtain the City
approval of a transfer of a franchise, as provided in subsection
7-6-7A2 of this Chapter, granted pursuant to this Chapter, an application must
be filed with City on the form attached to Ordinance 98-3 as Exhibit A, which
is hereby incorporated by reference. The application form may be changed by the
Mayor, so long as such changes request information that is consistent with this
Chapter. Such application form, as amended, is incorporated by reference.
   B.   Application Criteria: In making a determination as to an application
filed pursuant to this Chapter, the City may, but shall not be limited to,
request the following from the provider:
      1.   A copy of the order from the PSC granting a certificate of
convenience and necessity;
      2.   Certification of the provider's financial ability to compensate the
City for provider's intrusion, maintenance and use of the rights-of-way during
the franchise term proposed by the provider;
      3.   Provider's agreement to comply with the requirements of Section
7-6-6 of this Chapter.
   C.   Franchise Determination: The City, in its discretion, shall determine
the award of any franchise on the basis of these and other considerations
relevant to the use of the rights-of-way, without competitive bidding. (Ord.
98-3, 2-10-1998)
7-6-6: CONSTRUCTION AND TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   General Requirement: No provider shall receive a franchise unless it
agrees to comply with each of the terms set forth in this Section governing
construction and technical requirements for its system, in addition to any
other reasonable requirements or procedures specified by the City or the
franchise, including requirements regarding locating and sharing in the cost of
locating portions of the system with other systems or with City utilities. A
provider shall obtain an excavation permit, pursuant to the Excavation
Ordinance, before commencing any work in the rights-of-way.
   B.   Quality: All work involved in the construction, maintenance, repair,
upgrade and removal of the system shall be performed in a safe, thorough and
reliable manner using materials of good and durable quality. If, at any time,
it is determined by the FCC or any other agency granted authority by Federal
law, or the FCC to make such determination, that any part of the system,
including, without limitation, any means used to distribute signals over or
within the system, is harmful to the public health, safety or welfare, or
quality of service or reliability, then a provider shall, at its own cost and
expense, promptly correct all such conditions.
   C.   Licenses And Permits: A provider shall have the sole responsibility for
diligently obtaining, at its own cost and expense, all permits, licenses or
other forms of approval or authorization necessary to construct, maintain,
upgrade or repair the system, including, but not limited to, any necessary
approvals from persons and/or the City to use private property, easements,
poles and conduits. A provider shall obtain any required permit, license,
approval or authorization, including, but not limited to, excavation permits,
pole attachment agreements, etc., prior to the commencement of the activity for
which the permit, license, approval or authorization is required.
   D.   Relocation Of The System:
      1.   New Grades Or Lines: If the grades or lines of any rights- of-way
are changed at any time in a manner affecting the system, then a provider shall
comply with the requirements of the Excavation Ordinance.
      2.   The City Authority To Move System In Case Of An Emergency: The City
may, at any time, in case of fire, disaster or other emergency, as determined
by the City in its reasonable discretion, cut or move any parts of the system
and appurtenances on, over or under the rights-of-way of the City, in which
event the City shall not be liable therefor to a provider. The City shall
notify a provider in writing prior to, if practicable, but in any event as soon
as possible and in no case later than the next business day following any
action taken under this Section. Notice shall be given as provided in
subsection
7-6-11D of this Chapter.
      3.   A Provider Required To Temporarily Move System For Third Party: A
provider shall, upon prior reasonable written notice by the City or any person
holding a permit to move any structure, and within the time that is reasonable
under the circumstances, temporarily move any part of its system to permit the
moving of said structure. A provider may impose a reasonable charge on any
person other than the City for any such movement of its systems.
      4.   Rights-Of-Way Change; Obligation To Move System: When the City is
changing a rights-of-way and makes a written request, a provider is required to
move or remove its system from the rights-of-way, without cost to the City, to
the extent provided in the Excavation Ordinance. This obligation does not apply
to systems originally located on private property pursuant to a private
easement, which property was later incorporated into the rights-of-way, if that
private easement grants a superior vested right. This obligation exists whether
or not the provider has obtained an excavation permit.
   E.   Protect Structures: In connection with the construction, maintenance,
repair, upgrade or removal of the system, a provider shall, at its own cost and
expense, protect any and all existing structures belonging to the City. A
provider shall obtain the prior written consent of the City to alter any water
main, power facility, sewerage or drainage system, or any other Municipal
structure on, over or under the rights- of-way of the City required because of
the presence of the system. Any such alteration shall be made by the City or
its designee on a reimbursable basis. A provider agrees that it shall be liable
for the costs incurred by the City to replace or repair and restore to its
prior condition in a manner as may be reasonably specified by the City, any
Municipal structure or any other rights-of-way of the City involved in the
construction, maintenance, repair, upgrade or removal of the system that may
become disturbed or damaged as a result of any work thereon by or on behalf of
a provider pursuant to the franchise.
   F.   No Obstruction: In connection with the construction, maintenance,
upgrade, repair or removal of the system, a provider shall not unreasonably
obstruct the rights-of-way of fixed guide way systems, railways, passenger
travel, or other traffic to, from or within the City without the prior consent
of the appropriate authorities.
   G.   Safety Precautions: A provider shall, at its own cost and expense,
undertake all necessary and appropriate efforts to prevent accidents at its
work sites, including the placing and maintenance of proper guards, fences,
barricades, security personnel and suitable and sufficient lighting, and such
other requirements prescribed by OSHA and Utah OSHA. A provider shall comply
with all applicable Federal, State and local requirements including, but not
limited to, the National Electrical Safety Code.
   H.   Repair: After written reasonable notice to the provider, unless, in the
sole determination of the City, an imminent danger exists, any rights-of-way
within the City which are disturbed or damaged during the construction,
maintenance or reconstruction by a provider of its system may be repaired by
the City at the provider's expense, to a condition as good as that prevailing
before such work was commenced. Upon doing so, the City shall submit to such a
provider an itemized statement of the cost for repairing and restoring the
rights-of-way intruded upon. The provider shall, within thirty (30) days after
receipt of the statement, pay to the City the entire amount thereof.
   I.   System Maintenance: A provider shall:
      1.   Install and maintain all parts of its system in a nondangerous
condition throughout the entire period of its franchise.
      2.   Install and maintain its system in accordance with standard prudent
engineering practices and shall conform, when applicable, with the National
Electrical Safety Code and all other applicable Federal, State and local laws
or regulations.
      3.   At all reasonable times, permit examination by any duly authorized
representative of the City of the system and its effect on the rights-of-way.
   J.   Trimming Of Trees: A provider shall have the authority to trim trees,
in accordance with all applicable utility restrictions, ordinance and easement
restrictions, upon and hanging over rights-of-way so as to prevent the branches
of such trees from coming in contact with its system. (Ord. 98-3, 2-10-1998)
7-6-7: FRANCHISE AND LICENSE NONTRANSFERABLE:
   A.   Notification Of Sale:
      1.   Notification And Election: When a provider is the subject of a sale,
transfer, lease, assignment, sublease or disposed of, in whole or in part,
either by forced or involuntary sale, or by ordinary sale, consolidation or
otherwise, such that it or its successor entity is obligated to inform or seek
the approval of the PSC, the provider or its successor entity shall promptly
notify the City of the nature of the transaction. The notification shall
include either:
         a.   The successor entity's certification that the successor entity
unequivocally agrees to all of the terms of the original provider's franchise
agreement; or
         b.   The successor entity's application in compliance with Section
7-6-5 of this Chapter.
      2.   Transfer Of Franchise: Upon receipt of a notification and
certification in accordance with subsection A1a of this Section, the City
designee, as provided in subsection
7-6-9A1 of this Chapter, shall send notice affirming the transfer of the
franchise to the successor entity. If the City has good cause to believe that
the successor entity may not comply with this Chapter or the franchise
agreement, it may require an application for the transfer. The application
shall comply with Section
7-6-5 of this Chapter.
      3.   If PSC Approval No Longer Required: If the PSC no longer exists, or
if its regulations or State law no longer require approval of transactions
described in this subsection A, and the City has good cause to believe that the
successor entity may not comply with this Chapter or the franchise agreement,
it may require an application. The application shall comply with Section
7-6-5 of this Chapter.
   B.   Events Of Sale: The following events shall be deemed to be a sale,
assignment or other transfer of the franchise requiring compliance with
subsection A of this Section: 1) the sale, assignment or other transfer of all
or a majority of a provider's assets to another person; 2) the sale, assignment
or other transfer of capital stock or partnership, membership or other equity
interests in a provider by one or more of its existing shareholders, partners,
members or other equity owners so as to create a new controlling interest in a
provider; 3) the issuance of additional capital stock or partnership,
membership or other equity interest by a provider so as to create a new
controlling interest in such a provider; or 4) the entry by a provider into an
agreement with respect to the management or operation of such provider or its
system. (Ord. 98-3, 2-10-1998)
7-6-8: OVERSIGHT AND REGULATION:
   A.   Insurance, Indemnity, And Security: Prior to the execution of a
franchise, a provider will deposit with the City an irrevocable, unconditional
letter of credit or surety bond as required by the terms of the franchise, and
shall obtain and provide proof of the insurance coverage required by the
franchise. A provider shall also indemnify the City as set forth in the
franchise.
   B.   Oversight: The City shall have the right to oversee, regulate and
inspect periodically the construction, maintenance, and upgrade of the system,
and any part thereof, in accordance with the provisions of the franchise and
applicable law. A provider shall establish and maintain managerial and
operational records, standards, procedures and controls to enable a provider to
prove, in reasonable detail, to the satisfaction of the City at all times
throughout the term, that a provider is in compliance with the franchise. A
provider shall retain such records for not less than the applicable statute of
limitations.

electronic format, they shall be made in electronic format compatible with the
City's existing GIS system, of all existing and proposed installations and the
types of equipment and systems installed or constructed in the rights-of-way,
properly identified and described as to the types of equipment and facility by
appropriate symbols and marks which shall include annotations of all rights-of-
way where work will be undertaken. As used herein, "as-built" maps includes
"file construction prints". Maps shall be drawn to scale. "As-built" maps,
including the compatible electronic format, as provided above, shall be
submitted within thirty (30) days of completion of work or within thirty (30)
days after completion of modification and repairs. "As-built" maps are not
required of the provider who is the incumbent local exchange carrier for the
existing system to the extent they do not exist.
      2.   Throughout the term of the franchise, a provider shall maintain
complete and accurate books of account and records of the business, ownership,
and operations of a provider with respect to the system in a manner that allows
the City at all times to determine whether a provider is in compliance with the
franchise. Should the City reasonably determine that the records are not being
maintained in such a manner, a provider shall alter the manner in which the
books and/or records are maintained so that a provider comes into compliance
with this Section. All financial books and records which are maintained in
accordance with the regulations of the FCC and any governmental entity that
regulates utilities in the State, and generally accepted accounting principles
shall be deemed to be acceptable under this Section.
   D.   Confidentiality: If the information required to be submitted is

law, upon proper request by a provider, such information shall be classified as
a protected record within the meaning of the Utah Government Records Access and
Management Act ("GRAMA"), making it available only to those who must have

the books and records of the provider more often than annually. The provider
agrees to reimburse the City the reasonable costs of an audit if the audit
discloses that the provider has paid ninety five percent (95%) or less of the
compensation due the City for the period of such audit. In the event the
accounting rendered to the City by the provider herein is found to be
incorrect, then payment shall be made on the corrected amount within thirty
(30) calendar days of written notice, it being agreed that the City may accept
any amount offered by the provider, but the acceptance thereof by the City

known address of provider; b) any system has been installed in the rights-of-
way without complying with the requirements of this Chapter or franchise; or c)
the provisions of subsection

      2.   Removal Of Abandoned System: The City, upon such terms as it may
impose, may give a provider written permission to abandon, without removing,

provided in this Chapter, a provider shall remove within a reasonable time the
abandoned system and shall restore, using prudent construction standards, any
affected rights-of-way to their former state at the time such system was
installed, so as not to impair their usefulness. In removing its plant,
structures and equipment, a provider shall refill, at its own expense, any

condition as that prevailing prior to such removal without materially
interfering with any electrical or telephone cable or other utility wires,

expense, all aboveground portions of a system from the rights- of-way within a
reasonable period of time, which shall not be less than one hundred eighty
(180) days. If the provider is the incumbent local exchange carrier, it shall
not be required to remove its system, but shall negotiate a renewal in good
faith.
      5.   Leaving Underground System: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Chapter, a provider may abandon any underground system in
place so long as it does not materially interfere with the use of the rights-
of-way or with the use thereof by any public utility, cable operator or other
person. (Ord. 98-3, 2-10-1998)

with any federal or state statute, or is ordered by a court to be modified in
any way in order to conform to the requirements of any such law and all
appellate remedies with regard to the validity of the chapter provisions in
question are exhausted, such provision shall be considered a separate,
distinct, and independent part of this chapter, and such holding shall not
affect the validity and enforceability of all other provisions hereof. In the
event that such law is subsequently repealed, rescinded, amended or otherwise
changed, so that the provision which had been held invalid or modified is no
longer in conflict with such law the provision in question shall return to full
force and effect and shall again be binding on the city and the provider,
provided that the city shall give the provider thirty (30) days, or a longer
period of time as may be reasonably required for a provider to comply with such
a rejuvenated provision, written notice of the change before requiring
compliance with such provision.
   C.   New Developments: It shall be the policy of the city to liberally amend
this chapter, upon application of a provider, when necessary to enable the
provider to take advantage of any developments in the field of
telecommunications which will afford the provider an opportunity to more
effectively, efficiently, or economically serve itself or the public.
   D.   Notices: All notices from a provider to the city required under this
chapter or pursuant to a franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall be
directed to the officer as designated by the mayor. A provider shall provide in

requirements. (Ord. 2006-01, 2-14-2006)
   D.   City Failure To Enforce: A provider shall not be relieved of its
obligation to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter or any
franchise granted pursuant to this chapter by reason of any failure of the city
to enforce prompt compliance.

8-1-2: APPLICATIONS FOR CONNECTION, SERVICE:
   A.   Connection: Any person, other than a subdivider or developer seeking
multiple connections, who desires or is required to secure a new connection to
the City water system, shall file with the Water Department for each connection
a written and signed connection application which is on file in the City
office. (1989 Code § 14-113; amd. 1998 Code)
   B.   Connection By Subdividers: Whenever a subdivider or developer desires
or is required to install water connections and extensions for a subdivision or
development, the subdivider or developer shall enter into a written extension
agreement which shall constitute an application for permission to make the
extensions and connections and an agreement specifying the terms and conditions
under which the water extensions and connections shall be made and the payments
that shall be required. (1989 Code § 14-114)
   C.   Service: The current property owner is required to secure water service
when such service is available from the City water system by completing the
required application/agreement, presenting a legal form of identification
(driver's license, passport, tax ID, green card) to the City offices, and
paying the associated sign-up or connection fee.
   D.   Invoicing Regulations: The property owner shall be on record as the
responsible party. Invoicing for services shall only be issued to the property
owner. In the case of a rental, shutoff notices shall only be mailed to the
property owner. The property owner may add an additional name, such as the name
of the renter, to the invoice; however, the invoice will reflect the property
owner's name. (Ord. 16-09, 7-26-2016)
8-1-3: FEES:
   A.   Service Rates And Connection Fees: The rates, penalty fee for
delinquency in payment, sign-up fee, after hours service fee, connection fee,
shut-off fee for non-payment, tampering fee, reservoir fee, inspection fee and
other charges incidental to connection and services from the City water system
shall be fixed from time to time by resolution enacted by the City Council. The
City Council may from time to time promulgate rules for levying, billing,
guaranteeing and collecting charges for water services and all other rules
necessary for the management and control of the water system. Rates for
services furnished shall be uniform with respect to each class or classes of
service established or that may hereafter be established. (Ord. 16-09, 7-26-

   C.   Complaints; Corrections: The City Council is hereby constituted as a

month, including any past due amounts. (1989 Code § 14-121)
   B.   Delinquency: The utility statement shall specify the amount of the
bill, the place of payment and date due. If any customer fails to pay the
utility charges on or before close of business on the eighteenth day of the
month (or next business day if the eighteenth falls on Saturday, Sunday or
holiday), a late fee, as reflected on the currently adopted fee schedule, will
be assessed the following business day and shall be reflected on the next
utility statement. If the utility bill is not paid on or before the eighteenth
day of the following month, a courtesy notice will be mailed to the customer
stating all charges/fees must be paid in full on or before the shut-off day in
order to avoid shutoff. If the full balance of the utility bill is not paid on
or before the day of shut-off, a shut-off fee will be assessed in accordance
with the currently adopted fee schedule. Once a shutoff fee has been assessed,
the fee shall be due and payable even if the water is not actually turned off.
Water will be turned on no sooner than three o'clock (3:00) P.M. on the day it
is turned off and only after all charges/late fees have been paid in full. No
extensions of payment will be afforded once the water service has been shut-off
for non-payment. If payment has not been made to the City office by five
o'clock (5:00) P.M., the water will remain turned off until the next day of
business.
All delinquent payments shall be made at the City office in the form of cash or
credit card. Once penalty fees have been assessed to a customer's account for
nonpayment, such fees shall only be removed upon authorization of the City
Manager, or designee. If a due date falls on a holiday or a weekend, payment
will be due on the next business day.
   C.   Extensions: No extensions of payment will be afforded once the water
service has been shut-off for non-payment. Extension of payment and avoidance
of late and services fees may be granted by the City Manager or designee.
However, no extension of payment will be granted longer than the following
month's scheduled shutoff date. If more time is needed, the customer must
contact the City Manager or designee for an additional extension. At this time,
a payment schedule will be established and signed by the customer. (Ord. 16-09,
7-26-2016)
   D.   Enforcement Of Delinquent Charges: The City Manager or designee is
hereby authorized and empowered to enforce the payment of all delinquent
utility charges by an action of law in the name of the City. (1989 Code § 14-
121; amd. 1998 Code; Ord. 08-11, 8-26-2008, eff. 10-1-2008)
   E.   Legal Proceedings: If any person fails to pay his utility charges
within the designated time frame, the City is hereby authorized to take all
action necessary to enforce collection. Such action may include, but not be
limited to, the commencement of legal proceedings in a court of proper
jurisdiction seeking judgment for all the amount of the delinquent fees, late
fees and service fee charges and all costs of collection, including a
collection fee based on a percentage in accordance with the City's adopted fee
schedule and Utah Code Annotated 12-1-11, and including court costs and
reasonable attorney fees. (Ord. 13-14, 7-16-2013)
   F.   Option To Terminate Not Waived: Nothing herein shall be construed as a
waiver by the City of its option to terminate water service if payment is not
made as required herein. (1989 Code § 14-121)
8-1-5: DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICE:
Any customer desiring to discontinue service shall notify the City of such fact
at least ten (10) days before the date when such service shall be discontinued.
On giving such notice, the customer shall not be responsible for water bills
incurred after the date specified in the notice. Any credit balance in favor of
the customer as a result of an advance payment of bills will be refunded upon
discontinuation of service. (Ord. 11-01, 4-26-2011)
8-1-6: USE WITHOUT PAYMENT PROHIBITED:
It shall be unlawful for any person by himself, family, servants, or agents to
utilize the City water or sewage system without paying therefor, as herein
provided or, without authority, to open any fire hydrant, stopcock, valve, or
other fixtures attached to the system of water supply unless it is done
pursuant to proper application, agreement or resolution. It shall be unlawful

separate dwelling, twin house, apartment unit or any structure wherein the
living quarters' bathing facilities, washing facilities or cooking facilities
are separate and distinct from the other living quarters' bathing facilities,
washing facilities or cooking facilities in the structure.
      2.   It shall be unlawful for two (2) or more water users to be supplied
from the same service pipe, connection or water meter unless special permission
for such combination usage has been granted by the City Council and the
premises served are owned by the same owner. In all such cases, a failure on
the part of any one of the users to comply with this subsection shall warrant a
withholding of a supply of water through the service connections until
compliance or payment has been made, and in any event, the property owner shall
be primarily liable to the City for all water services utilized on all such
premises. Nothing herein shall be deemed to preclude the power of the City to
require separate pipes, connections or meters at a subsequent time.
      3.   An exception to subsection B2 of this section is granted to where
two (2) or more separate water users are receiving water from and through the
same meter on the effective date hereof, subject to the following:
         a.   Each separate water user herein shall be charged the standard
monthly rate for water service as determined by resolution of the City Council.
The individual or entity that applied for or received the water connection
shall be responsible for the payment of each and every water bill incurred as a
result of that water connection.
         b.   If two (2) or more separate water users are receiving water from
and through the same meter, the individual or entity that applied for or
received the water connection shall be responsible for the payment of each and
every water bill incurred as a result of that water connection. If two (2) or
more separate water users occupy the apartment unit, basement apartment, home
or separate dwelling during any month, the individual or entity that applied
for or received the water connection shall pay a fee for the water service as
if the separate water user had occupied the apartment unit, basement apartment,
home or separate dwelling for the entire month, unless the individual or entity
that applied for or received the water connection notifies the City that the
tenant or other occupant living in the apartment unit, basement apartment, home

8-2-2: DEFINITIONS:
   APPROVED BACKFLOW ASSEMBLY: A device or assembly accepted by the Utah
Department of Health, Bureau of General Sanitation, as meeting applicable
specifications or is suitable for the proposed use of prevented backflow.
   AUXILIARY WATER SUPPLY: Any water supply on or available to the premises
other than the City's public water supply will be considered as an auxiliary
water supply. These auxiliary waters may include water from another purveyor's
public potable water supply or any natural source such as a well, spring,
river, stream, harbor, etc., or "used waters" or "industrial fluids". These
waters may be contaminated or polluted or they may be objectionable and
constitute an unacceptable water source over which the City does not have
authority for sanitary control.
   BACK PRESSURE: The flow of water or other liquids, mixtures or substances
under pressure into the distribution pipes of a potable water supply system
from any source other than the intended source.
   BACK SIPHONAGE: The flow of water or other liquids, mixtures or substances
into the distribution pipes of a potable water supply system from any source
other than the intended source, caused by the reduction of pressure in the
potable water supply system.
   BACKFLOW: The reversal of the normal flow of water caused by either back
pressure or back siphonage.

poisoning or through the spread of disease.
   CROSS-CONNECTION: Any physical connection or arrangement of piping or
fixtures between two (2) otherwise separate piping systems, one of which
contains potable water and the other nonpotable water or industrial fluids of
questionable safety, through which, or because of which, backflow may occur
into the potable water system. This would include any temporary connections,
such as swing connections, removable sections, four (4) way plug valves,
spools, dummy sections of pipe, swivel or change-over devices or sliding multi-
port tubes.
   CROSS-CONNECTION, CONTAINMENT: The installation of an approved backflow
assembly at the water service connection to any customer's premises where it is
physically and economically infeasible to find and permanently eliminate or
control all actual or potential cross-connections within the customer's water
system; or, it shall mean the installation of an approved backflow prevention
assembly on the service line leading to and supplying a portion of a customer's
water system where there are actual or potential cross-connections which cannot
be effectively eliminated or controlled at the point of the cross-connection
(isolation).
   CROSS-CONNECTION, CONTROLLED: A connection between a potable water system
and a nonpotable water system with an approved backflow prevention assembly
properly installed and maintained so that it will continuously afford the

   A.   Public Works Director: The Public Works Director shall be responsible
for keeping the public potable water distribution system free from
contamination or pollution due to the backflow of contaminates or pollutants
through the water service connection. If, in the judgment of said Public Works
Director, an approved backflow prevention assembly is required (at the
customer's water service connection; or, within the customer's private water
system) for the safety of the water system, the Public Works Director or his
designated agent shall give notice in writing to said customer to install such
an approved backflow prevention assembly at a specific location on his
premises. The customer shall immediately install such approved assembly at the
customer's own expense; and, failure, refusal or inability on the part of the
customer to install, have tested and maintain said assembly shall constitute
grounds for discontinuing water service to the premises until such requirements
have been satisfactorily met. (1989 Code § 14-162; amd. 1998 Code)
   B.   Building Inspector: The Building Inspector of the City has the
responsibility to not only review building plans and inspect plumbing as it is
installed, but, has the explicit responsibility of preventing cross-connections
from being designed and built into the structures within the City. Where the
review of building plans suggests or detects the potential for a cross-
connection being made an integral part of the plumbing system, the Building
Inspector has the responsibility to require such cross-connections be either
eliminated, or provided with an approved backflow prevention assembly in
accordance with the Plumbing Code. The Building Inspector's responsibility
begins at the point of service (the downstream side of the meter) and carries
throughout the entire length of customer's water system. The Building Inspector
should inquire about the intended use of water at any point where it is
suspected that a cross-connection might be made or where one is actually called
for by the plans. When such a cross- connection is discovered, it will be
mandatory that a suitable, approved backflow prevention assembly be required by
the plans and be properly installed in accordance with the International
Plumbing Code. (1989 Code § 14-163; amd. 1998 Code)
   C.   Technician:

for the competence and accuracy of all tests and reports.
         f.   It will be the technician's responsibility to ensure his license
is current, the testing equipment being used is acceptable to the State and is
in proper operating condition. (1989 Code § 14-164)
         g.   Failure to report a failing assembly to the Bureau of Drinking
Water/Sanitation and the Public Works Director within five (5) working days,
may be grounds for revocation of the technician's certification. (1989 Code §
14-164; amd. 1998 Code)
         h.   The technician shall be equipped with, and be competent to use,
all necessary tools, gauges and other equipment necessary to properly test,
repair and maintain backflow prevention assemblies. (1989 Code § 14-164; amd.
1998 Code)

8-5-1: Findings
8-5-2: Purpose
8-5-3: Definitions
8-5-4: Creation And Operation
8-5-5: Fee
8-5-6: Billing
8-5-1: FINDINGS:
The city council makes the following findings regarding storm water runoff and
the city's storm sewer system:
   A.   The city's existing storm sewer system consists of a network of manmade
and natural facilities, structures and conduits, including ground water and
aquifers, that collect and route storm water runoff.
   B.   The city's existing storm sewer system does not adequately handle the
storm water runoff generated in the city.
   C.   The city's anticipated growth will place increased demands on the
already inadequate storm sewer system.
   D.   Uncontrolled or inadequately controlled storm water runoff endangers
the city's ground water supply.
   E.   Uncontrolled or inadequately controlled storm water runoff causes
erosion and property damage.
   F.   Uncontrolled or inadequately controlled storm water runoff hinders the
city's ability to provide emergency services to its residents.
   G.   Uncontrolled or inadequately controlled storm water runoff impedes the
regular flow of traffic in the city.
   H.   Uncontrolled or inadequately controlled storm water runoff poses health
hazards to the citizens of the community.
   I.   Storm water runoff carries concentrations of oil, grease, nutrients,
chemicals, heavy metals, toxic materials and other undesirable materials that
may jeopardize the integrity of ground waters and receiving waters, including
the city's culinary water supply.
   J.   All developed properties in the city contribute to the need for the
storm sewer system by converting natural ground cover into impervious surfaces.
   K.   All developed properties in the city make use of or benefit from the
city's operation and maintenance of the storm sewer system.
   L.   The state department of environmental quality (DEQ) has determined that
some of the city's storm water sumps must be included on the prioritized
contamination sources for culinary wells.
   M.   The EPA and the DEQ are developing additional storm water permitting
requirements that will apply to cities.
   N.   Absent effective maintenance, operation, regulation and control,
existing storm water drainage conditions in the city constitute a potential
hazard to the health, safety and general welfare of the city, its residents,
and its businesses.
   O.   A storm sewer utility is the most equitable and efficient method of
managing storm water in the city and ensuring that each property in the city
pays its fair share of the amount that the property contributes to, benefits
from, and otherwise uses the storm sewer system. (Ord. 07-14, 6-12-2007)
8-5-2: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to protect the health, safety and welfare of the
city and its inhabitants by improving the city's storm sewer system, managing
and controlling storm water runoff, protecting property, preventing polluted
waters from entering the city's water supply and other receiving waters, and
establishing a viable and fair method of financing the construction, operation
and maintenance of the storm sewer system. (Ord. 07-14, 6-12-2007)
8-5-3: DEFINITIONS:
The following words and phrases shall be defined as follows:
   DEVELOPED PARCEL: Any parcel that has been altered from its natural
condition by grading, filling, or the construction of improvements or other
impervious surfaces.
   EQUIVALENT RESIDENTIAL UNIT ("ERU"): The average amount of impervious
surface, expressed in square feet, on developed single-family residential
parcels in South Weber. One ERU equals two thousand eight hundred (2,800)
square feet of impervious surface area.
   IMPERVIOUS SURFACE: Any hard surface, other than the natural surface, that
prevents or retards the absorption of water into the soil, or that causes water
to run off the surface in greater quantities or at greater rates of flow than
the natural surface. (Ord. 07-14, 6-12-2007)
8-5-4: CREATION AND OPERATION:
   A.   Creation: The city council hereby creates and establishes a storm sewer
utility as part of the city's overall sewer system. The storm sewer utility
shall plan, design, construct, maintain, administer and operate the city's
storm sewer system.
   B.   Enterprise Fund: The city council hereby establishes a storm sewer
utility enterprise fund to handle all income, expenses and other financial
transactions related to the storm sewer utility. All storm sewer utility
service charges shall be deposited in the enterprise fund. Money in the storm
sewer utility enterprise fund shall not be commingled with or transferred to
other city funds. However, the storm sewer utility may pay other city funds for
services and expenses directly attributable to the storm sewer utility. The
enterprise fund shall be operated according to state law and city policy.
   C.   Facilities And Assets: The storm sewer utility shall operate
independently of city operations funded by the general fund. The storm sewer
utility shall have the same relationship to the city as other city utilities,
such as the water utility and the sanitary sewer (wastewater) utility. Upon
creation of the utility, all of the city's storm sewer facilities and assets
(other than streets and other facilities and assets designated by the city
manager) shall be transferred to the storm sewer utility in consideration for
the storm sewer utility's agreement to take primary responsibility for
planning, designing, constructing, maintaining, administering and operating the
city's storm sewer system.
   D.   Administration: The storm sewer utility shall be administered by the
city's public works director. (Ord. 07-14, 6-12-2007)
8-5-5: FEE:
   A.   Imposed: Each developed parcel of real property in the city shall be
charged a storm sewer utility fee.
   B.   ERU: The fee shall be based on the number of equivalent residential
units (ERUs) contained in the parcel. The city council finds that the ERU is
the most accurate measurement for determining the amount that each parcel
contributes to, benefits from, and otherwise uses the storm sewer utility.
Based on a study completed by an independent engineer, the city council finds
and establishes that one ERU equals two thousand eight hundred (2,800) square
feet of impervious surface area.
   C.   Calculation: The city council finds that each single-family residential
parcel contributes approximately the same amount of storm water runoff;
therefore, each developed single-family residential parcel shall pay a base
rate of one ERU. All nonsingle-family residential parcels shall pay a multiple
of this base rate, expressed in ERUs, according to the measured impervious area
on the parcel. The city council may adopt separate rates for PRDs, condominiums
and other uses that are not easily handled under the standard rate schedule.
   D.   Charge Per ERU: The amount charged for each ERU shall be established by
resolution of the city council.
   E.   Exemptions And Credits: The city council may establish exemptions and
credits to the storm sewer utility fee by resolution.
   F.   Policies: The public works director may adopt policies, consistent with
this chapter and any resolutions passed by the city council, to assist in the
application, administration and interpretation of this chapter and any
resolutions related to the storm sewer utility.
   G.   Appeals: Any person or entity that believes that this chapter, or any
storm sewer utility rate resolution, was interpreted or applied erroneously may
appeal to the public works director ("director"). The appeal shall be in
writing, shall state any facts supporting the appeal, and shall be made within
ten (10) days of the decision, action, or bill being appealed. The director may
elect to hold a hearing on the appeal. The director shall decide the appeal
within ten (10) days of when the appeal is filed. If the person or entity is
not satisfied with the director's decision, a further appeal may be made to the
city manager (or his or her designee). The appeal to the city manager shall
follow the same procedure as the appeal to the director. The city manager's
decision shall be final and binding on all parties. (Ord. 07-14, 6-12-2007)
8-5-6: BILLING:
The city council finds that the city's storm sewer system, sanitary sewer
system, culinary water system, and solid waste collection system are
interrelated services that are part of a unified city plan to provide for the
health, safety and welfare of the city and its residents in an environmentally
responsible manner. Therefore, the storm sewer utility fee shall be included on
the city's regular monthly utility bill for any given property. If there is no
regular utility bill for the property, the storm sewer utility fee shall be
charged to the owner of the property. The fee shall be deemed a civil debt owed
to the city by the person or entity paying for the city utility services
provided to the property. All properties shall be charged the fee, regardless
of whether or not the owner or occupant of the property requests the storm
sewer utility service. Failure to pay any portion of the utility bill may
result in termination of water service. (Ord. 07-14, 6-12-2007)

applicable regulations of the environmental protection agency (EPA) and the
Utah department of environmental quality (DEQ).
   B.   Findings. The city council makes the following findings regarding storm
water:
      1.   Facilities. The city operates a storm water system consisting of a
network of man-made and natural facilities, structures and conduits, that
collect and route storm water runoff.
      2.   Endangerment. Uncontrolled or inadequately controlled storm water
runoff endangers public health and safety by causing, among other things:
flooding, pollution, property damage, erosion, traffic and emergency response
interruption, and impacts the ground water supply.
      3.   Pollution. Storm water runoff carries concentrations of oil, grease,
nutrients, chemicals, heavy metals, toxic materials, and other undesirable
materials that can damage the integrity of ground waters and receiving waters,
including the culinary water supply.
      4.   Impervious Surfaces. Developed properties in the city contribute to
the storm water system by converting natural ground cover into impervious
surfaces.
      5.   Maintenance. Developed properties in the city make use of and
benefit from the city's operation and maintenance of the storm water system.
      6.   Regulations. The Act, EPA, DEQ, and applicable rules mandate storm
water regulations that apply to the city and otherwise.
      7.   Operation. Effective maintenance, operation, regulation, and control
of the storm water system is necessary for the health, safety, and general
welfare of the city, its residents, and its businesses. (Ord. 2025-11, 5-20-
2025)
8-6-2: APPLICABILITY:
The storm water regulations in the municipal code apply to all developments of
one (1) or more acres of land, or any part of a common development plan
regardless of the size of any of the individually owned or developed sites.

multiple separate distinct construction activities may be taking place at
different times or different schedules under an overall plan. For example, if a
developer buys a large parcel and subdivides lots, builds roads, installs
pipes, and runs electricity with the intention of constructing homes or other
structures, this would be considered a common development plan. If the land is
parceled off or sold, and construction occurs on plots that are less than one
(1) acre by separate, independent builders, this activity still would be
subject to storm water permitting requirements. The common development plan
also applies to other types of land development such as industrial or business
parks.

DETENTION BASIN: An area designed to detain peak flows from storm water runoff
and to regulate release rates of that water into the storm drainage system,
also allowing debris to settle out. Detention basin outlets may also be
connected to downstream storm drains. Flows entering detention basins are
released via outlet piping.
   A.   Regional detention basins mean large detention basins owned and
maintained by the city.
   B.   Local detention basins mean smaller basins typically in a development
or subdivision that is constructed by the development or subdivision which,
following construction and acceptance, the ownership, operation, and
maintenance may either be conveyed and maintained by the city, association, or
private owner(s) as determined by the city.
DEVELOPMENT: Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate of any
parcel to alter it from its natural condition by site preparation, grading,
filling, and/or the construction of improvements or other impervious surfaces.

corrective actions neglected by the owner/operators or the qualified third
party.
         d.   Allows the city to recoup the costs from the owner/operator as
necessary to cover the expenses for necessary actions conducted by the city.
   E.   Interpretation. The city interprets this regulation as secondary and
subservient to the United States Constitution and the Utah State Constitution
as applied to property rights, land use, development, and similar rights.
Specifically, the intent of this regulation is not to be applied to violate
vested property rights nor to be a physical invasion of property rights as
determined by the United States Supreme Court in Loretto v. Teleprompter
Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419 (1982). The city recognizes that the United
States supreme court interprets property right in conjunction with the laws and
constitutions of each state. Therefore, Utah law also plays an important role
in defining property rights. For the purpose of determining when a property
right is vested the city shall continue to apply the Utah supreme court ruling
in Western Land Equities, Inc. v. City of Logan, 617 P.2d 388 (1980), that
states a property owner is vested to follow the city regulations in effect at
the time a land use application is filed. Furthermore, where there is vagueness
in any land use regulation, including the storm water regulations, it shall be
interpreted in favor of the property owner. (Ord. 2025-11, 5-20-2025)
8-6-9: REQUIREMENT TO MONITOR AND ANALYZE:
If a test or inspection by the city, its designee, or other authorized agency
indicates that a site is causing or contributing to storm water pollution,
illegal discharges, and/or non-storm water discharges to the storm water system
or waters of the United States, and if the violation continues after notice of
the same, the city or other authorized agency may require any person engaged in
the illicit activity and/or the owner of operator of the site to provide, at
their own expense, monitoring and analyses as required by the city or other
applicable agency to ensure compliance with the municipal code. (Ord. 2025-11,
5-20-2025)
8-6-10: DAMAGE SYSTEM:
Any person who damages any portion of the storm water system or any irrigation
system shall be responsible for repairing the damage. The damage shall be
repaired by a licensed contractor and, where applicable, be repaired in
accordance with the current adopted public works standards for development,
design, and construction adopted by the city. It is unlawful to remove or alter
any portion of the storm water system or irrigation system without permission
from the director or owner of the irrigation system. (Ord. 2025-11, 5-20-2025)
8-6-11: AUTHORIZED ACCESS:
It is unlawful for any person to open any storm water access hole, grate, lid,
cover, inlet, head gate, valve, pipe or other otherwise access any storm water
facility without express permission from the director. (Ord. 2025-11, 5-20-
2025)
8-6-12: WETLANDS AND PERMITS:
Any development that may affect any wetland or potential wetland, regardless of
whether such wetlands are identified or unidentified, shall provide to the city
an accurate wetland delineation that has been completed within the past
eighteen (18) months prior to city approval of the development. Any delineated
wetland shall be accurately shown on all construction plans and any plat map
relating to the development. Prior to issuance of any building permit, the
developer shall accurately stake and install appropriate BMPs all on site
delineated wetlands and shall maintain such until the notice of termination has
been completed. The developer shall also provide to the city a copy of the EPA
wetlands 404 permit, stream alteration permit, regulator letters, and other
related permit or regulator documents required by any regulatory agency
relating to the development. (Ord. 2025-11, 5-20-2025)
8-6-13: FEDERAL AND STATE COMPLIANCE:
Nothing in the storm water regulations shall be interpreted to relieve any
person from an obligation to comply with an applicable federal, state, or local
law. (Ord. 2025-11, 5-20-2025)
8-6-14: VIOLATION AND ENFORCEMENT:

referral of unpaid fine(s) to city attorney.
   D.   Stop Work Order. The city may issue a stop work order if there is
clearly documented reason articulating an immediate threat to water quality.
      A stop work order may not be issued if the contractor or property owner
has selected the preferred best management practice for site conditions and is
properly implementing said practice, but a violation results from a deficiency
in the preferred best management practice.
   E.   Special Cases.
      1.   The city can issue a stop work order earlier than in the process
described in this section if the city can document that the violation imposes
an immediate and/or imminent threat to water quality.
      2.   The city can correct a violation for the contractor or property
owner and recoup the costs if the contractor or property owner refuses to
correct the violation and there is imminent significant harm to water quality
or the storm water system.
      3.   The city cannot issue a stop work order if the violation is a result
of a properly installed and maintained BMP per specifications from the
preferred BMP list. (Ord. 2025-11, 5-20-2025)
8-6-15: STORM WATER CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY:
   A.   Design. All storm water shall be designed and constructed in accordance
with the current public works standards. Storm water outfall design and water
quality shall meet federal, state, and local discharge requirements.
   B.   Construction.
      1.   BMPs.
         a.   The storm water management plan contains a listing of BMPs that
can be used on a site. BMPs typically fall into the following categories:
            (1)   Perimeter control.
            (2)   Erosion controls.
            (3)   Sediment control.
            (4)   Materials handling and spill prevention.
            (5)   Waste management.
            (6)   Good housekeeping.
         b.   The application of some BMPs include, but are not limited to:
            1.   Oil Separators (OWS). Oil Separators shall be required on all
sites with parking facilities that exceed two (2) acres, automobile salvage or
wrecking areas, or smaller sites anticipating oily discharges such as mechanic
shops or similar facilities. Oil separators must be capable of removing
particulates down to one hundred fifty (150) microns. Possible products
include, but are not limited to: BaySaver, Storm Cerptor, Vortechnic. Where oil
separators are required, sizing and design of OWS must be reviewed by the city
engineer prior to installation. Consideration must be given to frequency and
ease of maintenance of the structure. Basins shall have agreements in place
with the city to periodically clean the separator in accordance with the
manufacturer's specifications. Manufacturers' recommendations for sizing shall
be followed with calculations submitted to the city. The separator may either
be installed upstream or downstream of the basin keeping in mind that flows on
the outlet of the basin would be smaller.
      2.   Inlet Protection (IP). The storm water management plan may allow
straw bales, silt fences, or curb snakes (after asphalt is placed). Filter
fabric under the grate shall not be permitted since drainage is greatly
inhibited.
      3.   Tracking Pads (CR). Sites must have a tracking pad to eliminate mud
from being tracked onto the adjacent street. If mud is tracked, the contractor
shall be responsible to sweep the streets as necessary.
      4.   Surface Sweeping (SC). If mud or dirt is tracked onto a travel
surface such as a road or parking area, the developer or owner shall be
responsible for sweeping the surface to remove the mud and dirt.
      5.   Concrete Washout (CWM). A place must be located within the
subdivision or on the site for concrete washout. No washout will be permitted
on the street which would then continue to the storm drain. The washout area
may need to be maintained and temporarily excavated until the building
foundations and driveways are constructed, or some other arrangement made.
      6.   Silt Fences (SF). Silt fences must be installed to prohibit the flow
of sediments off the site in accordance with manufacturers recommendations and
the storm water management plan.
      7.   Notice Sign. All development and subdivisions are required to at
least one (1) notice sign that is clearly visible at each entryway to the
subdivision indicating that the SWPPP must be obtained and followed. Said
notice sign shall be maintained by the original development or subdivision
applicant until termination. The specific wording on the sign relating to storm
water, and other related requirements, may be prescribed and modified by the
city as needed to meet challenges created by development and to give notice to
requirements of law.
   C.   Plan Approval Required. Storm water construction activity prevention
plan approval is required in conjunction with the SWPPP before any person may
excavate, grub and clear, grade, or perform any type of construction activity
that will disrupt or cause a change in the natural landscape within the city
that is one (1) acre or more, or any part of a common development plan.
Development of a subdivision greater than or equal to one (1) acre in size
qualifies under this section even if each of the individual lots in the
subdivision are smaller than one (1) acre.
      1.   Process. Any person or entity desiring a storm water construction
activity plan approval must first submit a "Notice of Intent" (NOI) with DEQ.
Upon DEQ approval of the NOI, any person desiring a storm water construction
activity plan approval must file the SWPPP with the city along with any
documentation necessary for the city to calculate the number of ERUs for each
parcel upon completion of development.
      2.   Approval. The storm water construction activity plan is approved and
issued in conjunction land use and / or building permit approval. The city may
impose conditions in connection with the approval to enforce the activity plan
and SWPPP and include specific measures to prevent erosion, unlawful discharge,
sediment accumulation, debris removal, and other storm water measures for the
construction site.
      3.   Effect. Unless otherwise revoked or suspended for a violation, a
storm water construction activity plan approval is effective for the full
period of the construction activity. The construction activity will not be
considered to be completed until the following events occur:
         a.   Termination. The storm water construction activity plan approval
shall be considered terminated after the applicant notifies the city of
completion of the project and a final inspection is performed to verify site
stabilization. The permittee shall also verify the site is stabilized and give
"Notice of Termination" to DEQ. The applicant shall keep and maintain all
permit required improvements on the site until termination.
         b.   Amendments. If the proposed construction activity for a site to
which a plan approval pertains is materially altered from the time of approval,
an amended storm water construction activity plan and SWPPP shall be submitted
for approval.
   D.   Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan. A SWPPP is required for all
sites disturbing one (1) acre or more or any part of a common development plan.
The SWPPP shall contain the information required in the general permit and by
DEQ. The city may require additions, changes, modifications, and amendments to
the SWPPP in order to conform to the storm water management plan adopted by the
city or to remedy deficiencies occurring at the construction site during
construction.
   E.   Erosion And Sediment Control. The applicant of the SWPPP shall install
the erosion and sediment control measures required by the approved SWPPP prior
to commencing other construction activity on the site. The erosion and sediment
control measures shall be properly installed and maintained in accordance with
the SWPPP, specifications of a manufacturer, and best practices. The applicant
shall maintain such measures on the site until the city accepts termination.
   F.   Inspection And Entry. The written approval of a storm water activity
plan and SWPPP authorizes the EPA, DEQ, City, or other applicable agency to
enter the site and inspect compliance with the construction activity plan and
SWPPP. The applicant shall also make available upon request inspection of storm
water records for the construction site. (Ord. 2025-11, 5-20-2025)
8-6-16: CONNECTION PERMIT:

STORM WATER CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY PERMIT
SECTION:
8-7-1: Purpose And Intent
8-7-2: Permit; When Required
8-7-3: Permit Application
8-7-4: Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan
8-7-5: Proper Operation And Maintenance
8-7-6: Inspection And Entry
8-7-7: Revocation Or Suspension Of Permit
8-7-8: Violations And Enforcement
8-7-9: Exemptions
8-7-10: Appeal
8-7-11: Compliance With Federal And State Law
8-7-1: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
The purpose of this chapter is to prevent the discharge of sediment and other
construction related pollutants from construction sites. Sediment and debris
from construction sites are a major source of pollution to waterways and water
systems located within the city and surrounding areas. Each year storm water
runoff carries tons of sediment from construction sites into local drainage
systems, irrigation systems, canals, rivers, and lakes. Sediment from storm
water runoff also clogs and obstructs storm drains, culverts, and canals and
causes damage to private property, wildlife habitat and water quality. (Ord.
07-14, 6-12-2007)
8-7-2: PERMIT; WHEN REQUIRED:
A South Weber City storm water construction activity permit is required before
any person or entity may excavate, grub and clear, grade, or perform any type
of construction activity that will disrupt or cause a change in the natural
landscape upon any of the following types of property located within the city:
   A.   One Acre Or More: Any parcel, lot or land development which is equal to
or greater than one acre (43,560 square feet) in size. A subdivision
development greater than or equal to one acre in size qualifies under this
subsection even if each of the individual lots in the subdivision is smaller
than one acre.
   B.   Less Than One Acre: Any parcel, lot or land development smaller than
one acre in size, if any portion of the parcel, lot or land development lies
within the area known as erosion sensitive areas.
   C.   Special Concern Areas: Any parcel, lot or land development for which
the city determines that because of the nature or type of the parcel, lot or
development, disturbance of the land is likely to result in erosion or the
transport of sediment off of the site by storm water to a degree substantially
greater than that which would occur under natural landscape conditions. (Ord.
07-14, 6-12-2007)
8-7-3: PERMIT APPLICATION:
Any person or entity desiring a storm water construction activity permit must
first file an application with the development services department. The
application may be submitted independently, or as part of an application for a
preliminary site plan approval, site plan approval, or building permit.
   A.   Content: The application shall include a storm water pollution
prevention plan which meets the criteria set forth in section
8-7-4 of this chapter.
   B.   Timing: The applicant shall file the application on or before the
following dates:
      1.   Subdivision: The date that the applicant submits the preliminary
subdivision plat application if the applicant proposes to develop a
subdivision.
      2.   Site Plan: The date that the applicant submits a site plan
application if the applicant proposes to develop a site plan or amended site
plan.
      3.   Building Permit: The date that the applicant submits a building
permit application if the applicant proposes to construct a building on an
existing lot or parcel.
      4.   Other: At least two (2) weeks before the developer intends to
perform any type of work not listed above that would require a storm water
construction activity permit pursuant to this chapter.
   C.   Compliance: If an applicant's development comes under more than one of
the categories listed above, then the applicant shall submit the storm water
construction activity permit application on the earliest of the listed dates.
Failure to comply with the application dates set forth above is not a criminal
offense, but may delay the applicant's project. Failure to acquire a required
storm water construction activity permit is grounds for denying a related
subdivision application, site plan application, conditional use permit
application, or building permit application. It is unlawful to commence work
(move dirt) on a development site before obtaining a required storm water
construction activity permit.
   D.   Fee: The applicant for a storm water construction activity permit shall
pay a fee in an amount set by resolution of the city council.
   E.   Application Approval: The storm sewer utility manager or designee shall
approve the application and grant the permit if the application is complete and
meets the criteria set forth in section
8-7-4 of this chapter. The storm sewer utility manager shall deny the
application or approve the application with conditions if he or she determines
that the measures proposed in the plan fail to meet the criteria set forth in
section
8-7-4 of this chapter. Conditions the storm sewer utility manager may impose in
connection with the approval of a permit include, but are not limited to, the
establishment of specific measures and controls to prevent erosion and the
discharge of sediment, debris and other construction related pollutants from
the site by storm water.
   F.   Term: Unless otherwise revoked or suspended, a storm water construction
activity permit shall be in effect for the full period of the construction
activity. The construction activity will not be considered to be completed
until the following events occur:
      1.   Subdivisions: For permits associated with a subdivision plat
approval:
         a.   The permittee must complete all required subdivision
improvements; and
         b.   One of the following three (3) events must occur:
            (1)   The city issues a final certificate of occupancy for each lot
in the subdivision, or
            (2)   Individual storm water construction activity permits have
been issued for each lot in the subdivision not having a final occupancy
permit, or
            (3)   The property has been revegetated or landscaped in a manner
that eliminates erosion and sediment discharge or that brings the property back
to its natural state.
      2.   Site Plans: For permits associated with a site plan approval, the
date that the permittee has completed all required landscaping and all outside
construction work associated with the site plan.
      3.   Building Permits: For permits associated with a building permit
application, the date that the city issues a final occupancy permit for the
structure covered by the building permit.
      4.   Other: For permits issued that are not tied to other approvals from
the city, the date that the permittee has completed all work associated with
the permit and takes steps required by the permit to prevent further erosion
and runoff from the site.
   G.   Termination: No storm water construction activity permit shall be
considered terminated until the permittee submits a notice of termination of
construction activity permit ("notice") to the city and the notice is accepted
by the city. The city shall accept the notice if the permittee has met the
requirements of the permit and this chapter. The permittee shall keep and
maintain all permit required improvements on the site until the city accepts
the notice.
   H.   Amendments: In the event that the proposed construction activity for a
site to which a permit pertains is materially altered from that described in an
original plan in a way that may have a significant impact upon the
effectiveness of the measures and controls described in the original plan, the
permittee shall file an amended storm water pollution prevention plan which
meets the criteria set forth in section
8-7-4 of this chapter. (Ord. 07-14, 6-12-2007)
8-7-4: STORM WATER POLLUTION PREVENTION PLAN:
   A.   Required Information: The storm water pollution prevention plan (the
"plan") shall contain the following information:
      1.   Site Description: A site description (including a map with spot
elevations and contour lines) which includes a description of the nature and
location of the construction activity, a description of the intended sequence
of major activities which will disturb soils for major portions of the site
(e.g., grubbing, excavation, grading, utilities, and infrastructure
installation, etc.), and estimates of the total area of the site and the total
area of the site that is expected to be disturbed by excavation, grading, or
other activities;
      2.   Control Description: A description of the proposed measures and
controls that will be implemented during construction activity and/or while the
site is not stable. The plan must clearly describe the times during the
construction process that the measures will be implemented for each major
activity identified pursuant to subsection A1 of this section. The plan shall
also state the name and phone number of the person or entity responsible for
implementation of each control measure.
   B.   Goals And Criteria: The proposed measures and controls described in the
plan shall be designed to meet the following goals and criteria:
      1.   Prevent Or Minimize Discharge: The proposed measures and controls
shall be designed to prevent or minimize, to the maximum extent practicable,
the discharge of sediment, debris and other construction related pollutants
from the construction site by storm water runoff into the storm drainage
system.
      2.   Prevent Or Minimize Construction Debris: The proposed measures and
controls shall be designed to prevent or minimize, to the maximum extent
practicable, the deposit, discharge, tracking by construction vehicles, or
dropping of mud, sediment, debris or other potential pollutants onto public
streets and rights of way. Any such discharge shall be cleaned up and removed
immediately upon notification to the permittee or when it otherwise comes to
the attention of the permittee. At a minimum, the deposit or discharge shall be
cleaned and removed at the end of the work shift in which the deposit occurred,
or at the end of the workday, whichever comes first.
      3.   BMPs: The proposed measures and controls shall consist of best
management practices (BMPs) available at the time that the plan is submitted.
BMPs may include, but shall not be limited to, temporary silt or sediment
fences, sediment traps and detention ponds, gravel construction entrances and
wash down pads to reduce or eliminate off site tracking, straw bale sediment
barriers, establishment of temporary grasses and permanent vegetative cover,
use of straw mulch as a temporary ground cover, erosion control blankets,
temporary interceptor dikes and swales, storm drain inlet protection, check
dams, subsurface drains, pipe slope drains, level spreaders, rock outlet
protection, reinforced soil retaining systems, and gabions.
      4.   Stabilization: The proposed measures and controls shall be designed
to preserve existing vegetation, where possible. Disturbed portions of the site
shall be stabilized. Stabilization practices may include temporary seeding,
permanent seeding, mulching, geotextiles, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer
strips, protection of trees, preservation of mature vegetation, and other
appropriate measures. Use of impervious surfaces for stabilization should be
avoided. Stabilization measures shall be initiated as soon as practicable in
disturbed portions of the site where construction activities have temporarily
or permanently ceased, but in no case more than fourteen (14) days after the
construction activity in that portion of the site has temporarily or
permanently ceased, except under the following circumstances:
         a.   If the initiation of stabilization measures by the fourteenth day
after construction activity temporarily or permanently ceases is precluded by
snow cover or frozen ground conditions, stabilization measures shall be
initiated as soon as practicable; or
         b.   If construction activity on a portion of the site is temporarily
ceased, and earth disturbing will resume within twenty one (21) days, temporary
stabilization measures need not be initiated on that portion of the site.
      5.   Minimize Risk Of Discharge Of Other Materials: The proposed measures
and controls shall be employed to minimize the risk of discharge of
construction related pollutants (such as paint, thinners, solvents and other
chemicals) from the construction site. Such measures may include implementation
of storage practices to minimize exposure of the material to storm water as
well as spill prevention and response. (Ord. 07-14, 6-12-2007)

the improvements.

of a healthy and well-planned community be sought when establishing or altering
the composition of the membership of the planning commission. Candidates for

CHAPTER 4
APPEAL AUTHORITY
SECTION:
10-4-1: Established
10-4-2: Powers And Duties
10-4-3: Appeals
10-4-4: Variances
10-4-5: Decision By Appeal Authority
10-4-1: ESTABLISHED:
The general appeal authority shall be an unbiased attorney with expertise in
land use and preappointed by the mayor to serve this purpose for a preapproved
fee. (Ord. 13-03, 6-25-2013)
10-4-2: POWERS AND DUTIES:
The appeal authority shall act in a quasi-judicial manner and serve as the
final arbiter of issues involving the interpretation or application of land use
ordinances. The appeal authority shall hear and decide appeals from
administrative decisions applying the land use ordinance and appeals from fees
charged in land use applications, and shall hear requests for variance from the
terms of this title. The appeal authority may not entertain an appeal of a
matter in which any participating member of the appeal authority had first
acted as the land use authority.
Legislative decisions shall be appealed directly to a court of competent
jurisdiction in accordance with state law. (Ord. 13-03, 6-25-2013)
10-4-3: APPEALS:
   A.   Application:
      1.   The applicant, a board or officer of the municipality, or any person
adversely affected by the land use authority's decision administering or
interpreting a land use ordinance may, within thirty (30) days from the
decision, appeal that decision to the appeal authority by alleging that there
is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the land
use authority in the administration or interpretation of the land use
ordinance.
      2.   An applicant who has appealed a decision of the land use authority
administering or interpreting the municipality's geologic hazard ordinance may
request the municipality to assemble a panel of qualified experts, per Utah
code, to serve as the appeal authority for purposes of determining the
technical aspects of the appeal. One member of this panel is selected/appointed
by the applicant, one member is selected/appointed by the city and the third
member of the panel is mutually agreed upon. The cost of these experts is to be
equally shared.
   B.   Burden Of Proof: The appellant has the burden of proving that the land
use authority erred. (Ord. 13-03, 6-25-2013)
10-4-4: VARIANCES:
   A.   Application: Any person or entity desiring a waiver or modification of
the requirements of a land use ordinance as applied to a parcel of property
that he owns, leases, or in which he holds some other beneficial interest may
apply to the appeal authority for a variance from the terms of the ordinance.
   B.   Conditions For Granting Of Variance: The appeal authority may grant a
variance only if:
      1.   Literal enforcement of the ordinance would cause an unreasonable
hardship for the applicant that is not necessary to carry out the general
purpose of the land use ordinances. In determining whether or not enforcement
of the land use ordinance would cause unreasonable hardship, the appeal
authority may not find an unreasonable hardship unless the alleged hardship is
located on or associated with the property for which the variance is sought;
comes from circumstances peculiar to the property, not from conditions that are
general to the neighborhood; and is not self-imposed nor economic.
      2.   There are special circumstances attached to the property that do not
generally apply to other properties in the same zone. In determining whether or
not there are special circumstances attached to the property, the appeal
authority may find that special circumstances exist only if the special
circumstances relate to the hardship complained of; and deprive the property of
privileges granted to other properties in the same zone.
      3.   Granting the variance is essential to the enjoyment of a substantial
property right possessed by other property in the same zone;
      4.   The variance will not substantially affect the general plan and will
not be contrary to the public interest; and
      5.   The spirit of the land use ordinance is observed and substantial
justice done. (Ord. 13-03, 6-25-2013)
10-4-5: DECISION BY APPEAL AUTHORITY:
   A.   Written Decision: A decision of the appeal authority takes effect on
the date when the appeal authority issues a written decision. A written
decision constitutes a final decision.
   B.   No District Court Review Until Administrative Remedies Exhausted: In
accordance with Utah code, no person may challenge in district court a
municipality's land use decision until that person has exhausted the person's
administrative remedies. (Ord. 13-03, 6-25-2013)

10-5L-12: PERFORMANCE STANDARDS:
The following performance standards are intended to ensure that all industries
will provide necessary modern control methods to protect the City from hazards
and nuisances; to set objective quantitative standards for the maximum
tolerated levels of frequently hazardous or annoying emissions; and to protect
any industry from arbitrary exclusion or persecution based solely on the
characteristics of that type of industry's past controlled operation.
   A.   Noise:
      1.   Level: No use shall emit or cause the emission of sound from a
stationary source such that the one hour equivalent sound level (Leq) of
resultant sound measurement at the lot line of the establishment or use exceeds
by six (6) dB or more than one hour equivalent sound level (Leq) caused by
ground transportation as estimated for that point of measurement and that time
of day, pursuant to FHWA-RD-77-108 highway traffic noise prediction model, or
by other techniques at least as accurate as those set out in FHWA-RD-77-108.
The sound level measuring instrumentation shall conform with ANSI Sl.4-1971
type 1, and the measurement procedure shall be compatible with that according
to ANSI Sl.13-1971, with the following adjustments:
         a.   Temporal And Tonal Characteristics Of Sound: If the sound has a
pronounced audible tonal quality such as a whine, screech, buzz or hum, or if
the sound has an audible cyclic variation in sound level such as beating or
other amplitude modulation, five (5) dB shall be added to the measured sound
level to allow for increased subjective response to the sound.
         b.   Quasi-Steady Impulsive Sound: Where the sound is of a repetitive
impulse nature so that a steady reading is obtained using the "slow response"
setting on the sound level meter, then ten (10) dB shall be added to the
measured value to allow for the increased subjective response to the sound. An
adjustment may be made under only one of subsection Ala of this section and
this subsection Alb. In a case where both subsections apply, then this

   A.   Extraction Essential: The extraction of minerals is essential to the
continued economic well-being of the City and to the needs of society.
   B.   Minerals Required: It is necessary to alter the surface of the earth to
extract minerals required by our society. This should be done in such a way as
to minimize undesirable effects on the surroundings.
   C.   Reclamation: Mined land should be reclaimed so as to prevent conditions
detrimental to the general safety and welfare of all citizens of the City and
to provide for the subsequent use of the lands affected. Reclamation
requirements must be adapted to the diversity of the topographic, chemical,
climatic, biologic, geologic, economic and social conditions of the area where
the mining takes place. (1989 Code § 12-12-001)
10-6-2: DEFINITIONS:
As used in this Chapter, the following words and terms shall have the meanings
ascribed to them in this Section:
   EXCAVATION: The removal of sand and gravel, clay, soil, granite, flagstone,
slate or shale by excavating, stripping, leveling or other process, together
with all other types of mining operations where material is removed from the
earth. The provisions of this Chapter shall not apply to the removal of sod or
topsoil, provided the operation be not closer than ten feet (10') to any
property line or to a depth in excess of eighteen inches (18") or so to
adversely affect the drainage, stability or vegetation for the area; and to
provide further, that this Chapter shall not apply to ditching and land
leveling for agricultural or recreational uses, or for site preparations for
building a structure. Land leveling for these purposes may include the removal
of mineral resources. Excavations for these purposes may include the removal of
mineral resources. Excavations for these purposes, which exceed two hundred
(200) cubic yards per acre contained in the site or a proportionally equivalent
amount for fractional acreage, shall be considered a conditional use.
   LAND AFFECTED: The surface and subsurface of an area within the incorporated
areas of the City where mining operations are being or will be conducted,
including, but not limited to, on- site private ways, roads, the excavation
site itself, exploration sites, drill sites or working, parking, storage areas;
areas in which structures, facilities, equipment, machines, tools or other
materials or property which result from or are used in such operation, are
situated.
   MINING OPERATIONS: Those activities conducted on the surface of the land for
the exploration for development of or the extraction of mineral deposits from
its natural occurrences, including surface mining and surface effects of
underground mining, including on site transportation or other primary
processing.
   NATURAL RESOURCES PERMIT: The acceptance of the premining inventory/
analysis, the operations plan and the final reclamation plan as evidenced by
the properly endorsed and designated signature blocks, shall constitute the
issuance of a natural resources permit.
   OFF SITE: The land areas that are outside or beyond the on site land which
is owned or controlled by the operator.
ON SITE: The surface land area within which mining operations are or will be
conducted, which is bounded by continuous property lines dividing the surface
of land ownership, control or right that is invested in the operator. A series
of related properties under the control of a single operator but separated by
small parcels of land controlled by others will be considered a single site
unless excepted by the planning commission.
   OPERATOR: Any person, firm, corporation, association, partnership, receiver,
trustee, executor, administrator, guardian, fiduciary, agent or other
organization or representative of any kind either public or private, owning,
controlling or managing mining operations or proposed mining operations,
including exploring for or developing of a mineral deposit.
   OWNER: Any person, corporation, association, partnership or other legally
deeded organization or representative of any kind, either public or private,
owning, controlling or managing a mineral deposit or the surface of lands
employed in mining operations.
   PUBLIC ROAD: Any road, street, alley, lane, court, place, viaduct, tunnel,
culvert or bridge laid out or erected as such by the public, or dedicated or
abandoned to the public, or made such in an action for the partition of real
property and includes the entire area within the right of way.
   RECLAMATION: Actions performed during and after mining operations to shape,
stabilize, revegetate or otherwise treat the land affected in order to achieve
a safe, stable, ecological condition. The mined lands will be reclaimed to a
usable condition which is readily adaptable to alternate land uses and creates
no danger to public safety. These rehabilitated or reclaimed conditions will be
consistent with the city land use plan in the immediate area. The reclamation
process may extend to affected lands surrounding the mined lands and may
require backfilling, grading, resoiling, revegetation, soil compaction,
stabilization and other measures. (1989 Code § 12-12-003)

10-6-9: ANNUAL PROGRESS REPORT:
At the end of each calendar year, unless waived by the Planning Commission for
due cause, each operator conducting mining operations shall file an operations
and progress report with the Planning Commission. Part of this progress report
may be submitted on United States Department of Interior, Bureau of Mines form
OMB no. 42-RO264. The remainder of this report will summarize activities in
fulfillment of the requirements of simultaneous excavation and reclamation in
confirmation with the reclamation plan previously submitted. (1989 Code § 12-
12-010)
10-6-10: RECLAMATION:
   A.   Objectives: The objectives of excavation reclamation shall be:
      1.   To return the land, concurrently with the mining operation or within
a reasonable amount of time thereafter, to a predetermined condition defined by
the reclamation plan as submitted and approved, compatible with past, present
or probable future local land uses.
      2.   To minimize or prevent present and future on-site or off- site
environmental degradations to the ecologic and hydrologic regimes caused by
mining operations and to meet other pertinent State and Federal regulations
regarding air and water quality standards and health and safety criteria.
      3.   To minimize or prevent present and future hazards to public safety
and welfare.
   B.   Simultaneous Excavation And Reclamation:
      1.   The reclamation or rehabilitation of natural resource sites with a
projected life of more than one year shall be carried out simultaneously with
the excavation of the resource. A few objectives of simultaneous excavation and
reclamation are to prevent shallow, stagnant, small bodies of water, small
unusable remnants of land and eroding, barren slopes all normally associated
with open pit operations, except as providing stormwater detention facilities
as described in a hydrologic report.
      2.   Excavations shall be planned so as to progressively develop the
proposed final land forms by grading and by stockpiling overburdened materials
in areas designated for future landforms or in excavations where the material
will be spread over the pit floor where no future excavation is anticipated.
Such areas are to be seeded and planted immediately after grading is completed
or within appropriate planting seasons, but in any case, the grading and
planting shall be completed within one year. The reclamation plan shall contain
a description of the phased rehabilitation process throughout the anticipated
life of the mine.
   C.   Final Reclamation: Final reclamation shall begin immediately for any
site where operations authorized under a natural resources permit have been
abandoned for a period of at least one year, or otherwise terminated. The final
reclamation shall conform to the plan approved (including approved
modifications) in the natural resources permit. All reclamation plans shall
conform at least to the below listed minimum standards and requirements listed
elsewhere in this chapter; provided however, that the Planning Commission may
require more stringent standards where special hazards exist in order to
protect the health, safety or general welfare of the public and to prevent
injury to property or improvements.
      1.   Grading: Slopes, overburdened stockpiles and abandoned soil piles
shall be graded and smoothed so as to control erosion and prevent the creation
of potentially dangerous areas in accordance with the direction of the City
Engineer.
      2.   Water-Filled Areas: All excavations which create standing water or
ponds shall be refilled with inert materials. This requirement shall not apply,
however, to any water-filled excavations scheduled to become an integral part
of the final reclamation plan. The rehabilitation of these areas shall be done
in such a manner that the ground water is not polluted as determined through
consultation with the Davis County Health Department. Fill material shall be
porous to allow for water dispersion unless otherwise specified in the
reclamation plan.
      3.   Landscaping: Unless inconsistent with the final proposed use of the
reclaimed land, the excavated areas and all other disturbed areas shall be
replanted and maintained with trees, shrubs, grasses or other vegetative ground
cover, preferably native to the area, in order to minimize erosion and to
restore the land to a natural appearance, or to an appearance previously
approved by the Planning Commission.
      4.   Removal Of Buildings And Equipment: As soon as excavation and/or
manufacturing has been permanently terminated, all buildings and equipment
(including electrical conduit) used in the administration of the operations,
shall be removed, unless deemed necessary to the approved final use of the
reclaimed site.
      5.   Excavation Closer To Property Lines: In the final year of
excavation, the mining operation may as part of the reclamation project,
excavate closer than forty feet (40') to any property lines, but only upon a
showing of compelling mutual good and the approval of the Planning Commission
and City Council.
   D.   Reclamation Verification: At the conclusion of mining operation and
reclamation of the excavation site, the building and zoning inspector and City
Engineer shall present to the Planning Commission a statement verifying the
permit area has been reclaimed in compliance with the requirements of this
chapter and reclamation plans previously submitted in compliance with this
chapter. The Planning Commission shall certify to the City Council that all
requirements of this chapter have been met. (1989 Code § 12-12-012)
10-6-11: TRANSFER TO SUCCESSOR OPERATOR:
Whenever an operator succeeds to the interest of another operator by sale,
assignment, lease or other means, the Planning Commission may release the first
operator from his responsibilities under his approved plans as described in
section
10-6-5 of this chapter, including surety, provided the successor assumes all of
the responsibilities of the former operator to the satisfaction of the Planning
Commission under the approved operations and reclamation plans and the positing
of surety. Upon satisfactory assumption of such responsibilities by the
successor operator, under conditions approved by the Planning Commission, the
responsibility of the total excavation site shall be transferred to the
successor operator. (1989 Code § 12-12-008)
10-6-12: REVOCATION OR MODIFICATION OF PERMIT:
Any natural resources excavation permit issued shall be subject to revocation
or modification by the Planning Commission, for cause, and in the following
manner:
   A.   Notice Of Failure To Comply: A notice shall be served on the owner or
the permittee by the building and zoning inspector or his representative
specifying the failure to comply with the requirements of the natural resource
zone or with any of the conditions set forth in the natural resources permit or
this chapter, requiring him to appear before the Planning Commission at a
designated date and hour to show cause why said permit should not be revoked or
modified. (1989 Code § 12-12-007)
   B.   Hearing: Upon the date set for hearing, the Planning Commission shall
hear all charges and other testimony relating to the matter under
consideration. The Planning Commission shall then decide to either continue,
revoke, modify or refer to the City Attorney for further action. (1989 Code §
12-12-007; amd. 1998 Code)
   C.   Modification Of Permit Plans: Modification of the natural resources
permit plans may be initiated either by the Planning Commission or by the
permittee where it is merely sought to effect minor revisions on the approved
grading plan, schedule of proposed operation, proposed reuse plan or landscape
plan. Consideration of such revisions need not require a public hearing;
provided, that in the judgment of the Planning Commission the proposed
revisions would not constitute significant changes; and providing also, that
the permittee has not expressly requested that a public hearing be held. (1989
Code § 12-12-007)
10-6-13: APPEALS TO CITY COUNCIL:
Appeals from any decision of the Planning Commission with respect to a natural
resources excavation permit may be directed to the City Council within thirty
(30) days and in the manner prescribed for in this title. Upon the hearing of
such appeal, the City Council may, by motion, affirm, reverse, or modify in
whole or in part, any determination of the Planning Commission. (1989 Code §

system, if so proposed by the developer and accepted by the city; or
      2.   Granting to the city a permanent open space easement on and over the
said private open spaces to guarantee that the open space remains perpetually
in the use for which it was intended, with ownership and maintenance
responsibilities being that of a homeowners' association established with

10-13-1: SCOPE AND APPLICATION:
The provisions and special regulations of this chapter will apply to all
proposed industrial development within an L-I, T-1 or N-R zone. The provisions
of this chapter will be in addition to the requirements outlined in the L-I, T-
1 and N-R zones or any other requirements imposed by a conditional use permit.
(Ord. 08-06, 3-25-2008)
10-13-2: PURPOSE:
The purpose of the industrial park is to provide for a park like healthful
operation environment for industry, from the protection of industry for the
encroachment of uses adverse to the operation and expansion of such industry,
and to protect industries within the district from the adverse effect of other
incompatible industries. These regulations are intended also to reduce the
impact of industries on surrounding nonindustrial land uses; to lessen traffic
congestion; to protect the health and safety of the residents or workers in the
area and within the city in general. (Ord. 08-06, 3-25-2008)
10-13-3: DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Minimum Land Area: The minimum land area required for development of an
industrial park within the provisions of this section is five (5) acres.
   B.   Ownership: The development shall be in single or corporate ownership at
the time of application or the subject of an application filed jointly by all
owners of the property.
   C.   Minimum Lot Area: There is no minimum lot area. Lot sizes shall be as
required by the planning commission for site plan approval or conditional use
approval, whichever is appropriate for the proposed land use. Lots may be
established by metes and bounds descriptions after approval of a preliminary
plat and approval and recording of a road dedication plat.
   D.   Minimum Lot Width: Each lot shall have a minimum lot width as approved
by site plan or conditional use permit except within the N-R zone where the
minimum lot width shall be three hundred feet (300') with a minimum street
frontage of seventy feet (70'). No lot shall face directly onto any public
street or highway that abuts the industrial park site.
   E.   Location To Residential Boundary: No main or accessory building shall
be located within fifty feet (50') of the boundary of a residential zone.
   F.   Geotechnical Recommendations: The developer shall have a geotechnical
analysis done on the site by a geotechnical engineer. The report resulting from
that analysis shall make recommendations on proper construction methods for the
site as well as make recommendations on road construction standards based on an
assumption that there will be frequent heavy truck traffic in the industrial
park. Recommendations of the geotechnical report shall be followed both in
development of the industrial park as well as individual lots within the
industrial park.
   G.   Street Overlay: Due to the uncertainty of individual lot locations at
the time of city approval, it is likely that it will become necessary to
introduce street pavement cuts when individual lots are developed to provide
utility connections. In addition to constructing roads according to the
geotechnical recommendations, the developer shall be responsible for
resurfacing all public streets that have been cut to provide utility
connections to lots within the development within four (4) years of recordation
of the street dedication plat. The resurfacing shall consist of milling one and
one-half inches (11/2") of asphalt off the street and overlaying a new two inch
(2") layer of asphalt. The cost of resurfacing all streets in the development
shall be established by the developer's engineer and verified by the city
engineer. The funds required to perform the resurfacing shall be deposited with
the city in an escrow account established for that purpose. If after the
resurfacing is performed there are escrow funds left, they shall be refunded to
the developer of the industrial park. (Ord. 08-06, 3-25-2008)
10-13-4: LANDSCAPING:
   A.   Required; Site Plan: At least fifteen percent (15%) of the total site
shall be thoroughly landscaped, including an irrigation system adequate to
maintain such landscaping.
Landscaping shall meet the requirements of chapter 15 of this title. Where
appropriate, a performance bond will be required to ensure compliance with
approved site plans.
   B.   Included Landscaping: Landscaping may include, but not be limited to,
planting of grass, shrubs or trees, decorative plazas and fountains.
Landscaping shall be used to the extent possible to screen visually all
buildings and parking areas from abutting land uses. Landscaping shall meet the
requirements of chapter 15 of this title. (Ord. 08-06, 3-25-2008)
10-13-5: ADVERSE CONDITIONS PROHIBITED:
No land or building devoted to uses authorized by this chapter shall be used or
occupied in any manner so as to create dangerous, injurious, noxious or
otherwise objectionable fire, explosive or other hazards; noise or vibration;
smoke, dust, odor or other form of air pollution; heat, cold, dampness, glare,
electrical or other disturbance; liquid or solid refuse or waste; or other
substance, condition or element in such a manner or in such an amount as to
affect adversely the surrounding area or adjoining premises. (Ord. 08-06, 3-25-
2008)
10-13-6: MEASUREMENT LOCATION:
The determination of the existence of dangerous and objectionable elements
shall be made at any point; provided however, that the measurements having to
do with noise, vibration, odors or glare shall be taken at the lot line of the
establishment or use. (Ord. 08-06, 3-25-2008)
10-13-7: INDUSTRIAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS:
The following performance standards are intended to ensure that all industries
will provide necessary modern control methods to protect the city from hazards
and nuisances; to set objective quantitative standards for the maximum
tolerated levels of frequently hazardous or annoying emissions; and to protect
any industry from arbitrary exclusion or persecution based solely on the
characteristics of that type of industry's past controlled operation.
   A.   Noise:
      1.   Level: No use shall emit or cause the emission of sound from a
stationary source such that the one hour equivalent sound level (Leq) of
resultant sound measurement at the lot line of the establishment or use exceeds
by six (6) dB or more than one hour equivalent sound level (Leq) caused by
ground transportation as estimated for that point of measurement and that time
of day, pursuant to FHWA-RD-77-108 highway traffic noise prediction model, or
by other techniques at least as accurate as those set out in FHWA-RD-77-108.
The sound level measuring instrumentation shall conform with ANSI S1.4-1971
type 1, and the measurement procedure shall be compatible with that according
to ANSI S1.13-1971, with the following adjustments:
         a.   Temporal And Tonal Characteristics Of Sound: If the sound has a
pronounced audible tonal quality such as a whine, screech, buzz or hum, or if
the sound has an audible cyclic variation in sound level such as beating or
other amplitude modulation, five (5) dB shall be added to the measured sound
level to allow for increased subjective response to the sound.
         b.   Quasi-Steady Impulsive Sound: Where the sound is of a repetitive
impulse nature so that a steady reading is obtained using the "slow response"
setting on the sound level meter, then ten (10) dB shall be added to the
measured value to allow for the increased subjective response to the sound. An
adjustment may be made under only one of subsection A1a of this section and
this subsection A1b. In a case where both subsections apply, then this
subsection A1b takes precedence.
      2.   Stationary Source: No use shall emit or cause to permit the emission
of sound of an impulsive nature from a stationary source such that it results
in an impulsive sound level at a point of measurement in excess of eighty (80)
dB or in a one hour equivalent level (Leq) exceeding that one hour equivalent
level (Leq) caused by ground transportation as estimated for that point of
measurement and that time of day, pursuant to FHWA-RD-77-108 or equivalent
method.
   B.   Vibration: No vibration (other than from transportation facilities or
temporary construction work) shall be permitted which is discernable without
instruments at the property line.
   C.   Odors: No emission of odorous gases or other odorous matter shall be
permitted in such quantities as to be readily detectable when diluted in the
ratio of one volume of odorous air to four (4) volumes of clean air (1:4) at
the point of greatest concentration. Any process which may involve the creation
or emission of any odors shall be provided with a secondary safeguard system so
that control will be maintained if the primary safeguard system should fail.
   D.   Glare: No direct or sky reflected glare, whether from floodlights or
from high temperature processes, such as combustion or welding or otherwise,
shall be permitted to be visible at the property lines. This restriction shall
not apply to signs or lighting of buildings or grounds for advertising or
protection otherwise permitted by the provision of this chapter.
   E.   Fire And Explosion Hazards: All activities involving and all storage of
flammable and explosive materials shall be provided at any point with adequate
safety devices against the hazard of fire and explosion and adequate
firefighting and fire suppression equipment and devices standard in the
industry. Burning of waste materials in open fires is prohibited at any point.
   F.   Air Pollution: No particulate or gaseous pollutants shall be emitted
into the air in violation of the Utah state air conservation act, its
amendments, or resulting regulations.
   G.   Liquid Or Solid Wastes: No discharges at any point into a public sewer,
private sewage system or stream, or into the ground shall be allowed contrary
to the Utah state water pollution control act, its amendments, the subsequent
wastewater disposal regulations or the Utah code of solid waste disposal
regulations. (Ord. 08-06, 3-25-2008)
10-13-8: PERFORMANCE STANDARDS REVIEW:
In addition to meeting other application requirements for a conditional use
permit, parties seeking a conditional use permit for an industrial use shall
include in the application a description of the proposed machinery, products
and processes to be located at the development. If, in its opinion, the
proposed use may cause an emission of dangerous or objectionable elements, the
planning commission may refer the application for investigation and report to
one or more expert consultants qualified to advise as to whether a proposed use
will conform to the applicable performance standards specified in section
10-13-7 of this chapter. A copy of such report shall be promptly furnished to
the applicant. The cost of such expert report shall be borne by the applicant.
(Ord. 08-06, 3-25-2008)
10-13-9: RULING BY PLANNING COMMISSION:
Within thirty (30) days after the planning commission has received the
aforesaid application or report, if a report was required, or within such
period as agreed to by the applicant, the planning commission shall determine
whether reasonable measures are being employed to assure compliance with the
applicable performance standards. On such basis the planning commission may
authorize or refuse to authorize issuance of a conditional use permit or may
require a modification of the proposed plans, construction specifications,
device or operation, and shall so inform the building inspector. (Ord. 08-06,
3-25-2008)
10-13-10: CONTINUED COMPLIANCE:
Any permit so authorized and taken shall evidence only that reasonable measures
are being taken. It shall not relieve the applicant of the responsibility of
meeting such standards when the plant is actually in operation; and, in case of
a failure to perform in accordance with the standards, whatever additional
devices or modifications in process shall be necessary to achieve full
compliance with the standards shall be the sole responsibility of the
applicant. (Ord. 08-06, 3-25-2008)
10-13-11: INVESTIGATION:
The zoning administrator shall investigate any purported violation of
performance standards and, if necessary for such investigation, may request
that the planning commission employ qualified experts. If, after public hearing
and due notice, the planning commission finds that a violation has existed or
does exist, it shall order the zoning administrator to serve notice that
compliance with the performance standards must be achieved within a specified
period of time or the plant will be shut down. Should the violation of
performance standards threaten the public health, convenience or welfare, the
planning commission may order the offending plant to cease operation until
proper steps are taken to correct the conditions which cause the violation. The
services of any qualified experts employed by the planning commission to advise
in establishing a violation shall be paid by the violator if said violation is
established by the city. (Ord. 08-06, 3-25-2008)

10-14-1: PURPOSE:
The city council of South Weber, Utah, deems that, in order to keep the peace,
health, safety, and welfare and promote the best interest of the inhabitants of
the city of South Weber, these "sensitive lands development regulations" be
created, which shall provide standards, guidelines and criteria, having the
effect of minimizing flooding, fire, erosion, and other natural and manmade
hazards and protect people and property while protecting the natural scenic
character of the sensitive land areas not suitable for development, or suitable
for development only after mitigation of hazards and ensuring the efficient
expenditure of public funds.
The standards, guidelines, and criteria to be achieved by the overlay zone
shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
   A.   The protection of the public from natural and manmade hazards;
   B.   The minimizing of the threat and consequential damages of fire in
foothill areas by establishing fire protection measures;
   C.   The preservation of natural features, wildlife habitat and open space;
(Ord. 2001-5, 2-13-2001)
   D.   The preservation of public access to mountain areas and the
preservation of natural drainage channels;
   E.   The preservation and enhancement of visual and environmental quality by
use of natural vegetation and the prohibition of excessive excavation,
terracing and removal of natural vegetation; (Ord. 09-03, 8-11-2009)
   F.   The establishment of traffic circulation facilities that ensure ingress
and egress for vehicles including emergency vehicles into all developed areas
at any time of the year with minimal cuts, fills, or visible scars;
   G.   The encouragement of a variety of development designs and concepts that
are compatible with the natural terrain of the foothill areas, that will
preserve open space and natural landscape;
   H.   The establishment of land use management criteria that will encourage
protection of natural elements while allowing a harmonious and satisfying
residential environment;
   I.   The encouragement of regard for the view of the foothills, as well as
the view from the foothills; and
   J.   The determination of areas in the city that, due to geologic hazards,
may not be suitable for development, or may require engineering measures to
reduce the hazards to an acceptable level. (Ord. 2001-5, 2-13-2001)
10-14-2: SCOPE AND APPLICATION:
   A.   The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all lands in South Weber
City that are so designated as sensitive lands on the sensitive lands overlay
map located in the South Weber general plan or as determined by the city.
   B.   This chapter makes additional provisions to those set forth in title 11
of this code and other chapters of this title. Additional requirements not
covered in this chapter may be required by the city if they determine that it
reasonably appears that there are additional hazards associated with the site.
In the event of conflict between such foregoing designated chapters of this
title, the more restrictive provisions shall apply. (Ord. 09-03, 8-11-2009)
   C.   The provisions of these amendments shall have no application to
subdivisions, planned unit developments, or other construction projects, which
have been granted preliminary approval prior to the adoption of this chapter.
(Ord. 2001-5, 2-13-2001)
10-14-3: SENSITIVE LANDS OVERLAY MAP:
The South Weber general plan map specifies areas of the city which are
development sensitive for various defined reasons. When these areas
are proposed for development, the applicant must go through the process
outlined in this chapter in conjunction with title 11, "Subdivision
Regulations", of this code. Properties within this overlay may not be suitable
for development or may only be suitable after mitigation of the hazards
associated with the specific site. Development within sensitive lands may have
one or more of (but is not limited to) the following natural and manmade
hazards: slope ten percent (10%) or above, dense brush, faults/fault zones,
high liquefaction potential, debris flow and other sediment laden flows,
flooding, landslides, rockfalls, shallow groundwater, potentially contaminated
grounds, groundwater, and wetlands.
In the event that there are hazards in an area that are not depicted on the
sensitive lands overlay map, studies, as determined by the city and at the
developer's expense, may be required and the process outlined in this chapter
will be followed. The sensitive lands overlay map is located in the map section
of the general plan. (Ord. 09-03, 8-11-2009)
10-14-4: APPEALS; BOUNDARIES OF MAPPED HAZARDS:
The boundary lines of the sensitive lands overlay and the hazards therein are a
general depiction and should be field verified.
Where there is a conflict between the boundary lines illustrated on the map and
actual field conditions, or where mapped hazards are not present within a
particular area, the dispute shall be settled as follows:
   A.   The applicant shall submit to the city, technical and geologic evidence
by a qualified geotechnical engineer or geologist to support the claim.
   B.   The sketch plan review committee may require additional reviews. These
reviews may be generated by the Utah geologic survey (UGS) or an independent
geologist or geotechnical engineer. The cost for all reviews is the sole
responsibility of the developer.
   C.   If, after additional reviews are made, the sketch plan review committee
agrees with the applicant's engineer and the site is determined to be out of
the sensitive lands overlay area, the applicant may proceed with their
application as outlined in title 11, "Subdivision Regulations", of this code.
(Ord. 09-03, 8-11-2009)
   D.   If, after additional reviews are made, a consensus is not reached by
the sketch plan review committee and the applicant, the item may be appealed to
the city appeal authority.
   E.   The applicant shall pay any costs incurred for any review considered
necessary by the sketch plan review committee, other than costs relating to the
city's geological hazards ordinance, the costs for which are equally shared by
the applicant and the city. (Ord. 13-03, 6-25-2013)
10-14-5: SENSITIVE LANDS SUBMITTAL AND APPROVAL PROCESS FOR BUILDING PERMITS
AND SITE PLANS:
Each step should be followed in the order outlined.
   A.   A meeting may be requested to determine the feasibility of the
development and review the sensitive lands overlay map from the general plan to
determine if the site is in the sensitive lands area and if it is, what hazards
are associated with the site. If the site is outside of the sensitive lands
area, the process outlined in title 11, "Subdivision Regulations", of this code
will be followed. If it is subsequently determined that the site is within the
sensitive lands area or the site has geologic hazards that are not shown on the
map the review process will be pursuant to this chapter.
   B.   All building permits on single lots, which are in the sensitive lands'
areas, will follow the outline through this section up to subsection D of this
section after which the building permit may be issued administratively after it
is determined that the lot can be developed in accordance with the intent of
this chapter.
      If the only hazard associated with the site is high liquefaction, then
the applicant must submit a soils report with recommendations for control of
subsurface water as well as footing and foundation design after which the
proposal will follow the process outlined in title 11 of this code.
   C.   All applications required in this section shall first be submitted for
review by the City Planner or designee and the City Engineer or designee. The
following items are required to be submitted with the application for site
plan:
      1.   Location of the proposal, with identification of abutting streets;
      2.   A plan showing the average "slope" (as defined in section 10-14-8 of
this chapter) of the proposed site broken down into homogenous slope zones,
generally with no more than a five percent (5%) difference in slope within each
slope zone and with each zone no smaller than ten thousand (10,000) square
feet;
      3.   The number of lots;
      4.   The location and size of proposed lots;
      5.   Location, width, and grade of all proposed streets or hard surfaced
areas, and radius of any cul-de-sac;
      6.   Soil/geologic report that addresses all items in the scope of work
as approved by the committee and, if applicable, recommendations by a qualified
geotechnical engineer. Reports shall be site specific and identify all geologic
hazards, whether on or off site, if it affects the particular property
including the following hazard(s):
         a.   Flood history and potential; proximity to known canals, lakes,
streams, and alluvial fan flooding;
         b.   Definition of any zones of deformation with respect to active
faults and recommended setbacks therefrom;
         c.   Evidence for other mass movement of soil and rock (landslides,
debris flows, rockfalls);
         d.   Evaluation of the site for global and local instabilities;
         e.   Identification of anomalies of the terrain or characteristics of
the geological materials which would have any potential impact upon the use of
site;
         f.   Determination of characteristics including any contamination that
may be present in the groundwater or soil;
         g.   The report shall contain written recommendations for construction
of structures and avoidance or mitigation of the hazards;
         h.   Report on soil characteristics. Data regarding the nature,
distribution, and strength of soils within the project area. The soil report
shall include a unified classification of all soils with an estimate of
susceptibility to erosion, plasticity index, liquid limit, shrink-swell
potential, and general suitability for development;
         i.   Estimate of the likely highest level of the water table
considering the long-term effects of development and irrigation.
   D.   After the application is received, the geologic and soil report will be
reviewed by the City Planner or designee and the City Engineer or designee and,
if geologic hazards exist, other geotechnical advisors which may include the
Utah geologic survey (UGS). If after review, the committee concurs with the
geologic and soil report submitted by the applicant, the item will be forwarded
to the planning commission for review for preliminary plan or site plan
approval. If the submitted information does not provide sufficient data for
recommendation of approval, the City may require additional studies to be
performed.
   A determination by the City Planner or designee and the City Engineer or
designee that the site plan cannot be developed may be appealed by the
applicant to the appeal authority by filing of a written notice of appeal
within thirty (30) days of the action.

         a.   Structural retaining walls may be a part of the dwelling unit, if
designed to function in that manner, and approved by the city building
official.
         b.   Structural retaining walls must be designed by an authorized
licensed professional engineer and approved by the city engineer.
         c.   Any wall less than four feet (4') in height (vertical) is
considered "decorative" and not subject to approval by the city.
         d.   Any terracing of retaining walls shall be considered a structural
retaining wall that must be designed by an authorized licensed professional
engineer and approved by the city engineer.
         e.   Rock walls are considered "decorative" and cannot be used as
structural retaining walls.
   H.   Streets And Ways: Streets, roadways, and private accessways shall
follow as nearly as possible the natural terrain. The following additional
standards shall apply:
      1.   At least two (2) ingress and egress routes shall be provided for
each subdivision or condominium project, in the long range development plans of
the development unless it is determined by the planning commission that it is
not feasible due to topography or other constraints. If so determined,
additional development requirements may be imposed in order to mitigate
circumstances of a single access;
      2.   Points of access shall be provided, giving access to all developed,
partially developed, or undeveloped areas for emergency and firefighting
equipment. Driveways located upon each lot extending from a public street shall
have a maximum grade of twelve percent (12%) for a length not to exceed one
hundred fifty feet (150') and a minimum width of ten feet (10');

approved by the reviewing authority.
   J.   Building Permit Bond: In addition to the performance bond, anything
that is required by this chapter shall be bonded for. (Ord. 09-03, 8-11-2009)
10-14-13: WILDLAND-URBAN INTERFACE:
   A.   Administration: The provisions of this section shall apply to the
construction, alteration, movement, repair, maintenance and use of any
building, structure or premises within the urban wildland interface areas in
this jurisdiction.
Buildings or conditions in existence at the time of the adoption of this
section are allowed to have their use or occupancy continued, if such
condition, use or occupancy was legal at the time of the adoption of this
section provided such continued use does not constitute a distinct danger to
life or property.
Buildings or structures moved into or within the jurisdiction shall comply with
the provisions of this section for new buildings or structures.
      1.   General: The objective of this section is to establish minimum
regulations consistent with nationally recognized good practice for the
safeguarding of life and property. Regulations in this section are intended to
mitigate the risk to life and structures from intrusion of fire from wildland
fire exposures and fire exposures from adjacent structures and to mitigate
structure fires from spreading to wildland fuels.
The development and use of property in wildland-urban interface areas is a
potential threat to life and property from fire and resulting erosion.
Safeguards to prevent the occurrence of fires and to provide adequate fire
protection facilities to control the spread of fire in wildland-urban interface
areas shall be in accordance with this section.
This section shall supplement the jurisdiction's building and fire codes, if
such codes have been adopted, to provide for special regulations to mitigate
the fire and life safety hazards of the wildland-urban interface areas.
         a.   Retroactivity: The provisions of this section shall apply to
conditions arising after the adoption thereof, conditions not legally in
existence at the adoption of this section, to conditions which, in the opinion
of the code official, constitute a distinct hazard to life or property.
         b.   Additions Or Alterations: Additions or alterations may be made to
any building or structure without requiring the existing building or structure
to comply with all of the requirements of this section, provided the addition
or alteration conforms to that required for a new building or structure.
Additions or alterations shall not be made to an existing building or structure
that will cause the existing building or structure to be in violation of any of
the provisions of this section nor shall such additions or alterations cause
the existing building or structure to become unsafe. An unsafe condition shall
be deemed to have been created if an addition or alteration will cause the
existing building or structure to become structurally unsafe or overloaded;
will not provide adequate access in compliance with the provisions of this
section or will obstruct existing exits or access; will create a fire hazard;
will reduce required fire resistance or will otherwise create conditions
dangerous to human life.
            (1)   Exception: Provisions of this section that specifically apply
to existing conditions are retroactive. See appendix A attached to the
ordinance codified herein.
         c.   Maintenance: All buildings, structures, landscape materials,
vegetation, defensible space or other devices or safeguards required by this
section shall be maintained in conformance to the code edition under which
installed. The owner or the owner's designated agent shall be responsible for
the maintenance of buildings, structures, landscape materials and vegetation.

have the power to render interpretations of this section and to adopt and
enforce rules and supplemental regulations to clarify the application of its
provisions. Such interpretations, rules and regulations shall be in conformance
to the intent and purpose of this section.
A copy of such rules and regulations shall be filed with the city recorder and
shall be in effect immediately thereafter. Additional copies shall be available
for distribution to the public.
         b.   Liability Of The Code Official: The code official charged with
the enforcement of this section, acting in good faith and without malice in the
discharge of the duties required by this section or other pertinent law or
ordinance, shall not thereby be rendered personally liable for damages that may
accrue to persons or property as a result of an act or by reason of an act or
omission in the discharge of such duties. A suit brought against the code
official or employee because of such act or omission performed by the code
official or employee in the enforcement of any provision of such codes or other
pertinent laws or ordinances implemented through the enforcement of this
section or enforced by the code enforcement agency shall be defended by this
jurisdiction until final termination of such proceedings, and any judgment
resulting therefrom shall be assumed by this jurisdiction. The code enforcement
agency or its parent jurisdiction shall not be held as assuming any liability
by reason of the inspections authorized by this section or any permits or
certificates issued under this section.
      3.   Compliance Alternatives:
         a.   Practical Difficulties: When there are practical difficulties
involved in carrying out the provisions of this section, the code official is
authorized to grant modifications for individual cases on application in
writing by the owner or a duly authorized representative. The code official
shall first find that a special individual reason makes enforcement of the
strict letter of this section impractical, the modification is in conformance
to the intent and purpose of this section and the modification does not lessen
any fire protection requirements or any degree of structural integrity. The
details of any action granting modifications shall be submitted to the
applicant in writing and entered into the files of the code enforcement agency.
If the code official determines that difficult terrain, danger of erosion or
other unusual circumstances make strict compliance with the vegetation control
provisions of the code detrimental to safety or impractical, enforcement
thereof may be suspended, provided that reasonable alternative measures are
taken.
         b.   Technical Assistance: To determine the acceptability of
technologies, processes, products, facilities, materials and uses attending the
design, operation or use of a building or premises subject to the inspection of
the code official, the code official is authorized to require the owner or the
person in possession or control of the building or premises to provide, without
charge to the jurisdiction, a technical opinion and report. The opinion and
report shall be prepared by a qualified engineer, specialist, laboratory or
fire safety specialty organization acceptable to the code official and the
owner and shall analyze the fire safety of the design, operation or use of the
building or premises, the facilities and appurtenances situated thereon and
fuel management for purposes of establishing fire hazard severity to recommend
necessary changes.
         c.   Alternative Materials Or Methods: The code official, in
concurrence with approval from the building official and fire chief, is
authorized to approve alternative materials or methods, provided that the code
official finds that the proposed design, use or operation satisfactorily
complies with the intent of this section and that the alternative is, for the
purpose intended, at least equivalent to the level of quality, strength,
effectiveness, fire resistance, durability and safety prescribed by this
section. Approvals under the authority herein contained shall be subject to the
approval of the building official whenever the alternate material or method
involves matters regulated by the international building code.
The code official shall require that sufficient evidence or proof be submitted
to substantiate any claims that may be made regarding its use. The details of
any action granting approval of an alternate shall be recorded and entered in
the files of the code enforcement agency. (Ord. 09-03, 8-11-2009)
      4.   Appeals: To determine the suitability of alternative materials and
methods and to provide for reasonable interpretations of the provisions of this
section, the South Weber appeal authority shall be the appeal board. The appeal
authority shall adopt reasonable rules and regulations for conducting its
investigations and shall render decisions and findings in writing to the code
official, with a duplicate copy to the applicant.
         a.   Limitations Of Authority: The appeal authority shall not have
authority relative to interpretation of the administrative provisions of this
section and shall not have authority to waive requirements of this section.
(Ord. 13-03, 6-25-2013)
      5.   Permits: When not otherwise provided in the requirements of the
building or fire code, permits are required in accordance with this section.
         a.   Code Official Approval Required: No land use permit or building
permit shall be issued within the wildland-urban interface area unless the code
official first approves such permit. No subdivision may be approved in the
wildland-urban interface area without first obtaining the advice and approval
of the code official.
      6.   Plans And Specifications: Plans, engineering calculations, diagrams
and other data shall be submitted in at least two (2) sets with each
application for a permit. When such plans are not prepared by an architect or
engineer, the code official may require the applicant submitting such plans or
other data to demonstrate that state law does not require that the plans be
prepared by a licensed architect or engineer. The code official may require
plans, computations and specifications to be prepared and designed by an
architect or engineer licensed by the state to practice as such even if not
required by state law.
Exception: Submission of plans, calculations, construction inspection
requirements and other data, if it is found that the nature of the work applied
for is such that reviewing of plans is not necessary to obtain compliance with
this section.
         a.   Information On Plans And Specifications: Plans and specifications
shall be drawn to scale upon substantial paper and shall be of sufficient
clarity to indicate the location, nature and extent of the work proposed, and
show in detail that it will conform to the provisions of this section and all
relevant laws, ordinances, rules and regulations.
         b.   Site Plan: In addition to the requirements for plans in the
international building code, site plans shall include topography, width and
percent of grade of access roads, landscape and vegetation details, locations
of structures or building envelopes, existing or proposed overhead utilities,
and site water supply systems. Site plans shall also include occupancy
classifications of buildings, types of ignition resistant construction of

plans shall include details regarding the vicinity within three hundred feet
(300') of property lines, including other structures, slope, vegetation, fuel
breaks, water supply systems and access roads.
         g.   Retention Of Plans: One set of approved plans, specifications and
computations shall be retained by the code official for a period of not less
than ninety (90) days from date of completion of the work covered therein; and
one set of approved plans and specifications shall be returned to the
applicant, and said set shall be kept on the site of the building, use or work
at all times during which the work authorized thereby is in progress.
      7.   Inspection And Enforcement:
         a.   Inspection: All construction or work for which a permit is
required by this section shall be subject to inspection by the code official
and all such construction or work shall remain accessible and exposed for
inspection purposes until approved by the code official. It shall be the duty
of the permit applicant to cause the work to remain accessible and exposed for
inspection purposes. Neither the code official nor the jurisdiction shall be
liable for expense entailed in the removal or replacement of any material
required to allow inspection.
Approval as a result of an inspection shall not be construed to be an approval
of a violation of the provisions of this or of other ordinances of the
jurisdiction. Inspections presuming to give authority to violate or cancel the
provisions of this section or of other ordinances of the jurisdiction shall not
be valid.
A survey of the lot may be required by the code official to verify that the
mitigation features are provided and the building or structure is located in
accordance with the approved plans.
            (1)   Authority To Inspect: The code official shall inspect, as
often as necessary, buildings and premises, including such other hazards or
appliances designated by the code official for the purpose of ascertaining and
causing to be corrected any conditions that could reasonably be expected to
cause fire or contribute to its spread, or any violation of the purpose of this
section and of any other law or standard affecting fire safety.
            (2)   Reinspection: To determine compliance with this section, the
code official may cause a structure to be reinspected. A fee may be assessed
for each inspection or reinspection when such portion of work for which
inspection is called is not complete or when corrections called for are not
made.
Reinspection fees may be assessed when the approved plans are not readily
available to the inspector, for failure to provide access on the date for which
inspection is requested or for deviating from plans requiring the approval of
the code official.
To obtain a reinspection, the applicant shall pay the reinspection fee as set
forth in the currently adopted fee schedule. When reinspection fees have been
assessed, no additional inspection of the work will be performed until the
required fees have been paid.
         b.   Enforcement:
            (1)   Authorization To Issue Corrective Orders And Notices: When
the code official finds any building or premises that are in violation of this
section, the code official is authorized to issue corrective orders and
notices.

required by this section shall be given or served on the owner, operator,
occupant or other person responsible for the condition or violation either by
verbal notification, personal service, or delivering the same to, and leaving
it with, a person of suitable age and discretion on the premises; or, if no
such person is found on the premises, by affixing a copy thereof in a
conspicuous place on the door to the entrance of said premises and by mailing a
copy thereof to such person by registered or certified mail to the person's
last known address.
Orders or notices that are given verbally shall be confirmed by service in
writing as herein provided.
         c.   Right Of Entry: Whenever necessary to make an inspection to
enforce any of the provisions of this section, or whenever the code official
has reasonable cause to believe that there exists in any building or on any
premises any condition that makes such building or premises unsafe, the code
official is authorized to enter such building or premises at all reasonable
times to inspect the same or to perform any duty authorized by this section,
provided that if such building or premises is occupied, the code official shall
first present proper credentials and request entry; and if such building or
premises is unoccupied, the code official shall first make a reasonable effort
to locate the owner or other persons having charge or control of the building
or premises and request entry.
If such entry is refused, the code official shall have recourse to every remedy
provided by law to secure entry. Owners, occupants or any other persons having
charge, care or control of any building or premises, shall, after proper
request is made as herein provided, promptly permit entry therein by the code
official for the purpose of inspection and examination pursuant to this
section.
         d.   Compliance With Orders And Notices: Orders and notices issued or
served as provided by this section shall be complied with by the owner,
operator, occupant or other person responsible for the condition or violation

premises or vehicle subject to this section who allow hazard to exist or fail
to take immediate action to abate a hazard on such occupancy, premises or
vehicle when ordered or notified to do so by the code official shall be guilty
of a misdemeanor.
            (4)   Unsafe Conditions: Buildings, structures or premises that
constitute a fire hazard or are otherwise dangerous to human life, or which in
relation to existing use constitute a hazard to safety or health or public
welfare, by reason of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, obsolescence, fire
hazard, disaster damage or abandonment as specified in this section or any
other ordinance, are unsafe conditions. Unsafe buildings or structures shall
not be used.
Unsafe buildings are hereby declared to be public nuisances and shall be abated
by repair, rehabilitation, demolition or removal, pursuant to applicable state
and local laws and codes.
      8.   Certificate Of Completion: No building, structure or premises shall
be used or occupied, and no change in the existing occupancy classification of
a building, structure, premises or portion thereof shall be made until the code
official has issued a certificate of completion therefor as provided herein.
The certificate of occupancy shall not be issued until the certificate of
completion indicating that the project is in compliance with this section has
been issued by the code official.
Issuance of a certificate of occupancy shall not be construed as an approval of
a violation of the provisions of this section or of other pertinent laws and
ordinances of the jurisdiction. Certificates presuming to give authority to
violate or cancel the provisions of this section or other laws or ordinances of

Each new development or rehabilitated landscape that uses primary potable water
for landscape irrigation must provide a water budget calculation to demonstrate
a Maximum Applied Water Allowance (MAWA) for the new landscape or development.
For parcels using secondary water, the MAWA is determined by the secondary
water provider based on parcel size and is referred to as an allocation.
The Maximum Applied Water Allowance shall be calculated using the following
equation:
MAWA = (ETo) (0.62)(1.15)[(0.8 x LA) + (0.3 x SLA)]
MAWA = Maximum Applied Water Allowance (gallons per year)
ETo = Reference Evapotranspiration (inches per year) as calculated from weather
data at the closest available weather station.
0.62 = Conversion Factor (to gallons)
1.15= Delivery Inefficiency Factor (sprinkler system uniformity etc.)
0.8 = ET Adjustment Factor (ETAF), plant factor or crop coefficient (.8
standard for cool season turf)
LA = Landscape Area including SLA (square feet)
0.3 = Additional Water Allowance for SLA
SLA = Special Landscape Area (square feet)
ETo values can be obtained directly from the USU Climate Center where a
database of weather data from local stations is collected, analyzed, and
stored. If you cannot find the ET data you need, please contact the City.
Additional details and examples of calculations are found in Appendix A. (Ord.

11-1-1: TITLE:
This Title shall be entitled as the SUBDIVISION ORDINANCE OF SOUTH WEBER CITY,
UTAH, and may be so cited.
(Ord. 2023-17, 11-28-2023, eff. 1-1-2024)
11-1-2: PURPOSE:
Promote the health, safety, convenience, and general welfare of the inhabitants
of the City in the matter of Subdivisions or matters affected by Subdivisions
through provisions designed to:
   A.   To promote the health, safety, convenience, and general welfare of the
residents of the City;
   B.   To ensure the efficient and orderly subdivision and development of land
within the City:
   C.   To prevent the uncontrolled division and development of real property,
which may be done without considering the rights and best interests of
adjoining property owners and the City as a whole:
   D.   To avoid subdivisions and developments that:
      1.   Do not comply with the City general plan or ordinances,
      2.   Cannot be adequately served by existing utilities or public
services,
      3.   May prove to be dangerous or unsafe due to design, natural or man-
made hazards existing prior to or created by the subdivision and development,
      4.   May cause an undue burden on existing traffic or transportation
services, or
      5.   May require the future expenditure of public funds to correct
problems caused by the subdivision and development;
   E.   To provide design standards for public improvements, facilities, and
utilities to provide for reasonable access to public rights-of-way, parks,
trails, or open spaces, to provide for the dedication of land and streets
deemed necessary for the proper development of the subdivision, and to provide
for easements or rights-of-way that are necessary to service the properties
created by the subdivision.
(Ord. 2023-17, 11-28-2023, eff. 1-1-2024)
11-1-3: SCOPE:
   A.   This Title is designed to inform the Subdivider and public of the
requirements and conditions necessary to obtain approval of a Subdivision.
Because each parcel of real property has unique site/situational
characteristics (whether natural or man-made), there may be some aspects of
subdivision development that cannot easily be articulated. For this reason, it
is not possible to cover every possible contingency. Therefore, the
Administrative Land Use Authority has the authority to impose reasonable
conditions for the subdivision and development in addition to those expressly
required, provided that:
      1.   The conditions are not arbitrary or capricious;
      2.   The conditions do not conflict with any local, state, federal law.
   B.   This Title shall apply to lots or parcels where public rights of way
are dedicated, and public improvements and infrastructure are installed
regardless of whether the land is subdivided.

All improvements and infrastructure related to a Subdivision shall be installed
according to the requirements of the City Code and the Public Works Standards.
The Subdivider shall be responsible for extending all utilities and
improvements and infrastructure to the Subdivision if they are not already
adjacent to or on the site including curb, gutter, and sidewalk on streets
operated by the Utah Department of Transportation. When the City is to take
ownership of public infrastructure and improvements, the City shall require the
Subdivider to install such improvements in a manner that does not cause
excessive liability or maintenance costs for the City at the convenience or
advantage of the Subdivider.
(Ord. 2023-17, 11-28-2023, eff. 1-1-2024)
11-6-2: UTILITIES REQUIRED:
The following utilities are required to be provided by the Subdivider to each
lot:
   A.   Culinary Water: The water source shall be provided by South Weber City
unless an alternative permanent source is approved by the City Engineer and the
Davis County Health Department.
   B.   Sewer: The sewer service shall be provided by South Weber City through
gravity collection lines. Public sewer lift stations are generally not
permitted.
      1.   Public sewer lift stations may be granted by exception by the
Administrative Land Use Authority and the City Engineer when a lift station is
deemed clearly preferable to the interest of the City and gravity sewer is not
feasible.
      2.   As determined by the Administrative Land Use Authority and the City
Engineer, some property may not be developed if gravity sewer cannot be
reasonably provided.
   C.   Secondary Water: Secondary water service shall be provided by the Davis
and Weber Counties Canal Company, South Weber Irrigation Company, South Weber
Water Improvement District, Weber Basin Water Conservancy District, or an
alternative permanent source as approved by the City.
   D.   Land Drain: The land drain system must be installed in areas with
shallow groundwater. If basements are eliminated and the geotechnical report
can provide sufficient documentation that groundwater levels (including
historical) are deep enough to eliminate the need for the land drain system,
the Administrative Land Use Authority and the City Engineer may allow this
requirement to be waived.
   E.   Electrical Power: The electrical power will be provided by Rocky
Mountain Power (RMP), or their successors and all installations must follow RMP
Standards.
   F.   Natural Gas: The natural gas service will be provided by Dominion
Energy, or their successors, and all installations must follow Dominion Energy
Standards.

Storm water plans shall meet the requirements of the Public Works Standards and
the City Code. The City Engineer shall determine the appropriate implementation
strategy for meeting the City's storm water-related standards, using the
current Capital Facilities Plan as a guide; this may include decisions
regarding ownership and access to storm water ponds, and where and how the
water shall flow as part of the City's overall storm water system.
(Ord. 2023-17, 11-28-2023, eff. 1-1-2024)
11-6-4: INSPECTIONS:
All improvements and infrastructure shall receive inspections by the City
Engineer and/or City Public Works Department as required in the Public Works
Standards and as necessary to verify conformance with the City Code and the
Public Works Standards. Failure to obtain the necessary inspections shall
result in a fine as outlined in this Title. Failure to obtain the necessary
inspections may also necessitate removal and re-installation of the
improvements and infrastructure at the Subdivider's sole cost, as such removal
and re-installation are determined by the City Engineer and/or Public Works
Department.
(Ord. 2023-17, 11-28-2023, eff. 1-1-2024)
11-6-5: FEE IN LIEU OF ACTUAL IMPROVEMENTS:
Subdivisions adjacent to a rural road or another road where the surrounding
area is lacking public improvements and infrastructure may request the option
to pay a fee in lieu of constructing the required improvements and
infrastructure. The Administrative Land Use Authority and City Engineer may
also require payment of the fee in lieu to make improvements as a part of a
larger future project. An Agreement approving the payment of the fee in lieu
may be approved during the Preliminary Improvement Plans Application phase by
the Administrative Land Use Authority and City Engineer. Fee in lieu Agreements
should only be approved when it is unreasonable or undesirable for the
improvements and infrastructure to be installed with the development. The
Agreement should include:
   A.   A calculation of the cost of the improvements not being installed.
   B.   For areas where the future project date is known, inflation costs at a
maximum of three percent (3%) per year may be used up to the project year. For
areas where the future project date is not known, inflation costs may only be
included at a maximum of three percent (3%) per year for five (5) years.
   C.   For areas where off-site improvements have already been constructed and
excess capacity exists that was paid for by the city, Subdividers may "buy in"
to the existing improvements to meet their requirements. A determination of
available excess capacity and cost will be evaluated by the City Engineer.

mean that adequate access exists. It shall be the Subdivider's responsibility
to construct and dedicate all public roads required by the City to provide
access to the Subdivision.
   B.   Design Standards: All Subdivisions shall comply with the current
adopted design standards set forth in the City Code and in the Public Works
Standards.
   C.   Public Infrastructure And Improvements: The City Engineer shall have
authority to require adjustments to the utility plan associated with a proposed
Subdivision including adjustments to the type, manner, and location of
utilities. Such adjustments to the utility plan may be required to provide
connectivity among developments, provide for public safety, and minimize public
infrastructure maintenance and liability.
   D.   Additional Reports And Studies:
      1.   Geotechnical reports as required by the Public Works Standards and
the City Engineer.
      2.   A traffic study may be required by the City Engineer depending on
his/her judgment regarding the size of the Subdivision, complex traffic
movements involved with the proposal, interaction of streets with State roads,
new traffic patterns, traffic volume in or near the Subdivision, history of
crashes or expected crashes in the area, general safety, or anticipated traffic
delays due to the Subdivision.
      3.   Storm water pollution protection as required by the Public Works
Standards and City Code.
      4.   Wetland delineation and mitigation may be required as determined by
the City Engineer.

deficiencies or damages to the improvements and infrastructure required for
final acceptance (see Subsection 10 hereof), the City may declare the escrow
forfeited and the City may install, repair, or cause the required improvements
and infrastructure to be installed or repaired, using the proceeds from the
collection of escrow to defray the expense thereof.

workmanship show unusual depreciation, or do not comply with the acceptable
standards of durability, or if required inspections or testing have not been
done, or if any outstanding liens are not paid, then the City may withhold
releasing the money and the City may declare the Subdivider in default. The
City shall have exclusive control over the release of the escrow funds, and
they may be released only upon written approval by the City.
   G.   Direct Costs: The Subdivider shall pay the following direct costs at
the time they establish the required Improvements Completion Assurance. The
funds collected for each item will be used for the construction and
installation of said items by the city; thus, removing the Subdivider's
responsibility for the installation of these items as part their development:

TITLE 12
FLOOD CONTROL
CHAPTER 1
FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
SECTION:
12-1-1: Statutory Authorization, Findings Of Fact, Purpose, And Methods
12-1-2: Definitions
12-1-3: General Provisions
12-1-4: Administration
12-1-5: Provisions For Flood Hazard Reduction
12-1-1: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE, AND METHODS:
   A.   Statutory Authorization: The Legislature of the State of Utah has in
Utah Code Unannotated 10-3-701 delegated the responsibility of local
governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses.
   B.   Findings of Fact: The flood hazard areas of South Weber City are
subject to periodic inundation by flood waters, which results in potential loss
of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood
protection and relief; all of which adversely affect the public health, safety,
and general welfare of the inhabitants of South Weber City. These potential
flood losses are caused by:
      1.   The cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains that are known
to cause increases in flood heights and velocities;
      2.   The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses and structures
vulnerable to floods because they are inadequately elevated or floodproofed, or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages; and
      3.   Uses deemed unsuitable for floodplain areas or that do not account
for the increased flood risk.
   C.   Statement of Purpose: It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety and general welfare of the City and to minimize public
and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions
designed to:
      1.   Protect human life and health;
      2.   Minimize damage to public infrastructure, including but not limited
to utilities, streets, and bridges that are susceptible to flooding;
      3.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions caused by flooding;
      4.   Minimize public expenditures on flood control projects;
      5.   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and are generally undertaken at the expense of the public;
      6.   Protect and safeguard the welfare and safety of first responders
should an emergency response is needed;
      7.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
      8.   Promote the notification of potential buyers if properties are in a
flood area.
   D.   Methods of Reducing Flood Losses: To accomplish the purposes outlined
in section subsection 12-1-1.C, Statement of Purpose, this chapter applies the
following methods:
      1.   Restricts or prohibits land uses that are dangerous to health,
safety, or property in times of flooding, or cause excessive increases in flood
heights or velocities;
      2.   Requires that land uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      3.   Controls the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
      4.   Controls filling, grading, dredging and other developments that may
increase flood damage; and
      5.   Prevents or regulates the construction of flood barriers that will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or may increase flood hazards to other lands.

                exceeded during any given year (1-percent-annual-chance flood). The terms "100-hundred-
100-YEAR FLOOD: year flood" and "1-percent-annual-chance flood" are synonymous. The term does notimply
                that the flood will necessarily happen once every 100 hundred years. Mandatory
                floodinsurance requirements may apply.
100-YEAR        The area of land susceptible to being inundated due to theoccurrence of a 1-percent-
FLOODPLAIN:     annual-chance flood.
                A flood having a recurrence interval that has a 0.2-percent chance ofbeing equaled or
500-YEAR FLOOD: exceeded during any given year (0.2-percent-annual-chance flood). The termdoes not
                imply that the flood will necessarily happen once every 500 years and mandatory
                floodinsurance requirement generally does not apply.
500-YEAR        The area of land susceptible to being inundated due to theoccurrence of a 0.2-percent-
FLOODPLAIN:     annual-chance flood.
                A structure that is on the same parcel of property as a principal structure. Its use is
                incidental to the use of the principal structure. The ownership of the accessory
ACCESSORY       structure is the same owner as of the principal structure. An accessory structure is a
STRUCTURE:      non-residential structure of low value that is used solely for the parking of vehicles
                and storage of tools, materials, or equipment. No human habitation is allowed within an
                accessory structure. See section 12-1-5, Appurtenant or Accessory Structure.
                Any improvement that expands the enclosed footprint or increases the square footage of

                added underneath a structure.
ALLUVIAL FAN    Flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or similar landform that
FLOODING:       originates at the apex. It is characterized by high-velocity flows; active processes of
                erosion, sediment transport, and deposition; and unpredictable flow paths.
APEX:           A point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path of the major
                stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan flooding can occur.

FLOODING:       (1) to three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of
                flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is
                characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL The land within a city that is most likely to be subject to severe flood-related
FLOOD-RELATED   erosion losses. The area may be designated as Zone E on the Flood Hazard Boundary Map
EROSION HAZARD: (FHBM). After the detailed evaluation of the special flood-related erosion hazard area,
                in preparation for publication of the FIRM, Zone E may be further refined.
                The land in the floodplain within a city subject to a one percent (1%) or greater
                chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as Zone A on the FHBM.
AREA OF SPECIAL After detailed rate making has been completed in preparation for publication of the
FLOOD HAZARD:   FIRM, Zone A usually is refined into Zones A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, A99, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/
                AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, or V1-30, VE, or V. For purposes of these regulations, the term

                property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. Floodproofing
FLOODPROOFING:  can either be accomplished in the form of dry floodproofing in which the structure is
                watertight below the levels that need flood protection, or wet floodproofing in
                permanent or contingent measures applied to a structure that prevent or provide
                resistance to damage from flooding, while allowing floodwaters to enter the structure
                or area.

12-1-3: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   A.   Lands to which this Chapter Applies: This chapter shall apply to all
areas of special flood hazard identified by FEMA and areas of identified and
documented flood risk supported using Best Available Data within the
jurisdiction of South Weber City.When the City annexes any land from a
neighboring city and/or county, South Weber City will manage and regulate the
annexed land under this chapter.
   B.   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard: The areas of
special flood hazard identified by FEMA in a scientific and engineering report
entitled, "The Flood Insurance Study for Davis County, Utah, and incorporated
areas " dated September 15, 2022 (date of effective FIS), accompanying FIRMs,
and any revisions thereto are hereby automatically adopted by reference and
declared to be a part of this chapter.The City has elected to adopt Best
Available Data, defined in subsection 12-1-3.A. Lands to which this Chapter
Applies, to regulate floodplain development in addition to utilizing the
effective FIRMs, FIS, and/or FBFM. Where Best Available Data contradicts the
FIRMs, FIS, and/or the FBFM, the more restrictive data shall be utilized.
   C.   Establishment of Development Permit: A Floodplain Development Permit
shall be required to ensure conformance with the provisionsof this chapter.
   D.   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions: This chapter is not intended to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants,or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance,

   F.   Warning and Disclaimer or Liability: The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable forregulatory purposes and is
based on scientific and engineering considerations. On rareoccasions, greater
floods can and will occur and flood heights may be increased by human-madeor
natural causes.
This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood
hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood
damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City or any
official or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on
this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   G.   Severability: If any section, provision, or portion of this chapter is
adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court, the remainder of the chapter
shall not be affected.

to penalties as prescribed by local or state law including but not limited to
the penalties outlined in subsection 12-1-3.J. Penalties for Noncompliance.
   J.   Penalties for Noncompliance: No structure or land shall hereafter be
constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance
with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violation of
the provisions of this chapter by failure to comply with any of its
requirements(including violations of conditions and safeguards established in
connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person, firm,
or corporation, whether as principal, agent, employee or otherwise, violating
or causing or permitting the violation of any of the provisions of this chapter
shall be guilty of a class B misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be
punishable by a fine or by imprisonment, or by both to the maximum extent
permitted by law. Such person, firm, or corporation shall be deemed to be
guilty of a separate offense for each day during which any portion of any

   B.   Duties and Responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator: Duties and
responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator shall include, but not be
limited to, the following:
      1.   Uphold the goals of the City and the NFIP to reduce risk when
possible and increase the city's resistance to future disasters.
      2.   Maintain and hold open for public inspection all records pertaining
to the provisions of this chapter, including the actual elevation of the lowest
floor (including basement or crawlspace) of all new or substantially improved
structures and any flood-proofing certificates, including the data supporting
such certificates.
      3.   Maintain and hold open for public inspection maps that identify and
locate the boundaries of the SFHAs to which this chapter applies, including,
but not limited to, the FIRM.
      4.   Review development proposals to determine whether a proposed
building site, including sites designed for the placement of manufactured
homes, will be reasonably safe from flooding.
      5.   Review, approve, or deny all applications for development permits
required by adoption of this chapter.
      6.   Ensure that all necessary permits have been obtained from those
federal, state, or local governmental agencies (including Section 404 of the
Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334 and the
Endangered Species Act of 1973) from which prior approval is required.
      7.   Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion of any watercourse is maintained.
      8.   Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent cities and the State
Coordinating Agency which is the Division of Water Rights, prior to any
alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such
notification to FEMA.
      9.   Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the
boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field
conditions), the Floodplain Administrator shall make the necessary
interpretation.
      10.   When BFE data has not been provided by FEMA, the Floodplain
Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any BFE data and
flood way data available from a federal, state, or other source including data
provided by the applicant, in order to administer the provisions of this
chapter.
      11.   When a regulatory flood way has not been designated, no new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill)
shall be permitted within Zones A1-30, AE, and AH on the city's FIRM, unless it
is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one-half (0.50) foot at
any point within the City.
      12.   Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12 of the NFIP
Regulations, a city may approve certain development in Zones A1-30, AE, and AH
on the city's FIRM, which increases the water surface elevation of the base
flood by more than one-half (0.50) foot, provided that the city first meets the
requirements of Section 65.12 for a conditional FIRM revision through FEMA's
CLOMR process.
      13.   Zone A Areas: When a regulatory flood way has not been designated
and if the project is determined or reasonably believed to cause an adverse
impact, the Floodplain Administrator shall require new construction,
substantial improvements, or other development (including fill, grading or
excavation) permitted in a Zone A to have an encroachment analysis done prior
to issuance of a floodplain development permit. The encroachment analysis shall
create a baseline of existing conditions model and compare it to the proposed
conditions model to determine the potential impact of the project. Based on the
findings, the floodplain administrator shall require as a condition of the
permit a CLOMR to be submitted and approved prior to any work occurring and/or
that a LOMR be submitted to FEMA within six (6) months of completion of the
development.
      14.   If the project is determined or reasonably believed to cause an
adverse effect on the BFE(s), boundaries of the floodplain or any insurable
structures, technical justification for the proposed development shall be
submitted and the city may require a CLOMR or LOMR to be submitted prior to the
permit approval or as a requirement of the permit.
   C.   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data:
      1.   The property owner or developer shall notify FEMA by submittal of a
LOMR within six (6) months of project completion when an applicant had obtained
a CLOMR from FEMA orwhen development altered a watercourse, modified floodplain
boundaries, or modified BFE.
      2.   The property owner or developer shall be responsible for preparing
technical data tosupport the CLOMR or LOMR application and paying any
processing or application feesto FEMA. The property owner or developer is
responsible for submitting the CLOMR and LOMR to FEMA and shall provide all
necessary data to FEMA if requested during thereview process to ensure the
CLOMR or LOMR is issued.
      3.   The Floodplain Administrator shall be under no obligation to sign
the Community Acknowledgement Form, which is part of the CLOMR/LOMR
application, until theapplicant demonstrates that the project will or has met
the requirements of thisordinance and all applicable state federal, and local
laws.
   D.   Permit Procedures: Application for a Development Permit shall be
presented to the Floodplain Administrator onforms furnished by him/her and may
include, but not be limited to:
      1.   Duplicated plans drawn to scale showing the location, dimensions,
and elevation ofproposed landscape alterations.
      2.   Duplicated plans drawn to scale showing the location, dimensions,
and elevation ofexisting and proposed structures, including the placement of
manufactured homes.
      3.   Location of the foregoing in relation to SFHAs.
      4.   Elevation (in relation to mean sea level), of the lowest floor
(including basement andcrawlspace) of all new and substantially improved

The City requires that the following Elevations Certificates be completed for
any new residential or non-residential building construction:
      1.   Proposed Conditions: A proposed conditions Elevation Certificate is
required to be completed by a professional and licensed engineer, surveyor, or
architect as part of the Floodplain Permit package.
      2.   Finished Construction: A finished construction Elevation Certificate
is required to be completed by a professional and licensed engineer, surveyor,
or architect once the structure is completed, utilities are installed, and

   E.   Variance Procedures: The appeal authority, as established by the City,
shall hear and render judgment on requests for variances from the requirements
of this chapter after a floodplain development permit has been denied.
      1.   Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the appeal
authority may appeal such decision to 2nd District Court, Davis County, Utah,
as provided by law.
      2.   The appeal authority, as established by the City, shall hear and
render judgment on an appeal only when it is alleged there is an error in any
requirement, decision, or determination made by the Floodplain Administrator in
the enforcement of administration of this chapter.
      3.   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all actions
involving an appeal and shall report variances to FEMA and the State
Coordinating Agency upon issuing a variance.
      4.   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous
to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood level, providing the relevant factors in subsection 12-1-4.E. Variance
Procedures have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the
one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
      5.   Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this
chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this
chapter.
      6.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      7.   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure. The term ‘‘substantial improvement'' does not include
any alteration of a structure or facility listed on the National Register of
Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places.
Prerequisites for granting variances:
      1.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief. Variances shall only be issued upon:
         a.   Showing a good and sufficient cause.
         b.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         c.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, conflict with existing local laws or ordinances, considers the need of
ingress and egress during times of floods, and does not jeopardize first
responders' health and welfare.
      2.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor
elevation below the BFE, and that the cost of flood insurance will be
commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
      3.   Variances may be issued by a city for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of
a functionally dependent use provided that:
         a.   The criteria outlined in subsection 12-1-4.E. Variance Procedures
are met; and
         b.   The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimizeflood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to
publicsafety.
Variances for freeboard and Allowable Increases:

12-1-5: PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION:
   A.   General Standards: In all areas of special flood hazards, the following
provisions are required for all new construction and substantial improvements:
      1.   Construction Materials and Methods:
         a.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be
designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse,
or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and
hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
         b.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be
constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
         c.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials resistant to flood damage.
         d.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be
constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding.
      2.   Utilities:
         a.   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system.
         b.   All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed
to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system and
discharge from the systems into flood waters.
         c.   On-site waste disposal systems shall be designed or located to
avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
   B   Temporary Structures. All temporary structures associated with
festivals, carnivals or other temporary uses placed on sites within Zones A1-
30, AE, AH, AO, and A on the city's FIRM or area that has been identified as a
flood hazard area through the use of Best Available Data are required to:
      1.   Be on the site for fewer than thirty (30) consecutive days.
      2.   Have a plan in place for the removal of the structure including a
list of necessary supplies, tools, and resources needed to achieve the removal.
      3.   Be capable of being removed within twelve (12) hours.
   C.   Temporary Storage: All temporary storage of materials or equipment on
sites within Zones A1-30, AE, AH, AO, and A on the city's FIRM or area that has
been identified as a flood hazard area through the use of Best Available Data
are required to:
      1.   Be on the site for fewer than thirty (30) consecutive days and no
more than ninety (90) cumulative days within a calendar year.
      2.   Have a plan in place for the removal of the equipment or materials
including a list of necessary supplies, tools, and resources needed to achieve
the removal.
      3.   Have proper documentation to support when the materials or equipment
are moved on and off the site.
   D.   Substantial Improvement: Any combination of repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, or improvement of a building or structure, if the
cumulative cost of the entire project equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent,
unless a higher standard option is selected below, of the market value of the
structure only (not of the structure and land value combined) before the
improvement or repair is started then the work shall be considered as
substantial improvement. If the structure has sustained substantial damage, any
repairs are considered substantial improvements regardless of the actual repair
work performed. For Substantial Damage, refer to subsection 12-1-5.F.
Substantial Damage. The term does not, however, include either:
      1.   Any project for improvement of a building required to correct
existing health, sanitary, or safety code violations identified by the building
official and that are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
      2.   Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic
structure.
   E.   Cumulative Substantial Improvement: The City has elected a higher
standard option that includes a cumulative substantial improvement threshold
that is defined as:
Substantial Improvement shall also include any combination of repairs,
reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure
taking place within a selected five (5)-year timeframe.
   F.   Substantial Damage: Substantial damage means damage of any origin
sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its
pre-damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market
value of the structure only, unless a higher standard option is selected,
before the damage occurred. This term also applies to structures which have
incurred any damage that equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the
structure's market value regardless of the actual repair work performed. When a
structure or building has been determined as substantially damaged, any work or
repair on said structure or building will be considered as substantial
improvement and will be required to meet the development requirements set forth
within this chapter for substantial improvement.
   G.   Substantial Improvement and Substantial Damage Determination: For
applications for building permits to improve buildings and structures,
including alterations, movement, enlargement, replacement, repair, change of
occupancy, additions, rehabilitations, renovations, and any other improvement
of or work on such buildings and structures, the Floodplain Administrator, in
coordination with the applicable City officials and staff, shall:
      1.   Estimate the market value or require the applicant to obtain an
appraisal of the market value prepared by a qualified independent appraiser, of
the building or structure only, not of land and building, before the start of
construction of the proposed work. In the case of repair, the market value of
the building or structure shall be the market value before the damage occurred
and before any repairs are made.
      2.   Compare the cost to perform the improvement, the cost to repair a
damaged building to its pre-damaged condition, or the combined costs of
improvements and repairs, if applicable, to the market value of the building or
structure.
      3.   Determine and document whether the proposed work constitutes
substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage; the determination
requires evaluation of previous permits issued for improvements and repairs as
specified in the subsection 12-1-5.D. Substantial Improvement and subsection
12-1-5.E. Cumulative Substantial Improvement.
      4.   Utilize FEMA's Substantial Improvement/Substantial Desk Reference
when making anydetermination on Substantial Improvement and/or Substantial
Damage.
      5.   The substantial improvement regulations apply to all of the work
that is proposed as theimprovement, even if multiple permits are issued.
Therefore, the determination of thecost of the improvement should consider all
costs of all phases of the work beforeissuance of the first permit.
      6.   Notify the applicant that if it is determined that the work
constitutes substantialimprovement or repair of substantial damage and that
compliance with the flood, thisordinance is required.
   H.   Specific Standards: In all SFHAs and areas of known or suspected flood
risk areas, the following provisions shall apply:
      1.   Residential Construction: New construction and substantial
improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including
basement) elevated to the BFE, unless a free-board option is noted below. If a
free-board option is noted, new construction and substantial improvement shall

and/or reviewstructural design, specifications, and plans for the construction
and certify thatthe design and methods of construction are in accordance with
acceptedstandards of practice as outlined in this subsection.
         b.   A record of such certification that includes the specific
elevation (in relation tomean sea level) to which such structures are
floodproofed shall be maintainedby the Floodplain Administrator.
            (1)   If the use or occupancy of the building changes in the future
to residential, then the dryfloodproofing of the structure cannot be used when
determining compliance of thestructure to the residential construction of this
chapter, subsection 12-1-5.H.1. Residential Construction, subsection 12-1-
5.H.1.a. Residential Construction Freeboard and subsection 12-1-5.H.1.b.

closest adjacent BFE.
The development and construction of the structure shall conform to the
provision in FEMA/FIA-Technical Bulletins 1, 2, 10 and 11. Certification and
documentation from a professional, licensed engineer or architect is required
if the structure's lowest floor is built below the BFE.
      3.   Non-Residential Construction Access (Ingress-Egress): New
development proposals will be designed, to the maximum extent practicable, so
non-residential building sites, walkways, driveway, and roadways are located on
land with a naturalgrade within elevation not less than the BFE and with dry
land access.
      4.   Enclosures:
         a.   New construction and substantial improvements with fully enclosed
areas below the lowestfloor that are to be used solely for parking of vehicles,
building access, or storage in an areaother than a basement and that are
subject to flooding, shall be designed to automaticallyequalize hydrostatic
flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit
offloodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement shall either be certified
by a registeredprofessional engineer or architect, or shall meet or exceed the
following minimum criteria:

an enclosure, a non-conversion agreement shall be completed as part of the
permitting process. The non-conversion agreement:
            (1)   Acknowledges the risk associated with this building practice.
            (2)   Acknowledges the use of the area that was permitted as an
enclosure will be used solely on accessory or appurtenant structure of low
value whose usage is only for building access, parking, or storage.
            (3)   Allows for city, state and/or federal officials to conduct
periodic inspections to ensure compliance.
      5.   Crawlspace: New construction and substantial improvements built on a
crawlspace or sub-grade (below grade) crawlspace may be permitted if the
development is designed and meets or exceeds the standards found in FEMA's
Technical Bulletins 1, 2, and 11, which include but are not limited to the
following:
         a.   The structure shall be affixed to a permanent foundation,
designed and adequately anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy. Because of hydrodynamic loads, crawlspace
construction is not allowed in areas with flood velocities greater than five
(5) feet per second unless the design is reviewed by a qualified design
professional, such as a registered architect or professional engineer.
         b.   The crawlspace is an enclosed area below the BFE and, as such,
shall have openings that equalize hydrostatic pressures by allowing the
automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. The bottom of each flood vent opening
can be no more than one (1) foot above the LAG.
         c.   The crawlspace enclosure shall have proper openings that allow
equalization of hydrostatic pressure by allowing automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters. To achieve this, a minimum of one (1) square inch of flood opening
is required per one (1) square foot of the enclosed area subject to
flooding.4.Portions of the building below the BFE shall be constructed with
materials resistant to flood damage. This includes not only the foundation
walls of the crawlspace used to elevate the building, but also any joists,
insulation, piers, or other materials that extend below the BFE. Ductwork, in
particular, shall either be placed above the BFE or sealed from floodwaters.
         d.   Any building utility systems within the crawlspace shall be
elevated above the BFE ordesigned so that floodwaters cannot enter or
accumulate within the systemcomponents during flood conditions.
         e.   The interior grade of a crawlspace below the BFE shall not be
more than two (2) feetbelow the LAG.
         f.   The height of the below-grade crawlspace, measured from the
lowest interior grade ofthe crawlspace floor to the bottom of the floor joist
of the next higher floor cannotexceed four (4) feet at any point.
