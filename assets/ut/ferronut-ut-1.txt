Manager.

drivers' Motor Vehicle Record (MVR) will be screened and monitored on an
ongoing basis to ensure the standard is met and maintained. Drivers will be
qualified as “Acceptable,” “Unacceptable” or “Borderline.” Drivers qualified as
“Borderline” may be authorized to drive on a probationary basis as determined
by the Fleet Manager. Drivers whose records do not meet the driver
qualification standard will not be authorized to operate any vehicle on behalf
of Ferron City.

endorsements must also be maintained. The driver qualification evaluation will

skills assessments and work-related motor vehicle incidents, whether or not the
incident has been recorded on the driver's MVR. All violations recorded on the
MVR, whether they occurred on the job or not, are included in the driver
qualification evaluation.
   D.   “Acceptable” or “Borderline” qualifications will be determined using
the following criteria. Any number of violations or accidents in excess of the

standard resulting in revocation of driver authorization. (Note - DUI and DWI

fault work related accident in the last three (3) years.

      3.   Unacceptable:
         a.   No valid driver license;
         b.   Recent DUI conviction; or
         c.   Four (4) or more violations recorded on the MVR.
   E.   A single major violation recorded on the MVR, or resulting from a work
related incident, may result in revocation of the drivers' qualification and

1-11-4: Analysis
1-11-5: Appeals
1-11-6: Limitations
1-11-7: Legal Action
1-11-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to provide advisory guidelines for the city to
assist the city in identifying actions that involve the unconstitutional taking
or damaging of private real property without the payment of just compensation
as required by the constitution of the United States and of the state of Utah.
(Ord. 2003-1, 4-24-2003)
1-11-2: DEFINITIONS:
As used herein, "constitutional taking issues" means actions involving the
physical or regulatory taking of private real property by the city that might
require compensation to a private real property owner under:
   A.   The fifth or fourteenth amendment of the constitution of the United
States;
   B.   Article 1, section 22 of the Utah constitution; or
   C.   Any recent court rulings governing the physical or regulatory taking of
private real property by a governmental entity. (Ord. 2003-1, 4-24-2003)
1-11-3: GUIDELINES:
The following guidelines shall be considered by the city when taking any action
that might result in the physical or regulatory taking of private real
property. The city should review the following to determine and identify
whether a proposed governmental action raises constitutional taking issues. It
is the policy of the city that no individuals bear burdens which, in all
fairness and justice, should be borne by the community as a whole. A "yes"
answer to any of the following questions could raise the implication of a
taking or damaging of private property for which just compensation may be
required:
   A.   Does the action result in a permanent or inevitably recurring physical
occupation of private property?
   B.   Does the action require a property owner to dedicate property or grant
an easement to the city without the payment of just compensation?
   C.   Does the action create or otherwise impose a permanent or ongoing
nuisance, originating on city property, that impacts neighboring lands so that
their owners or occupants sustain a special and unreasonable interference with
the quiet enjoyment of their property?
   D.   Does the action interfere with a fundamental attribute of ownership
such as the right to reasonable access, the right to light, air and view within
the right of way of an abutting public street, or the right to exclude others
from private property?
   E.   Does the action unreasonably interfere with a separately protected and
vested right, such as the right to continue a nonconforming use; the right to
have an application reviewed under the law that was in effect when a complete
application was submitted; legally issued subdivision plat approvals, building
permits, or licenses; or other protected property interests?
   F.   Does the action impose a severe economic burden that is inappropriately
unfair when considered in light of: 1) the burden placed on the property owner,
2) the nature of the government action and benefit, and 3) the property owners'
investment backed expectations?
   G.   Does the action deprive the property owner of all economically viable
use of the property in a situation where the proposed use does not constitute a
nuisance or a severe threat to health and safety?
   H.   Does the action limit the use of private property without substantially
advancing a legitimate public interest?
   I.   Has the city failed to demonstrate, by an individualized determination,
that any conditions, dedications or exactions imposed as a condition of
approval of development applications place only fair and roughly proportionate
burdens on development, offsetting the burdens that the proposed development
places on public utilities, streets and other services but not imposing
additional burdens on development that the community as a whole should bear?
   J.   Does the action discriminate against property owners, imposing
restrictions or burdens on one property owner that other similarly situated
property owners do not bear? (Ord. 2003-1, 4-24-2003)
1-11-4: ANALYSIS:
If the city determines that a governmental action involves constitutional
taking issues, the proposed action should be reviewed by the city to analyze
the possible taking and to determine the action to be taken. In reviewing the
proposed action the following factors may be analyzed:
   A.   The effect the potential taking would have on the use or value of the
private property;
   B.   The likelihood that the action may result in a constitutional taking;
   C.   Any alternatives to the proposed action that would fulfill the city's
lawful objectives and reduce the risk of a constitutional taking;
   D.   The cost to the city for payment of compensation if a taking is
determined. (Ord. 2003-1, 4-24-2003)
1-11-5: APPEALS:
Any owner of private property whose interest in the property is subject to a
physical or regulatory taking by the city pursuant to a final and authoritative
decision or action of the city, may appeal the city's decision or action by
filing a written notice of appeal and statement of the grounds for the appeal
in the city recorder's office within thirty (30) days from the date of the
city's decision or action. The city council or its designee shall hear all
evidence regarding the appeal and render its decision and findings in writing
within fourteen (14) days from the date the appeal was filed. If the city fails
to hear and decide the appeal within fourteen (14) days, the city's decision or
action is presumed to be approved. (Ord. 2003-1, 4-24-2003)
1-11-6: LIMITATIONS:
The guidelines set forth herein are advisory only and shall not be construed to
expand, nor limit the scope of the city's liability for a constitutional
taking. The city shall have no legal liability to any person, firm or entity of
any nature whatsoever, and a court may not impose liability upon the city for
failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 2003-1, 4-24-2003)
1-11-7: LEGAL ACTION:
A property owner's failure to appeal the action of the city does not
constitute, and may not be interpreted as constituting, a failure to exhaust
available administrative remedies or as a bar to bringing legal action. (Ord.
2003-1, 4-24-2003)

promulgated by the city council. (1979 Code § 8-251; amd. 1998 Code)
   E.   Resale Restrictions:
      1.   From and after September 1, 1979, the lots sold by the city shall
not be further sold, transferred, conveyed or assigned to any person except the

reason, before new certificates are issued, the original certificate shall be
canceled or an assignment given and the record shall be so changed.
      3.   The certificates shall be issued and signed by the mayor and shall

replacement is directly caused by the City. (1979 Code § 8-262)
   B.   Contracting For Care:
      1.   No grave shall be hereafter opened in the cemetery of this City
until perpetual care upon the lot where the grave is to be opened shall have
been contracted for with the City, or perpetual care thereon paid. Should it be
the desire of any person to have a grave opened and the body interred therein
and perpetual care shall not have been previously contracted for or paid in
full for the lot therein, the person may either pay the full purchase price for
perpetual care or enter into a contract wherein payment shall be agreed.
      2.   The agreement shall provide for a down payment in the amount of
twenty percent (20%) of the total purchase price of the cost of the lot, and
shall further provide for the payment of monthly installments over a period not
to exceed twenty (20) months. The monthly installments shall be in the amounts
equal to the balance of the contract divided by the number of months which the
contract is to run, plus two (2) months extra payment to pay for the privilege
of making the payments in installments or six percent (6%) of the balance,
whichever is less.
      3.   The installment contract for perpetual care of, or purchase of a lot
with perpetual care, shall provide for collection by the City in event of a
default and such collection shall be by civil action, and the defendant therein
shall pay cost of collection, together with a reasonable attorney fees to the
City, and shall also pay interest at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum
upon the past due installments. All installments shall immediately become due
upon the default of any of the installments; provided however, that when
perpetual care for any lot in the City cemetery or portion thereof, has not
been paid for a period of ten (10) years, then, and in such an event, the
unused portion of the lot shall thereafter escheat to the City, and the title
thereof shall revert to the City, which shall thereafter have the right, option
and privilege to sell and dispose of unused cemetery property, as is in this
Chapter provided, upon condition that the City shall thereafter maintain
perpetually without cost of fee the portion of the lot occupied by a grave or
graves prior to the date when the remaining property escheated to the City.
(1979 Code § 8-261)
      4.   The City shall have the power to fix, by resolution, a fee from any
person now owning a cemetery lot or portion thereof for the annual maintenance
and care thereof. Until such time as the fee shall be fixed by resolution, said
person shall pay a fee equal to fifty dollars ($50.00) per lot and twenty five
dollars ($25.00) per one-half (1/2) lot per year for such care and maintenance.
The fee shall continue to be paid until such time as a further or additional
interment shall be made on the lot, at which time the provisions of this
subsection relating to perpetual care and maintenance and to payment of fees
and costs pertaining thereto shall take effect and apply. (1979 Code § 8-261;
amd. 1998 Code)
   C.   Fund Created; Use:

laws of the State and this Chapter. All funds received from the sale of
perpetual care services shall be placed in a special Perpetual Care Fund,
invested in compliance with the laws of the State and used for the purposes
herein provided.
      2.   The income from the Perpetual Care Fund shall be used to pay the
upkeep and development of the cemetery. The City may borrow from the Fund from
time to time, but any funds borrowed shall be repaid to the Fund with interest
thereon at the prevailing rate paid by the City to borrow funds from commercial
lenders.
      3.   If the City borrows from the Fund, it shall pay into a fund for the
operation of the cemeteries the interest accrued upon money annually. Should it
be found that the interest returned upon the perpetual care funds shall be more
than is required to pay for the operation and upkeep of the City cemetery, then
the surplus shall be added to the principal amount of the Perpetual Care Fund
herein created, and shall be so handled until changed by resolution to provide
for the use of such accumulated interest. (1979 Code § 8-271)
   D.   Duties Of Officials:
      1.   Treasurer: It shall be the duty of the City Treasurer to keep an
accurate record of the perpetual care trust fund account, including
investments, to see that the principal portion thereof is properly invested in
accordance with resolutions of the City Council and the laws of the State, and
to advise the Mayor when funds are available for investment in the amount of
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or more. The Mayor shall advise the City
Council of the availability of such funds. (1979 Code § 8-272)
      2.   City Council: It shall be the duty of the City Council, when funds
are available for investment, to direct by resolution all purchases of
securities for the Perpetual Care Fund or to name a suitable trustee for such
investment. (1979 Code § 8-273)
   E.   Investment Income: All income from investments held in the Perpetual
Care Fund shall be quarterly credited to the Cemetery Maintenance Fund for use
in providing the perpetual care as required herein. (1979 Code § 8-274)
7-5-9: NONPERPETUAL CARE LOTS:
   A.   Maintenance Charges:
      1.   Every lot for which perpetual care has not been purchased and with
reference to which the owner has established a right to directly provide for
maintenance and care, notwithstanding the provisions of Section
7-5-12 of this Chapter, shall be maintained and cared for to the extent and in
accordance with the standards established by the City Council for care and
maintenance of all lots of the cemetery. (1979 Code § 8-281)
      2.   In the event that the owner fails to provide the requisite care and
maintenance for nonperpetual care lots, the Maintenance Department shall
furnish care and maintenance at rates established by the City Council. (1979
Code § 8-281; amd. 1998 Code)
      3.   All such charges shall become a personal liability of the owner of
the lots and, in addition thereto, shall constitute a lien against the lots
upon the basis of which the City Council may cause the burial rights therein to
be forfeited and said rights to revert to the City. (1979 Code § 8-281)
   B.   Reversion Of Nonpaying Lots:
      1.   When any owner of any lot or portion of a lot in the cemetery shall
have failed to pay the cost of services rendered by the City or its employees
in watering, beautifying, maintaining or caring for any lots or portions
thereof in the City cemetery for which perpetual care has not been purchased in
accordance with the provisions of this Chapter, and such failure to pay has
continued for a period of six (6) months, the City may pursue collection of
such costs in a court of law. A court action may be pursued for the purpose of
seeking judgment against the owner and thereafter attaching any of the assets
of the owner, including an attachment of the lots or portions of lots upon
which the owner has failed to make payment for maintenance service.
      2.   As an additional remedy, or in lieu of seeking collection in a court
of law, the City may cancel the owner's certificate or deed representing rights
to burial on the unoccupied lots or portions of lots and causing ownership of
lots or portions thereof to revert back to the City by following the procedure
set forth in this Section. (1979 Code § 8-282)
   C.   Procedure For Reversion Back To City:
      1.   The City may terminate the owner's right to use of unoccupied lot or
lots in the City cemetery when there has been a six (6) month failure to pay
the costs of maintenance provided by the City in the following manner:
         a.   The City Council shall fix a time and place of hearing before the
City Council at which the owner shall be given the opportunity to present good
cause as to why his right to future use of the lot or lots involved shall not
be terminated and as to why the ownership of the lot or portions of lot shall
not revert back to the City for resale by it.
         b.   A notice of the time, place and purpose of the hearing to forfeit
the owner's interest in the lot or parts of the lot shall be given by personal
delivery of a written notice of the time, place and purpose of the meeting of
the City Council or by mailing a copy of the notice to the last known address
of the owner or owners.
         c.   In the absence of an ability to make personal delivery of the
written notice to the owner or owners, a notice of the hearing to forfeit
rights to said lot or portions of lot shall be published at least once in a
newspaper having general circulation in the County. The publication shall be
made at least three (3) weeks prior to the date of the hearing.
         d.   If the owner is known to be deceased, then mailing of notice or
delivery of notice shall be made to the last known addresses of any known
heirs.
         e.   Copies of the notice shall also be posted in a conspicuous place
in the offices of the City.
         f.   At the time and place set for the hearing before the City
Council, the City Council shall give the owner or owners an opportunity to be
heard, a right to present witnesses and to submit evidence showing cause why
the lot or portions of the lot shall not be forfeited to the City.
      2.   After due consideration of all the facts presented at such hearing,
the City Council may order, if it finds that there has been a failure to make
payment of such costs or if no satisfactory arrangement has been preferred for
making the immediate payment of such costs, that the lot or portions of lot
shall revert to the City for resale and that all of the rights and privileges
of the owner in the lot or lots are terminated.
      3.   Thereafter, the City may make sale of the lots in the same manner as
it makes sales of all other lots within the cemetery. (1979 Code § 8-283)

cemetery, and that the nearest relative or representative of such deceased
person desires to have the body of such deceased interred in the cemetery, the
Mayor may grant burial space for such deceased person at the request made to
him by the City Treasurer.

public service entities delivering utility and public services rendered for
profit, to the enhancement of the health, welfare and general economic well-
being of the City and its citizens; and

management to maximize the efficiency and to minimize the costs to the
taxpayers of the foregoing uses and to minimize the inconvenience to and
negative effects upon the public from such facilities' construction, placement,
relocation and maintenance in the rights of way.
   B.   Compensation: The City finds that the City should receive fair and
reasonable compensation for use of the rights of way.

in part an extension of interstate commerce, their operations also involve
rights of way, Municipal franchising and vital business and community service,
which are of local concern.

the best interests of its taxpayers and citizens to promote the rapid

public to franchise and to establish standards for franchising providers in a
manner that:
      1.   Fairly and reasonably compensates the City on a competitively
neutral and nondiscriminatory basis as provided herein;
      2.   Encourages competition by establishing terms and conditions under
which providers may use the rights of way to serve the public;

of the City infrastructure;

way; and

are created and that such franchising is accomplished in a manner that does not
prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting telecommunication services, within
the meaning of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 ("Act") (P.L. No. 104-104).

Chapter and a franchise entered pursuant to it, the provisions of this Chapter
in effect at the time the franchise is entered into shall control.
   B.   New Developments: It shall be the policy of the City to liberally amend
this Chapter, upon application of a provider, when necessary to enable the
provider to take advantage of any developments in the field of
telecommunications which will afford the provider an opportunity to more
effectively, efficiently or economically serve itself or the public. (Ord. 1-
27-98, 1-27-1998)

person designated to receive notices from the City. A provider shall
immediately notify the City of any change in its name, address or telephone
number. (Ord. 1-27-98, 1-27-1998; amd. 1998 Code)
   D.   Exercise Of Police Power: To the full extent permitted by applicable
law either now or in the future, the City reserves the right to adopt or issue
such rules, regulations, orders or other directives that it finds necessary or
appropriate in the lawful exercise of its police powers.
   E.   Construction:
      1.   Federal And State Statutes: This Chapter shall be construed in a
manner consistent with all applicable Federal and State statutes.
      2.   Applicability: This Chapter shall apply to all franchises granted or
renewed after the effective date hereof. This Chapter shall further apply, to
the extent permitted by applicable Federal or State law, to all existing
franchises granted prior to the effective date hereof and to a provider
providing services, without a franchise, prior to the effective date hereof.
      3.   Other Applicable Ordinances: A provider's rights are subject to the
police powers of the City to adopt and enforce ordinances necessary to the
health, safety and welfare of the public. A provider shall comply with all
applicable general laws and ordinances enacted by the City pursuant to its
police powers. In particular, all providers shall comply with the City zoning
and other land use requirements.
      4.   City Failure To Enforce: A provider shall not be relieved of its
obligation to comply with any of the provisions of this Chapter or any
franchise granted pursuant to this Chapter by reason of any failure of the City
to enforce prompt compliance.
      5.   Construed According To Utah Law: This Chapter and any franchise
granted pursuant to this Chapter shall be construed and enforced in accordance
with the substantive laws of the State. (Ord. 1-27-98, 1-27-1998)
7-6-4: APPLICABILITY; EXCEPTIONS:
   A.   Providers: This Chapter shall provide the basic local scheme for
providers of telecommunications services and systems that require the use of
the rights of way, including providers of both the system and service, those
providers of the system only and those providers who do not build the system
but who only provide services. This Chapter shall apply to all future providers
and to all providers in the City prior to the effective date hereof, whether
operating with or without a franchise as set forth in subsection 7-6-3E2 of
this Chapter.
   B.   Excluded Activities:
      1.   Cable Television Operators: This Chapter shall not apply to cable
television operators otherwise regulated by the Cable Television Ordinance.
      2.   Wireless Service Facilities: This Chapter shall not apply to
personal wireless service facilities.
   C.   Excluded Providers; Provisions Applicable: Providers excused by other
law that prohibits the City from requiring a franchise shall not be required to
obtain a franchise, but all of the requirements imposed by this Chapter through
the exercise of the City's police power and not preempted by other law shall be
applicable. (Ord. 1-27-98, 1-27-1998)
7-6-5: FRANCHISE REQUIRED:
   A.   Nonexclusive Franchise; Authority: The City is empowered and authorized
to issue nonexclusive franchises governing the installation, construction and
maintenance of systems in the City's rights of way, in accordance with the
provisions of this Chapter. The franchise is granted through a franchise
agreement entered into between the City and provider.
   B.   Provider Required To Obtain: Except to the extent preempted by Federal
or State law, as ultimately interpreted by a court of competent jurisdiction,
including any appeals, every provider must obtain a franchise prior to
constructing a telecommunications system or providing telecommunications
services using the rights of way, and every provider must obtain a franchise
before constructing an open video system or providing open video services via
an open video system. Any open video system or service shall be subject to the
customer service and consumer protection provisions applicable to the cable TV
companies to the extent the City is not preempted or permitted as ultimately
interpreted by a court of competent jurisdiction, including any appeals. The
fact that particular telecommunications systems may be used for multiple
purposes does not obviate the need to obtain a franchise for other purposes. By
way of illustration and not limitation, a cable operator of a cable system must
obtain a cable franchise, and, should it intend to provide telecommunications
services over the same system, must also obtain a telecommunications franchise.
   C.   Nature Of Grant: A franchise shall not convey title, equitable or
legal, in the rights of way. A franchise is only the right to occupy rights of
way on a nonexclusive basis for the limited purposes and for the limited period
stated in the franchise; the right may not be subdivided, assigned or
subleased. A franchise does not excuse a provider from obtaining appropriate
access or pole attachment agreements before collocating its system on the
property of others, including the City's property. This subsection shall not be
construed to prohibit a provider from leasing conduit to another provider, so
long as the lessee has obtained a franchise.
   D.   Current Providers; Time Limit To Request: Except to the extent exempted
by Federal or State law, any provider acting without a franchise on the
effective date hereof shall request issuance of a franchise from the City
within ninety (90) days of the effective date hereof. If such request is made,
the provider may continue providing service during the course of negotiations.
If a timely request is not made, or if negotiations cease and a franchise is
not granted, the provider shall comply with the provisions of subsection 7-6-
12D of this Chapter.
   E.   Nature Of Franchise: The franchise granted by the City under the
provisions of this Chapter shall be a nonexclusive franchise providing the
right and consent to install, repair, maintain, remove and replace its system
on, over and under the rights of way in order to provide services.
   F.   Regulatory Approval Needed: Before offering or providing any services
pursuant to the franchise, a provider shall obtain any and all regulatory
approvals, permits, authorizations or licenses for the offering or provision of
such services from the appropriate Federal, State and local authorities, if
required, and shall submit to the City, upon the written request of the City,
evidence of all such approvals, permits, authorizations or licenses.
   G.   Term: No franchise issued pursuant to this Chapter shall have a term of
less than five (5) years or greater than fifteen (15) years. Each franchise
shall be granted in a nondiscriminatory manner. (Ord. 1-27-98, 1-27-1998)
7-6-6: APPLICATION FOR FRANCHISE:
   A.   Required; Form: To obtain a franchise to construct, own, maintain or
provide services through any system within the City, to obtain a renewal of a
franchise granted pursuant to this Chapter or to obtain the City approval of a
transfer of a franchise, as provided in subsection 7-6-11A2 of this Chapter,
granted pursuant to this Chapter, an application must be filed with City on the
form attached to the Ordinance codified herein as Exhibit A, which is hereby
incorporated by reference. The application form may be changed by the Mayor so
long as such changes request information that is consistent with this Chapter.
Such application form, as amended, is incorporated by reference.
   B.   Criteria: In making a determination as to an application filed pursuant
to this Chapter, the City may, but shall not be limited to, request the
following from the provider:
      1.   A copy of the order from the PSC granting a certificate of
convenience and necessity.
      2.   Certification of the provider's financial ability to compensate the
City for provider's intrusion, maintenance and use of the rights of way during
the franchise term proposed by the provider.
      3.   Provider's agreement to comply with the requirements of Section
7-6-9 of this Chapter.
   C.   Determination By City: The City, in its discretion, shall determine the
award of any franchise on the basis of these and other considerations relevant
to the use of the rights of way, without competitive bidding. (Ord. 1-27-98, 1-
27-1998)
7-6-7: COMPENSATION, FEES AND PAYMENTS:
   A.   Compensation; Provider Obligations: As fair and reasonable compensation
for any franchise granted pursuant to this Chapter, a provider shall have the
following obligations:
      1.   Application Fee: In order to offset the cost to the City to review
an application for a franchise and in addition to all other fees, permits or
charges, a provider shall pay to the City, at the time of application, five
hundred dollars ($500.00) as a nonrefundable application fee.
      2.   Franchise Fee: The franchise fee, if any, shall be set forth in the
franchise agreement. The obligation to pay a franchise fee shall commence on
the completion date. The franchise fee is offset by any business license fee or
business license tax enacted by the City.
      3.   Excavation Permits: The provider shall also pay fees required for an
excavation permit as provided in Chapter 4 of this Title.
   B.   Due Monthly: Unless otherwise agreed to in the franchise agreement, all
franchise fees shall be paid on a monthly basis within forty five (45) days of
the close of each calendar month.
   C.   Statement Of Calculation; Certification: Unless a franchise agreement
provides otherwise, each fee payment shall be accompanied by a statement
showing the manner in which the fee was calculated and shall be certified as to
its accuracy.
   D.   Future Costs: A provider shall pay to the City or to third parties, at
the direction of the City, an amount equal to the reasonable costs and
reasonable expenses that the City incurs for the services of third parties
(including, but not limited to, attorneys and other consultants) in connection
with any renewal or provider-initiated renegotiation, or amendment of this
Chapter or a franchise; provided however, that the parties shall agree upon a
reasonable financial cap at the outset of negotiations. In the event the
parties are unable to agree, either party may submit the issue to binding
arbitration in accordance with the rules and procedures of the American
Arbitration Association.
   E.   Taxes, Assessments: To the extent taxes or other assessments are
imposed by taxing authorities, other than the City on the use of the City
property as a result of a provider's use or occupation of the rights of way,
the provider shall be responsible for payment of its pro rata share of such
taxes, payable annually unless otherwise required by the taxing authority. Such
payments shall be in addition to any other fees payable pursuant to this
Chapter.
   F.   Interest On Late Payments: In the event that any payment is not
actually received by the City on or before the applicable date fixed in the
franchise, interest thereon shall accrue from such date until received at the
rate charged for delinquent State taxes.
   G.   Acceptance Of Fee; Not Construed Satisfaction: No acceptance by the
City of any fee shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact
the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of such fee payment be construed
as a release of any claim the City may have for additional sums payable.
   H.   Additional Taxes Or Fees Still Applicable: The fee payment is not a
payment in lieu of any tax, fee or other assessment, except as specifically
provided in this Chapter or as required by applicable law. By way of example,
and not limitation, excavation permit fees and fees to obtain space on the
City- owned poles are not waived and remain applicable.
   I.   Operation After Term; Continuing Obligation And Holdover: In the event
a provider continues to operate all or any part of the system after the term of
the franchise, such operator shall continue to comply with all applicable
provisions of this Chapter and the franchise, including, without limitation,
all compensation and other payment provisions throughout the period of such
continued operation; provided, that any such continued operation shall in no
way be construed as a renewal or other extension of the franchise, nor as a
limitation on the remedies, if any, available to the City as a result of such
continued operation after the term, including, but not limited to, damages and
restitution.
   J.   Publication Costs: A provider shall assume any publication costs
associated with its franchise that may be required by law. (Ord. 1-27-98, 1-27-
1998)
7-6-8: INSURANCE, RECORD REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Insurance Required: Prior to the execution of a franchise, a provider
will deposit with the City an irrevocable, unconditional letter of credit or
surety bond as required by the terms of the franchise, and shall obtain and
provide proof of the insurance coverage required by the franchise. A provider
shall also indemnify the City as set forth in the franchise.
   B.   Inspection By City; Management: The City shall have the right to
oversee, regulate and inspect periodically the construction, maintenance and
upgrade of the system, and any part thereof, in accordance with the provisions
of the franchise and applicable law. A provider shall establish and maintain
managerial and operational records, standards, procedures and controls to
enable a provider to prove, in reasonable detail, to the satisfaction of the
City at all times throughout the term, that a provider is in compliance with
the franchise. A provider shall retain such records for not less than the
applicable statute of limitations.
   C.   Records Maintenance: A provider shall at all times maintain:
      1.   On file with the City, a full and complete set of plans, records and
as-built hard copy maps and, to the extent the maps are placed in an electronic
format, they shall be made in electronic format compatible with the City's
existing GIS system, of all existing and proposed installations and the types
of equipment and systems installed or constructed in the rights of way,
properly identified and described as to the types of equipment and facility by
appropriate symbols and marks, which shall include annotations of all rights of
ways where work will be undertaken. As used herein, as-built maps include file
construction prints. Maps shall be drawn to scale. As-built maps, including the
compatible electronic format, as provided above, shall be submitted within
thirty (30) days of completion of work or within thirty (30) days after
completion of modification and repairs. As-built maps are not required of the
provider who is the incumbent local exchange carrier for the existing system to
the extent they do not exist.
      2.   Throughout the term of the franchise, a provider shall maintain
complete and accurate books of account and records of the business, ownership
and operations of a provider with respect to the system in a manner that allows
the City at all times to determine whether a provider is in compliance with the
franchise. Should the City reasonably determine that the records are not being
maintained in such a manner, a provider shall alter the manner in which the
books and/or records are maintained so that a provider comes into compliance
with this Section. All financial books and records which are maintained in
accordance with the regulations of the FCC and any governmental entity that
regulates utilities in the State and generally accepted accounting principles
shall be deemed to be acceptable under this Section.
   D.   Confidentiality: If the information required to be submitted is
proprietary in nature or must be kept confidential by Federal, State or local
law, upon proper request by a provider, such information shall be classified as
a protected record within the meaning of the Utah Government Records Access and
Management Act (GRAMA), making it available only to those who must have access
to perform their duties on behalf of the City; provided, that a provider
notifies the City of, and clearly labels the information which a provider deems
to be confidential, proprietary information. Such notification and labeling
shall be the sole responsibility of the provider.
   E.   Provider's Expense: All reports and records required under this Chapter
shall be furnished at the sole expense of a provider, except as otherwise
provided in this Chapter or a franchise.
   F.   Right Of Inspection: For the purpose of verifying the correct amount of
the franchise fee, the books and records of the provider pertaining thereto
shall be open to inspection or audit by duly authorized representatives of the
City at all reasonable times, upon giving reasonable notice of the intention to
inspect or audit the books and records; provided, that the City shall not audit
the books and records of the provider more often than annually. The provider
agrees to reimburse the City the reasonable costs of an audit if the audit
discloses that the provider has paid ninety five percent (95%) or less of the
compensation due the City for the period of such audit. In the event the
accounting rendered to the City by the provider herein is found to be
incorrect, then payment shall be made on the corrected amount within thirty
(30) calendar days of written notice, it being agreed that the City may accept
any amount offered by the provider, but the acceptance thereof by the City
shall not be deemed a settlement of such item if the amount is in dispute or is
later found to be incorrect. (Ord. 1-27-98, 1-27-1998)
7-6-9: CONSTRUCTION, TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Compliance Required; Excavation Permit: No provider shall receive a
franchise unless it agrees to comply with each of the terms set forth in this

utilities. A provider shall obtain an excavation permit, pursuant to the
excavation ordinance, as provided in Chapter 4 of this Title, before commencing
any work in the rights of way. (Ord. 1-27-98, 1-27-1998; amd. 1998 Code)
   B.   Quality And Performance Of Work: All work involved in the construction,
maintenance, repair, upgrade and removal of the system shall be performed in a
safe, thorough and reliable manner, using materials of good and durable
quality. If, at any time, it is determined by the FCC or any other agency
granted authority by Federal law or the FCC to make such determination, that
any part of the system, including, without limitation, any means used to
distribute signals over or within the system, is harmful to the public health,
safety or welfare, or quality of service or reliability, then a provider shall,
at its own cost and expense, promptly correct all such conditions.
   C.   Licenses And Permits: A provider shall have the sole responsibility for
diligently obtaining, at its own cost and expense, all permits, licenses or
other forms of approval or authorization necessary to construct, maintain,
upgrade or repair the system, including, but not limited to, any necessary
approvals from persons and/or the City to use private property, easements,
poles and conduits. A provider shall obtain any required permit, license,
approval or authorization, including, but not limited to, excavation permits,
pole attachment agreements, etc., prior to the commencement of the activity for
which the permit, license, approval or authorization is required. (Ord. 1-27-
98, 1-27-1998)

Code)
      2.   Emergency; City Authority To Move System: The City may, at any time,
in case of fire, disaster or other emergency, as determined by the City in its
reasonable discretion, cut or move any parts of the system and appurtenances
on, over or under the rights of way of the City, in which event the City shall
not be liable therefor to a provider. The City shall notify a provider in
writing prior to, if practicable, but in any event as soon as possible and in
no case later than the next business day following any action taken under this
Section. Notice shall be given as provided in subsection 7-6-3C of this
Chapter.
      3.   Temporary Move For Third Party: A provider shall, upon prior
reasonable written notice by the City or any person holding a permit to move
any structure, and within the time that is reasonable under the circumstances,
temporarily move any part of its system to permit the moving of said structure.
A provider may impose a reasonable charge on any person other than the City for
any such movement of its systems. (Ord. 1-27-98, 1-27-1998)
      4.   Change In Rights Of Way; Obligation To Move System: When the City is
changing a right of way and makes a written request, a provider is required to
move or remove its system from the right of way, without cost to the City, to
the extent provided in the excavation ordinance, as provided in Chapter 4 of
this Title. This obligation does not apply to systems originally located on
private property pursuant to a private easement, which property was later
incorporated into the rights of way, if that private easement grants a superior
vested right. This obligation exists whether or not the provider has obtained
an excavation permit. (Ord. 1-27-98, 1-27-1998; amd. 1998 Code)
   E.   Protection Of Structures, Landmarks: In connection with the
construction, maintenance, repair, upgrade or removal of the system, a provider
shall, at its own cost and expense, protect any and all existing structures
belonging to the City and all designated landmarks, as well as all other
structures within any designated landmark district. A provider shall obtain the
prior written consent of the City to alter any water main, power facility,
sewerage or drainage system, or any other City structure on, over or under the
rights of way of the City required because of the presence of the system. Any
such alteration shall be made by the City or its designee on a reimbursable
basis. A provider agrees that it shall be liable for the costs incurred by the
City to replace or repair and restore to its prior condition in a manner as may
be reasonably specified by the City, any City structure or any other rights of
way of the City involved in the construction, maintenance, repair, upgrade or
removal of the system that may become disturbed or damaged as a result of any
work thereon by or on behalf of a provider pursuant to the franchise.
   F.   Obstructions Prohibited: In connection with the construction,
maintenance, upgrade, repair or removal of the system, a provider shall not
unreasonably obstruct the rights of way of fixed guideway systems, railways,
passenger travel or other traffic to, from or within the City without the prior
consent of the appropriate authorities.
   G.   Safety Precautions: A provider shall, at its own cost and expense,
undertake all necessary and appropriate efforts to prevent accidents at its
work sites, including the placing and maintenance of proper guards, fences,
barricades, security personnel and suitable and sufficient lighting, and such
other requirements prescribed by OSHA and Utah OSHA. A provider shall comply
with all applicable Federal, State and local requirements, including, but not
limited to, the National Electric Safety Code.
   H.   Repair Of Rights Of Way: After written reasonable notice to the
provider, unless, in the sole determination of the City, an eminent danger
exists, any rights of way within the City which are disturbed or damaged during
the construction, maintenance or reconstruction by a provider of its system may
be repaired by the City at the provider's expense, to a condition as good as
that prevailing before such work was commenced. Upon doing so, the City shall
submit to such a provider an itemized statement of the cost for repairing and
restoring the rights of ways intruded upon. The provider shall, within thirty
(30) days after receipt of the statement, pay to the City the entire amount
thereof.

Chapter or the franchise agreement, it may require an application for the
transfer. The application shall comply with Section
7-6-6 of this Chapter.
      3.   PSC Approval No Longer Required: If the PSC no longer exists or if
its regulations or State law no longer require approval of transactions

exchange carrier, shall be deemed to have abandoned such system.
      2.   Removal Of Abandoned System: The City, upon such terms as it may
impose, may give a provider written permission to abandon, without removing,
any system, or portion thereof, directly constructed, operated or maintained
under a franchise. Unless such permission is granted or unless otherwise
provided in this Chapter, a provider shall remove within a reasonable time the
abandoned system and shall restore, using prudent construction standards, any
affected rights of way to their former state at the time such system was
installed, so as not to impair their usefulness. In removing its plant,
structures and equipment, a provider shall refill, at its own expense, any
excavation necessarily made by it and shall leave all rights of way in as good
condition as that prevailing prior to such removal without materially
interfering with any electrical or telephone cable or other utility wires,
poles or attachments. The City shall have the right to inspect and approve the
condition of the rights of way cables, wires, attachments and poles prior to
and after removal. The liability, indemnity and insurance provisions of this
Chapter and any security fund provided in a franchise shall continue in full
force and effect during the period of removal and until full compliance by a
provider with the terms and conditions of this Section.
      3.   Transfer Of Abandoned System To City: Upon abandonment of any system
in place, a provider, if required by the City, shall submit to the City a
written instrument, satisfactory in form to the City, transferring to the City
the ownership of the abandoned system.
      4.   Removal Of Aboveground System: At the expiration of the term for
which a franchise is granted, or upon its revocation or earlier expiration, as
provided for by this Chapter, in any such case without renewal, extension or
transfer, the City shall have the right to require a provider to remove, at its
expense, all aboveground portions of a system from the rights of way within a
reasonable period of time, which shall not be less than one hundred eighty
(180) days. If the provider is the incumbent local exchange carrier, it shall
not be required to remove its system, but shall negotiate a renewal in good
faith.
      5.   Leaving Underground System: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Chapter, a provider may abandon any underground system in
place so long as it does not materially interfere with the use of the rights of
way or with the use thereof by any public utility, cable operator or other
person. (Ord. 1-27-98, 1-27-1998)
7-6-13: SEVERABILITY:
If any provision of this Chapter is held by any Federal, State or local court
of competent jurisdiction to be invalid as conflicting with any Federal or
State statute, or is ordered by a court to be modified in any way in order to
conform to the requirements of any such law and all appellate remedies with
regard to the validity of the Ordinance provisions in question are exhausted,
such provision shall be considered a separate, distinct and independent part of
this Chapter, and such holding shall not affect the validity and enforceability
of all other provisions hereof. In the event that such law is subsequently
repealed, rescinded, amended or otherwise changed, so that the provision which
had been held invalid or modified is no longer in conflict with such law, the
provision in question shall return to full force and effect and shall again be
binding on the City and the provider; provided, that the City shall give the
provider thirty (30) days', or a longer period of time as may be reasonably
required for a provider to comply with such a rejuvenated provision, written
notice of the change before requiring compliance with such provision. (Ord. 1-

service established or that may hereafter be established. (1979 Code § 14-117)
   B.   Special Rates: The city council may from time to time fix by agreement
or resolution special rates and conditions for users using exceptionally large
amounts of water service or making use of the water system under exceptional
circumstances, upon such terms and conditions as they may deem proper. (1979
Code § 14-118)
   C.   Complaints; Corrections: The city council is hereby constituted a board
of equalization of water rates to hear complaints and make corrections of any
assessments deemed to be illegal, unequal or unjust. They may, if they see fit,
rebate all or any part of the water bill of any indigent person. Persons
seeking an adjustment on a utility bill will be required to appear in person
before the board of equalization to explain the nature of their request. (1979
Code § 14-119; amd. Res. 2003-1, 2-13-2003)
The city treasurer will submit a report to the board of equalization which will
include the following account information: the average usage, the current
usage, and the cost of the services to the city. The board will then make their
decision using the following criteria:
      1.   The amount of time lapsed before the leak was determined.

discretion, order a test of the meter measuring the water delivered to such
customer. If such request is made within twelve (12) months after the date of
the last previous test, the customer may be required to pay the cost of such
test. If the meter is found in such test to record from ninety seven percent

8-6-1: PURPOSE:
   A.   The Division of Water Resources has been charged with the
administration of the Utah Water Conservation Plan Act;
   B.   The Utah Water Conservation Plan Act (73-10-32, UCA) requires water
conservancy districts and public water systems with more than five hundred
(500) connections to submit Water Conservation Plans every five (5) years;
   C.   The Governor of Utah has announced a conservation goal to reduce two
thousand (2,000) base per capita use by at least twenty-five percent (25%) by
the year 2025;
   D.   Ferron City operates a culinary and secondary water system;
   E.   Ferron City Officials are concerned about water conservation and the
pressing need to use water in an efficient manner, allowing for future
sustained growth of the city;
   F.   The Ferron City Water Conservation Plan identifies ways to reduce the
consumption of water;
   G.   The attached Ferron City Water Conservation Plan is adopted to meet the
requirements of the Utah Water Conservation Plan Act (73-10-32, UCA). The plan
will be amended no less than every five (5) years and will play a vital role in
the future development of Ferron, Utah. (Res. 2013-9, 12-12-2013)
8-6-2: WATER CONSERVATION PLAN ACT:
Due to the continued growth in Utah, many citizens and leaders are becoming
increasingly aware and concerned for the future cost and availability of water.
The state legislature has also voiced concern and addressed this issue in the
Water Conservation Plan Act ( House Bill 418), which passed in the 1998
session, and its revision (House Bill 153), passed in the 1999 session, and
further amendments in the 2004 session (House Bill 71). The Act has been
codified in the Utah State Code, Section 73-10-32. The Ferron City Water
Conservation Plan has been written to address the concerns of both leaders and
citizens in the City of Ferron. (Res. 2013-9, 12-12-2013)
8-6-3: DESCRIPTION:
Ferron is a small rural community located in western Emery County situated
between Ferron Mountain in the Manti Lasal Range to the west and the San Rafael
Swell to the east. Throughout Ferron's history, farming and raising livestock
has been a main part of the culture. With the construction of the Hunter Power
Plant in the 1970's Ferron's economic growth became tied to the coal and power
industries. Ferron's population in 2000 was 1623 residents. Ferron has a
current population of 1626 residents (2010 census). The Ferron City General
Plan, written in 2007 projected a nineteen percent (19%) increase in population
over the next twenty (20) years. This projection, due to minimal growth in
industry, suggests that the demand for water should stay within the capacity
that is currently used to take care of the needs of the city.
Ferron City leaders are committed to maintaining the rural feel and open space
setting that is Ferron. Ferron has worked in cooperation with the Ferron Canal
and Reservoir Company to assist water delivery to the farmers located both
within and outside of city limits via water stock lines.
In keeping the rural feel of the city, the largest zone within the city is the
R-1-10,000 Zone. This zone contains many residential lots that exceed the
requirements. It also contains churches, schools and small farm pastures that
are typically large water users. Much of the farm ground in this zone is
watered under a special agreement that was made with the Ferron Canal and
Reservoir Company, so that farmers can utilize the secondary water system to
deliver individual shares of water. This reduces the amount of secondary water
needed by the city to water large areas of ground. Although the industrial zone
is also a large percentage of the city, there are currently no businesses in
the industrial zone that are large consumers of water.

(Res. 2013-9, 12-12-2013)
8-6-4: WATER SUPPLY:
Millsite Reservoir, completed in the early 1970's supplies both the culinary
and secondary water for the city. Water in the Reservoir is managed by the
Ferron Canal and Reservoir Company. Ferron City owns 1660 shares of water stock
which during normal years is calculated at 0.75 acre foot per share and
averages one thousand two hundred and forty-five (1,245) acre feet of water.
These shares are used to supply the water for both the culinary and secondary
systems. Castle Valley Special Service District maintains the water treatment
plant and delivers the water to the residents of Ferron. In 2005, Ferron
entered into a contract with the Ferron Canal and Reservoir Company to purchase
up to three hundred (300) acre feet of water each year for the city's culinary
needs. This agreement allows the shares owned by the city to be dedicated for
secondary use. There are approximately seven hundred and ten (710) culinary
connections in Ferron with an average three hundred and thirteen (313) GPCD.
This average is slightly higher than the state average of two hundred and sixty
(260) GPCD due to the large amount of culinary water that is used to water the
city owned Millsite Golf Course when the secondary water is not available.
Ferron City has approximately five hundred and forty (540) secondary
connections through which untreated water is delivered to users by the Castle
Valley Special Service District. The secondary water is available from mid
April through the first of October during normal water years. Secondary water
usage is monitored through the summer months and restrictions are set in place
during drought years as needed.
Historically, Ferron City has required developers to turn in one share of water
stock per culinary connection and one (1) share per acre of land for secondary
connections. In 2006 Due to the hardship of obtaining water stock, Ferron's
leaders felt that the requirement of turning in water stock for connections was
limiting the growth of the city. Thus, they passed regulations that allowed
developers to pay a fee in lieu, equivalent to the price of water stock, to the
city in order to obtain water connections. This was continued for a period of
five (5) years during which time nineteen (19) new homes were constructed. In
2011, fearing that the practice may someday prove detrimental to the city
supply of water, and due to the fact that the city could no longer purchase
water shares with the funds received from the fees, the ordinance was repealed.
(Res. 2013-9, 12-12-2013)
8-6-5: CURRENT WATER USE:

IMAGES/0-0-0-1283.png]
 
As illustrated in the cart above, secondary water usage varies from year to
year based on the amount of water available for use. In 2003 and 2004 the area
experienced a drought. Water use was restricted and strict penalties were put
in place. During the drought citizens were provided with education
opportunities to learn appropriate ways to conserve water. From 2007 through
2011 the water supply was abundant. During the spring of 2011 the city
experienced flooding due to the high runoff and citizens were encouraged to use
all the water that they needed. It may be noted that with the exception of
drought years, the spillway at the reservoir overflows and "free water" is
given. Water used during the runoff from the spillway is not counted against
the water allotted for use and the count is started over, thus the final data
shows that the water used is over the amount allotted for the year. (Res. 2013-

(Res. 2013-9, 12-12-2013)
8-6-7: WATER CONSERVATION CHALLENGES AND CONCERNS:
   A.   Ferron City has determined that some of the main challenges and
concerns to water conservation are the following;
      1.   Many Citizens lack basic knowledge and understanding of how much
water is needed to maintain healthy landscaping and how to consistently
conserve the use of indoor water. Current practices seem to be based on
convenience rather than actual plant need and supply considerations.
      2.   Drought tolerant plants and landscaping are not promoted locally and
at times it is difficult to purchase drought tolerant plants and trees in local
nurseries.
      3.   Many homeowners have large areas of grass and other water intensive
landscaping.
      4.   Ferron City Ordinance
10-4-18  requires front and side yards to be landscaped however; there is no
reference to drought tolerant plants or water wise landscaping in the
ordinance.
      5.   The current water pricing and billing system, while adequate to
cover the expenses in the water fund, lacks incentives for citizens and
businesses to use water in a more conscious and efficient manner.
      6.   Secondary water is not metered, thus it is difficult to determine if
water is wasted.
      7.   Water that spills from the Millsite Reservoir is channeled
downstream and unavailable for use in the city secondary system.
      8.   Storage capacity in the Millsite Reservoir has declined due to the
increase in sediment entering the reservoir.
   B.   Each challenge recognized gives the city an opportunity to improve. The
first four (4) challenges can be addressed through well thought out
conservation education opportunities. Local religious groups, schools and city
publications can be used as a means to distribute education materials.
   C.   Revising current ordinances to promote water conservation landscaping
and xeriscaping is a good way to allow citizens to become familiar with native
drought tolerant plants. Samples of drought tolerant landscaping and
xeriscaping can be obtained and on file at the city office and made available
for new development. Furthermore, the example of the city use of drought
tolerant landscaping around city buildings and in city parks will promote the
cause and assist in acquainting citizens with water conservation measures and
practices. Challenges five through seven allow the city to partner with other
entities to develop additional conservation measures. Although it is difficult
at best to accurately determine the amount of water wasted through the
secondary system, the city may benefit from working with the Ferron Canal and
Reservoir Company to assess programs and methods that will provide more water
storage for use in drought years. Ferron City leaders have established working
relationships with members of the Ferron Canal and Reservoir Company Board and
are continually looking for ways to partner resources with the company to
address these issues which will include dredging of the reservoir when
conditions permit. (Res. 2013-9, 12-12-2013)
8-6-8: CURRENT CONSERVATION MEASURES AND PROGRAMS:
Ferron City currently implements the following water conservation measures and
procedures:
   A.   Secondary water system. Secondary water (pressurized irrigation water)
is supplied to residents of Ferron City from April to October, for outside
watering of lawns and gardens. The use of secondary water conserves on culinary
water but is not to be perceived as an opportunity of unrestrained use of
water.
   B.   Public Awareness. Ferron City provides water conservation tips and
updates on the secondary water usage in the newsletter that is delivered to
each resident on a monthly basis. During short water years additional
information has been posted weekly at the City Hall and Post Office.
   C.   Water System Maintenance. Ferron City recently installed a culinary
meter system that allows the city to read meters each month of the year. This
system has the ability to detect and log areas that appear to have leaks. This
information is provided immediately to users so that leaks can be fixed in a
timely manner.
   D.   Waste Prohibiting Ordinance. Ferron City Ordinance
8-1-16  prohibits wasting water and discourages practices that allow water to
be wasted such as watering with an open hose, washing vehicles and allowing
sprinklers to spray so that water is running down the curb. Furthermore, the
city ordinance supports the states suggested regulations of no watering between
the hours of ten o’clock (10:00) a.m. and six o’clock (6:00) p.m. (Res. 2013-9,
12-12-2013)
8-6-9: WATER CONSERVATION GOALS:
In pursuit of solutions to the problems previously identified and in order to
objectively evaluate the City's progress in promoting water conservation, the
following goals have been identified:
   A.   Reduce the city per capita indoor water use by two percent (2%)
annually for the next five (5) years.
   B.   Use drought tolerant landscaping in city parks and around city
buildings.
   C.   Encourage drought tolerant landscaping in residential areas by
reviewing current ordinances and making revisions to promote water
conservation.
   D.   Educate citizens on indoor and outdoor water conservation by providing
continued information in city newsletters and on the city website.
   E.   Investigate and consider adopting an inclining block rate, encouraging
citizens to conserve through increased rates for water used in excess of a
reasonable amount.
   F.   Partner with local agencies, the Ferron Canal and Reservoir Company,
the BLM, and the Castle Valley Special Service District to initiate the removal
of sediment from the Reservoir, replace infrastructure and to develop new
infrastructure in increasing water storage. (Res. 2013-9, 12-12-2013)
8-6-10: ADDITIONAL CONSERVATION MEASURES:
   A.   Ferron City wishes to continue certain water conservation measures as
part of this Water Conservation Plan. In order for the city to accomplish the
goals listed specific measures must be taken. Compliance with emergency
measures would be mandatory when deemed appropriate and could be enforced by
the assessment of fines and restriction of water use. Compliance with non-
emergency measures would not be mandatory but could be influenced by billing
rate adjustments, education, awareness and community involvement. Water
Conservation measures are summarized below.
   B.   Emergency Measures:
      1.   Water city properties on a minimal schedule of every two (2) or
three (3) days, one property at a time.
      2.   Eliminate watering of city property in cases of severe shortages or
drought.
      3.   Reduce the number of flower pots and planters on city properties in
cases of shortages and drought.
      4.   Hold educational public meetings on water supply and conservation
measures.
      5.   Strictly enforce water schedule and if necessary, reduce schedule to
meet the supply.
      6.   Strictly enforce the imposition of fines and loss of secondary water
services for non compliance with adopted schedules.
   C.   Non Emergency Measures:
      1.   Sweep sidewalks and driveways instead of using hoses to clean them
off.
      2.   Wash vehicles with a bucket of soapy (biodegradable) water and rinse
while parked on or near landscaped area so that all water running off goes to
beneficial use instead of running down the gutter. Use twist style nozzle at
the end of the hose so that water is not allowed to run when not being used.
      3.   Check for and repair all leaks in pipes, hoses, faucets, couplings,
valves, etc. Verify there are no leaks by turning everything off and checking
your water meter to see if it is still turning. (Some underground leaks may not
be visible due to draining off into storm drains, ditches, or travel outside
your property).
      4.   Do not water on hot, sunny or windy days. You may actually end up
doing more harm than good to your landscape as well as waste a significant
amount of water.
      5.   Use mulch around trees and scrubs, as well as in your yard to retain
as much moisture as possible. Areas with drip systems will use much less water,
particularly during hot dry and windy conditions.
      6.   Keep your lawn well-trimmed and all other landscaped areas free of
weeds to reduce overall water needs of your yard.
   D.   Indoor Use:
      1.   Do not use toilets as a waste basket. Put all tissues, wrappers,
diapers, cigarette butts, etc. in the trash can.
      2.   Check toilet for leaks. Is the water level too high? Put a few drops
of food coloring in the tank. If the bowl becomes colored without flushing,
there is a leak. For those who do not have a low volume toilet, put a plastic
bottle full of sand and water in the tank to reduce the amount of water used
per flush, being careful to not reduce the amount of water so that it takes two
flushes to make the toilet work. Be sure that containers do not interfere with
the flushing mechanisms.
      3.   Take short showers with the water turned up only as much as it is
necessary. Turn the shower off while soaping up or shampooing. Install low flow
shower heads and/or other flow restriction devices.
      4.   Do not let the water run when you are brushing your teeth or
shaving. Fill the sink or a glass instead.
      5.   Wash only full loads of laundry or adjust the water level
appropriately for the amount of clothes you are washing. Most machines will use
forty (40) gallons or more of water for each load whether it is two socks or a
full weeks worth of clothes.
      6.   Repair any leaks within the house. Even a small slow drip can waste
up to fifteen (15) or twenty (20) gallons per day.
      7.   Know where your main shut off valve is located and that it works.
Shutting the water off yourself when a pipe leaks or breaks will not only save
water but will eliminate or minimize damage to your property.
      8.   Keep a jar or jug of water in the refrigerator for a cold drink
instead of running water from the tap until it is cold. You can put several
glasses of water down the drain for one drink of water.
      9.   Stop the sink when rinsing vegetables, dishes or anything else; use
only a sink full of water instead of continually running water down the drain.
      10.   Wash only full loads of dishes in the dishwasher. Let pans soak
rather than running the water over them while you are scrubbing them clean.
(Res. 2013-9, 12-12-2013)

clearance applications prior to submission to the building inspector. He shall
enforce all of the provisions of this title, entering actions in the courts,
when necessary and upon approval from the city council; and his failure to do
so shall not legalize any act in violation of such provisions.

Board and shall be a public record. Robert's Rules of Order shall be followed
in the conduct of meetings wherever applicable.
   C.   Powers And Duties: The Board of Adjustment shall have judicial power to
interpret the provisions of this Title. It shall also have administrative
duties to grant variances and special exceptions or conditional use permits, as
follows:
      1.   Interpret Ordinance And Map:
         a.   Intent: It is the intent of this provision to provide a way
whereby applicants who think that the Zoning Administrator is in error or does
not interpret the provision of the Zoning Title correctly, to obtain a relief
from such error in an expeditious and inexpensive manner without having to
resort to the courts.
         b.   Duty To Interpret: The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide
appeals where it is alleged by the appellant that there is error in any order,
requirement, decision or refusal made in the enforcement of this Title. The
Board of Adjustment shall also interpret the Zone Map and boundaries thereof in
cases of dispute or disagreement.
      2.   Grant Variances: The Board of Adjustment may authorize upon appeal,
variances from the terms of this Title pertaining to area and width of lot,
size of yards and height and size of buildings, where owing to special
conditions peculiar to the property, a literal enforcement of the provisions of
this Title would result in a hardship which is unnecessary in carrying out the
intent of this Title. Before any variance may be granted, however, it must be
shown that:
         a.   The variance will not substantially affect the Comprehensive Plan
of zoning and that adherence to the strict letter of this Title will cause
difficulties and hardships upon the petitioners, which are unnecessary in order
to carry out the purposes of this Title.
         b.   Special circumstances attach to the property covered by the
application that do not apply to other property in the same zone.
         c.   That because of said special circumstances, property covered by
the application is deprived of privileges possessed by other properties in the
same zone; and that the granting of the variance is essential to the enjoyment
of a substantial property right possessed by other property in the same zone.
         d.   That the difficulties and hardships were not created by any act
of the appellant subsequent to the effective date of the regulation appealed
from.
      3.   Grant Certain Special Exceptions Or Conditional Uses:
         a.   Intent: There are certain uses which are not permitted within
particular zones unless they are made to comply with conditions which are
compatible with other uses in the same zone. It is the intent of this provision
to authorize the Board of Adjustment to use its discretion in prescribing these
conditions. However, the Board of Adjustment may not authorize a conditional
use unless such use is specifically permitted by the terms of this Title.
         b.   Duty To Prescribe Conditions: The Board of Adjustment shall hear
and decide requests for "special exceptions", but only when authorized by the
terms of this Title to do so. In deciding whether or not to grant a special
exception, the Board shall be guided by the conditions set forth in this Title
with respect thereto, which conditions shall be deemed to be the minimum
standards which must be complied with.
      4.   Attach Reasonable Conditions: The Board of Adjustment may attach
reasonable conditions or requirements to the grant of a variance, special
exception or conditional use which the petitioner must comply with as a
condition of the grant or approval. A time limit of one year shall be attached
to the exercise or nonexercise of any grant unless specifically extended by
action of the Board. (Ord. 4-8-86, 4-8-1986)
      5.   Reverse Or Affirm Zoning Administrator: In performing the duties and
powers as set forth herein, the Board of Adjustment is hereby empowered to
reverse or affirm wholly or partly or modify the order, requirement, decision
or determination of the Zoning Administrator and may make such order or
requirement as ought to be made; provided however, that in interpreting and
applying the provisions of this Title, the requirements contained herein shall
be deemed to be the minimum requirements for the purpose set forth. (Ord. 4-8-
86, 4-8-1986; amd. 1998 Code)
   D.   Authority Limited: The powers and duties of the Board of Adjustment are
limited to judicial and administrative matters as set forth in this Title. The
Board of Adjustment shall not have the authority to amend this Title, nor to
correct what it may consider to be an unwise requirement. Nevertheless, the
Board of Adjustment shall have powers and duties as set forth in this Title and
within the limitations and intent of the provisions of this Title, shall
perform its duties and shall have the power to perform those acts as herein set
forth.
   E.   Vote: The concurring vote of three (3) members of the Board shall be
necessary to decide upon any matter upon which it is required to pass. (Ord. 4-
8-86, 4-8-1986)
   F.   Appearances Before Board:
      1.   Application; Fee: Any citizen or person, or any officer of a City
department may appeal to the Board of Adjustment by filing a request in writing
with the Zoning Administrator and by paying a fee of twenty five dollars
($25.00), provided such appeal is made within thirty (30) days from the grant
or refusal of a building permit by the Zoning Administrator. The request to
appear before the Board of Adjustment shall be made on forms furnished by the
Zoning Administrator. (Ord. 4-8-86, 4-8-1986; amd. 1998 Code)
      2.   Procedure: Upon receipt of the application, the Zoning Administrator
shall forthwith transmit to the Board of Adjustment all papers constituting the
record upon which the action appealed from was taken. The Board of Adjustment
shall review the application and shall return the same to the Zoning
Administrator with its decision pertaining thereto within thirty (30) days.
Failure to return said application within thirty (30) days shall constitute
approval. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed
from unless the Zoning Administrator certifies to the Board of Adjustment after
the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him that by reason of facts
stated in the certificate, a stay would in his opinion cause imminent peril to
life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than
by restraining order which may be granted by the Board of Adjustment or by the
District Court on application and notice to the Zoning Administrator and on due
cause shown.
      3.   Hearing: The Board of Adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for the
hearing of the appeal, give public notice thereof by posting in three (3)
public places and by mail to adjacent property owners, and decide the same
within a reasonable time. Any party may appear at the hearing, in person or by
agent or by attorney.
      4.   Action Of The Board: The Board of Adjustment shall make
determinations in harmony with the provisions of this Title and shall notify
the Zoning Administrator of the action taken.
      5.   Recourse From Decision: Any person aggrieved by any decision of the
Board of Adjustment may have and maintain a plenary action for relief therefrom
in any court of competent jurisdiction; provided, that petition for such relief
is presented to the court within thirty (30) days after the filing of such
decision to the office of the Board of Adjustment. (Ord. 4-8-86, 4-8-1986)

subdivision plat or on an existing publicly- dedicated street. Double frontage
lots shall be prohibited, except where unusual conditions make other designs
undesirable.
   I.   Side Line Angles: Side lines of lots shall be approximately at right
angles, or radial to the street lines. (Ord. 8-28-98, 8-28-1998)
11-4-3: STREETS AND STREET IMPROVEMENTS:
   A.   Arrangement: The arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall make
provision for the continuation of existing streets in adjoining areas and shall
provide access to unsubdivided adjoining areas insofar as such continuation or
access shall be deemed necessary by the City.
   B.   Connection: New streets must connect with existing public streets.
   C.   Width; Costs:
      1.   The total street right of way shall be standard at eighty feet (80')
for major streets; sixty feet (60') for collector streets; and fifty feet (50')
for feeder streets. All reference to the "total width" of a street, road, right
of way or easement shall refer to the "total width" stated in the property
title or right-of-way rights transferred or dedicated to the City. The paved or
traveled portion of the street or road may be less than the "total right of
way" to allow for public improvements in accordance with City ordinances.
      2.   Costs of new roads and repairs to existing roads caused by
development for collector (60') and feeder (50') streets shall be borne by the
subdivider. Where a major (80') street is required, the cost of paved section
over and above that required to the collector (60') street may be shared by the
City. The City's participation shall be determined by cost estimates reviewed
by the City Engineer and approved by the City Council. The approved estimates
shall be part of the development agreement attached to the final plat.
   D.   Surfacing: Asphalt surfacing shall be provided on all roads with a two
and one-half inch (21/2") minimum asphalt pavement thickness. All asphalt
paving shall be installed over a minimum of a four inch (4") granular base over

on sustained grades, unless otherwise approved by City. Grades of roads shall
be a minimum of one-half of one percent (0.5%).
      2.   Streets shall be leveled to a grade of less than four percent (4%)
for a distance of at least one hundred feet (100') approaching all
intersections; and at the intersection a grade of three percent (3%) shall be
maximum, unless otherwise approved by the City Engineer.
      3.   All changes in street grade shall be connected by vertical curves of
a minimum length equivalent to fifteen (15) times the algebraic difference in
the rate of grade for major streets and secondary streets and one-half (1/2) of
this minimum for all local streets.
   F.   Curvature On Center Line: Minimum radii of curvature on center line
shall be as follows: major streets, five hundred feet (500'); collector
streets, three hundred feet (300'); and feeder streets, one hundred feet
(100'); unless otherwise approved by the City.
   G.   Half-Streets: Wherever there exists a dedicated or platted half-street
or alley adjacent to the tract to be subdivided, the other half shall be
platted; however, in most other cases, half-streets shall be prohibited. When a
half-street is approved, it will require sufficient right of way to provide
pavement.
   H.   Intersection Angles; Curb Radii: The Planning Commission will consult
on each proposed development with the City Engineer to determine proper
intersection angles and curb radii, taking into consideration such items as the
topography of the land, the location of planned and existing City streets and
public safety. In general, streets should intersect at right angles, feeder
streets should approach the major or collector street at an angle of not less
than eighty degrees (80°), and all curb corners should have radius of not less
than twenty five feet (25'). Where streets meet at acute angles, the radii

should be held to a minimum in the planning of subdivisions. Cul-de-sacs must
be terminated by a turnaround right of way not less than one hundred twenty
feet (120') in diameter as measured to the property lines. Surface water
drainage, where possible, shall flow away from the turnaround of the cul-de-
sac. Where drainage is not possible because of physical topography,
alternatives will be reviewed by the planning commission in consultation with
the city engineer and a recommendation will be made to the city council for a
final decision.
   J.   Curbs And Gutters:
      1.   All streets within the subdivision shall be improved with pavement.
The pavement must be bounded by concrete curbs of the standard high back, roll
type, flat type unit, or by a properly prepared shoulder based on the
recommendations of the planning commission in consultation with the city
engineer and city staff to the city council for final approval. Street
classifications and roadway widths shall be recommended by the planning
commission in accordance with the master plan to the city council for final
approval.
      2.   Minimum grades for curb and gutters and streets shall not be less
than one-half of one percent (0.5%), and from crown of the road to the lip of
the curb shall be a minimum of two percent (2%).

four feet six inches (4'6") wide minimum and four inches (4") thick minimum.
All sidewalks that cross driveways shall be six inches (6") thick minimum.
Sidewalks at all intersections of public streets shall conform to adopted
American disabilities act standards. Based on topography, terrain, public
safety and other existing conditions, at the request of the subdivider, and in
consultation with the city engineer and city staff, the planning commission
will recommend placement of sidewalks to the city council for final approval.
   L.   Existing And Proposed Streets: The subdivider shall improve existing
and proposed streets in all subdivisions, except on the rear of lots that back
on streets where access is not permitted. Timetable of completion and the
security performance of all improvements will be listed in the development
agreement.

(6"), except for cul-de-sacs, where fire hydrants are not needed, then a four
inch (4") line size will be allowed. Pipe sizes larger than six inches (6") may
be required where an extension to roads within a subdivision is anticipated,
thereby requiring service from a water line in the original subdivision. The
city engineer shall determine the size of lines greater than six inches (6") in
diameter. Where main lines larger than eight inches (8") are requested by the
city for future development, the additional cost shall be shared by the city.

list will be made up by the City Engineer indicating the items missed or
needing correction prior to acceptance of the improvements by the City
Engineer, and all required replacements or repairs shall be completed by the
subdivider, at the subdivider's expense, prior to acceptance by the City. (Ord.
8-28-98, 8-28-1998)
11-5-5: ACCEPTANCE:
The subdivision of lands shall not be accepted by the City without the City and
subdivider first receiving a statement signed by the City Engineer that the
improvements described in the construction drawings have been completed and
that they meet the minimum requirements of all the ordinances, resolutions,
rules and regulations of the City, that they comply with the recommendations of
the County Board of Health, the Planning Commission, the Fire Department, and
with the standards, rules, regulations and policies formulated by the City
Engineer and by the various City departments and approved by the City Council;
which standards, rules, regulations, and policies the City Council is hereby
empowered to approve and adopt by resolution or ordinance, and the same are
hereby incorporated in this Title by reference. Additionally, any subdivision
of lands shall not be accepted without the subdivider having first provided the
City with a one year written guarantee on all public improvements installed
therein. (Ord. 8-28-98, 8-28-1998)
11-5-6: DELAY OF IMPROVEMENTS; CONDITIONS:
As mentioned above, some improvements, such as sidewalks, may be delayed until
home or building construction is reasonably complete; provided, that the
subdivider furnishes to the City a security of performance, as set forth in
Section
11-5-7 of this Chapter. The amount of the said security shall be estimated by
the developer's engineer and approved by the City Engineer. Said security shall
be required for the purpose of assuring payment by the subdivider of all
expenses incurred for labor and materials used in construction of the required
improvements. In no event shall the City be deemed liable under this Section
for any claim asserted by a laborer or material person. (Ord. 8-28-98, 8-28-
1998)
11-5-7: SECURITY OF PERFORMANCE:
   A.   Option: At the subdivider's option, security of performance will not be
required if all public improvements are completed before recording and before a
maximum of three (3) lots are sold as according to State law.
   B.   Amount: The amount determined by the developer's engineer and approved
by the City Engineer shall be equal to at least one and one-half (11/2) times
the reasonable value of the improvements required herein.
   C.   Methods: The security of performance required by this Section may, at
the City's sole discretion, be furnished by any of the following methods:
      1.   By providing a performance, surety or cash bond in the amount
specified and conditioned upon payment by the subdivider of all expenses
incurred for labor and materials used in the construction of the required
improvements. This method of security shall be preferred by the City.
      2.   By depositing the specified amount of cash in a bank account to
which the City alone has access, but only in the event it becomes necessary, in
order to complete, repair or replace the improvements as set forth in this
Chapter.
      3.   By providing the City with an irrevocable letter of credit issued by
an acceptable financial institution naming the City as the sole beneficiary
with a maturity date of at least two (2) years and three (3) months from the
date of recording the final plat.
      4.   By depositing the specified amount of cash in a supervised bank
account to which the subdivider has access, with the approval and signature of
the City, which funds shall be used to pay for the improvements as construction
is completed and evidence lien waivers. In the event it becomes necessary for
the City to foreclose on the security of performance and move to complete,
repair or replace the improvements as set forth, then the City shall have
access to said supervised bank account for the purpose of completing,
repairing, or replacing improvements without the necessity of obtaining the
approval of the subdivider.
      5.   By giving other security in an amount approved by the City. This
method shall be accepted only at the option of the City. In addition, the City
must have official appraisals, a title report and review all encumbrances on
the assets being offered before this method may be accepted.
   D.   Hold Of Percentage: The security of performance required by this
Section is to assure the City that all improvements are constructed in
conformance with all relevant City ordinances, regulations and standards, and
to assure the City that all expenses incurred for labor and materials used in
the construction of the same are paid for by the subdivider. Further, the City
may hold ten percent (10%) of the security of performance provided by the
subdivider until one year following the final inspection by the City Engineer,
or for such other period of time less than one year as the City deems
necessary, to ensure compliance as set forth herein.
   E.   Incomplete Or Unacceptable Improvements:
      1.   In the event construction of the public improvements is not
completed, or is not completed in a satisfactory manner, within the negotiated
time period but not to exceed two (2) years from the date the final plat was
approved with all required signatures, the City may proceed to install the
improvements at the subdivider's expense by foreclosing on the subdivider's
security of performance held by the City. If said security is insufficient to
pay for said improvements which the City shall cause to be installed, then the
subdivider shall be liable for any deficiency and reasonable attorney fees
realized by the City.
      2.   In the event the public improvements fail to meet the standards as
set forth in the subdivider's written guarantee, the City shall so notify the
subdivider who shall be given a reasonable time to repair or otherwise correct
as requested or the City may proceed to repair or replace the unsatisfactory
improvements at the subdivider's expense by foreclosing on any security of
performance still held by the City; and, in addition, the City may avail itself
of any other remedy provided to it under the laws of the State and of the City.
(Ord. 8-28-98, 8-28-1998)

   A.   Intent; Requirement: The intent and requirement of this section is that
one water share per connection in all subdivisions will be transferred to the
City for future development and operation of the culinary or secondary water
systems. Water shares will be transferred to the City based on the number of
connections in the subdivision designated for building in each phase. Water
shares or stock will be transferred in no less than one share increments. The
City shall have the first right of refusal to purchase all water shares or
stock of the subdivider which has been used to irrigate real property in the
proposed subdivision and which is in excess of those water shares or stock
required herein. (Ord. 2011-2, 4-28-2011)
   B.   Not In Subdivision: For building lots not in a subdivision or for which
no prior transfer of water has been made and with no existing water
connections, shares of water will be transferred to the City at the time a
building permit is issued. If shares are unavailable, the City may charge an
index fee for a culinary water connection only. (Ord. 2018-3, 7-12-2018)
11-5-9: ADJACENT STREETS:
It shall become the responsibility of the developer to pay for all of the
necessary public improvements on one-half (1/2) of streets adjacent to the

development. All private lanes shall be negotiated with the City. Private lanes
shall be governed by a signed agreement of the homeowners residing on the
private lane, which agreement the City shall have power to enforce. The City,
however, shall have no responsibility or liability in the maintenance, snow
removal or garbage pick up on lanes. Water meters and barrels shall be placed
on City right-of-way, such that waterworks maintenance shall not extend beyond
public right-of-way in order to accommodate all properties equitably, and to
serve and maintain utilities on all properties, lanes shall not be obstructed.
Sidewalks, curbs and gutters and roads shall conform to the standards set in
this title. Road improvements shall also conform to the following:
      1.   For one or two (2) houses, the right-of-way shall be twenty feet
(20') in width with asphalt pavement of twelve feet (12') in width minimum. No
sidewalk or curb and gutter shall be required.

   C.   Homeowners' Agreement: The approved homeowners' agreement shall be
placed on the lots affected at the time of recording. In addition, a recorded
restriction will be placed on all lots on the private lane stating that all of
the above mentioned minimum improvements shall be complete before the City will
approve the issuance of a building permit by the building inspector, for
subdivided lots on the private lane. (Ord. 2010-1, 1-28-2010)
11-5-11: EXTENSION OF PUBLIC WORKS FACILITIES:
The extension of any city public works facilities, including, but not limited
to, roads, bridges, storm drains, water mains, sewer lines, and secondary water
systems, shall be installed by the developer of any subdivision. There shall be
no consideration or return to the developer within this area. (Ord. 8-28-98, 8-
28-1998)
11-5-12: UTILITIES:
All utilities, privately or publicly owned, shall be placed underground. This
will include, but shall not be limited to, telephone, gas, electric power,
water, sewer, etc. These underground utilities shall be installed after cutting
the road to rough grade and before the surfacing of the streets and
installation of road base, curb and gutter, sidewalks, etc. (Ord. 8-28-98, 8-
28-1998)
11-5-13: CITY WATER AND SEWER SYSTEMS:
All subdivisions located within the corporate boundaries of the city shall be
required to connect to the water and sewer systems of the city, except as
provided by a resolution to the contrary. (Ord. 8-28-98, 8-28-1998)
11-5-14: SHARING DEVELOPMENT COSTS:
Public works improvements should be paid for by developers and landowners that
will benefit by their use. An agreement for sharing development costs by all
landowners that may use the facilities should be submitted by the developer
initially responsible for the facilities, along with the final plat. If such an
agreement is not negotiated at the time of permitting the original subdivision,
the developer who installs the facilities is entitled to future compensation as
follows:
   A.   Statement Of Costs: The original developer must file a letter with the
city engineer that includes the acquisition cost of land used by the public
works facilities, costs for engineering the facilities and costs for
constructing the facilities, i.e., water and sewer lines, roads, curbs and
gutter, and sidewalks.
   B.   Future Development; Pro Rata Share: Future planned developments that
would use the public improvements would not be approved by the city until the
new developer agrees in writing to adequately compensate the original developer
or legal agent for a pro rata share of the costs of the facilities.
Determination of pro rata costs may be based on the following:
      1.   Length of frontage, for example, if two (2) landowners shared the
same length along both sides of a street, the cost would be split equally.
      2.   Number of lots per subdivision, for example, costs for sewer or
water lines may be based on the number of hookups to both.
   C.   Reimbursement To Original Developer: Reimbursement to the original
developer would be one hundred percent (100%) of the pro rata share during the
first five (5) years following construction of the improvements, costs would be
depreciated twenty percent (20%) per year thereafter, and no pro rata share
would be due after ten (10) years following initial construction, unless a
specific agreement was developed and agreed to that extended this time frame.
(Ord. 8-28-98, 8-28-1998)
11-5-15: ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS:
   A.   Appeals: All appeals shall be as are governed by state law.
   B.   Written Agreements: When and as written agreements are deemed to be
necessary for the protection and understanding of all parties concerned, they
shall be entered into by all parties concerned, i.e., to cover areas of concern
not specifically addressed by this title or other requirements of the city, and
shall be completed before the mayor places signature on the final plat.
   C.   Guidelines And Checklists: The city is hereby authorized and empowered
to promulgate by way of resolution certain guidelines and/or checklists
relative to this title. These materials shall be provided to any interested
person upon request and upon payment of a fee if required by the city. These
materials shall be for instructional purposes only and represent an attempt to
aid those seeking to comply with this title. In the event any conflict arises
between such guidelines and this title or other regulations, resolutions or
policies of the city, then said ordinances, resolutions, regulations, or
policies shall be deemed controlling and all questions shall be resolved in
their favor.
   D.   Exceptions To Title: Where unusual topographic or other exceptional
conditions exist, the city council may vary the requirements of this title
after receiving the recommendations of the planning commission and/or the city
engineer; provided, that such variations will not substantially impair the
intent of this title. (Ord. 8-28-98, 8-28-1998)
